It’s provably fair which means it works according to publicly established rules. The code and results are transparent for anyone to audit. Buy a ticket for 100 tWGR and score a chance to win 80% of the pot. The pot grows with every ticket bought.  Be the House Of course, it wouldn’t be Wagerr if there weren’t a chance to be the House! Two features make Wagerr Lotto unique.  18% burn The blockchain burns 18% of the tickets. Just think about what that does to the coin supply. The lottery places continuous downward pressure on the total supply. Another great reason to hold WGR.  2% to Masternodes Masternodes earn 2% of the pot. As if it weren’t enough to collect a percentage of sports betting fees, the lottery adds more ways to win for operating a Masternode.  More events! More markets!    The feeds have been redesigned to allow for more events and markets to be posted. We’ve already seen that the amount of $WGR bet rises proportionally to the number of events and markets available.  Feel the burn The more betting action, the more fees. The more fees, the more WGR burned — and — the more rewards for Masternodes.   Performance Upgrades  The new Wagerr has a ton of upgrades. You’ll notice immediate improvements:  Hundreds of simultaneous events Fast loading app User-friendly display  You can now quickly choose from loads of games and easily understand your potential winnings.  Some of the upgrades won’t be obvious to the casual user. The under-the-hood changes made now will make a big difference to Wagerr in the future:  Faster odds updating will keep Wagerr competitive with prevailing markets. 70% less data stored. Faster sync, smaller footprint. Lays the technical foundation for Head-to-Head Betting and feature-complete Oracles.  Participate in the Wagerr 3.0 Testnet here : https://t.me/Wagerrpublictest",False

David Mah is no CEO (not even his proper name). Probably close to $40m is unaccounted for. As WGR raised $10m at ICO the logic is it is only owed that $10m is spent, even though the funding grew to a value of $50m (bitcoin cash sold near high etc). This funds Ionomy (much more vibrantly than wgr) among others. Anyone who didn't work for Ionomy left the company. WGR funds used to build centralised sports betting websites of which Adam Matlack is personal stakeholder. Team buy orders hold the price on the markets and have done since everyone went dark after ICO in 2017. Majority of MNs are run by team etc. Ionomy lead dev Mitchell is guy trying to release the new wallet since dev team quit. Ionomy general manager Richard was doing results for WGR during QT betting ....  It's all a big fucking joke. David will do really well to stay out of jail.

The community. Without a doubt: the fact that this application works the way we intended and the network works so well that it sustains a dedicated user community is a great accomplishment. It’s a testament to a sound idea and decent implementation.  We’ve had sort of a “build it and they will come” approach — and the users are here! Sports bettors are using Wagerr. It’s not just the people looking for the price of the WGR coin to “10x” — though, of course, there are some of those folks in any community.  For the most part, these are people who want Wagerr to work. They are excited about its potential and want to be a part of it. Sure, some people are impatient, garrulous, and critical. They’re also experienced and knowledgeable gamers, and they keep us on our toes. Fundamentally, they are partners in a radically disruptive project.  They’re bettors, advocates, developers, ambassadors, and partners. They’re the people who will help reach other established communities and help Wagerr expand. It’s not an us vs. them relationship with the community because they understand that this project is different. It’s not a traditional company or a couple of individuals. Wagerr is not “the man.” It’s way bigger than us. I mean it’s almost spiritual, which I realize is a funny thing to say about a gaming community. But we’re loaded with true believers who see something bigger than corporate profits or even personal gain. There’s a real sense of membership.

You should really stick to just positively promoting EDG in their thread, instead of these often-vulgar rants here in ours.  Not sure why the mods allow it to continue for so long when you've made so many false accusations and just general FUD here in the not-so-distant past.

We won't be able to offer a complete schedule of events during these earliest weeks/months with just the QT wallet, so mainly just primetime games and other major events for now.  The upcoming HTML5 wallet will be the true Wagerr experience, likely eclipsing the QT wallet in every conceivable way.  Also there will be some variance with minting/burning for on-chain bets, due to imbalances in total bets for each side(s).  This means that in the short-term, there could be more or less inflation/deflation.  A good example of this was the Mayweather promo bet from last year, where an imbalance led to a much larger amount being burned than expected.

To allow this transition to occur we have outlined a specific plan as follows:  1.) 10th September 10:00 UTC - The Wagerr Development Team will place the Wagerr mainnet network in maintenance mode, this will disable all zWGR minting and spending temporarily. If you need to spend any zWGR, please do so before this time. Your zWGR balance will be 100% safe. Maintenance mode is planned to last two weeks, but may need to be extended. Communication will come from the team when new wallets are available and maintenance mode is disabled.  2.) Ensure you have a recent backup of your wallet.dat, as zWGR is stored in your wallet.dat and not your private keys. If you are unfamiliar with the process, please refer to our guide at https://wagerr.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001309872-How-to-backup-and-restore-Wagerr-dat-and-private-keys#. zWGR v2 will bring new features and security updates to zWGR! Most notably, you will now be able to stake zWGR in your QT wallet. zWGR v2 also allows deterministic seed keys to be generated for your zerocoin. You will soon be able to backup zWGR outside of the wallet.dat.  More info to come in the following weeks",False

So if you or anyone currently has zWGR, it's recommended to convert it back to normal WGR if you think you will need to use it within the next few weeks or so.  However if you aren't going to need it right away, it's still safe to leave it as zWGR so no worries on that.  With that said, there may be some short delays regarding deposit/withdraw on exchanges as they upgrade to keep pace with our new developments so we should try to be understanding and patient with them.

There is going to be a lot of negativity in this post which will the usual fanboys undoubtedly classify as 'FUD', which it isn't, these are all FACTS.  The Wagerr Development team keeps missing deadline by deadline, Atumn 2k17? Missed. Mid jan 2k18? Missed. Betting on the Worldcup? Missed. Everytime they are setting a deadline where they want to achieve something and they miss it, not by a bit, but they miss it BIG. People criticising the lack of progress, transparancy or honesty get instantly banned from their Discord or Telegram group.  There was said there would be betting on the worldcup, well 1 day before the WC started there was a 'private' test betting launched. Just 50 Wagerr holders where allowed to bet with fake tokens. Seems like a good idea, you know, testing before rolling anything out is a good idea, but one of my close friends who is a big wagerr holder and a private tester says this testing is one big chaos internally and there is nothing done with the comments of the testers. This would not surprise me as their advisors are mature people calling themself 'Herb Mentalist' and talk about smoking weed all the time. Are you a grown up guy working at a possible million dollars company or a you a 15 year old boy flipping burgers? His behavior is not telling me.  Anyway, this private testing was supposed to take 72 hours at maximum, this is two weeks ago now. A couple of days ago they were rolling out 'public testing', nothing has been happening since then.  Oh, their fancy logo? It is a cheap ass copy from an other company logo, check: https://www.weswap.com/en/  The Wagerr team is claiming the weswap logo is dead, someone should contact this company to find out. You know, creating a professional unique logo costs about 150 dollars, but still they copied an excisting one?

The Wagerr Team has been extremely busy over the last few months, and is proud to announce that they are now currently testing both head-to-head betting and on-chain betting on the Wagerr Privatenet, in preparation for the 2018 World Cup!   Wagerr holders can expect to either bet in pairs against each other through matched head to head bets, or directly on the blockchain, which will mediate the collective payout liability. The team’s current sentiment is that on-chain betting is the most feasible starting point for Wagerr betting during the 2018 World Cup.   The Wagerr Team has been working to develop Oracle Masternodes that can contribute to resulting for the World Cup. The Oracle Masternodes function as the central checkpoint to achieve super-consensus on event results, thus triggering proper payouts. The team believes that the best way to deploy the Wagerr betting layer is in a modular fashion. As a result, the first Oracle Masternodes for the World Cup will be centralized, and run by the team.   The scheduled portion of fees generated from Wagerr Network betting, and earned by the centralized Oracles, will initially be distributed to eligible (active) masternodes, rewarding those who have supported the network in its early stage.   It's also worth noting at this point that CEO David Mah has been in negotiations to license Wagerr (the company) as a regulated gaming business. It is a lengthy process, but one that Wagerr is proud to embark on. This move intelligently positions Wagerr to raise its profile within the current online gaming industry while rolling out a fully decentralized system. This will not negatively impact the ability of any user, in any location, to interact with the blockchain. The next few months will be a very exciting time for the Wagerr Community! The weather is heating up, and so is the Wagerr Network! The team has been working very hard on development, exchange negotiations are ongoing, the team has entered discussions regarding future partnerships that could be beneficial for both Wagerr users & the Wagerr Network as a whole, and the team has been solidifying their marketing plans in anticipation of the World Cup and the start of betting on the Wagerr Blockchain! Stay tuned to Wagerr.com & Wagerr's numerous social media channels for many more exciting announcements over the next few months.   Betting belongs on the Blockchain... And that’s exactly what the team intends to make possible for the 2018 World Cup!   --- The Wagerr Team    MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNN",False

I try to make my rounds, and check in with all of our social media groups/sub-groups in my free time, usually at the end of my work day. As far as updates, sometime it's literally as simple as there's nothing that groundbreaking to announce. We're working hard at getting the betting platform out, that IS our MAIN PRIORITY. PERIOD. We're still in negotiations with exchanges, that's been taking up quite a bit of time. And we've also been working on some partnerships to benefit our investors. The progress report for the last month, however, will be coming out in the next few days. I wanted to include a little more substance, so I reached out to our System Architect to get a few Dev Team updates for everyone, and that delayed things a few days. I have seen some FUD from people over the past month or so, and I don't get it. Yeah, updates have slowed down a little bit. But, things behind the scenes have been going very well. Everyone is working very hard. Exchange listings are starting to roll in. H2H launch is getting near. We're starting to get recognized by our peers.

If you want daily updates, sell your coins ASAP. We're not about fluff & fake hype like other coins. Our goal is a stable, secure, easy to use Betting Network. Period. We've said numerous times that marketing & advertising without a working project, is a complete waste of money since our goal is user adoption/retention. There's been no illusion that this was a long term investment from day 1. When H2H launches, that's when our next Marketing Phase begins. Until then, we post news when there's news. If it's quiet, everyone is working hard at development or whatever their job is. I run a tight ship, I'm not a fun to guy work for. I'm fair, I'm respectful, I pay my guys well, but I have no problem calling people out for not doing their job. My guys will tell you straight up, that I'm far from a ""Yes Man.""  When addressing the issue of exchanges - ""David told people because he was excited about it. David didn't take into account the new market conditions when it comes to listings. Things have majorly changed. The ICO Market is oversaturated, and has been for months. There's 30/40 projects coming out daily. That's 30/40 projects per day that are looking for a home. That's 10x more applications than exchanges are used to, and they have to go through each one by one. That means more time to go through applications, and more time to list each project. Quite a few exchanges have decided to only list ERC-20 coins for now, in order to get them out of the way. We're also not in the game of wasting money. So, we're not going to give a shit exchange $500,000 just to get listed SOMEWHERE. If it's worth the fee, we'll pay for it. If not, we move forward. Like I said, there's plenty of exchanges upcoming, and we're still in negotiations.""  Giving some insight into the expansion of the team in recent months, along with other related info - ""To answer how many employees Wagerr has, we have grown to 20+. We have two full-time dev teams, one part-time dev team, and a full executive branch. Both dev teams' employees work/live in the same city as each other. One dev team is in the EU, the other is in North America.""  To those who have been saying 'just a pivx clone' or those who are simply a bit worried about low activity on github currently - ""As far as GitHub is concerned, anything that would give a competitor any type of advantage, is currently hidden. That means the betting engine, the multi-layer transaction system, etc... It is closed source till release, and then it will be open source, just like the wallet.  There's a lot of eyes on this project. We are definitely making waves and getting noticed in the sports betting industry. Whether you guys realize that now or not, that should become more apparent to everyone next week.""  And finally a fun and/or interesting fact - ""We already have some current & retired MMA fighters who have invested in Wagerr right now.""   I really hope this clears up some of the common misconceptions and can allow for more constructive discussions to take place.  Even though I may not always post often, I do keep up with reading this thread along with many other platforms that wgr users prefer.",False

Their ICO raised approx 6.5 million dollars in BTC when BTC was hovering around 2k per coin. All that has been accomplished since the ICO,  is to clone PIVX and produce a wallet similar to several wallet that i see on graviex. They also managed to get into exchanges that ton of coins with zero funding have easily gotten into.   So, i find it bewildering, when i see ppl talk about it been undervalued.

Literally every coin that is not listed on a big exchange states that they are awaiting listing. the valuable info will be the actual listing.   If most of you sheep spent a little more time hitting up the admin on discord and twitter and asking them to stop staking the swap wallet. Maybe, you will have more individuals swapping their coins to earn stakes. As it currently stands, if you swap your coin and don't have enough for a masternode, you will probably get a stake of 0.9 coin every five weeks if you lucky. That's what am getting with 18k coins. To make matters worse, you can't even sell the coin after you swap cos their is no exchange for the swapped coin. So, am not earning any stake, and am currently stuck with the coins.  So for that ridiculous amount of money they raised from the ICO, not counting the percentage of token they kept for themselves, all they have accomplished so far, is fork PIVX and set up the swap wallet top stake and earn all the rewards under the guise of protecting the network.

C'mon guys, let's get this right.  Also, the whole ""NOT Recommended"" option #3 needs to be explained. Its confusing and seems like a fine way to do it (the only way) when you store your WGR on Waves/DEX, which is how most people do it I imagine.  Just sent a few coins to test and if the wallet ever finishes syncing, I hope to see them there and send the rest.

Quote from: Islapdonkey on February 17, 2018, 04:18:28 PM i apologize but i haven't visited the WGR forum in several months, so am out of loop. I still have my coin on their platform from ICO,i never transferred it. anyway, wondering what WGR is swapping to and will mine automatically be swapped since it's still on their platform. Also can someone plz link me the process on how to set up their masternode or is it similar to others where you have to get a vps and etc. Also plz what is the estimated roi for the masternode. I apologize for the several question, it just feel dauting having to peruse thru several page to find those info.  Not sure about automatic swapping, could be. Similar process, any Dash masternode guide should be good. But you know, there is no hurry. Block rewards only after 10k block (now at 2740), guides for all (swap & mn setup) should be available in 1-2 days. There are a couple of spreadsheets available for that (ROI) - here and here  Good to know:  Annual Coin Supply: +1% Block Time: 60 seconds Total Block Reward: 3.8 WGR Masternode Share: 2.85 WGR Staking Wallet Share: .95 WGR Oracle Share: 2.85 WGR (MN share) + betting fees  (please give +merit if this post is useful to you)",False

Hello Wagerr Community,  Wagerr Mainnet is live!  The Wagerr team wants everyone to have a fair chance to earn block rewards, and have therefore established a period of approximately five to seven days of zero rewards.  That means everyone can download or build the Wagerr wallet in their own good time. Non-zero rewards begin at the 10,000th block, which is expected to arrive roughly between Wednesday and Friday, February 21st-23rd.  Both Daemon and Qt wallets are available for Linux, MacOS Sierra (10.12), and Windows. The team is working on a build that will work with High Sierra (10.13). NOTE: For the first week (up to 10,000 blocks), block rewards are zero. This provides ample opportunity to set up your wallet or masternode.  The team aims to provide guidance and support as it rolls out the new wallet in a measured manner. Downloading and configuring the wallet is the first step.  Download Now https://github.com/wagerr/wagerr/releases/tag/v1.4.33.0  Over the next days, Wagerr will publish guides to swap coins and set up wallets. One guide explains how to swap Wagerr-over-Waves tokens to your Wagerr Mainnet address. The second explains how to send coins from your wagerr.com crowdsale account to your Mainnet address (for those who never moved coins from the wagerr.com website).  Mainnet is a great start to this year. The team is firing on all cylinders and is eager to show you what else they’ve been working on.  The Wagerr Team",False

Featuring PIVX’s Zerocoin (zPIV) privacy technology, this release is a crucial first step in our journey to provide the world with reliable and secure, decentralized betting.  Our progress has been steady and encouraging:  Mainnet genesis block created. All proof-of-work blocks mined. Masternode-sync issue resolved. Developers are monitoring performance, stability, and the transition to pure proof-of-stake. Throughout this period, a separate developer team has continued working on the betting layer of the network.  The revised target for universal Mainnet access is now Friday, February 16th. At that point, Wagerr tokens can be swapped or withdrawn to the Mainnet. Any rewards collected during the Proof-of-Stake phase prior to public access will be publicly destroyed.  Withdrawals from wagerr.com Wagerr initially suspended withdrawals from wagerr.com while we patched against potential Spectre/Meltdown and other security threats. At the time, we believed that Mainnet would be available imminently, so we intended to resume withdrawals only upon release.  Consequently, Wagerr is re-opening withdrawals to Waves beginning February 1st, for the two weeks leading up to February 16th. Anyone who wishes is free to withdraw their Wagerr-over-Waves tokens and trade on the Waves decentralized exchange (DEX).   Fair distribution Because we also want token holders to have equal access to relevant information about internal development, Wagerr pledges not to release Mainnet wallets before February 16th even if the technology is ready.    Pony up or pay up We're so confident, that for every day that Mainnet is not publicly available beyond February 16th, Wagerr will publicly destroy 5000 tokens from the developer allocation.  Wagerr’s decentralized sports betting solution is unmatched. It is on course to disrupt a trillion-dollar industry. Secure, private, anonymous, multilayered transactions combine with a carefully structured system of economic rewards to make Wagerr the best bet in the business.",False

Even though Wagerr is an open source project and no one can assist or help build it in the future, the launch team is committed to lock up your coins and it's our long term vision that we won't deliver on launch commitments.  Wagerr does this all with a top secret dev team while avoiding criticism by deleting post and banning critical investors from social media.  ● SOON -Testnet released. The Wagerr testnet deploys, allowing players to preview Head to Head bet matching and general wallet functions. Oracle Masternode owners can become familiar with their operation and test different configurations for best results.  ● SOON -Head to Head Betting is deployed and the chain goes live. The blockchain mediates bets between two players taking opposite sides on upcoming sporting events. The fee for an executed contract is 2% of the payout. 1% goes to the processing Oracle and 1% gets burned.  ● SOON -Event Chat Add-on. Every event will have its own chat room that will allow those who are betting on the event to communicate with one another. Users can get to know who they are betting against and talk about the event live while it happens.  ● SOON -Multi User Betting. To make it easier to find and fulfill more bets on low volume events, the system allows multiple players to be paired against a single bettor. This ensures that large bets do not require an exact match to forge a contract. The fee for this transaction is 4 percent. 2% of the fee goes to the Oracle processing the transaction and 2% gets burned.  ● SOON -Challenge/ Rematch Add-on. The Challenge and Rematch system allows the player to message previous betting partners and issue challenges or ask for rematches. This expands on the concept of an address book by allowing users to see, track, and rematch past players and easily invite friends to use Wagerr to bet against one another.  ● SOON -Peerless Direct Chain Betting. Wagerr gives the player the option to forgo looking for a match and bet directly against the chain, which takes the other side of 27 the bet automatically. The fee for this transaction is 6 percent. 3% of the fee goes to the Oracle that processes the request and 3% is automatically burned.  ● SOON -Dynamic Odds Balancing. For Direct on Chain betting, Wagerr incentivizes betting on the other side when one side gets overweighted. This feature allows the Wagerr chain to ensure that it exposes the network to the smallest amount of payout liability.  Yours faithfully,",False

In the process of incorporating these features, the developers encountered two unforeseen issues: a synchronization issue and an issue with generating blocks. The team is working around the clock to resolve these.  Cryptocurrency developments storm in at a dizzying pace. Case in point: the unprecedented advances in blockchain privacy technology known as Zerocoin Protocol (or zPIV) recently implemented by the PIVX team. The Wagerr Team has always intended to include enhanced privacy features down the road, but since a high degree of privacy is important to the customer base and the Wagerr vision, I insisted on merging this powerful technology into the Wagerr code base now. In addition to the centrality of privacy, introducing it later would necessitate a disruptive hard fork and create a trackable record that may not be in all users’ interests. The enhanced wallet will be worth the wait.  When the developer team has resolved these outstanding issues, the wallet and source code will be published. I can hardly wait to share it with you. Wagerr has exciting times ahead. It will really be something when the Wagerr blockchain disrupts the sports betting industry forever. We won’t be stopped.  Yours faithfully,  David Mah CEO, Wagerr",False

They mislead the community and lied again about the release day of the platform. I think people forgot they had no idea how to build a token when they did the ICO. After the ICO they went to the Waves platform chat and asked how to create a Waves token. Anyone can create a Waves token you can do it on your cellphone and it takes 30 seconds. They had no idea how to create a ERC20 token or even knew what one was. Anyone who believes these scammers will create a solid blockchain and is capable of making a token swap needs to get there heads examined! This David Ma is an excellent bullshit artist.  What pisses me off anyone can hire a experienced blockchain developer $100,000 or less to create there own coin and blockchain. I assume these guys haven't done shit since theirs lack of any shred of evidence they wrote 1 line of code. The team is likely located in the US which is highly illegal to run a gambling platform regardless if it's decentralized or not.

From what I was told, there's only one way to buy WGR tokens, and that's through the waves exchange.  I'm sure there will be more exchanges after the launch on 15th.  I bought some more the other day and it was easy:  Step 1: Go to waveswallet.io and register an exchange account. Step 2: Ask someone in this thread (or me) to tip you a small amount of Waves on the exchange (you'll need it, since the exchange has you pay for your buy/sell fees with Waves, even though you need Waves to buy Waves; it's sorta stupid, just go with it lol).  All you need is a tiny amount of waves.  Even 0.01 Waves would be enough. Step 3: Go to the wallet section of the exchange, and click the Deposit button for BTC.  The exchange will not let you deposit less than 0.01 BTC (also stupid, I know, especially with how high BTC is right now). Step 4: Once your BTC shows up in your account, head to the ""market"" section or whatever, type ""wagerr"" in the search bar, click the only one that shows up, and buy whatever amount you'd like.  And you're done! (You won't be able to transfer them to a WGR wallet until main-net launches, where you will convert these WGR tokens to actually WGR)   I'll be honest with you, I don't remember how much masternodes were, I thought they were 20k WGR, but it's been a while since I've seen anyone mention it so I'm not sure.  I also don't know the specifics on how they work.  Sorry, I tried to help as much as I could. xD",False

Also in my opinion, the governance system of Dash is certainly admirable and should most likely work well for sports betting too.  I've mentioned this phrase before I think, but it deserves repeating - masternodes (and therefore community consensus) will have a lot of power in the Wagerr network.  It may just sound like some marketing-speak catchphrase, but we are really trying to disrupt an industry dominated by centralized sportsbooks by shifting as much of the control back to the betting community as possible.  The Dash model is extremely fair, everyone has to put up the same amount per masternode...no more, no less.

Although I do still have some questions on the technical side, I'll drop those on Discord.  However, the other point I'd like to address here is the scheduled 15 January release for test- & mainnet. What I simply do not understand is the lack of 'marketing' surrounding Wagerr. Again, I'm planning on setting up a masternode so I have invested. But at the moment it's a coin toss for me. There's simply not a lot of information out there which supports any ongoing development efforts. Comments on this forum stating that some implementation details are uncertain at the moment do not really help either. With a planned deployment in <1month, those details should be clear. Testing is all that should remain, otherwise I sense an upcoming delay for the golive.  Here are some things I would expect from a team with a deadline right around the corner;  1) Proper introduction of the new developers that were hired  2) Weekly updates (youtube/blog/whatever) which may include; (this is by far the most important of the 4 points I mention here)    - developer interviews on their current focus and progress.    - discussion on the past and future of WGR    - comparison of WGR to other 'coins'    - technical details regarding the implementation of the new blockchain/DASH fork    - community input and discussion  3) API documentation (at least part of it)  4) Runbooks for setting up masternodes (at least a draft)  All of the above can give people a little bit more assurance than there is right now. Please do not see this as an attack on the WGR team. Consider this to be constructive feedback on the marketing side of things which will hopefully improve in the near future. Thank you!",False

Yes you both can leave all coins on Wagerr website if you like. Advantage over Waves is the 2FA authentication for logging in. On the other hand, Waves is secure as well if you just write down the seed (string of words to open your wallet) on several pieces of paper, logout from your account, remove the login from the Waves wallet.

It was a high risk investment for me at the beginning, not knowning what it would turn out to be. I do however see great potential. For me this is one the first true useful implementations of the blockchain.  Over the past few days I have taken the time to have a thorough look at the whitepaper. My prime interest is to see what it takes to setup a functioning masternode. I'm not talking about the 25k WGR investment, that's a given. This is about the technology requirements behind the masternode. It's good to see that others (@Spartaneous) are also asking technical questions. From what I read, Wagerr is relying heavily on the implementations of masternodes to become a success.  Another thing I'm interested in is the progress by the development team and the supposed 15jan mainnet release. But I will dedicate a seperate post on that topic.  So, I have a couple of technical/implementation questions;  1) @Spartaneous started of with a good one;   Answered by @lotuspod with;  It's still a bit early for some specifics, ... these sources most likely will be randomly assigned to each MN.  One of the risks with WGR is that if someone has sufficient funds, they could get the 75% majority and decide the outcome for each game on the WGR network. In the whitepaper this is downplayed by the fact that making abuse of such a majority would probably have negative effects for the investor that holds 75% or more masternodes. Nonetheless, this is a potential risk. With the answer provided by @lotuspod however, this potential attack vector suddenly becomes a lot bigger. Although from a technical standpoint I do understand that you may not need or want to have all results polled against every masternode, not doing so would inherintely increase the risk that someone has a 75% majority on a given result. I wonder what the thoughts of the Wagerr team are on this.  2) I'm planning on writing a NodeJS scraper, or possibly implementing something using https://xible.io. So, to implement this, some kind of API docs must be available which explains the interface to the masternode. This question will also be part of my next post on that 15jan release; but how can those docs not already be available if the release is so close?  3) Will every masternode be expected to return results on every league as part of WGR right now? That's a fairly long list already and from a developer standpoint it would be nice to be able to opt-in or opt-out for some leagues. Especially in the beginning, where a developer will probably implement a scraper league-by-league or site-by-site (where a single website may hold multiple leagues). But, although this would be nice from a developer point-of-view, the earlier mentioned majority risk becomes an issue yet again...  4) What will the interface look like for manual input into the masternode? Any screenshots of current beta's? (again part of my next post on development progress)  5) Since I'm afraid that no docs will be available until the 15th, or perhaps even after that, we cannot expect that masternode developers have their end of the spectrum ready to go. Manual input probably won't be an option as no one will have someone 24/7 behind a desk and results are expected to roll in within the hour after an event. So will masternodes also be dropped in the early beginnings of the Wagerr (test?)net if they do not comply to the rules as they are currently set?  That's it for now. Thanks!",False

Besides that, I have a lot of trust and respect for the newly established Wagerr community as a whole.  During the few rough months awhile back, a lot of the weak hands sold off and we were left with a solid core of very supportive members and many of which aren't very easily swayed by financial gain alone.  Some of us have even been victims of all sorts of pretty shady practices by some of the centralized gambling networks, personally this has been my main motivation for wanting this project to succeed.  I also think I wasn't clear enough on how I explained it in the previous post, and it may have caused you to misunderstand.  My main point wasn't that a subset of the masternodes would be randomly polled for results(I don't have details on that part yet but I made a note to try to get you all some), I meant that the actual results sources could be randomly assigned to masternodes so that everyone isn't using the same source or few sources...such that certain sources aren't too unfairly weighted.  This is much more likely to pose a realistic security issue with the results, rather than someone buying out 75% of the masternodes.  But even this isn't much of an issue, since if too many of the major results sources are incorrect a meaningful % of the time...then the sportsbetting industry as a whole would be having some serious issues    2)  The reason that docs like you're referring to aren't out yet is that h2h and other types of betting won't be included in the initial mainnet release on Jan 15th.  Instead, the masternodes will get at least half of the staking rewards and at least half of the transactions fees until mainnet h2h betting is implemented.  We will have a few months to get familiar with the testnet first, and bring h2h over to mainnet when we all are feeling comfortable with it. I do agree with you that getting some of these related docs out as early as possible will be very helpful to the community and we'll try to get you the relevant info as soon as it becomes available to us.  3)  I don't think you'll need to post every single league worldwide, there will likely be some sort of minimum requirements though to make sure each masternode contributes its fair share of the work.  Sorry for having to give the same response so many times, but it's yet another set of details that I'm going to make sure to annoy the devs about for you guys and try to get back to you ASAP.  4)  I really (really!) tried on this one to get some screenshots in the most recent email/news update, but I can't talk about these things specifically just yet  However I can say to keep an eye on this thread and our Discord/Telegram servers as we inch our way closer to mainnet release.  5)  I wouldn't rule anything out quite yet, let me see what I can do  *Remember none of this is exactly set in stone yet, certainly not until I get some confirmations on those specific details that I'm unsure on and also hopefully get some documents and/or screenshots for you all within a reasonable time.  **The best place by far for you and others who are interested in running masternodes is the #masternodes-oracles channel on the Wagerr Discord server, if you aren't already there.  Be sure to check the pinned messages in that channel for lots of interesting tidbits of info you may not have caught.  ",False

I could be wrong on some of these details though, or things could always get adjusted between now and then.  I made a note of it though, and will post further info on it in this thread as soon as I can.  2)  We may need those extra stats eventually, especially once there is a reasonable amount of demand for prop bets and such.  If/when we do, we'll try to make sure there is some time for people to prepare.  There will be quite a bit of time between network release and the release of h2h betting, and then further time before expanding to other types of betting which should give us all some much-needed time to get familiar with everything.  Instead of rushing to release a little bit of everything at once, the team have it broken down into logical sections so hopefully it will be a bit easier to understand and stay on the same page as a group.  3)  Yes, at first linux I'm fairly sure anyway.  But you know how these decentralized projects can be, anyone can contribute a solution to an issue affecting some/all of the community.  So I wouldn't be surprised to see future solutions that gradually make it easier and easier to run a MN, until it becomes a matter of a few simple clicks eventually.  4)  The fork thing has been joked about plenty in Discord, and back in the old Slack days.  I think we're still far too small for a fork to get any serious traction though.  Also David and the rest of the team have been good about listening to the community, for the serious stuff anyway.  I think they'll get things done right the first time and we won't have to worry about it.  All of the planning that has went into this has been done in a very forward-thinking manner and incentives have been provisioned for all of the important aspects of the project...everything from masternodes/staking/security, to affiliates/loyalty, to future development/scaling and expansion.",False

Sparta  It's still a bit early for some specifics, but the lines/results will be pulled from across many different main sources and these sources most likely will be randomly assigned to each MN.  Of course there could be the possibility for those running MNs to add in additional (optional) sources of their own.  I don't think any preference could really be fairly given to often subjective things like reputation within a certain community - instead it will be things like maintaining high uptime, accurate results, and such.  Also they recommend running masternodes from a VPS so I don't think exceptions could be made for issues that arise from trying to run them from a home network.    With that said though, having more highly technical (and helpful!) users to run these MNs is very welcome.  If there are some significant contributions made to the project in the future, I'm sure they would be fairly rewarded  Currently there's nothing preventing a person from potentially running 2 or 100 MN, except for accumulating that much wgr and the 2k total MN cap of course.  Even the cap could be removed though, if the masternodes reach consensus on it or a wide range of other things.  The fees will likely burn a lot of wgr yes, but some will be minted from staking so eventually a balance point will be reached.  Quote from: 2bfree on December 07, 2017, 03:54:41 AM I still have my wager in the wager website where i bought it at ICO. Should I move it to waves wallet and when is it going to some other exchange? What's the plan here?  You can wait until the network is released if you'd rather leave it on the site for now.  If you do move it to a Waves account, remember to backup your seed and be sure to practice proper security.  There will be a gateway for WGR on Waves once mainnet is ready.    I wouldn't expect any other exchanges until sometime after the main token is available, which will hopefully avoid complicating the swaps even further.  Not worrying about getting the temporary token on the larger centralized exchanges also lets the team better focus their resources on trying to do other things like direct fiat/wgr gateways, and of course trying to get the main wgr tokens on more exchanges when the time comes.",False

I have now figured out how to get results off webpages without VPS+API. I am doing this, because it really doesn't seem economical to pay for API+VPS during the early stages of Wagerr development. If the profitability gets to a reasonably high level and my way is not as reliable, then I will happily shift over to the recommended options. The reason is also the advantage of an alternative source. I think that a very obvious thing that may happen is that people will run for the cheapest APIs and cause a low variation of sources.  Its not the ""reputation within a certain community"" that I had in mind, sorry for confusing you. I meant exactly the reputation from previously submitting accurate results on time, etc.  Now, I still have some questions:  1) What exactly does the 25000WGR collateral mean? Is there a way of losing it or do you just HODL it for the 30 days each time and return it afterwards? 2) Are we only interested in scores and winners? I.e. no pass accuracy, fouls, etc. Or is this up for discussion? 3) Do you know if the MN will only be operable from Linux? 4) Is there a chance that the voting system will cause some form of ""forking"" in Wagerr?  I am sure many of these things will shake into place during testnet. I am just hoping to get stuff ready early so that I would only need to make minor tweaks in the end.  Thanks!",False

It seems to me that the most valuable part of this project is its decentralization and the removal of power from bookmakers and governments, bringing freedom for anybody who wants to bet anywhere in the world.  I therefore do not believe it is of great importance to compete with other bookmakers on odds/lines/prices. Wagerr could succeed with a larger spread than the major bookmakers and in fact it might even be a prerequisite for its success. The best priced bookmakers in the world put enormous amounts of effort into producing accurate prices for sports and this allows them to offer tighter spreads (better odds on both sides of an event). But if Wagerr is going to be using some form of market price scraping and producing its odds second hand then it is going to suffer from time lags allowing it to be picked off by arbitrageurs and betting syndicates which will cause the on-chain book balance to be massively asymmetrical. Or if Wagerr wants to produce its own odds it's going to have to hire very skilled odds compilers which is very costly.  My point here is that Wagerr is offering a market to people who can't normally bet and who are unlikely to be price conscious when betting. They are what economists would call price inelastic. Offering these customers great prices doesn't increase their betting volume and it doesn't increase the on-chain bookmaking profitability.  I guess it all comes down to who the target market is. Offer great prices if you want to attract betting syndicates and smart punters. Offer great accessibility, fast payouts, fast settlements, user protection, lots of markets, etc along with quite good odds if you want to attract everybody else.  Ideally I'd like to see great prices on offer too but I can't see that working unless there is some hidden balancing mechanism in the valuation of Wagerr tokens themselves. If the on-chain betting is paying out more than it's bringing in is this balanced out by devaluing the currency, in the same way that printing billions of dollars devalues the dollar?",False

However, while the price per wgr is low the fees will burn a larger amount of wgr to naturally return it to a sort of balance.  There will likely be a lot of h2h/mu bets which will be burning more wgr for essentially no risk, since there will be someone else covering the other end of it.  As far as the size of fees go, I think the main goal is to strike the best balance between keeping the fees low and limiting risk to the chain.  They will certainly be competitive of course since we want it to be as appealing as possible to as many different types as possible.",False

It would be very useful to know how the odds compilation will work for on-chain betting. If the Wagerr team cannot put out accurate prices for the markets it will cover then the whole operation will just be the same as a soft bookie that is going to get torn apart by shrewd punters.  I'm mostly invested in Wagerr because I want to use the actual betting service (I'm also invested because i think this could be a very valuable crypto ecosystem in the future). But unlimited bet sizes at a bookie that doesn't restrict accounts is unheard of... and there's a reason for that. A bookie that doesn't protect itself from smart bettors will get destroyed. So my question is how will Wagerr protect itself from bettors that know how to beat the book? If bettors aren't restricted then the only way to protect yourself as a bookie is to put out accurate odds and that is very very hard to do.,False

You guys are completely right in that running on-chain bets will be extremely complex with massive amounts of potential risks, especially if not managed properly.  This is why h2h and multi-user will be implemented first (and are lower fees) - there will always be someone on the other side taking the risk for these types.  For the on-chain bets we've brought in a few of these same smart bettors that you're talking about, Jason(MMAforMoney) and Sean(SuparTipstar).  They will review all of the processes from as many angles as possible, and make recommendations for a more secure and efficient system.  These two are the real deal and I'll see about maybe getting one or both to come here and answer some of the more technical questions from you all, you can check them out on twitter where they post a lot of their own solid picks for free.  Then there are quite a few other long-time bettors that aren't a part of the team, but still make solid contributions.  David has honestly done a great job in listening to these experienced bettors and in trying to implement their suggestions.  Some people will try to say ""Oh he's just a doctor, what could he really know about blockchains and gambling?"", but it's pretty clear he's quite intelligent and could learn just about anything if he has enough motivation.  I can't really go into too much detail yet about how we plan to handle on-chain betting initially, but we're well aware of the points you guys are making.  It's actually good to see a bit more serious talk around here, which is why I wanted to respond.  What I can say for sure though is that the network of masternodes/oracles will eventually run the network, so a better question might be how would you (or a group of users) handle these issues?  Developers would really only be able to submit proposals, it would ultimately be up to you guys to decide on which one(s) to implement.    I'm not sure the community realizes just how much control they will have over the network.  It's pretty much impossible to see which ways this thing will go and a great deal is subject to change due to our decentralized nature.  This is a fairly unique project which we hope will be disruptive to the gambling industry because it has been failing its users more and more in recent years...especially with the global patchwork of regulations further complicating things.  With that said though, Wagerr will still try to do its best to work with existing structures of the industry.   Edit - When I said restrictions above, I mainly meant overall limitations on bet sizes that apply to everyone...not restrictions on winning bettors.  We actually want those types of people, their achievements should be promoted instead of trying to restrict them unfairly or even outright ban them.  I'm sure many of them would eventually get interested in running a masternode and using their knowledge to improve the network, there would certainly be a lot of incentive to do so....more than pretty much any other network at least.",False

We've got a lot planned on the marketing/promotion side later on, but what we'd really like to see more of right now are highly technical users who are very forward-thinking.  Once everything is up and running fairly stable, then when we can really begin to formally introduce Wagerr to the gambling world.  We're already making preparations for this, we just need to make sure we get plenty of people who can run a high-quality masternode(s).  It's also important to note that a lot of our marketing concerns are common to cryptos in general really.  We realize that we will need to have something that is simple and practical, which is certainly much easier said than done for blockchain technology especially.  This will surely take significant time to develop and refine, getting helpful feedback from the community during these stages will be important for us.

I can assure you that serious work is being done and the Jan 15th release date is still a go.  Those guys have already wasted more than enough of my time, if they decide to flood the Wagerr thread here there's really nothing I can do about it.    It's a disservice to you guys too, since it reduces or removes any meaningful two-way conversation that would normally be possible between the team and the community here.    Instead we're trying to provide other reliable options for (somewhat) serious people to get their questions and concerns answered.  We try to be fairly free and open-minded and we've even included a trading/speculation channel where people are free to discuss other coins and their advantages/disadvantages, even coins that some may see as directly competing with wgr.  You can also pull current btc/alt info and graphs directly from Coinmarketcap straight to our Discord with a simple command, I made sure to add it for you guys  One question I did see that I can quickly answer is that the Bcash is treated the same as any other resource raised and will be used to improve the network...no worries, nobody is just going to walk away with it.",False

Most of his posts are just him concern-trolling a few projects he had unrealistic expectations on, and then going into random fits of childish cursing and insults when he doesn't get an instant profit or at any news he doesn't like.  Still funny how none of these guys warned about any of the actual crypto betting projects that went under recently, yet they sure find the time to bash this one like it's the worst thing ever.  In reality, Wager is one of the best in its sector.  Look at the distribution on some of these other betting coins, devs are keeping a ridiculous amount and some still trying to call it decentralized.  Meanwhile, the wgr devs have kept only a very modest portion of the total wgr.  They also burned nearly 1% of the entire supply by taking on a large amount of exposure/risk with the mayweather promo bet, when they could've just kept it for themselves.  The 100x mistake is almost nothing in the long-term, hilarious to see a few of you guys act like it's the end of the project lol  DYOR on all of these betting projects and do a thorough comparison, you'll see that this is one of the best of the bunch(circulating supply vs. total supply is a good place to start).  There's tons of buy support right now, and hardly any sell orders...so it's not too hard to see which way this one is going.  Trying to compare it to btc currently is just lol, since alts as a whole are down quite a bit against btc lately but it'll surely pass after this fork hype.  Many of the other betting coins are down a lot more than this one, and a few are at a serious risk of failing...while Wagerr has been slowly expanding the team with solid talent and quietly working hard.

Why anyone would believe these guys is just beyond me, unless they're looking for confirmation bias or something.    The ""half"" of the team he's saying that left was an advisor and a marketing guy, who was busy finishing up his degree currently.  Their role was mainly for the pre-ICO and ICO anyway, and we've had far better replacements waiting for a few months now.  Neither of these guys was anywhere even near essential to this project.  We appreciate their work and they did an amazing job with the ICO, but this thing has grown to a scale that they would have trouble doing things alone and they had too much going on in their personal lives anyway to be able to continue to dedicate the time needed to this project.    The discord community has already met some of the new guys, especially the new advisors...and they are fairly happy with the choices.  Most of them have been community members themselves since the ICO or even before, so they truly do understand things from the holders' point of view.  The rest of the community will learn more about them during this next update I'm assuming, I can't spoil too much  These trolls know pretty much 0 about the gambling industry, or even about this project and its members it seems.  You don't have to trust either of us, do your own research and watch for this next update...then you'll be able see who was more correct here.  Also as soon as the marketing guy left, one of these trolls here created a fake reddit account with his name and starting posting a ton of lies on the Wagerr subreddit and elsewhere.  The real one got on to clear things up, but still it shows how desperate some of these people are to try and discredit this project with indirect or completely non-factual evidence and tactics.  They're currently trying to run a negative campaign against us on /r/Cryptocurrency and pretty much anywhere else they can get away with it also.  Since they can't/won't give other betting projects the same treatment, it's highly unfair and extremely biased...if you want unbiased info then try to research the project as objectively and thoroughly as possible.

Calling the project ""on target"" is more than a bit delusional at this point.  You guys are out of your mind if you think they will have a working project in January. They had - allegedly - been working on Wagerr for quite some time before the ICO. I think it was about a year or two that they claim they were developing it. And then they had to throw it all out and start over from scratch.  Btw they never posted anything on Github. Their reasoning was that their code was so super-advanced that it would get solen immediately if they posted it in public. Well turns out it was so shitty they had to throw it all in the trashcan and start over LOL.  You seriously believe they will get a working product done within 3 months... when they couldn't do it before in one year+?  You'd be seriously lucky to see a proper wallet or even a listing on a real exchange by January. But looking at the teams performance so far it would be a safe bet to say that that's not gonna happen.  At some point maybe you should start facing the facts. The dev team is a bunch of amateurs who are in way over their head. They made some big promises and collected a bunch of money... but they will never deliver on those promises.  Another fun fact: Bitcoin more than tripled in price since the Wager ICO. You could've made some nice profits just betting on a safe thing (as safe as it gets in regards to cryptos at least).

So they threw out a number and they are ""very confident"". Well I guess that changes everything! LMAO  They couldn't even release a proper wallet let alone get it listed on a real exchange so far. But somehow they'll pull a working product out of thin air in less than three months now.  Hahahahha I'll keep a close eye on this thread for sure.   With all of the effort you spent bashing this single project, why didn't you warn Imperium investors or holders of the other gambling tokens who are down far more than this one?  What kind of dumbass argument is that? I dont know shit about any of these projects and couldnt care less about them. I was actually invested in wagerr at some point, realized what a clusterfuck it is and got out (with a decent profit I might add).  Now I just come here to troll since wagerr bagholders are the most deluded ""investors"" I've ever seen and its hilarious to watch this project burn to the ground.

As I knew very well that 95% of all mega projects(be it programming or non-programming) were subjected to delay in common, I already spared a six months delay for Wagerr the very first time I read the roadmap during ICO. Therefore this one doesn't hurt my sentiment at all.  Oppositely, by staying closely and observing every word the team frequently spoke on slack, I'm absolutely sure that this delay is a total positivity for the long run. Firstly, it has minimized the possible delay for mainnet as expected bugs and other programming hassles can be solved easier during this period before the official release. Secondly, launching the blockchain on 15th Jan doesn't effect the timeline much. But it would have avoided many technical failures causing price dips after the launch. Thirdly, I myself don't like to mess too much time with the experimental testnet, to avoid being implicated by the technical problems which were supposed to be solved at the dev's own obligation before exposing it to the public.  They have clarified on Wagerr Slack that they are not necessarily to rewrite the code. But they must revamp and improve it to strengthen the security and workability.  ",False

To address it, we brought in one of the top blockchain security consultants. Following the review, Wagerr has revised the roadmap to make the necessary changes in design.  *The challenge* The main challenge facing developers is that the original architecture was designed to accommodate a much narrower vision and scope for Wagerr, with a focus on P2P contracts of real-world events. The overwhelming enthusiasm during the ICO, however, afforded us the opportunity to expand our vision. Thanks to the additional resources and user base, we broadened the project scope to include fantasy leagues, e-sports, and live in-game betting.  To achieve our new goals, the original prototypes for Wagerr must be discarded and replaced with more complex architecture. This change in design requires us to reboot development and make new hires, and we are currently in the process of onboarding two additional C++ blockchain developers.  *The road ahead* Consequently, we anticipate a 3-6 month delay of some near-term targets. On the bright side, the team has reconceptualized the sequence of the roadmap, allowing us to achieve some components sooner than originally anticipated. Furthermore, we believe the overarching targets are still within reach.  One crucial and exciting component we intend to launch on schedule is the Wagerr mainnet. This means Wagerr holders will be able to operate Masternodes and earn Wagerr for staking coins as soon as the mainnet starts! However, betting and Oracle functions will not be available, but will instead remain sandboxed in a limited testnet, which will launch and run in parallel. Our target for mainnet+testnet is January 15. >“It took the madmen of yesterday for us to be able to act with extreme clarity today. I want to be one of those madmen. We must dare to invent the future."" — Thomas Sankara  *Expanding public relations* Wagerr is excited to announce it is seeking a Community Ambassador to develop and cultivate the Wagerr community and to build positive industry relationships. The position will foster a supportive and growing community, raise Wagerr’s profile across the media, cryptocurrency, and event forecasting industries, and promote Wagerr as it develops and grows.  As we scan the regulatory environment, it becomes even clearer to the Wagerr Team how important a decentralized solution for sports betting really is. Rumors about China's regulation of digital currency exchanges, for instance, cracked the price of Bitcoin in days.  Sports betting is one industry where government regulation always means a shift in the answer to the question of who is abusing the power. The Wagerr team is more committed than ever to delivering the secured trustless system that disrupts autocratic centralized abuses of power. Betting belongs on the blockchain for good reason.

I care about profit, and about having a gambling network that doesn't kick winners off and/or charge crazy high fees with oftentimes long delays on withdraws...or just straight up run away with users' money(Lock Poker anyone?).  When there are issues, I'll speak with my group and we'll write up a solid solution and pass it along to the team, instead of coming on btctalk and crying here for months like you do, like that would ever do anything lol...get real kid.  I've made the team aware of plenty of ways they could improve, constructively too, unlike the childish bs you post here lol.  Between the immature posts and even the name, it's pretty clear you're nothing more than a troll who's trying to pass themself off as an investor.  You said you sold all your token off at over 4k sats (the absolute highest point, and highly unlikely) the total volume for that was very small.  So either you lied or you were only ever holding a very tiny amount of tokens.  And then there's the other times you said you sold all off and were out, honestly it seems like you're nothing more than some habitual liar who has little to no money to even invest.  Hopefully others can see the lies and lack of experience in your writing, and avoid taking you too seriously lol.    I've posted plenty of constructive and logical ways the team can improve, while you post a stream of total negativity consisting of mostly complete bs and opinions.  Yeah that's bias, boy.  Especially since you weren't trolling the actual fail coins, so why didn't you warn us about any of the actual failures?  Why even waste months trolling this project, lol were you invested in the Imperium failure yourself?  Or are you invested on one of these dime-a-dozen prediction markets that have failure written all over them?  For real, get a job or some kind of hobby...since this is pretty pathetic lol.    You sound like some broke-ass college kid who had unrealistic expectations about this project and bought in for a hundred bucks or whatever the minimum was, thinking you'd get a 100x return in a week and be hood rich for nothing lol.  Once you realized that wasn't how things work, you flipped out in slack and started throwing around a bunch of childish insults and useless opinions.  Once nobody took you seriously there, you came here with your shitposting and for the most part it's the same here too.    People are still investing and progress is still being made on the project, funny how you never mention anything about the demo they presented which shows they have much of the work done already.  Or about the successful transactions they're made on the wagerr network many weeks ago.  Or about the security flaws they found and fixed before testnet is even out.  Or the fact they have an experienced company (Darcrus) who are making sure the project gets done right or the team don't get paid from the investor funds.  You conveniently leave all of these out, but manage to find time to include your opinions and outright lies.  Yes there's been problems and some negative stuff too, we've already brought it up constructively quite a few weeks ago about their communication issues and we're already seeing actual results with the new updates every few weeks...so yeah that's definitely old/outdated news.  We told them the promo structure from the first bet just won't work, and we offered some working systems.  One is a community-driven project being developed right now that will allow us to begin betting in a little as a few weeks, and only at a 1% fee which is about as cheap as it can get anywhere.  The community has gotten quite large, and there are some talented people willing to put in the effort to make this happen...that's why I'm saying now that this network is going to be built, no worries on that part.  As far as the exchange issues go, bittrex has allowed gambling coins already...there are some on their list.  And waves isn't as terrible as some people make it out to be, daily volume for wgr is nearly 1m tokens a day.  Most of the people complaining about waves couldn't even afford near that amount anyway.  Yet we're still pushing the team for more options, but we have to do it in constructive ways or it's just a waste of everyone's time.  Many exchanges aren't as willing to accept a temporary token, that is the main reason.  Once we get to mainnet we can focus on the big exchanges more.  Also we have some plans for p2p exchanges and such, because a decentralized project relying entirely on centralized exchanges is just setting itself up for failure.  Lastly, there are some serious investors supporting this project.  There are groups of successful sports bettors who are committed to keeping this project funded and making progress.  This is why we often see the $ price hold, even when btc and other alts are dipping.  The main reason it seems a bit low lately is that the buy-back from the promo mistake hasn't been fully completed yet.  The price is artificially low right now, and the smart money is taking advantage of that with buys.  Very soon we will have promo bets, community-driven betting, and even testnet slowly approaching.  It's really not hard to see which way this token is going over the next few months, and the fud is actually helping the team in their buyback (and the smart investors who are trying to buy cheap) so carry on if ya want...but there really isn't much logic to it unless it is constructive.  Once final thing, this is a network/token adapted for the gambling community...not for the crypto community.  It has a use case specifically for gambling and some things simply aren't going to be done in the same way as many of these other coins.  It's not a clone of another chain with just a few numbers changed, that must pay off exchanges to host it and keep it alive.  Bitcoin managed to survive before exchanges, if people want it then they'll find a way to get it.  Wagerr doesn't have to follow the traditional crypto standards, they've already demonstrated that gamblers come first for this project.

Thanks for the update!  There are many telltale signs that Wagerr will succeed once it is launched. The biggest one is that there are many strong hands holding this coin. Watch how little movement there is in the Wagerr token price every time the market corrects. Many other coins go up and down like a seesaw. For the most part, Wagerr dips just a bit and in some cases, it goes up. Those are signs of strong hands. Considering that there really isn't too much positive news on this token, it's really impressive how it holds on. Just imagine how the market will react once we actually have some positive news behind it. I predict that the price will skyrocket.

The announcements channel is pretty much the only useful thing in there now, I left #general and some of the others for awhile since it's just a waste of time lately anyway.  Other than the announcements channel, the wagerr website and email updates plys the price charts is enough info for now I guess.  Hopefully there will be better options in the future.  And yeah like some of the others said, I used this opportunity to load up(how could you not at these prices?).  There's promo bets coming, world series looks like the next likely wgr betting event.  There also may be a community-driven option to do some betting with wgr tokens early, using a modified waves wallet.  Regardless of how the market price looks right now, this thing is going to happen and even if there are small delays it is still nothing in the big picture.  Inexperienced investors feel like they must flip their way into a profit somehow each day, and eventually the math will catch up with them causing a huge loss or missing out on some big value in a pump.  Essentially, they're usually trying some variation of economic martingaling lol.  Also other sports betting projects like Imperium are failing and all of those prediction market tokens popping up are easy for devs to crank out plus have very little risk/reward for the house...there most likely won't be near as much value in those as their investors are expecting.  Lastly, that uw0tm8 guy has been trolling this project for months on here and on slack for awhile(elsewhere too maybe?).  He brings up decent but clearly obvious and outdated points every now and then, but much of what he says is highly opinionated bs or straight up lies.

You make some very good points. In my opinion, getting involved with the Mayweather/McGregor fight was not a smart move. They were obviously not ready for what was to come and it showed in how badly things played out. Something like that should have been done when the project was close to completion. The way I see it is they really screwed up on that. There should be more PR constantly posting and bringing attention to the project updates, as well as engaging with the public, like some of the other top coins are doing.  I hear about their Slack, but a lot of people including myself are too busy to be hanging out in their slack. The updates should be readily and easily accessible by all. This is one area which troubles me about this project because marketing is crucial to the success of this project. That being said, if the dev team can even come close to creating what they set out to, Wagerr has the potential to be huuuuggggeeee! Personally, I need the price to dip a bit more because I have an open limit order to buy some more.  Despite its shortcomings, I believe that Wagerr can be a $10+ coin by the end of 2018. I have nothing to back up my comment, it's purely instincts. Barring any major fuckups and a bit more communication to market the project once they are complete, $20 is not out of the question in my opinion. ",False

One of our biggest goals is making it as easy and comfortable as possible to run one of these, but for those who absolutely don't understand tech things or simply don't have time...you'll probably want the help of a trusted friend who's fairly smart about computers and such.  And even at the very least, you can just lease your coins to the network through the staking feature to earn some extra wgr instead of running an entire masternode or group of them.  Also someone asked if you can run multiple masternodes through the same ip address, you can't sadly.  But you can still run multiple masternodes, and it's probably for the best to have multiple servers/addresses anyway.  Lastly, the 2000 masternode limit is not necessarily a hard cap.  It can potentially be voted on in the future, and the cap could be raised as needed.  So anyone who is worried about not being able to run the amount of masternodes they'd like to, has no need to worry really.  There won't be a rush to fill up the first 2000 anyway, since masternodes likely won't be profitable right at the beginning.  The strategy many large wgr holders seem to be going with is to have one masternode at first to play around with and test, and use the rest of their wgr for staking.  As betting traffic grows, they will move wgr from staking to making more masternodes as needed.  If anyone has more questions about masternodes or just wagerr in general, I'll try to answer them the best I can.",False

It will likely result in rapid appreciation which is also good for bettors and they may well become WGR investors & speculators too as a result.    However for bets that are over a longer horizon, it's true that greater stability is valuable. However the solution to that is not to dump WGR to maintain the price but rather to introduce a stable token backed by WGR.  Also most sportbooks have to jump through a big amount of hoops to serve particular markets. This is much easier and cheaper for a blockchain based solution so profits are higher while still being cheaper for bettors.  The Wager Dollar  (Based on BitUSD by BitShares)  For the example and simplicity let's say the current market price is 1 WGR = $0.1  If a bettor wants to bet $10 on a fight, he needs to buy 100 WGR to get 10 WGR Dollars. Unbeknownst to the bettor, whales, masternodes & WGR holders are able to short that 10 WGR dollars with 100 WGR. Both amounts go into a pool containing all WGR Dollar bets and those shorting them. If WGR goes up in value let's say to $0.2 then it will only cost 50 WGR to return $10 USD worth of WGR to the bettor. The other 50 WGR is profit to the person who shorted the WGR dollar. Conversely if the value of dollar rises vs WGR then the person who shorted it will lose. Also because all the WGR collateral is pooled it should be able to maintain dollar payouts even where WGR loses 90% of its value.  The example of this is BitUSD & BitCNY by BitShares. (BitCNY has an $11 million CAP https://coinmarketcap.com/assets/bitcny/  They have both maintained their respective currency pegs for 3 years+ I believe, even with BTS falling 80%+ at times.  https://cryptofresh.com/a/USD https://cryptofresh.com/a/CNY  So as a medium term goal I would reccomend emulating currency stable assets in order to provide stability without whales ever needing to sell WGR. It would probably be best to employ a BitShares developer if this is something you were interested in.",False

Unless you're already familiar with american odds, decimal will probably easier for you to work with.  +550 means that for every 100 units you bet, you get 550 units profit...plus the 100 back for a total of 650.  So 6.5 for decimal is same.  -550 means that you'd have to bet 550 units to win 100 units profit...plus the 550 back for a total of 650.

So you either aren't really selling(or even holding?), or you're simply trying to angle-shoot for gains of a fraction of a penny lol...either way it's pretty scummy.  To be short and not waste any more of my time with your opinions and often outright lies - I'm sorry you've clearly had some very unrealistic expectations, but look you're throwing an unnecessary temper tantrum to try and get wagerr to pay off a bunch of shady centralized exchanges so you can try and make a quick buck.  It's not going to work, and this effort would have been (or still could be) better spent trying to get the exchanges to add wagerr.  Those are the groups you should be angry with.

I also don't think they promised exchanges at ICO stage and I think they've suggested from early on that it suits them to be under the radar a bit for now.  However the answer to your question is 'As a courtesy to ICO investors, soon to be a requirement.'  ICO's which are rapidly added to decent exchanges relative to their size, have a high probability of maintaining and growing their value post ICO. ICO's which list on very small exchanges have a high probability of trading below their ICO price even if developmental progress is good.  So by not putting a tiny percentage of funds raised into centralised exchange listings, it's a bit like an FU to the people who funded you, because there's a high probability they will have made a bad investment timing wise, because the same shares will be purchasable at a later date, for lower risk and a lower price. So it's like 'Invest at this price in our ICO! (Even though we know it will be very likely be cheaper in two months due to our undisclosed exchange listing policy/strategy.)  As a result, I'm fairly certain more and more projects will actually need exchange agreements in place at ICO stage because investors will be more and more reluctant to invest, knowing that the biggest factor influencing their investment timing decision is whether or not the ICO will swiftly list on relatively large and liquid exchanges.",False

You seem convinced wagerr needs to overpay to get on exchanges in the pre-alpha stages when we don't even need them yet.  These are the earliest stages of for investment and therefore the highest risk...you're more than welcome to wait and see which exchanges wagerr gets on in the future but you'll likely be paying a much higher price then.   Idk why you seem to hate waves so much (I mean seriously just get over this childish crap and use waves if trading is that important to you this early), or seem to think we need distribution through every exchange when main net isn't even running yet...let alone the test net lol.  Honestly, did you seriously expect to get 25-100x gains in a few weeks without a platform up and running?  Many of us don't even care about the investment profits yet, we just want to support the decentralization of gambling.    Until you've been screwed over by one or more of the centralized networks for things as ridiculous as simply winning a bit too much, you'll continue to remain laughably clueless about what this project really means.  But I don't expect you to understand or even feel the slightest bit of sympathy, since you're so fixated on bittrex being the answer to all of our problems.  Given your logic, how about this...go develop your own coin, pay a ton of money to get it on all of the exchanges, and make all the money you want instead of crying here for months now.  Surely you have something better to do when you're not even invested in this lol, and even with all of this fixation you still haven't answered my question earlier.  Why should a decentralized project pay a bunch of centralized competitors to push these few new decentralized exchanges (waves/tidex) out of wgr trading?  They've been cool af to us, why sell them out for only a short-term gain?  I mean you do realize that having a ton of exchanges now has little to no impact on the long-term value of wagerr right?  However, it just looks like you're focused on a short-term pump and dump rather than actually supporting a project that would be good for the gambling community.  This is investing, what you're looking for seems to be a pyramid scheme...gl with those and remember to dance close to the door  ",False

I think I'd be more worried about a team that is more focused on selling its tokens rather than focusing on development of the actual project.  A better question might be, why would an exchange knowingly cost themselves money each day by not making wgr available on their market?    Or maybe still another one, why would wagerr pay a bunch of centralized exchanges to help push decentralized exchanges out of wgr trading?  Waves has been very helpful to the wagerr community from the start, and they gain more users/traffic each day that the centralized exchanges don't add wgr trading.  Probably same for tidex too lately.

Without you guys, Wagerr wouldn’t be the success that it is today! We are very proud of our community, and wanted to give back to everyone by offering a fun event on August 26th to highlight the Fight of the Century between Floyd Mayweather & Conor McGregor!  Before we get into that, let me explain to those who are still unfamiliar with the Wagerr project, what exactly it is…  Wagerr is a decentralized sportsbook that brings trustless sportsbetting to the entire world. Due to its strict use of Application Specific Smart Contracts (ASSC) and 2nd layer network controlled by Oracle Masternodes, Wagerr solves the security, scaling and incentive issues that have plagued smart contracts since their inception. Additionally, Wagerr combines leaps in technical design with an economic linkage that creates a deflationary, and self regulating economy. Through decentralized governance and contract fees, structural mechanisms balance Wagerr’s token value by dynamically adjusting supply based on the current exchange rate and betting volume within the Wagerr network. Wagerr does this all while avoiding single points of failure and implementing a network and system that is fully decentralized.  Now, why is this so important, and what does it mean for the Sports Betting Industry? First of all, there is no single point of failure. Wagerr is not a website or an application, it’s a network powered by over 2000 servers in 100+ different countries. You can take the website down, a rogue government can try to outlaw it, the whole team can die in a horrific plane crash, etc…And not only is your money safe, but you will still be able to place a Wagerr. There’s no book’s closing up shop and taking your winnings, or booting you for winning too much. You’re not taking a chance wiring your money to Estella Gonzalez Menudo Martinez in Costa Rica, there’s no fears of your credit card number getting stolen by some temp employee, you don’t have to wait months to receive a payout, or any of the issues that plague traditional offshore books. This is such a big deal, that a few of the largest offshore sportsbooks in the world, have already contacted Wagerr to enquire about balancing their sheets, since there’s only a 2% transaction fee on winning Wagerr’s! If you can’t beat em, join em!  So, let’s see…  ✅ Best odds in the world. ✅ No one oddsmaker or line manager. ✅ No fear of getting robbed. ✅ No fear of getting booted for winning. ✅ No fear of the government stepping in. ✅ No fear of the website “going down.” ✅ Bet on Sports & Events around the world. ✅ Live Betting. ✅ eSports Betting. ✅ You can own a masternode, collect part of “the cut”, and be “the house!”  Seems like a revolutionary, Sports Betting Industry game changer, to me! If I wasn’t selected to be 1 of the 8 members on the Wagerr Advisory Board, due to my experience, accomplishments, and credentials in the Sports Betting Industry, I might’ve even said Wagerr was too good to be true myself!  Wagerr is not launching until late Q4 of 2017. However, you can still invest in the company, and prepare to get enough tokens to own your masternode, at this time. But a revolutionary, industry disrupting, sports betting network takes time to build. The team at Wagerr has spent close to a year so far on planning & development! Luckily, we’re close to launching! For more information on the Wagerr Network, their full 34 page 100% transparent business plan (Whitepaper), how to invest, upcoming news, etc… Check out Wagerr.com!  Now, onto the August 26th promotion…  As I touched on earlier, the Wagerr team wanted to thank those of you in the MMAforMoney community, and this is our way of showing our appreciation to you guys! Setting up a promotion for the Fight of the Century! Those of you that already purchased Wagerr tokens, it will be very easy to bet on Mayweather/McGregor!  Use your Wagerr-over-Waves tokens to bet.  NOTE: If you still have credits in a Wagerr.com account, you must first withdraw your tokens to the Waves Lite wallet (not an exchange!).  Follow these instructions: https://news.wagerr.com/wavesguide/ to withdraw.  ✅  Waves Lite ✅ 🚫 TIDEX🚫  1. Pick your fighter! 2. Send to the address in the pop up window for your fighter, on Wagerr.com* 3. Watch the fight! 4. Get paid!  Winners will receive their payout (less fees) at the address from which they sent (so make sure you control that address!)  🚫 TIDEX🚫 * YOU MUST SEND FROM A PERSONAL WAVES WALLET TO GET PAID YOUR WINNINGS. WAGERR SENT FROM AN EXCHANGE WILL NOT HAVE A RETURN ADDRESS ASSOCIATED*  Follow @wagerrx for exciting tweets about the fight.  Good luck! The Wagerr Team",False

Have you seen their new announcement, where they proudly say they take bets on ""the fight of the century""?  have you seen the odds they offer?  At the moment:  McGregor +450, which means you get $5.50 for every $1 you bet.  Mayweather -700, which means you get $1.14 for every $1 you bet.  The house juice is already 6% with these shitty odds, and they even want to charge you extra 2% for what they call ""head to head"" (8% total fee), as they say, and I quote ""The standard Head-to-Head fee applies (2% of the payout)."" Isn't 6% juice big enough that you need to charge extra 2%? Head to head against who? Head to head means I should offer whatever odds I believe are fair and wait for someone to take the other side (or viceversa), not take the odds provided by the bookie. This is NOT head to head.  Where can I see how much money was offered by anyone at any given odds? Wasn't head to head meant for a user to take the complete bet from another user (according to your own whitepaper)? How can I see when I have taken someone's entire bet? Where can I see if my stake will be fully matched? What happens if it's not? What if it's too large or too short? Where can I offer a different, more attractive price for others to take?  Have you seen the user interface for this event? It's absolutely embarrassing to see a company that raised about $20M display something like that. You can make something better with wordpress for free. You cannot even place a bet intuitively, you need to send money to an address, which changes every time odds change. So what if when I'm sending money the odds are changing? What if my stake is larger than your limit? Who takes the extra risk?  Now let's take the odds of a real bookmaker (pinnacle) that does take large bets (over $60K on mayweather, and you can repeat as many times as you want).  McGregor +526, which means you get $6.26 for every $1 you bet.  Mayweather -667, which means you get $1.15 for every $1 you bet.  Juice is 3% compared to (6+2)% from wagerr. Who on earth would chose to bet with these scammers over a trusted company which doesn't require you to buy their volatile shitty tokens?  Have you seen the odds of a real exchange, such as betfair? 1.18 and 6.6, with over $10M liquidity. How does this even compare to wagerr joke?  How can people be so naive? I cannot believe people still fall for this scam, and even some say this is the future. This is nothing but a scam. These people are lying in their whitepaper, over and over again.",False

By theoretical estimation, when the platform is fully functioned where Wagerr is widely used for most of the world sport events and national sport events in different countries, its price would turn into 10 thousand dollars plus after one year.  I told my friends about this and they all laughed their shit out. So I tried a few estimations again from different angles. But the result still turned out more or less the same.  All I can explain is, perhaps when the team designed the value-coupling economics, they mistakenly expected the 1-2% burning as an annual shrinkage, but had forgotten that the 1-2% burning could repeat thousands of times within a year.

There were pathetically very few people that recognized the unique potentiality of these alphas and had got their full bowls now, while the majority were still enjoying their self-smart self-showing-off parrot-cum party in vain. But the insiders of the sector know best. Here's where the FUD comes from. When you're feeling hopeless on your own ability, all you can do is to sabotage your competitors.  I'm no smarter than you in deed. But the difference is, you're too distracted by the trendy speculation mindset based on mouth to mouth information from the majority, while I've spent countless of resources on my own meticulous research and study.

The team has been speaking with exchanges and the extra requests from the rest of us would help lend more weight to the team's proposal to these exchanges.  The team is obviously well aware already of what it would mean to get on other, larger exchanges.  However with that said, it's not easy and it's not just something you can do with a flick of a switch.  Using certain other ICOs as examples is sometimes like comparing apples to oranges, since Wagerr wasn't operated like many of these other ICOs and its end product will most certainly be highly contentious and will push many legal/regulatory boundaries.  For this reason alone in particular, many exchanges will be (and probably already are) hesitant to just add wagerr to their system for free.  And then there's the whole issue of the increasingly pay-to-play nature of exchanges.  I myself find it pretty funny that some of these exchanges act like gambling is totally immoral, yet engage in very scummy practices themselves when they try to take advantage of dev teams and their investors.  This hidden cost eventually gets cycled back to users of these exchanges, so pretty much everyone shares a cost in paying up this dirty money.  Wagerr is decentralized betting, Waves is a decentralized exchange.  It just makes sense really.  Any wagerr investor can trade their wgr for bitcoin right now, and for a trade fee that is far lower than pretty much anywhere else.  This is definitely a workable solution for wagerr, at least until other exchanges see the value in adding wagerr.  Even if volume isn't to your liking, why not put up a buy/sell order to get what you can/want anyway?  If all of those asking about an exchange did this, you can be sure volume would go way up...unless they are all minnows or goldfish  There's a chance right now to turn a bunch of negativity into some positive (and real) results.  It's up to the majority of you to decide if the herd goes that route or not.  I'm not too worried myself either way in the short-term since it's win/win, one way I get to keep buying cheap wgr and the other way I get to see wgr go up.  I just figured I'd throw this out there to help some others begin to understand the bigger picture.  I don't claim to know it all myself or anything, I just see an opportunity to score a win for the community as a whole...no matter which side you're on in the whole exchange issue.  Even for those who didn't/couldn't invest or buy when it goes live, I'll personally be pushing for ways for the average user to get small amounts of wagerr for free on a regular basis...probably from fun betting challenges and such using wagerr.  A good example of this would be march madness brackets.      ",False

Here is a fair use case:  Edgeless Casino did an ICO in mid-March.  The token price amounted to $0.035 per token (when ETH was between $30-$35).  Edgeless will operate on the Ethereum EVM.  Less than 4 months later, with a working beta project, and NO launch yet, the token price is over $0.70 each.  That is a 20x profit for people who held for LESS than 4 months, and it has performed twice as well as ETH.  And Wagerr will NOT be on the EVM, and will arguable have a better product.  But to get there we have to listen to all the FUD'sters and complainers who can't trade their tokens a week after ICO.

When you have an ICO that runs for weeks, where literally ANYONE and EVERYONE can get into it, how does it help to list on a major exchange immediately following the end of the ICO period?  At that point there is little/no demand for the coin/project.  There has been no value added since ICO, no project yet created.  The ONLY thing that would happen at that point would be a pump and dump based on hype, making the coin look weak - when in reality it was just the initial weak-hand investors who are weak.  The Wagerr team is under no obligation to ensure you get liquidity of the tokens a week after ICO, and now they have to listen to whining, BS, and field a million Waves related questions all taking time away from what they ought to be doing - delivering on the Wagerr product that we all want to see successful.

The team tried to help out all the weak hands and whiners who want to trade or cash out early before a product is finished.  Now all we hear is bitching in the Slack about Wagerr sucks because the price is low, or Wagerr is a scam because I can't get the answers I want even though the questions have already been answered several times.  And now the team has to take time out from development, marketing, and useful productivity to answer a million Waves related questions and coddle a bunch of whiners who don't like the volatility of crypto prices.  For all those who can't handle the swing in crypto price, take your shit and go home.  Sell your position and be done.  To continue complaining, is to show your true colors.  You're either working for a competitor, or you're FUDDing to try to get cheap coin.  Yup, it is posts like this that annoys the shit out of me.  I don't wanna sell so no one else should be able to sell.  Love the attitude.  The major complaint is to put it in a real exchange.  TBH, I think Waves platform could work but definitely not Waves DEX.  The liquidity is NOT there for people who wants to sell.  What do you even gain from trapping them if they don't believe in the project?   I will wait and see how the exchange pans out since someone mentioned they posted they are working to get it on exchanges.  But this community is borderline toxic with the ""You have Waves DEX (that has shit liquidity), that's all you get till mainnet""   Wagerr Volume Statistics on Wave's DEX:                    Wagerr/BTC    Wagerr/Waves   = 24 hr tot est val in USD $ 07/01/2017:     28.62898980             2780.24236528             $82,000 07/02/2017:     18.11105841             3934.90559685             $60,000 07/03/2017:     20.26675335             1734.45253769             $57,000  Only 3 days worth of time has passed for people to move their Wagerr over to Waves anyways, so only like 10% of the Wagerr tokens are even on Waves at this point, so why is everyone complaining that you have no volume or liquidity?   People don't even hardly have their WGR out there to trade with yet, so how do you expect there to be much more volume than this yet?  There is well over half a $billion stored already in the Wave's ecosystem, if more people wanna trade WGR, there is plenty of money and other valuable assets like bitcoin or USD/EURO and Waves to trade it against.  You could even trade WGR/MGO if you want.  Whatever pairing you want that has a token there.  I think the lack of volume complaints don't make sense though. Do you guys really want $500k worth of volume on day 1 after the ICO?  That would mean a shit ton of sellers were dumping WGR, right?  DEX has more than enough volume to support WGR trading, especially once everyone is set up and has moved their WGR there, and understands how to use an exchange and the Waves liteclient. ",False

But somehow you quoted $57k worth of Wagerr sold in USD.  Unless somehow people were overpaying 4-5 times, your number is not likely to be correct.  On Wave DEX there is no fking buyer because there isn't a lot of users in the Exchange.  Stop pretending like this isn't an issue, and we're all just imagining things.  Its similar to the issue SONM is having right now.  They sold $30 mil worth of SONM tokens, but their best exchange is liqui.io, which is still many times larger than Waves DEX.  Also, what does it matter if people move their Wagerr to Waves DEX, Tideus, or any low volume exchange?  There's no buyers is the main complaint.  Compare and don't tell me you're giving us an exchange to trade on.  The most popular pair on Wave is Wave/BTC (naturally) and it has a lousy 150k trade volume:  https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/waves-dex/ vs https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/liqui/ vs https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bittrex/  I know Wagerr team is working on getting it on more exchange so I'll adopt a wait-and-see approach.",False

Also, it's my understanding that Ethereum won't be able to scale really until the sharding tech is developed and that seems to be at least a year away.  A lot can happen in a year!  Waves, to my understanding, is built from scratch on Scala.  It's proof-of-stake already from the beginning, and regular users can actually earn rewards through leasing without having to download the entire blockchain.  Plus, from what I'm reading, Waves will have non-turing complete smart contracts in a couple of months that won't require any programming knowledge to implement.

A few points:  I invested in Wagerr during the ICO. Other than that I have no affiliation with them. I have been pretty active in the slack for the last few weeks though and have a handle on whats going on.  In terms of your above points: when will this go on a real exchange?: Waves DEX is a real exchange. The WGR token will be listed on more 'mainstream' exchanges when the wallet is live why can other ICOs get it listed on proper exchanges and you cant?: Waves tokens are a bit different to your standard coin and the exchanges handle them differently. The 'real' coin will be listed on more exchanges when can we expect updates?: The updates are coming every day if you actually hang out on slack and chat with the team whats gonna happen between now and main net release: They are working on testnet before mainnet  All of these questions have been answered MULTIPLE times on slack and no one shys away from them. The slack does get a bit sick of people joining and asking the same questions repeatedly without researching them, which is why they have pinned posts and an FAQ site.  The money is also in escrow so the team can't take the money and run.  A lot of people seemed to think the ICO would give them 10x profit overnight because they didn't  do their research so they are frustrated and want to blame the team, or waves, or whatever else they can think of.  All these ICOs are a risk, but after reading the whitepaper, getting to know the team, and hanging out on slack this is really good project, but will take time to come to market. This was never designed to make ICO buyers rich very quickly, it's about developing a good and fair betting platform.  The vocal minority are spreading FUD whereas most people are happy holding after actually doing their research.",False

Don't get panic and sell your hard earned WGR like shit.  Those WGR offered on Waves now are the free ones they obtained from bounties, bonuses and gold tickets.  If you're panic now, even if you sell yours now with a slight gain, it'll be very difficult for you to get it back at the same price, unless you're very, very lucky!  Those who bought at round 1*5 cents, their break even cost would be USD 0.0455. So, expect this bottom price or slightly lower ones, if they sell for panic to get their cost back. But the volume will not be huge.  16 hours ago the withdrawn volume was approximately 10,300,000 WGR. It was only 6% of the total sold.  For those who yelled for wanting Wagerr to be listed on high volume exchanges. I'll recommend you to rather push the coming-up Wagerr Direct Exchange. Because, merely the bettors volume would be far more than enough to beat the largest exchange out there.

So now we are on the Waves platform, no volume no activity, no mention where you can trade the tokens on there main page of the site or on Twitter? They keep mentioning this token as a temporary token, which devalues the token to potential investors. I get it they want to issue the token on Waves because it's easy and theirs no network issues. But Do what MobileGO did issue the token on Waves and then add it to other exchanges. Doing this allows investors to buy and sell freely on the open market. Some people are still going to hold long term but they also want the peace of mind if they need to sell some coins they can do so at any time on a decent volume exchange.    If people gave me $10,000,000 the last thing I would do is dump them on 1 exchange with next to zero volume and when they complain come up with a snark smart ass response. I had 2 issues with these guys posting a massive banner on there Bitcointalk page that said in giant letters and numbers 100,000,000 supply, no asterisk, which means theirs nothing more to that number. Then they have 20 rounds, yes it said there may be additional rounds at the bottom of the ICO page and buried on page 29 of the white paper, but the banner conflicted with the true number and was confusing! My second issue with them was there treating the investors with concerns as complainers and only catering to people who don't question them or complain! They ban people from there Slack who complain or question the way they are handling everything. When I question them about the exchange they told me I'm lucky we are even on an exchange and they said we didn't promise you guys we where going to be put it on any exchanges. So what's this token I paid tens of thousands of dollars for a token of appreciation, a thank you badge for donating?           ",False

I'm guessing the person who replied to me, and you, are ones who have contributed nothing useful to this thread and have either smokescreened or trainwrecked legitimate questions from actual investors, as you're doing right now. And I'm guessing you both participated with Wagerr signatures, doing nothing but praising a coin that has offered literally nothing so far, not even tokens on the Waves platform. Anyone who has experience in this would know how disappointing that truly is.  No one has answered my question yet, so I'll repeat it:  Why haven't they they stuck to the deadline to deliver the tokens owed to us? Or have at least informed us, their investors, why they couldn't?  Looking at their website, which seems to be the only form of communication, they even went out of their way to change/edit/modify the original deadline for June 26th (how many more times will they do this in the future?).  It now reads:  Quote Signature campaign ends June 26th (11:59GMT), 2017  The bitcointalk signature campaign ends and all qualifying users are paid within the following week.  When originally it said, before the edit:  Quote ICO token issuance June 26th, 2017  All users are issued any Wagerr they have purchased, earned, or won as a reward or bonus. The blockchain network starts, and participants can withdraw Wagerr from wagerr.com accounts.   Now please, take David Mah out of your mouth. This should be worrying to anyone.

This was just posted.  -------------------   *Wagerr issuance on Waves update* _Genuine Wagerr tokens have a green check mark  indicating verification_  Hello Wagerr ICO participants,  The Wagerr Team has created and verified the Wagerr asset token with Waves!  The Waves network proved to be an extraordinary match with the needs of the Wagerr community compared to other asset token issuance blockchains because it features a built in exchange, fiat gateway, fast and reliable transfers, and lightweight, user friendly wallets on all devices. We are excited to issue intermediary Wagerr tokens on this groundbreaking platform.  *Only Trade Verified Tokens* You will know that the Wagerr token is authentic when your Waves client shows a *green check mark* next to the token name “Wagerr” with the official token ID 8t8DMJFQu5GEhvAetiA8aHa3yPjxLj54sBnZsjnJ5dsw.  The “verified” status will reflect in all Waves wallets, pending a Waves system update which propagates the verification across the Waves network. Only after this verified status displays in all wallets will Wagerr tokens be available to withdraw to personal Waves wallets.  Verification is a precautionary step the Wagerr team is taking for the security of ICO participants, potential new investors, and the community.  *Round bonuses and bounties* Round bonuses will be credited to accounts within the next 24 hours. Bounty coins will be handled shortly after.  We’ll be sending out an email with detailed instructions for accessing your Wagerr tokens over Waves as soon as they are available for withdrawal.  Sincerely, The Wagerr Team",False

No way it hits 20 Billion market cap. This is a fantastic project and I invested heavily but still....Hell just think about that for a moment....20 BILLION DOLLARS. Where do you propose all this money will come from? Sure, some sports bettors will pick this app up and hopefully in time it will grow. But majority of serious sports bettors will continue to use traditional avenues of sports betting because that is what they know and trust. People hate change. If it were to even come close to that amount it would be years and years from now (10 or more) when cryptos and blockchain become more accepted. Of course, by then there will be many newer ways to bet and gamble.  The good news is, IF (and that's a big if) WAGERR releases a good product and has good marketing and IF (bigger IF) they can keep the product from being shutdown by the government due to legality issues, it may attract a whole new breed of gambler, the younger millennial generation that is willing to use the blockchain and bet through an app like Wagerr.  I think before you call someone out you should think realistically and get back to me. You point to BTC as an example, which is the mother of all cryptos and has been around 10ish years to get that high market cap.  All that said, it's still a good idea and at $5 each is reasonable some day and I would be extatic with that result",False

If you and a few others had looked a bit deeper into the project, you'd have quickly noticed that quite a few investors were quite familiar with the gambling industry and offered their advice for free.  In fact, the very first two things a good consultant would have suggested (aside from general marketing campaigns of course) - referral and loyalty programs, have already been funded and are in the process of being added.  Much of the other things aren't even able to begin being implemented until release, this project is still in its earliest stages.

Anyways, absolutely no bookie in the world applies the exact same edge to all events, and even to all markets within each event, so expect their 6% fee to be on most liquid ones.  The 2% fee on head to head and multi user means extracting that percentage from what you win (not the total payout). Usually, if the liquidity is high enough, you can even see 1,99 / 1,99, but that is not a matter of what odds the house is offering, as it's what people are willing to pay for their choice on both sides. In this case, with odds of  1,99, saying you place a bet of 100$ and you win the bet, your fee would be (100*0,99*0,02). In lower liquidity events you will more likely see 1,9 / 1,7 (if there are bets on both sides at all). The fee they charge would remain a 2% on winning amount, but your odds will be horrible.  I don't really care that much about the guy who just constantly writes over my comments with useless arguments, it's obvious that if he knew a thing about betting he would at least try to prove me wrong. The problem is when people who are trying to invest their money into a project are fooled by this type of people, who are probably paid to hype the project, or fully invested in it. Anyways, investing is a matter of analyzing where you put your money, and I hope my comments at least help people thinking about putting their money in wagerr do a little in depth research.",False

As a background: I develop gambling software for a living, have run operational companies for 15+ years, and am well versed in cryptography, cryptocurrencies, and related themes. I thus believe I uniquely qualified to break down what wagerr is. 1. The head guy is in the 'medical field' in Australia. Chiropractor or holistics? Who knows. His professional background in gambling? In development? Non-existent. 2. In the whitepaper, he writes that his solution will help players to 'avoid violence' among other things. It lend me to question: what type of gambling have this person engaged in? It seems like he must have been engaging with loan-sharks that let guys wager on credit that then would break the legs of a guy that don't pay back. Again, who knows, but after 17 years in the field, I have never heard a player being subject to a physical attack. It's online gambling, people. 3. Immature platform. As another poster stated, a key element to succesful wagering platform is a inviting and fast user interface, nice features and general ease-of-use.  It seems like they are a long way from having a mature platform. They stated among this in their 'road map'. ● Event Chat Addon ● Rematch Function/friend challenge ● Dynamic Odd Balancing ● Moneyline betting ● Season winner/champions bets Moneyline betting is a key factor of sportswagering. As is 'Season winner' or Futures.  Dynamic odd balancing, i assume they means Odds. It is indicative they have no idea how to do basic bookmaking and making sure they have as little liability as possible.    So, while it's not in my habit; I will make a bold prediction: Wagerr won't amount to much of anything, as it seems like they don't have the first clue about sportsbetting, complete novices. Another example of an ICO that is just fishing for money based on a pipe dream.  ",False

I work for one of the biggest gambling operators in the world within the European gaming industry, in a role that requires me to know a bit of everything, though not CS. I believe the project has potential because of the possible target groups that are out there, I.E:  1) Regular European players who wants higher odds or not to deal with KYC and regulation. Head to head betting with 2% fee means 1.96 in odds on line betting, that's .6/.7 higher than regular odds being offered by all regulated operators across the continent.  2) Any players who's received limits on regulated operators. Though it's only a very small segment, these players are good bettors who often places many bets, they should work well for a site where there's a set fee and your bets are matched up vs other players instead of playing against the house - there's no incentive to not want them as customers.  3) Minors, there are plenty of 16-17 year old's out there who wants to bet.  4) Any player from a market where online sportsbook services aren't available, I.E lot of the US.  5) Any sportsbettor who believes in the value coupling. This goes for myself, I don't bet a lot, but I'd have no reason not to bet on Wagerr when I do place the occasional bet.  6) Wagerr looks like it'll feature daily fantasy sports, people like these products and DFS is a growing market. Just as in #1, a lower fee than competitors and therefore more value added to the prizepool will entice some players.  Wagerr will probably never be a industry leader, speed is a huge factor and an average bet settle time of 60 minutes is too much for many players, but there's a large segment of potential customers who could accept this since they don't have access to any regulated operator. What I'm mostly worried about is the possible huge push back from the industry in the regulated markets. Wagerr.com could get ISP blocked in a lot of countries and it would hurt the accessibility for players a lot.  Lots more stuff to talk about regarding the project, and there are many of your concerns I haven't addressed at all - I'll be trying to join the debate here from now on as much as possible, but it's getting late and it'll have to be another day  Edit: Quoted the wrong member, was supposed to be YodaYoda.  /Curly",False

I have some questions for the development team.   1. Is the network functioning as a decentralised bookie or as a decentralised exchange (Betfair without central authority)?  I presume it is the latter. If so the biggest hurdle to running an exchange is providing liquidity. The network moat or competitive advantage that comes from liquidity is paramount with an exchange (ask anyone who tried and failed to start an exchange). With each additional bettor more value is created for players already using the platform. Thus one needs liquidity and for liquidity market makers are essential.  Who will incentivise market makers to come? They need immaculate APIs to be able to run efficiently. Can this idea support it?  2. If it is working as a traditinal bookie who will be taking the other side of the bet?  Continuation of question 1) If it is the masternode network than the only way this could function is by setting absolutely uncompetitive odds because smart money would pour in only on pricing mistakes thus extracting money out of the system and ignoring the rest. And for average recreational Joe the punter what would be incentive to:  a) register at an unresposive and incredibly slow FIAT/Crypto exchange b) buy BTC at a prremium c) convert BTC to Wagerr at yet another crypto exchange d) deal with unfriendly software to transfer Wagerr  only to lose it at the same odds that he could have lost it by typing in a credit card number with William Hill and betting within seconds or even with his remote control while watching the game live?  3. Where does the marketing come into play?  Is it planned in any way? Without marketing the only guys you would attract are those that have no option to bet otherwise and the smart money. I fear that might be insufficient for a viable project.  4. Deflationary nature of Wagerr?  Economics 101 tells us that in a deflationary environment a tendency to hoard money emerges because of an expectation that it wiil have more value tomorrow. So I could collect some Waggerr and simply increase its value by sitting on the fence while others punt it away. How does that incentivise betting?  5. Live bettting?  Without live betting you are missing out on probably 80% of the revenue pro game. Is your platform able to support live betting, namely almost instantenous settlement of wagers.  6. Authority in live betting suspensions?´  Live betting without someone watching the game with no delays and having the authority to suspend a football match market when a goal is scored, a penalty awarded or a red card flashed becomes a blood bath for those not on the front of an arms race to have the fastest access to the platform. Is that implementable in this model?   7. Decentralised exchange without Wagerr token?  Why would not someone build a decentralilsed betting platform on an existing PoS coin instead of going through ICO if it was lucrative to build such a platform that would incentivise the operators to run the nodes. It is clear why Wagerr does not do it. They want to cash in right now regardless if the project fails.",False

This is taken for granted. Even though fee being on winning bets means the true cost is lower, it does not really mean it is 1% on payout, as that depends on the odds you are playing. Low odds will have fees under 1% of your total payout and higher odds will have higher fees. This would be very good if it applied both to head-to-head and multi-user (twice the fee from head to head). Take into account that existing bookies don't distinguish between these two types of bets, as your stake can be matched entirely by one player, or by as many players as it's necessary (or not every bet entirely matched). By the way, this certainly does not beat the lowest fees in the market, and will have trouble beating highest liquidity as well.  However, what I consider to be a bigger issue about the business model is unlimited chain betting, as the system is proposing an easy way to avoid being banned. As I mentioned before, very few bookies where you bet against the system are sharp enough to be profitable against pro players, and 99% of them avoid them by limiting accounts. Their chain betting model has fees that are too high to compete against industry leaders, but low enough to offer value and create arbitrage opportunities.  In their white paper, they say the following: ""Peerless direct chain betting. Peerless betting does not require a complementary transaction to forge a contract. Any bettor can initiate a contract on chain, which the Wagerr network is programmed to pay out if the bettor wins."". This is a very risky behavior, as tokens will be generated to pay winning players, and believe me that without account limits they will most probably attract many arbitrage bettors and value investors who will make them lose money (big time).  There are still many countries where online gambling is not taxed, so decentralizing the industry will not be a fast procedure. It's true on the other hand that regulation is horrible and will get worse for most people (ask people who use skrill and neteller how they feel about CRS and their money being safe), but in my opinion, it will be more likely to see consolidated and profitable bookies add bitcoin as payment method, and even as currency for betting, either directly or through betting agents, than a project like this or any other existing one being successful.  Anyhow, time will tell us if this project can attract at least a portion of the huge betting industry. Let's hope some day we can see a decentralized bookie worth using, either this one or any other one, as it will be amazing news for so many people who bet on sports for a living.",False

As far as I'm concerned, the biggest value seems to be the oracle masternode, where anyone holding a certain amount of tokens will be able to act as the bookmaker and earn half of the fee that bettors pay (still not sure about the exact requirements for this oracle masternode).  I will try to focus in the main aim of this company, which is to compete against existing sportsbooks, and create an edge for players to move to this platform.  There are two types of bettors, which are mug players and professionals.  The mug players will always need the following requirements for a new sportsbook:  - User friendly, easy to use interface - Welcome bonuses. This is the typical catch that most bookies use (in many cases it means a cost for companies, due to bonus abusers). - PROPAGANDA, and by this I mean mainstream advertising, as all the scam, worldwide known bookmakers do, which makes mugs feel their money is safe playing with them (doesn't really matter if it really is safe, the perception is key here), and they are getting the best deal (usually they are getting the worst deal, but then again, they don't care). This will be expensive, and wagerr will have to compete against billion dollar companies. - Easy to deposit/withdraw money. Here I see the biggest problem, since mugs are not generally used to crypto, and are pretty skeptical (those who are even familiar to this industry). Even more with the volatility of the market. - Feeling of being ""safe"" using the company. This again is related to propaganda, and since cryptocurrencies are not known for good things among general public, I see a very difficult task here to convince people to ""risk"" their money and avoid current easy-to-use options.   The professionals will need the following things:  - LOW JUICE (low fees), and therefore bigger payouts. - LIQUIDITY, which is 100% linked to low juice (see PINNACLE business model) - safe deposits and withdrawals - No limits/bans on winning accounts  As far as I'm concerned, the lowest fees are 2% on head to head betting and 4% on multi-user betting (this does not beat some of the current leading exchange bookmakers such as matchbook (1%), Smarkets (2%). The fee for direct chain betting (I guess this is typical ""bet against the house odds"" system) is 6%, which certainly won't be even close to beating main asian bookmakers, neither in fee nor liquidity. In case wagerr is thinking about implementing a mode where people can bet against the system, this is a huge risk, and here is why. Most bookmakers profit from a large number of mug players, and are not able to compete against professionals. In order to still be profitable companies, what they do is limit winning accounts. If wagerr is planning on decentralized betting, without identity verification and other KYC procedures, they need to be among the very few companies that are profitable against professionals (this would be very expensive, as they would need to hire the best traders and attract the best market makers), otherwise they will be eaten out by value bettors and arbers.  I guess you might think that decentralizing the service is an advantage against current companies, but I will explain you why I think it is not necessarily that way. Mug players are losing players, who don't even care enough to pay attention to this (this is the vast majority of players), and as I mentioned before, they just need to be brainwashed with very expensive propaganda, welcome bonuses and user friendly interface. Professionals currently have access to companies who offer huge limits (impossible to replicate by wagerr under their current terms) and lower fees. They can use reputable and trusted betting agents to access anonymously to many of these companies, and even deposit and withdraw using bitcoin if they want further anonymity.

All coins are ridiculously stupid bubbles. But Wagerr is surely not, at least at this moment.  When it goes live, even 1 Dollar price definitely shouldn't be a bubble.  Because, the way of betting now is totally changed since Wagerr. The more reserved betting capital a bettor has, the more advantage he's in, due to the effect of value-coupling, the burned 1-2% fees to cover up his losses. Hence, bettors would instinctively keep their betting capitals in Wagerr instead of bank.  In this case, even when Wagerr turns into a 30 dollars fat ugly bubble, bettors would still be even happier to rush for it. Because it is simply the best way to bet sports.  The faster Wagerr's rising momentum in price, the better it is for sport betting. For this reason, Wagerr would become the safest coin on Earth with the smallest and shortest dropping curves.  This phenomenon will end only if the next better value-coupling coin appears. Therefore it is utmost important for them to develop their own fiat exchange now to secure their market position. Now they have just suggested their direct multi-coins and fiat wallet and exchange. if they can make it come through, Wagerr would replace paper currencies on Earth.",False

Scammers need to scam because they do not have the intelligence to come up with a fantastic idea that would turn into multi-billion project.  Up to this day, even the Wagerr manifesting idea, plus the works that they have done so far, already worth billion dollars. Is it not a stupid stomach aching joke if they run away from the multi-billion project carrying that little fun lesser than 20 million dollars? Furthermore, their 50,000 dollars capital is definitely not a small pay up for an average IT company.  Let's say, even if their introduced programmers do not exist. With such sufficient capitals, they simply need to hire a truck of programmers from Philippine or India through Feelancer, and that would be much cheaper.",False

This means that, let's say if the 20th round is finished on the 15th of Jun, and if Wagerr is being launched on the 1st of July, its reasonable price should be USD0.0005 X 15(the other 15 days left in Jun) + USD0.1(price at the 20th round) + USD0.005(for the 1st of July itself) = USD0.18  It doesn't matter even if it is launched with 10 billion coin supply, because it is a value-coupling coin(1-2% fee destroyed would go unbelievably fast, because daily global betting volume is too gigantic).  If its coin supply is 10 times of Ethereum which would be 923,661,980, Wagerr's market value should be 1/10 times of Ethereum which should be USD29+-( Ethereum's price now is $ 291.779538), unmentioned their daily volume comparison yet.  Ethereum's up-to-date total daily volume on exchanges is USD$ 649,410,157. The estimated yearly sport betting volume is 3 trillion(http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3040540/Global-sports-gambling-worth-3-trillion.html). If Wagerr is used by 10% of all sport bettors, its daily transaction volume should be USD3,000,000,000,000 divided by 365days divided by 10= USD821,917,808(excluded total daily volume on exchanges yet!!!).  Even if Wagerr is launched at USD1.00, it is still blindly stupidly pathetically insanely motherfuckingly undervalued!  Help! I can't stop giggling at sleep.    Some of my friends asked me: ""what if they scam away the fund?"" Yeah! If I'm a joker Wagerr team member holding 1million Wagerr in hand, I'd surely run or dump the hell out of it before its market price hits USD0.18 !    2018 hosts the most of world sport events.

Just don't.   never is a harsh word...only the sith deal in absolutes...  I've participated in at least 2 ICO's that you could deposit from exchange, maybe even 3 I think TRST you could do that as well...and later on you input your ETH address for the ERC20 tokes.  I agree, good rule of thumb but you need to check the specific ICO because often sending straight from an exchange is easier for people, especially if they don't wish to use MEW and MIST is having synccing issues, and in many cases can save some fees/time.

My biggest remaining question is to do with marketing. As I see it, to use the network and bet you need to hold wagerr tokens. What will drive people to seek out and use wagerr over other services. Even if wagerr does provide a superior service they will need to coax users over; especially when the platform first opens.  Otherwise it will be a ghost town with no one to bet against. I'm worried it might end up like Google Plus; really good technical execution but not enough initial users and advertising.  So I guess my question boils down to how will the development team ensure that there's enough ""punters"" to ensure a viable product from the get go. Is the fact gamblers will always seek out the best returns/odds which wagerr can provide owing to the reduction in compliance and associated costs?  ",False

If I dont pay with ETH, how do the wagerr coins/tokens get delivered to me? I will probably use BTC, ripple or Dash as that is what I have most of. Is it ok to pay via my exchange wallet or do I have to move them off the exchange onto a local wallet first?

Why this discrepancy and which one is right ?  2. In your web site it says that the ICO structure will be 10 rounds of 8.5MM each. In other places it says round 1: 17MM, rounds 2-9: 7.75mm each, round 10: 6mm Same question as before: why this discrepancy and which one is right ?  3. It also says that the system will be deflacionary because of the 50% (or 48% ?) coins destroyed each bet. It doesn't say nothing about creation of new coins, however it says later that the Oracles receives a % of new created blocks. Could you elaborate this ?  Thanks",False

The fees are indeed 50% goes to the Oracles 48% are destroyed and 2% goes into the dev fund that the Oracles govern.  2. The original ico design called for 10 rounds of 8.5mm a piece, but we expanded that total in round one to allow for more people to get into the bonus.  it is indeed 17mm round one then 7.75 from round 2 to 9. and then 6 million in round 10.  3. The economy is deflationary in nature, but for it to be self regulating and self correcting there has to be a base of coins created each year.  In Wagerr's case its 1% inflation a year.  If it sells out that would be 1mm a year. So when under a million coins are destroyed by network fees it would technically be called disinflation, (a reduction in inflation) but once it crosses over that million it would then be deflation.  To get a better handle on the inflation and deflation mechanisms you can check out https://wagerr.com/economics  This has the interactive value calculator to help gain a bit of clarity for the mechanism of increased price = less deflation.  Also we will get those errors fixed asap, thanks for pointing them out!",False

All big betting exchanges incentivize market makers and give them access to an API that allows them to give liquidity to the market which in order creates tighter spreads. Others use the API to implement betting bots, which at the end of the day also bring liquidity. - Do you have deals in place with odds providers for vs. chain betting? - Are you focusing more on US (baseball, basketball, hockey...) or Euro (soccer, horses) markets? - What are the requirements for running a Masternode? Do you have any information available in this aspect? How will the Masternode settle the results of the events (is manual intervention necessary?)?",False

So what you see is the maximum bonus in round one is 9%. That is the bonus if the ICO sells out.  For another example lets say the ICO only sells out through round 5.

Do you know how a sportbook makes money? and why it's profitable?  im gonna go ahead and answer this just for posterity.  sportsbooks make money due to the edge generated by the advantage of paying out a lower number when they lose compared to when they win.  Just a short example. Joe bets 100 bucks, and there is a 5% vig or fee. If Joe wins the sport book lost money they give Joe his 100 back and pay him 95 more dollars totaling 195.  But if Joe loses, the sportbook doesn't win 95, they win 100.  So its all about having equal bets on both sides, or fading the payouts.  My point is that sportsbooks make a ton of money off of this small edge, and if i understand Wagerr correctly, The oracles get half of that bonus and the rest of it is destroyed.  Ultimately what this means is just like a normal sportbook, wagerr will make money over time, but in wagerr's case, half of all the money they make is destroyed.  The math says there will be less coins, not more.  Just my two sats.",False

Wagerr is built and designed to process thousands of bets at a time in a very short window.  If we added bloat and allowed other contracts to need to be queued on the chain it would eventually cause a degraded user experience due to the potential delays in a back log of transactions or unresolved contracts or postings.  By cutting that out and using set terms and Rigid contracts (ASSC) we are able to scale to a much larger degree and ensure that the UX does not suffer.,False

Read msilk's prior post a few back about this, as well as bitdrafter's more recent statistical explanation of how sportsbooks are the real winners over time.  Basically:  You're failing to account for any bettors that take the other side of this ""massive"" win you keep referencing. Both regular bettors as well as other sportsbooks will happily bet directly on chain the other way. While it is not directly against this winner, it is essentially the same thing.  You're also failing to account for thousands of other bets every minute that burn coin.  Over time, no one will bat an eye on any big increase in supply, because it is temporary. The sheer number of participants in the system and demand for WGR, as well as an increased burn level if price drops, all keep things even keeled. And as you already admitted, supply could drop even more tomorrow. It's a matter of when, not if.  This is simply accounting and statistics.  Finally, one last note which is not in the marketing materials, bet limits for Direct Chain betting will be in place initially until Dynamic Odds Balancing is implemented, which incentivizes more bets on the other side in case it is massively one sided.",False

If I bet 1m coins vs the chain and lose they disappear can cause big coin loss and not enough for everyone or if I bet vs the chain and win automatically value goes down. Don't make holding the COINS a GAMBLE as well, keep a set amount. People are going to bet vs the chain on sure win matches and way too much coin will flood the market. It's too dangerous to mint new coins, this is not good for the coin. You want coin value to stay stable. Instead you should choose to spread the coins far and wide so thousands and thousands of people join!  Let people even customize their own odds where people can call also have house odds which can be taken from some source. For house odds bets it is just a pool getting filled first come first serve if noone calls your bet you refunded. For custom bets people can see active bets on teams in the match, like an order book, which they can call or create their own. Example person A bet 100 coins on Team A with certain odds, Person B can fill that order with 40 coins on Team B and person C can add 60 coins on Team B to fulfill the order. If it is not fulfilled how much is goes in. This project will be perfect, smash hit! Please listen developer. I see the value as it continues to grow and grow reaching around $1, just make sure you have enough coins for the whole sports betting world! Maybe keep a lot extra and release with extra demand only maintain around $1 value of the coin. This is going to be amazing but please take this into account dev we have so many connections to help you push this out to the World!",False

Once shapeshift adds the wagerr token for conversions during the ICO then hopefully they will leave the token on their website for conversions out of the wagerr platform as well.

On your bogus ""backed coin"" theory:  Wagerr is distinctly different from a backed coin for good reason. Backed coins require a central authority to hold and manage the assets that back the coin. The blockchain is simply a ledger. But there's a huge downfall to this model — a single point of failure. What you describe is essentially a bank. Some individuals or group hold the keys to ALL the funds backing the platform. Therefore, centralization puts the user’s funds at great risk. Have we not learned our lesson here?  Centralization goes against everything Bitcoin represents and that Satoshi envisioned, and betting is a perfect match. Wagerr is fully decentralized — no risk to funds, no service interruptions, and thanks to Oracles, more reliable results than any centralized solution.  In addition, Wagerr builds in a deflationary fee engine that drives its value. With Direct On Chain betting, Dynamic Odds Balancing encourages a balanced book. Limits are in place until the model is proven as well and the userbase matures. All of which reduce volatility. A large bet against the network could just as well lose, which benefits ALL holders of WGR. There could also be bets on the other side that would balance a big win. And thanks to 6% bet fee, over time, the network (the House) wins. Statistics, bro. It’s not a matter of if, but when.   Backed coin platforms are the SCAM here. Why would one trust an anonymous stranger with hard earned funds? Are you behind one of these SCAMS?",False

Most of the world cannot bet safely.  For the average Joe in your situation, though, Wagerr still offers some nice incentives — lower fees, set your own line, privacy, 100% uptime, and peace of mind security of funds, along with strong potential for their funds to grow in value because WGR is a deflationary asset.  Also someone mentioned worldwide liquidity. Say you're into something rather obscure, a contract could be developed for it if the Oracle network agrees to add the league. And when Direct on Chain betting is implemented, you won't even need to find a peer to take the other side because the network will happily take it.",False

Let me explain further below:  ""If Round 1 is not fully funded by the end of the ICO, the ICO will extend or restart. If Round 10 successfully completes on or before June 14, the ICO will expand to maximize distribution and capitalization for development.. The ICO will extend by no more than 10 Rounds.""  I understand your concern, and the solution is built into the contingency plan, but isn’t spelled out clearly. So let me state it clearly here:  The bonus of 1% per round shown in the previous rounds would continue to apply to earlier investors. So, currently, the chart shows that Round 1 participants could win a maximum of 9% if all 10 rounds of ICO coins are completely bought.  In reality, if we extend as far as 20, and all rounds are completely bought, the Round 1 buyers could gain a maximum 19% bonus.  And it's not just the bonuses that reward early adopters. Early completion of the first 10 rounds would imply overwhelming interest. Extending the sale (and the number of coins) potentially doubles the number of investors and involved parties. People who become users of the Wagerr system are the drivers of value. It goes back to the value coupling mechanisms. The more bets that are placed, the more valuable Wagerr becomes because a portion of every fee gets burned.The deflationary economy is accelerated by mass participation. A successful ICO jumpstarts the user base by populating the Wagerr economy.  Theres another crucial rationale to extend in the event the first ten rounds complete so early: decentralization of the network is the foundation of network security. Doubling the maximum amount of coins would vastly increase distribution and thereby protect the network. The Oracle Masternodes are consensus agents, which collectively feed sporting events outcomes to the network, and wide initial distribution in combination with the supermajority consensus requirement gives Wagerr investors and users peace of mind.  If it turns out that extending the rounds would block our success, we would be open to reconsidering.  We designed the ICO to be fair and we intend to make the ICO successful, so please consider our reasoning and let us know what you think.",False

However, to be honest, this is the most confusing ICO distribution I have ever seen and probably ever will.  I think there should be a more simple way of running the ICO to eliminate confusion when it starts.  The way it currently is means, that it can go up to 20 rounds and possibly more than 200 million tokens with the bonuses.  There should always be a definitive ending, either by hitting the date or selling out before than but not both.  This is like someone running a marathon and if they get there to fast, you tell them, ""sorry one more lap to go"" and when they get there again too fast, you tell them again, ""sorry, one more lap"" and so on.  I know you're trying to make this ICO creative but I think you should reconsider this.  Not sure if anyone else agrees but this is my honest opinion.  I like this project but I think more people would invest if you just made it more simplex.  Good luck.",False

The bonuses are part of the 4% allocation — not additional coins. Assuming 100 mil coins, 4% is 4 mil.  - We must reserve the right to expand the amount offered in order to protect the interest of all investors. We don't want a handful of whales controlling the majority of coin. The more distributed it is, the more chance of success. The only way this can work is if it is fully decentralized.  - More funding means we can go crazy with marketing and development.  - Most ICOs are structured to reward only the early investors.

Here are some reasons bettors might choose Wagerr:  Since betting is prohibited in some regions, bettors don't want their assets confiscated by governments or crooked bookkeepers. Wagerr provides a better alternative:  Wagerr payouts are reliable and fair.  Wagerr is secure, safe and distributed. Because it's a distributed network, no government can shut it down or block betting activity.   There are several reasons Wagerr needs to charge fees:  The Oracle Masternodes that secure the network and function as consensus agents do crucial work that makes the system function safely and reliably. The fees compensate the Oracle operators for their work of forging contracts, retrieving sporting event outcomes, and consensually validating the outcomes that trigger payouts. The fees function as a crucial incentive to maintain the system.  Just like traditional bookkeepers, the Wagerr network takes risk whenever it takes a bet on the blockchain because the network has to pay out all winning bets. The fees partially offset the risk. And while the blockchain doesn't really care if it has to pay out the winners, everyone who holds Wagerr tokens cares a lot. The fees offset the risk to the value of the WGR token.  Since about half the fees are burned (48%), the Wagerr economy and the people who hold WGR tokens are also protected from dramatic changes in the WGR token's value. Systematic proportional destruction of WGR tokens keeps a check on the coin supply, stabilizing or even improving the price of Wagerr. And that's important because when people bet on Wagerr, they want to get a payout that has at least the fiat value they expect. If the Wagerr economy were not self-regulating, bettors would be taking much greater risks. The way we've designed Wagerr, however, actually opens up new opportunities for bettors to profit.",False

Increased usage simply meant it was dumped for fiat, and additionally there was (and still is) so much produced from mining. But now more commerce is done BTC to BTC instead of BTC to fiat, and demand from new fiat is booming.  Essentially, acceptance doesn't equal adoption.  Many different things have been tried, Proof of Stake and Masternodes being big steps in this direction. Wagerr combines these advancements with a deflationary usage mechanism in a way that accomplishes the usage-price link effectively.    How do you resolve real world events on the blockchain in fully decentralized way?  It's a really significant problem which a lot of teams like Gnosis, Ethereum are trying to solve.  It's largely based on Ethereum Oracles.  At a high level:  1. Sporting event results are gathered by individual Oracle Masternodes. 2. A majority of data sources must match, and a super majority of Oracles must achieve consensus. 3. The consensus data is then used by the network to pay out contracts with bets that match the posted event conditions.  The biggest differentiator of Wagerr from Gnosis and others is that bets are not prediction markets, they are just rigid, immutable contracts. This makes it secure, scalable, and accessible.",False

The ICO runs June 1st-June 25th.  Wagerr taps into the massive worldwide sports betting market by offering a better, more secure way to bet. Smart blockchain technology forges betting contracts, validates sporting event outcomes, and automates payouts.  The Wagerr system is decentralized and self regulating. These qualities allow Wagerr to deliver secure, private, and safe sports betting to the entire world.  No more worries about changing regulations or crooked bookmakers. Say goodbye to risk and regulation, and say hello to Wagerr, an asset optimized to grow in value as the Wagerr economy absorbs pent up demand for secure, trustless betting.  Since the Wagerr system is significantly superior to traditional sportsbooks, we expect broad adoption. And through a mechanism called “Value Coupling,” betting activity over the Wagerr network is a deflationary engine that drives the value of the Wagerr token.  Here's how value coupling links usage of the Wagerr network to the price of the Wagerr coin:  Y’know how they say, “The House always wins?” That’s because bookkeepers bet on a sure thing: fees. Wagerr charges a modest fee for the service, just like traditional bookkeepers. But unlike mainstream bookkeepers, the Wagerr blockchain actually destroys about half of every fee. Since this reduces the coin supply, increased adoption of Wagerr as the sports betting blockchain gradually drives up the market value of Wagerr. What's good for bettors is great for investors; it's a simple matter of supply and demand.  Thanks to Value Coupling, anyone who holds Wagerr potentially benefits from this “house advantage,” because burning fees is the mechanism which drives a deflationary economy — meaning that the Wagerr token grows in purchasing power over time.  Larger scale investors have an additional opportunity to earn returns by operating Oracle Masternodes, which function as consensus agents — forging all betting contracts and retrieving sporting event outcomes. Oracles not only collect fees for this work, but also win fixed periodic block rewards. What’s more, the Wagerr tokens earned can increase in value as the Wagerr economy grows. If you’ve lived in the digital currency space, you’ve seen a lot of ICOs. But Wagerr is a game changer, both for sports betting and for digital currency.  Early supporter bonuses begin May 25. Don’t miss out! Register for Wagerr ICO updates on wagerr.com to stay informed and get ready. You’ll also find more Wagerr news and info, including the development roadmap.  Keep an eye on the Wagerr bitcointalk.org ICO announcement thread wagerr.com/ANN for promotional opportunities to win free Wagerr and bet on sporting events. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1911583.0  Be sure to check out Wagerr’s first two video presentations at https://vimeo.com/wagerr • “What is Wagerr?” gives an introductory overview of how betting with Wagerr compares to traditional sports betting. • “Value Coupling” explains Wagerr’s compelling economic model in greater depth.

The first and main effect is gradual reduction of the coin supply over time. The reduction of the coin supply is accelerated as bettors adopt Wagerr as their platform of choice for sports betting, because more betting means more fees. And more fees means more coins are burned. The second effect is more subtle. Destroying fees protects the price of Wagerr for the user by self-adjusting. When the exchange price of WGR declines, a $100 USD (for instance) actually requires the user to bet more WGR coins than if the price is high. The size of the fee (and therefore the number of coins burned) rises proportionally to the decline in the price of WGR. The effect, over time, is to automatically rebalance supply and demand.  48% of the betting service fee is destroyed. 50% goes to the Oracle Masternode network. The remaining 2% goes to a fund dedicated for Wagerr development.",False

We do not believe that BaaS (blockchain as a service) is viable here, given the disruptive potential and all the hurdles to operating such a centralized platform.  The goal is to start with peer to peer matching, but in the end most bets will likely be backed by the chain directly (just as large sportsbooks are backed directly by the corporation managing the bets).  After the delivery of this system, Wagerr developers recognize the importance of partnering with an MSB, or launching a new one (something like kraken, for instance), to facilitate the interchange of currencies — from fiat to digital currencies and back. This service will make it easy for people, including those new to digital currency, to adopt Wagerr as their primary platform for placing bets.  Note that Wagerr Ltd. will not have a monopoly on this type of service; any of the others major providers will be able to do this as well. However, the Wagerr team wants to ensure that such a service is smoothly integrated into the system.  As for other companies using the Wagerr sport betting blockchain as a service, we are confident that a significant portion of bet volume will be generated from other Sportbooks balancing their books through arbitrage betting.",False

Wagerr does not have a lottery system and is designed exclusively for betting on real world sporting events.  Wagerr incentivized the Oracle Masternode network to retrieve, validate, and post the outcomes of real events so that when users bet on the outcome of those events, the blockchain automatically pays the winners.  Wagerr is purely a decentralized sportsbook. The specificity of the functions built into the technology, in combination with the second tier network of Oracle Masternodes handling the workload, mean that the system scales efficiently and performs robustly and securely.  As adoption of Wagerr grows, the network can handle large amounts of bets daily. And since a portion of each fee for the sportsbook service gets burned, usage drives up the value of the coin Wagerr token.  People who enjoy random number betting may enjoy vDice. If there is any mechanism that gives any predictable value to the vDice token, the mechanism hasn't been made clear.  Wagerr's deflationary economy, however, is crucial to the system's utility because the trajectory of the price supports that the fiat value of the winning bets over time, making blockchain based betting even more competitive with traditional sportsbooks.",False

An asset for investors who like their odds   Traditional sports betting in many locales is driven underground, leading to corruption, unfairness, and violence. Estimated at $400 billion worldwide, this untapped market offers an incredible opportunity to develop a safe, decentralized, and accessible blockchain alternative. If you’re an investor, speculator, or trader, Wagerr’s model is seriously compelling.  Wagerr (WGR) taps into a vast worldwide sports betting market. Say goodbye to risk and regulation and hello to an asset optimized to grow in value as Wagerr absorbs the pent up demand for secure, self-regulated betting.  However, capturing even a fraction of demand from this market is great, but only goes so far. Transient usage could be a major problem, as bettors generally convert BTC and fiat to WGR only when they want to bet, and back to fiat if they win, leading to a lot of market volatility during major betting events and from large bettors. So why would someone want to hold WGR?    Value Coupling: You can bet on Wagerr   The Wagerr network reduces the risk to value and protects holders of WGR tokens by linking betting volume to coin supply. This “Value Coupling” between usage and supply is a built-in deflationary mechanism that destroys 48% of the fee from every bet. With fees of 2%-6%, the net result is nearly 1-3% of every bet permanently removed from the network.  For example, if price falls dramatically, significantly more outstanding supply is destroyed with every bet, because bets now require more WGR. Conversely, if price rises dramatically, significantly less supply is destroyed. Over time, this leads to less price volatility and an asset value that more accurately reflects both adoption and usage.  Wagerr’s systematic destruction of fees thus creates supply scarcity over time. As the average volume of betting activity over the Wagerr network rises, the value of Wagerr rises with it, enabling all investors to participate in its strong growth potential simply by holding Wagerr.  Watch the video on Value Coupling to see how it works!    Oracle Masternodes: Be the house   For large scale investors, Wagerr’s Oracle Masternodes offer an exciting source of ongoing income. Like Dash Masternodes, Oracles win a portion of the block rewards. (Staking wallets win the remainder.) But that’s just the “icing on the cake” compared to the betting fees Oracles earn. That’s because 50% of all betting fees are paid to the processing Oracle, making them increasingly valuable as betting activity grows. They earn these fees for the intensive work of gathering and validating real world event data and forging contracts.    A better way to bet   Wagerr offers a superior alternative to the existing morass of regulated and underground markets. Wagerr is universally accessible, secure, and safe. By contrast, betting with traditional bookkeepers leaves your capital vulnerable to theft by untrustworthy parties, confiscation by shifting government regulation, and loss due to corporate bankruptcy.  At its most basic, sports betting is fun. It’s an enduring and extremely popular form of entertainment. The demonization, criminalization, and regulation of sports betting have only driven the practice underground, making it far more risky and dangerous, in a cruel self-fulfilling prophecy. Wagerr interrupts that cycle and safely puts the pleasure back into sports betting. Wagerr all you want: it’s your money.    A blockchain for sports bettors   If you enjoy sports betting, Wagerr is custom built for you. For a low fee, you can place your bet in secure escrow and, if you are on the winning side of the bet, get an automatic payout after the event. You can depend on the Wager network to confirm real world gaming results accurately because of strict enforcement of the requirements for Oracle Masternodes participation. The penalties for Oracles that attempt to feed bad data to the network are prohibitive. Supermajority consensus among the Oracle Masternode network is required in order to post game results on the blockchain, making results extraordinarily robust.   There's no risk of overleveraged betting because you can't bet more than you have. No loan sharks, no 5-0, no worries about your assets. Bet with Wagerr; your kneecaps will thank you.    Take back the house   You know what they say: “The house always wins.” Bookkeepers profit from the sure thing — fees. Wagerr not only cuts fees significantly, but enables anyone to own a piece of the house. Oracle Masternode operators become a low cost “distributed house,” earning fees when users bet. But the value proposition for Oracle operators gets better in two ways:  Oracle Masternodes win block rewards for their role as consensus agents, retrieving sporting event outcomes and collectively validating them. Since nearly half the fees are destroyed, the value of the WGR token is structurally inclined to grow over time.   You don’t have to operate an Oracle to win with Wagerr. Anyone who holds WGR can earn block rewards by operating a regular staking wallet. Bettors save with less spent on fees. And when bettors win, they may not even have to put their winnings in a wallet to win with Wagerr — if betting volume increases substantially, that could be enough to drive up the price of Wagerr through the two simultaneous mechanisms: increasing demand and increasing net fee destruction.    Profits you can feel good about   Wagerr is a carefully incentivized economy. We don’t give away money for nothing. Wagerr rewards work to secure the network, escrow bets, retrieve and validate sporting events, and make accurate payouts. The fee structure incentivizes adoption of Wagerr as the betting platform of choice. And even though investors can win big like the traditional house, you don’t have to act like a thug or a criminal to reap the rewards. Wagerr frees users from fear, risk, material harm, and exploitation and brings pure fun back to sports betting.    Good for digital currency   Wagerr has developed an economy, not just a currency. Innovative blockchain technology lays a crucial foundation to a successful cryptocurrency, but few coins see sustainable value growth and economic stability. Even Bitcoin, the king of digital currency has fluctuated violently between $200 to $2000 in the last year.  Wagerr's focus on sports betting gives it an unbeatable edge over competition:   Known as Application Specific Smart Contracts (ASSC), Wagerr's Smart Blockchain creates an optimized business model inspired by current open ended smart contracts — by pairing them with a single, reliable, rigid function. Smart contracts may be all the rage, but implementations that try to do everything risk disaster. Wagerr sticks to its knitting, doing one thing well: sports betting.    Attractive for arbitrage   Wagerr offers a better solution to a problem traditional sportsbooks commonly face. Frequently, mainstream sportsbooks find that they have taken on too much payout liability when their customers’ bets are unbalanced, strongly favoring on one side. If the overweighted team wins, the sportsbook has to pay out big time. They typically manage this liability by placing their own bets on the underweighted side — with competing sportsbooks.  Although Wagerr's low fees, automated payouts, and strong security against manipulation make it a competitor to traditional sportsbooks, the blockchain also offers a potent arbitrage solution at a competitive price.    Wagerr is a win   When you add it all up, here’s what you get. A blockchain that makes sports betting safe, secure, and potentially more profitable — for a $400 billion/year untapped industry. A deflationary coin whose value is tied to capturing market share of that $400 billion/year industry. A coin that lets Oracle Masternode operators profit, first from providing network security and betting service, and second from a deflationary economy. A coin in which its value is driven up by the scale of betting activity. A coin that gives everyday holders a chance to capitalize on the value growth of Wagerr by staking coins in the easy-to-use HTML5 wallet to win regular awards, or simply by holding on to Wagerr. As betting volume and coin value grows, everyone wins.  If the Wagerr sports betting blockchain captures even 0.25% of the global market — just the illegal market — we’re looking at one billion Dollars worth of betting activity. The corresponding fees destroyed would cut the total coin supply in half in one year. (Estimate assumes the price of WGR holds constant at the ICO price.)   So, we’re feeling pretty good about things. If we were the betting types, we’d be going all in. But since we’re mainly digital currency developer types and business developers, well, nevermind, we’re going all in anyhow because we absolutely believe in the project.  The future of betting is accessible, fair, and safe. Betting belongs on the blockchain, and that blockchain is Wagerr.",False

Glad you liked the concept and video presentation.  Wagerr is not a traditional betting platform in which the team acts as the house and the blockchain just mediates the transaction. Instead, Wagerr is a fully decentralized betting blockchain that manages betting contracts through  decentralized technology.  Because of the current global regulatory environment, a decentralized betting solution maximizes user accessibility.  At the root of the development of digital currency has always been an aspiration to get away from centralized governments and banks, their corruption and exploitation, and to distribute utility which users could assign their own value.  The bottom line is: Wagerr is trying to get away from centralized platforms by creating a digital currency blockchain that functions as a REAL decentralized solution.",False
