I just read the white paper - yes, I know, I should have done this before - and I have some questions concerning the following part of the document: ""The modum.io solution is offered in an easy “pay-per-shipment” model. It has been shown in the market studies and pilots that customers would pay up to 10 USD per shipment.""  My questions are: 1. What do they mean by ""10 USD per shipment"" ? Would it be 10 USD per logger used for the shipment ? Would it be 10 USD no matter how many loggers used in the shipment ? Other ? 2. Does anyone have any idea on the maximum volume that one logger can monitor ? 3. Does anyone have any idea/estimation for the cost of producing a single logger ?  And then, last but not least, I haven't been able to find answers to the following questions (but I admit that I didn't search a lot about it): 4. What do they mean by ""profit"" ? I guess it is earnings after taxes right ? 5. What proportion of these ""profits"" will be redistributed ? Is it at the board's full discretion or is there some sort of ""promised %"" of it ?  Many thanks in advance for your answers and thoughts ! With these answers I could definitely make some realistic valuations.  Cheers,",False

As the year progresses and momentum continues to build, we are so pleased to have such a strong and growing community (10,000 Twitter followers this week!) to share our progress with. In this update, I will provide you with some insights on our growth and how we are finding a good balance between executing projects, building and continuous improvement of our product, rigorous annual planning, onboarding new employees, developing new partnerships, and recruiting new talent.  Business Development & Partnerships  Trusted IoT Alliance workshop Good progress with all pilot projects Commitments from industry leaders     Our leadership team has been working closely with partners and collaborators to progress existing projects and close new customers in preparation for our approaching market entry.  Last week, COO Stefan Weber and the IoT team attended the Trusted IoT Alliance’s first European meeting in Berlin to discuss the latest innovations and challenges of IoT and blockchain integration alongside other leading blockchain companies, manufacturers, and Telecom providers. Our membership in the Alliance allows us to further our overlapping goals: strengthening the blockchain ecosystem, building new connections within it, and establishing standardisation.  Over the past month, we have spent significant time on site with partners to continue to integrate our solution into their regular operations. I am happy to report that our current pilot projects are all running smoothly and we have gained commitments from new partners to begin additional pilots. These projects have enabled us to open discussions with leaders in all of our targeted sectors. We are now in pilot and integration discussions with top-level committees at major players in ERP, big pharma manufacturers, pre-wholesalers and logistics companies. The team is determined to build modum’s reputation as a trusted business partner by giving their full commitment to this process. To support our clients who are building their competitive advantage by integrating our solution, we will only announce partnerships when it benefits our clients.  Product Development  Defining test and validation plans Establishing a pharma-grade Quality Management System Sensor production on track    Apart from commissioning and testing the prototypes now available, our development team has spent much of January working on firmware development, optimization, and testing. In addition to the ongoing evaluation of a second blockchain to integrate in our first product, the focus is on the implementation of core features and selected new features, according to the user requirement specifications being finalized.  These user requirements are also crucial input for our quality team who are currently creating test and validation plans. This newly assembled team is making excellent progress deploying our company-wide Quality Management System and integrating it in our development and testing procedures.  Meanwhile, our hardware team is eagerly awaiting the tools necessary for automated inspection and testing of each device during mass production. Their plan is to run a first test for the automated and secure commissioning of the loggers in February.  Organization  Efficient onboarding of new team members Defining a process-driven organisation Recruiting new key roles    Modum.io continues to grow the team at all levels. Our team has already grown by 100% since I joined in October. I am happy to see all of our new team members making an immediate impact, accelerating the work that modum.io is doing.  Currently, the entire team is focused on developing modum.io as a process-driven organization with well-defined roles that have clear responsibilities. This development is essential for product and business development but also for building and distributing our products and running our organization.  We are still working actively to fill a number of new roles. Leadership roles, such as a CMO, will strengthen our business development and bring valuable industry knowledge, particularly in logistics and pharma, in house. Junior roles will build our capacity to execute and deliver quickly and effectively. Please visit our careers page to see our newly opened positions. We look forward to receiving your application if your profile matches any of our open positions, and appreciate everyone sharing these job descriptions with their network.  Events  Great feedback from CES SAP Forum March 6 Blockchain Summit Belgium March 13    CES 2018 was an exciting way for modum.io to start the year. Hosted at the Nordic Semiconductor booth, the modum temperature logger was well represented in Las Vegas. According to customer tracking done by eyeQ, approximately 1500 people engaged with the modum sensor display over a few short days.  In Q1, we will continue to present at industry events that focus on modum’s first use case in the pharma supply chain and educating industry leaders on blockchain’s potential. For example, we will present at the SAP Forum in Basel to 2400 visitors, 475 companies, and 53 SAP partners on March 6th. We will also speak at several other events including Blockchain Summit Belgium, BVL Cologne, and Schweizer Aktien in Zurich. We will also be present at The Things Network Conference in Amsterdam, the Temperature Controlled Logistics conference in London and the Embedded World conference in Nuremberg. We look forward to seeing everyone there!  MOD Token  New, Up-and-Coming Exchange Listing Exceptional Community Growth    We are continuing to explore new listing options for the benefit of the MOD Token and its holders. This summer, modum.io is scheduled to be listed on a brand-new exchange from Singapore called Nebula. We are also currently in discussion with a new Swiss exchange listing. We look forward to releasing more details as the platforms launch.  The entire team is grateful for the energy and engagement from the MOD Token holder community. Each of us enjoys following the lively discussion on our channels and seeing direct feedback from the community. The time you take to promote our project and excite new token holders drives interest in modum.io. This week we reached 10,000 followers on twitter and 5,000 on Reddit. We have no doubt that as our following continues to grow, it will contribute to our future commercial success.  As always, our entire team is working incredibly hard toward the next of our milestones. These efforts have made for a great month of January and for great prospects for the rest of the year. Thank you again for your ongoing support, it helps us to keep our momentum going strong.  –Simon Dössegger  January 30, 2018  (Photo Description: Sample casings of the modum temperature logger.

For the pilots, modum.io used an off-the-shelf temperature logging device, the TI sensor tag, and developed its own custom firmware to interface with the modum system.   Pilot 1.0 The first pilot was conducted in Switzerland in 2016, monitoring shipments from a SME pharma producer to a wholesaler. Over six weeks, several temperature loggers recorded 10,000 data points and were able to successfully track the temperature of most shipments. The collected feedback indicated necessary improvements in the following areas: 1. Connectivity of the temperature logger with the mobile application should be quicker. 2. Data transfer speed should be improved. 3. A dashboard for data analysis should be created. The main advantages for SME pharma producers to use the modum system is the wider choice to find a suitable logistic partner and ensure compliance on a shipment level.   Pilot 2.0 In its second pilot, modum.io monitored shipments between a wholesaler and several clinics and pharmacies whereby shipment volumes were scaled up by one order of magnitude. For this pilot, the temperature logger’s connectivity and data transfer speed were improved and a dashboard for quality assurance and customer service departments of the wholesalers was introduced and tested. To improve the the responsiveness of the read-out process of temperature data was an important learning from pilot 2.0. Additionally, modum.io monitored a cross-border shipment to validate the technology internationally and between continents.   Paid Pilot 3.0 with 3PL & mail-order pharmacy A key takeaway from earlier pilots and the market studies was that a direct integration in the processes of a third-party logistics provider already serving high shipping volumes would greatly help modum.io scale because pick-up and hand-over would be handled by the same company. By using a third-party logistics provider, the shipment process remains the same for the sender: insert the loggers into the respective shipment and transfer the shipment to the 3PL provider. Prior to delivery to the pharmacy or hospital, the 3PL driver will use their proprietary scanning device to check compliance. He can then either release the shipment to the owner, or take corrective and preventive actions in case of any deviations.   During the third, paid pilot with the parcel-service market leader in Switzerland, modum.io aimed to prove the suitability for mass use of the modum system. Two phases were conducted: in the first phase, modum implemented and stabilized customer processes; in the second phase, modum.io quantified additional efforts and the duration of the temperature data read-out process. The customer’s objective for this pilot was to achieve 95% of all readouts within 30 seconds. modum.io managed an average readout of only eight seconds for 100% of the shipments. In the pilot wrap-up meeting, suitability of the modum system for mass use was confirmed and the client recommended integration of the modum system into the offering of the 3PL.   Business & Pricing Strategy By using the modum system, depending on market segment and volume, costs per shipment can be reduced by up to 60%. With respect to the 200 million shipments of pharmaceutical products in the EU, a widespread adoption of the modum system or competing services has the potential to reduce industry-wide expenses by approximately 3 billion USD.   The modum.io solution is offered in an easy “pay-per-shipment” model. It has been shown in the market studies and pilots that customers would pay up to 10 USD per shipment. When compared with the use of environmentally-controlled transport solutions, the modum system still significantly reduces overall shipping costs plus further cost reductions if the potential for automation, that comes with the modum system, is taken into account.   Current status Currently, the modum system is being integrated into the system of the leading last-mile logistics service provider in Switzerland. modum.io is planning to finalize this integration in Q4/2017, using the first series of proprietary temperature loggers. Clients from the wholesaler and mailorder pharmacy segment are lined up. Upon successful completion, official market entry in Switzerland will begin in Q1/2018. Once integration has been established within our first client site, the logistics service provider can approach the SME pharma segment to offer the additional service.   Furthermore, modum.io is in contact with significant customers from within the pharma distribution vertical in the UK, France, Germany, Turkey, and Vietnam.",False

Upon receipt, this smart contract will allow receivers to check that regulations have been met. The evaluation criteria (in this case temperature ranges), cannot be changed retroactively. During the shipment, the temperature is monitored, whereby the data is stored in the internal flash memory of the logger. Using BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) the shipment does not need to be opened in order to perform the checks. At each change of ownership, data authenticity is certified by the smart contract. The results of the evaluation are immutably stored in a blockchain as a proof-of-existence. Depending on the outcome, the receiver and sender are notified immediately, allowing them to release the product or arrange further corrective and preventative actions. Customers do not need to install additional hardware to use the system, downloading a mobile application is sufficient.   For the customer, the modum system provides: 1. A passive solution that includes a monitoring service with no special packaging required, without the need for expensive, active-temperature controlled logistic services. 2. The proof required by GDP regulations that medical products have not been compromised on shipment level.",False

From a risk-perspective, social and technical uncertainties of blockchain infrastructures (governance, scalability, interoperability), make blockchain agnosticism an essential foundation of modum’s business strategy in order to be able to provide the best infrastructure to every customer.",False

The distribution is conducted using the first in first out principle. All contributions are consolidated into one list. The timestamp per block is used to define the conversion rate to USD, which is then used to define the conversion rate to MOD tokens. One contribution might be in multiple bonus tiers. This process is supervised by our advisor Lykke Corp. The released tokens are used for our advisors, many helping hands in the making of this tokensale and the bug bounty program.   Milestone 2 – expected earliest Q1/2018: Objective is to ensure the go-to-market of our first product line including the mass production of our dedicated sensor device and the product ecosystem (application, validation & qualification). At least two environmental sensors are integrated into the hardware platform (temperature and motion) and besides Ethereum at least one of the following blockchains: IOTA, NEO, Fabric, ETC or Rootstock, is supported as blockchain back-end. 3 million tokens are upon positive voting released to a wallet controlled by modum.io.   Milestone 3 – expected earliest Q1/2019: Objective is to deliver the next sensor generation with real-time interaction (via current or emerging network technologies, like LoRaWAN). At least one additional environmental sensor is integrated (light or humidity) and any two additional blockchain back-ends of the following: IOTA, NEO, Fabric, ETC, Rootstock, Waves, Tezos, EOS or Cosmos, are supported. 3 million tokens are upon positive voting released to a wallet controlled by modum.io.   Milestone 4 – expected earliest Q1/2020: Objective is to deliver the next sensor generation with a real-time, on-chip blockchain node. An additional environmental sensors (e.g. light or humidity) is integrated and the complete modum software is delivered in a fully decentralized architecture. 3 million tokens are upon positive voting released to a wallet controlled by modum.io.",False

Our go-to-market strategy is regulatory driven, based on new requirements placed on the pharma industry. We are already working with industry partners and clients to deliver the modum system.   How was modum.io’s first business case developed? The European Commission has recently released tightened regulatory requirements for the transport of medicinal products for human use. modum.io’s first service offers an efficient system to comply with these regulatory requirements.   What are these regulatory changes? Chapter nine of the Good Distribution Practice regulation (GDP 2013/C 343/01) now requires proof that shipped medicinal products have not been exposed to conditions (particularly temperature) that may have compromised their quality.   How does modum.io solve improve its clients’ ability to be compliant with GDP regulations To date, pharmaceutical companies achieve compliance with regulatory requirements by using expensive, temperature-stabilized trucks and containers from third-party logistics providers (3PLs). modum.io offers a more efficient supply-chain solution, which enables companies to prove compliance with GDP regulations by using blockchain and Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology.   What is the business potential of the modum solution? By using the modum system, costs per shipment can be reduced by up to 60%. With respect to the 200 million shipments of pharmaceutical products in the EU, a widespread adoption of the modum system has the potential to reduce industry-wide expenses of approximately 3 billion EUR annually.   What is modum.io’s go-to market strategy? Currently, the modum system is being integrated into the system of the leading last-mile logistics service provider in Switzerland. modum.io is planning to finalize this integration in Q4/2017. Upon successful completion, official market entry will begin in Q1/2018. Additionally, modum.io is in negotiations with significant customers from within the pharma distribution vertical in the UK, France, Germany, Turkey, and Vietnam.   What is modum.io’s vision for growing its platform for expanded service delivery? modum.io, with its system and first business case, eagerly anticipates horizontal and vertical growth by evolving the developed system. Low-cost and low-power IoT sensors have become commonplace for:      Temperature      Humidity/moisture      Light/machine vision      Acceleration/tilt      Acoustics/sound/vibration      Position/proximity      Motion/velocity/displacement      Chemical/gas      Flow (Liquid)      Electric/magnetic      Force/load/torque/strain/pressure Modum.io foresees adding sensor devices with these capabilities to build a platform for IoT monitoring in supply chain across a variety of sectors.   Into which sectors could the modum system be expanded? With the experience gained from the high standards and low-cost requirements set by the pharma industry, the modum system will be well positioned to be deployed in other sectors. modum.io has been approached by leading companies from the following sectors, each of which have overlapping needs with the solutions laid out in our first use case:        Healthcare      modum.io has been approached by Healthcare institutions to improve their processes (internal and multi-stakeholder) using IoT and blockchain technology.        Chemical industry      Customers from the chemical industry have similar needs to pharma customers, requiring compliance with similar regulations. Data integrity is an issue, causing customers from the chemical industry to perform more extensive post-delivery checks           on their chemicals than they would deem necessary.        Heavy machinery      Machine building companies need accountability during transport of their high-value components, requiring traceable data for acceleration (shock) and humidity (storage and transport conditions).        Automotive, Aerospace and Aviation      The automotive, aerospace, and aviation industry needs efficient and auditable systems to prove the authenticity of every single component. Constant performance checks of essential parts serve to reduce liabilities in case of accidents.        Food sector      Pharma standards and regulations for food safety are closely related, in the United States they are supervised by the same government agency, the FDA. Customers from the food sector are additionally looking into improving their processes,      providing traceable data in order to market the origin and the quality of their products.   What are the USP/functions of the modum system? Before shipment occurs, the modum sensor device ID, shipment ID, and alarm criteria are fixed within a shipment-specific smart contract. Upon receipt, this smart contract will allow the receiver to check that regulations have been met. Due to the nature of a smart contract in the blockchain, the evaluation criteria for meeting regulations cannot be changed retroactively. During the shipment, the change of environmental conditions (i.e. temperature, humidity, movement, etc.), is monitored and the data is stored in the internal flash memory of the sensor device. Using BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), the shipment does not need to be opened to verify the shipment has complied with the environmental parameters set. At each change of ownership, data authenticity is first checked by the smart contract before it is evaluating the data. The results of the evaluation are then stored, immutably, as proof-of-existence in a blockchain.   Do customers need to install additional hardware? No, customers do not need to install additional hardware to use the system, downloading our mobile application is sufficient. The modum system is also compatible with every other BLE device.   How does modum.io generate revenue? modum.io will offer its solution in a “pay per shipment” model to pharma producers and wholesaler. During modum.io’s extensive proof-of-concept phase, pilot projects with several customers determined that the modum solution delivered the highest value as a service in last-mile logistics of an overall pharma supply chain. In the EU, more than 200 million of these last-mile shipments occur each year.   Does modum.io have any strategic Partnerships? Yes, modum.io has several partnerships. We are working with the market leader in parcel services in Switzerland, the owner of Europe’s leading mail order pharmacy, two leading pharma wholesaler and the University of Zurich and the University of St. Gallen.",False

However, mail-order pharmacies now open up a third stage skipping the pharmacy and are directly delivering to the patient.  Our third pilot involved working together with a third party logistics provider and a mail order pharmacy, integrating our system into their last mile logistics, including end-user delivery.  We chose the pharma industry as our first business case because this sector requires highly automated and cost-effective logistics solutions, which guarantee data integrity. As the pharma industry has one of the highest standards for product safety, security, and stability, it is the ideal candidate to act as a “blockchain-enabler”; having successfully proven a viable blockchain solution with the highest requirements, scaling into other verticals is feasible.",False

We are very happy to be able to announce the start of a long-term strategic collaboration with IOTA!  The start of this will be the integration of IOTA tokens as a participation possibility in the MOD token sale.  On Wednesday, August 23 modum.io and IOTA will host an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on the IOTA subreddit(https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/).  We look forward to fielding any and all questions regarding this exciting, new partnership and how the IOTA token can be used in the MOD token sale.      modum.io CEO, Malik El Bay, explains: “Integrating IOTA tokens as a participation possibility for our token sale is just the first step in a long-term strategic partnership. To execute our vision we need a technology for our sensor devices, allowing the transfer of value without charging tremendous transaction fees. For this reason, modum highly values IOTA’s infrastructure and we are aiming to integrate it as soon as possible into the modum system. The IOTA foundation and modum.io will be partnering to deliver a proof-of-concept for our next industry tests and we plan to publish the results by fall 2017.” He continues: “Since we are blockchain agnostic, we are always evaluating different technologies and protocols for our product and IOTA’s innovative approach with the Tangle has put it at the top of our list of technologies.”          More information on the collaboraiton can be found here: https://modum.io/modum-token-sale-to-accept-iota-tokens",False

Let me quote from our token sale website:  Quote The modum smart contracts are not restricted to a single blockchain. Our pilot projects, including those with a large Basel pharmaceutical company and a leading parcel distributor, used the Ethereum platform. Ethereum was chosen for its stability and its simplicity in creating the governing logic of the smart contract execution. However, modum.io remains agnostic in terms of blockchain use in order to avoid dependency on a single platform or limit the preferences of clientele. modum.io is currently testing the integration of other smart contract enabled blockchains.
