Your concern is understandable, and we expect others share your perspective.  Recent events have focused attention on the legalization of recreational cannabis at the US Federal level, and Canada is on track to legalize it near mid 2018. Regardless of the exact dates and policy changes, it is widely acknowledged that the production and sale of cannabis should be keenly regulated and tracked, which is exactly what the MJCoin Project is about.  We want to bring the inherent trust and immutability of blockchain to an industry that will thrive with such a framework.  Here are a couple of recent articles for some quick reading on the subject.

However, MJCoin is looking to service the legal cannabis industry inside and outside the US. 2. We have spent the last year working and speaking with members of the legal cannabis professional community, which is why the MJCoin is being presented and why we believe there is a need for such a project. 3. Although medical and recreational cannabis usage is becoming more acceptable in the US and abroad, the legal cannabis industry is still vastly under-serviced. We feel very strongly that the MJCoin Project can provide a valuable service to consumers and businesses, large and small.
