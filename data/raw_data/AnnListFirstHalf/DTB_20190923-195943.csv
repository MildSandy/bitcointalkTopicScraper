But i can say with some certainty why they delisted $DTB in order of importance.  1- Lack of daily vol.  This is No.1 reason why any coin will get kicked from Bittrex.  Then if they check the medium post updates to track progress of project, they will have seen the following.  2- Founders leaving. Yes, Kyle and Michael left the ship on ""Mutual"" agreement.  I personally like to think it was because, they did not want to change the style of the game, and thus, ""threw toys out of pram"" and quit. PRetty sure this is how it actually went down. The project is far better off without them.  3- ERC development halted. This was a major blow, it was a mistake to work with some unknown company ""Nona"" when there was very good options in the crypto space they could have worked with.   SO....  Coins have been delisted from Bittrex and relisted, so it is possible.  If all of the points above are addressed.  1- Coin finds new exchange and has 5btc min daily vol. 2- Update on the current size of team and who is leading it. 3- ERC developments continued.  Then $DTB would be back on Bittrex.  What i personally would like to see. A hell of a lot more details in the updates, they are really thin on information and progress report.   So for now.

So at least 2 out of the 3 issues can easily be addressed.    No.2 could be resolved with the game being more popular and being tokenized so people could trade in game ""gems"" to dtb and such.

Any stats are just placeholders at the moment too, the picture is mainly to showcase the different classes discussed in the update.  The class icons are in the circles next to the Health bars, and the Tank one you were looking for is indeed the Shield like you suggested after. Healer is the '+' icon, a common sign for First Aid, Medics or for example the World of Warcraft Healer icon if we are staying within the RPG scene. We don't want to be excessively creative with this; we want to use symbols that are commonly used in both real life and gaming so people instantly recognise them.  Our main aim at this moment in time is to create a playable beta version of the new RPG-style game for our community to test, which means small cosmetic changes are quite far down the priority list.

This is only the first iteration of the tutorial, and we'll be updating it if and when necessary along with the rest of the game. We are working closely with live testers for this, who test everything while recording their actions and providing commentary. This plus community feedback helps us decide the next steps in the dev process.  I've also replied on Telegram to your question regarding relics; you can find them and their full description in the place where you equip them on the creature page. With regards to stacking said creatures: since each creature will be unique as a token, stacking them would make it hard to see exactly which one is which. We are looking at ways of preventing future cluttering though.  This leads me to the next point, which is our dev plans for the near future! We are rolling out a new build this coming week to push through some bug fixes and improvements.

But please read here > https://www.augmentorsgame.com/databits-token-sale-shark-tank/  With app stores and their  stupid stance (for now) against crypto.  You need a way to not DIRECTLY  involve crypto altcoins in the app.  Augmentors created ""Emeralds""  These will be tradable for DTB.     Example: You earn Emeralds. Then you will go to Augmentors website and be able to Exchange your Emeralds for DTB and vice versa.  You will be able to buy Emeralds with DTB.  Then Emeralds will be used to buy upgrades and such for creatures and even the creatures themself.  So $DTB plays a big part in the economy. Also Emeralds are tied to $DTB so for every 100 emeralds spent, 1 DTB will need to be bought . (something like that).  The game economy explains it all. ",False

As mentioned, our partner Nona is working on an online Portal that will handle all blockchain related transactions and features, which is all part of the blockchain deliverables we are looking to complete this year.  App store integration is indeed a big stumbling block (for now), but like Bitcoin Co-op said there are signs that companies are slowly starting to accept crypto and change their views. We will keep working away on our online Portal until crypto is fully accepted in all app stores. Android has historically been more lenient, but with Apple featuring our game in their store we are hopeful that we can start slowly edging our way in through this connection.",False

But what we realised pretty quickly was that if a really experience player starts playing with a new creature (Level 1), then they will still be way overpowered because their spells will already be at high levels.  So what was implemented is that the spells get clamped to your Creature level.  This was implemented a while ago, and spell level/creature level was quite closely correlated. Recently though, more ways of getting portals have been added, so the spells are overtaking the creatures and getting clamped even at max creature level. It's something we hadn't given much thought, so thanks for bringing it to our attention! We'll work on a different system of making sure people dont get discouraged by stronger veterans of the game, while keeping it fair for everyone.",False

Make pre set battles, so players have to click the buttons, specified.  This way all the text is read and not missed.  Allow players to easily go back to tutorial also.  2. Make sure text boxes dont get in the way of the battle, often i could not see what i had done.  RELICS.   At the end of the tutorial it said something along the lines of ""you are ready to play"".  (Nope... No way was i ""ready"")  BATTLE. So, from the tutorial, i know what spells are meant to do.  But then i see 2 RELICS.  ....    IDEAS:  1 Place relics in the DECK SECTION would be more suitable. 2 Please consider  players to press/hold relic button to get ""pop up"" explanation of the relic.  i eventually found the relic info, in the equipment section.   3 Allow REPLY of tutorial also 4.

Should automatically show me ""me"".   LASTLY> Shields or more appropriate term Force Fields..... (as i have mentioned before)  Simply put, tell me a famous game that uses Force fields  in this way, because here is a list of the best selling beat em up games of all time.  Street fighter   Tekken Marvel vs Capcom Super Smash Bros Virtua fighter Soul calibur Dead or Alive Mortal Kombat UFC Dragon Ball  To name a few... NONE of these games have these  FORCE FIELDS, they are not shields... they are FORCE FIELDS! and they absolutely, hinder gameplay.    Allow players to ""Block"" by all means, but not stand there with force fields around them for (what feels like) half a hour.  Yes, you can use relics, if you ever figure out what they are and what they do, correct me if i am wrong, but i see zero info about them anywhere.  PS: duplicate creatures in ""Creature Tab"" gets really ""busy"" when you have more than one. Have a simply counter there to show how many of the same creature you have, or let players simply remove them.  Battery drain is still a issues also.

As for your questions: 1. Currently the creatures are not tokenized yet; this is something that is part of our plans for Q1 of 2019. Our partner Nona, who handles all our blockchain integration, is working on an online Portal where you can manage all assets. This will be bound to your game account, and will allow you to exchange DTB, manage your creatures and trade/sell them once the auction house is complete. We'll release the Q1 and Q2 roadmap this week, which will provide a rough timeline. 2. AR doesn't provide in-game benefits as such, it is more of a cosmetic addition. Some people enjoy having the creatures in the environment around them and taking cool screenshots, while other prefer to just focus on battling with no distractions. We're running a screenshot competition at the moment, and AR can make for some great shots.

With the limited amount of creatures currently available, and the max supply per creature I think the density of creatures would be too low at the moment. It is maybe something we could consider for the future, perhaps have it centred around known player locations. Once more creatures have been added this may be more feasible, but we'd be looking at distant future. We still have a lot we want to implement before then, so I'm just brainstorming a bit here.

They often look from 200-500.  Augmentors $DTB not even in the top 1,000 is terrible. But to be exected, daily BTC vol helps make a coin climb the ranks, often $DTB has chump change daily vol, so firstly that would have to change to get into the top 500 never mind top 100.  EXCHANGES: Bittrex and also TuxExchange but never any vol their due to their high withdraw fee of around 20DTB per W/D.  Again to climb the ranks, $DTB would have to be on the likes of Binance and COinbase and for that to happen, it would need serious vol and headline news EG: Nantic buys Augmentors and Facebook is going to showcase Augmentors for its new AR glasses!   The above is not possible.... in the terms of one day we will be living on Mars.    PS: That Epic Battle screenshot winner   (terrible)    No.3 was the best by far on the boat!  PPS:  At east $DTB will be changing over to ERC20 token along with the creature tokens and such, this alone will at least allow for much safer storing of assets on Ledger Wallets.  The team here really need to make a effort and also thank the long term supporters with a ""incentive = Thank you"" bonus for holding $DTB.  Usually when a altcoin does a token swap they offer a bonus EG: For every $DTB you will get 2 new ERC20 dtb. something like that.  As i have mentioned ledger wallet, would be really nice to see CUSTOM LEDGER WALLETS for people who hold over 50,000 DTB.",False

All stats are the creature's stats before any skill points have been put into them; Health is indeed its starting Health/Hit Points. The Mana stat shows how long it takes for the creature to regenerate one point of mana during battles (in this case 2.1 seconds per Mana point). Mana is required to cast spells. Defense means the creature's special shield (each creature has 1 special shield and 1 special attack, outside of the card deck you can build) Attack same as above.  We'll have a look at the wording on the tips (e.g. Equipment vs Relic), and adding some more. It was a recent addition so there is still lots of scope for alterations.  With regards to the ERC20 swap, we are still looking at Q1 2019.

You will indeed be able to use DTB in the online Portal, either to buy creatures directly or to exchange them for Emeralds with which you then buy creatures, that is still being worked on. The Augmentors universe will be two-fold, with the game itself being one part and the online Portal the other. The online Portal will host everything blockchain related, like creatures and Databits and associated transactions. This split is currently necessary as LordAltcoin says, because anything crypto related (and especially crypto transactions) is extremely difficult if not impossible to get in app stores.

Would make a hard game of ""Spot the Difference"".      The main screen looks near identical to how it was before.  The biggest change are the cards, this is much improved and a good step forward, everything else, still needs serious revision.  The one thing, that makes ANY game, is the players/creatures a player will choose to battle with.  Now. the original designs are quite good, but more effort and creativity is needed on these ""Dark-siders"" very underwhelming.  On the topic of creatures, look at this creature card (preferably on a small screen) and try and describe it to me..... its difficult thanks to the awful background design.   New Creture Card Design    https://i.imgur.com/EGhodSF.jpg  price of $DTB dropped from 2,750 to 2,400 sats...... after this update. Clearly, people are not impressed.  The team and i quote this (i dont believe it for one moment)  ""Taking into consideration their recommendations as well as the feedback from the community""  I think if Augmentors really listened to the helpful advice, the game would be looking a lot better than it does now.  So heres whats going to happen.  1. The team continue with the ""its my ball and no one else plays with it"" attitude and the game simply fails and $DTB gets delisted from Bittrex soon (approx 3 months))  after full game launch and the team runs out of money. But not to care, they did not loose any money like the investors and will most likely to think up of another ICO to try again.  2. The Augmentors Team do actually listen to advice and accept the fact they have to reall do a overhaul of the game to stand a chance of it being successful.   Would really like to hear the ""stats"" on the monthly Payments people are making, id bet good money it barely reaches the $500 mark.  One last thing, try to really engage the crypto community that made you.  PROMOTION ?  Before you were saying you neded to wait until Soft launch to start promoting... well where is it?  Do you have any plans to attend confrences in Europe and worldwide?  I see many other gaming projects in Crypto do this. You cant just attend a Comic Con event in your home country and expect it to be good enough.   Take a look here > https://cryptogames.events/  You see many names from Crypto here. Blckchain Cuties. POA, GAEX, GamerToken, Ugarsoft, XAYA, UnicornGo, Edgeess and MANY MORE!  You might have a valid excuse with being so far away from Europe, BUT  what efforts have been made to make a European Marketing team? None, by the look of it, you need a European brand to attend these events and promote Augmentors.  You guys HAD the edge with being first, but theres a lot more hungry game developers out there that will soon come out with bigger and better AR game.   You seem to be stuck in a little Bubble, but you miss out on what the world has to offer.   Step up your Game... or its Game Over.   Ooh on the subject of PROMOTION.

We absolutely listen to the community, and a lot of changes are driven just because of this. The UI changes were amongst those, and the feedback on them has been overwhelmingly positive. I dont think a small price drop in very thin orderbooks is a good indicator of the reception of this particular update, when there have been bigger moves on no news. We have only been live in App Stores for 2 months now, and already we've had multiple updates. We've also recently changed our update schedule to once every 2 weeks to better adapt to community feedback, and on top of that are constantly working on new features. Even though we have a small team, they are incredibly passionate and work very hard, but as I have said before you can't overhaul things completely overnight. With regards to engaging the crypto community; that is why I am here, and why I have started posting in this thread regularly.  I've already touched on promotion in a few previous posts, but some new points were raised. After the soft launch, we've had a good few articles and interviews posted in South African media, as per our plans. Promotion after soft launch was always going to be centred around the country we launched in. In early 2019, we will be looking to soft launch in more countries (EU included), which will be accompanied by promotion in their respective media outlets. As we work towards a full launch and worldwide release, promotion will also commence on a larger scale.  I like your idea of offering a reward for people to download the game, leave a review etc. I've added it to our list of ideas!",False

The deck overview (on the left) is a simplified version of the full cards (on the right), where the representation is fairly simple and as follows: Card Name, Attack/Shield Power, Mana Cost. There is a clear distinction between Attacks and Shields; Attack Power is red, and Shield Power is grey. With regards to the 's' (I assume you are referring to the creature stat x s/mana), that stands for seconds, which means the creature will regenerate a mana point every x seconds.  Creature grouping could be looked in to, but since each creature will be unique as NFTs (down to their relics and win/loss ratio), it may not be the best solution. We'll look into some possibilities to reduce cluttering!  With regards to DTB; I have touched on this in a few of my previous posts here, and it has been part of our weekly Medium updates too, so I'll try not to repeat myself too much. In short, our partner Nona is working on the blockchain integration, and once that is complete you'll be able to send your DTB to the online Portal and exchange them for game assets!",False

I like the new UI.  Still an issue with new creatures purchased not getting the correct spell version. They are stuck on level one spells for everything.

A REALLY GOOD IDEA would be for the team to contact LEdger and have some nice, limited edition ledger wallets made with a nice laser engraved token name and logo (like Stratis and AE had done)  https://www.ledger.com/  They ""act"" as basically a ""key""  you simply plug in the ledger (wallet) and go to MEW (my ether wallet) and choose ""Ledger"" as the option to log in (there are others).  Then you select ETHEREUM icon on the ledger and you will log into the MEW / Ethereum wallet that can also hold all ERC tokens.  As $DTB will be new (when the change over to ERC happens) you will probably need to add the coin to the wallet.  Again, pretty easy to do,  a few simple steps.   Then you will be able to get a $DTB deposit address and send the Databits and of course all the creature tokens and such that will also be ""ERC"".  When the times comes i will make a simple guide.  FOR NOW i highly recommend getting the Ledger wallet and testing how to add tokens and send and receive.  REMEMBER the MEW (MY Ether Wallet) uses ""GAS"" a tiny bit of ETH for each transaction, so you will need to send ETH to your new MEW wallet. Try and send no less than 0.1 ETH   ",False

If you have a minute, you can read the Q4 plan, which goes into the details of the blockchain integration happening this quarter, which includes creature swaps and tokenisation, and ability to use DTB in the game.  Vinny invested for 20% of the business, and while he is not personally involved in the game or the day to day proceedings of Augmentors, his company has provided invaluable connections, people and ideas. Regardless of your opinion of him, without him Augmentors may not even have been here. As for app stores, if you want an app that is globally available then this is unfortunately the way things are at this moment in time, until a better alternative presents itself.  In the past year and 8 months since the ICO, we have been working hard to cater to both gamers and investors alike, and now that we have the foundation of the game up and running we can work on the blockchain aspect of it. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither is a full game. The team is still small, but works incredibly hard every day on producing the best possible merger between AR, blockchain and gaming.

We are (and have been for a while) working on finalising the creature swap.  Originally the tokens were XCP based, but we decided that ERC is a better option for gaming tokens, im sure most of you will agree.   So we are working on enabling a token swap for ICO creature tokens to the new ERC-721 format as well as the creature token, Databits tokens will likely move over to ERC also, this would be another ""token"" swap also. We have been and are in full contact with Bittrex  who are aware of our plans and told us they will happily handle any future swpa as needed.  We will make sure everything goes as smoothly as possible and out top priority is to make sure no one has any risk of losing tokens. There are quite a few ""moving parts"" but all is coming along nicely, ETA for Tokens swap, as per roadmap is Q4 , which we are into so hope to keep to this timeframe.  As people know, we have just wrapped up a very enjoyable and very important 3 day event at  Comic Con.  We were very lucky with out timing as it could not have worked out better, being able to soft launch Augmentors at such a big event, was a real blessing.  We have met with a lot of gaming influencers and had several interviews with gaming related websites and spoke with representatives from gaming companies.  The comments from people, general public and professional people where very positive, they love how we are using Augmented Reality, they spoke abut a lack of quality and how we have put the ""magic ingredient"" into the recipe. We made many more contact who in the future will help us promote and reach new people in the industry.  Promotion.  We have plans and from the last 3 days, we now have even better and bigger plans for promoting Augmentors going forward, i would just like to add, in Soft Launch, this is a time for data collecting, we will be analysing all feedback and data to fine tune Augmentors Game and have it hit the ground running come full launch.  Once we are ready for full launch, then you will see a big push in promotion, we will reveal much more detail when the time comes.  For now, please enjoy these photo from Comic Con and rest assured, we have a professional team in the game design, creation and also marketing. It takes a lot of careful planning and execution, so i hope everyone here understands, that everything will happen when the time is right.  Part of the Augmentors Game Team at our stall, im sure you will all agree, the designer knocked it out of the park, many people commented how ""eye-catching"" it was and considering over the 3 days we always had a busy stall, we fully agree.  https://i.imgur.com/zZxK1ce.jpg  Our both soon filled up with gamers not only from Africa but from many countries worldwide, one thing is for sure, for future events.

So, Augmentors is launched with soft launch, totally normal and very common in games industry esp with Apps.  Now hopefully people will speak up and give honest feedback to team to tell them how to improve the game.  Gert, Augmentors CEO told me everything is 100% Solid with Bittrex also, Bittrex have been in contact to go over $DTB check supply and use case and everything and gave Databits the all clear, so mark my words, it wont be getting delisted from Bittrex.  In fact, quite the opposite in regards to Exchanges.   $DTB will become a ERC token as well as the creature ERC 721, many exchanges love these tokens, so dont be surprised to see $DTB on Binance and Coinbase next year.

So currently, the game is indeed live, but DTB and tokenized creatures can not yet be used there (you can battle with creatures, they are just not tokenized yet). As per the roadmap for Q4, this integration and the swap will happen this quarter, and until then everything is still on the BTC chain. People who have got creature tokens obtained in the ICO will be able to then trade them for actual creatures, if they so desire. I can highly recommend reading the high-level development update for this coming quarter for some more in-depth explanation.  The DTB supply of around 22M is fixed, that is not going to change. For every 1000 Emeralds circulating in the game, Augmentors will buy 1 DTB from secondary markets, and hold this in a wallet dedicated to maintaining this ratio. If you obtain Emeralds in the game (through whatever means), you will also be able to change those back into Databits and sell them, and the 'ratio-wallet' will be updated accordingly. There is an economic whitepaper that goes into all the details of how the game will provide value to DTB, you can find it here  I hope these were the answers you were looking for, feel free to ask any more you may have.",False

Mobile Game for mobile devices, Android, Ios and tablets.   2. Game is NOT launched yet. Has Soft Launch at Comic Con Africa in 11 days > https://www.comicconafrica.co.za/en.html Where the team has a big stand and will be engaging with all the people who attend this Sold Out Event.  3. Databits $DTB is the currency linked to the game. (Dirt cheap on Bittrex right now, below ICO price)  It is currently a XCP asset (but is likely to change to a ERC token)  4. Creature tokens will be changed to ERC 721 in the next few weeks/month.  5. Players will own assets in the game, every second you put into your creature, you will own that creature and be able to trade creatures and other things in the marketplace for $DTB.  (which you can then sell for Bitcoin and then for Cash)  6. App uses non digital currency to stay within rules of the Apple and Android store. So no fear of it being kicked from the App stores.  7. Public Team with high profile backers, Vinny Lingham, Llew Classen. > https://www.newtownpartners.com/about/portfolio-of-companies/  8. Game uses AR Augmented Reality.

The in game ""currency""  Emeralds and Gold will be transferable to $DTB  and not only that $DTB will be able to be used to buy gold or emeralds, these 2 ""in game"" currencies are linked to DTB but in a way, there will be no problems with the app stores down the road.  ""7. Vinny Lingham, Llew Classen.""  ""two clowns""   So, 2 people who are highly successful and professional businessmen worth over $500M USD are ""clowns"".   I rest my case. But feel free to Google search those names and get facts.     Llew Classen is executive director for the Bitcoin Foundation among other things. Vinny Lingham was one of the Shark Tank panel of investors, among other things.   I hope one day i can be as big as clown as these guys, hey.",False

Lets start with the mention of Delays.   Really we have only had delays with the creatures tokens and that is due to the change in platform, no longer will Counterparty be used (as originally planned) for Creatures, but we will now move to ERC 721 token for creatures, so understandably, there is a delay here due to the change in networks, all of which, is coming along nicely, these things do take time and it is of the utmost importance we get everything right before releasing the creature tokens, the security and protection of our investors is of the highest importance and we wont release anything until we know its a secure as possible.  Now there was going to be another testing round in Q2 that we pushed back to the start of Q3 mainly due to the feedback and there is now alternative way, much improved ways we can develop the game.   This is another reason for delays, we work hard daily and sometimes something comes along, that can help us do something is a much better way, either in the graphics department, speed of developments or another reason. We have done work and simply had to scrap it to move to the more advanced way of creating our mobile game.    We decided, through a lot and i mean a lot of studies that a soft launch approach would be much more beneficial to our game.   Please see here for a good explanation of a Soft Launch.  http://smallbusiness.chron.com/soft-launch-vs-hard-launch-24486.html  Again, this is being done to help make the game as fine tuned and of the highest quality possible before mass release, soft launches are very common in this space these days and will help the finish the final version of the game for Hard Launch.   So, i hope you can all understand the choices we make, we dont make these choices lightly and everything we do is for the best interests of the game, afterall we all want to release and see the best game possible and that is exactly what we strive for, every day here at Augmentors HQ.  So please give us a little leeway as we progres, i think we are doing well considering we are developing a game in new uncharted waters, AR is still in its infancy we have great timing in creating a game of high quality when there is little competition around.  We thank you for your patience and hope to see you all in the Telegram and Discord channels.

COMIC CON AFRICA  From the 14th to the 16th of September, the team behind the Augmentors Game will be at Comic Con Africa, transporting all our visitors to a new realm of mobile gaming.  Visitors will be able to download the game straight from the exhibition booth, as well as from the respective app stores. There will be ongoing battle competitions for those who want to play the game at the booth, with some epic Augmentors swag up for grabs for those who dominate their opponents.   We’ll also be running a number of competitions to giveaway tickets to attend Comic Con Africa (even for Saturday which is already sold-out!). So you’ll need to stay tuned to Discord and Twitter for details on these.  Comic Con Africa is the best place to soft-launch Augmentors, so from the middle of September, Augmentors will be live! While we’ll be soft-launching in South Africa first, and then select countries a few weeks later, you, our awesome community, will be able to play wherever you are in the world!

Augmentors Battle NEW CREATURE REVEALS  The 5 new creatures that will be available in Alpha are being revealed on Discord in a throwback game of #CreatureHangman! The second new creature, Hydrastia (below), was revealed last week after our community correctly guessed her name. Hydrastia, sorceress from the depths of the Wetlands, came to the aid of the Augmentors once she learnt of Rhule’s return. Her main source of strength comes from her coral reef scepter, allowing her to summon some of the most unique water spells the Bello Realm has ever known.

On Thursday we ""Ninja Launched"" our New and Updated RoadMap.  Please take a look here and share and like if you wish    https://medium.com/augmentors/augmentors-2018-roadmap-community-update-april-26th-2018-48343aff31f4  https://i.imgur.com/GsvhLtd.png  There are several important updates.   In Q3 Development you will see ""Emerald System"". Let me explain this further.  Emeralds will be the premium currency in the game, and linked to Databits at a fixed ratio (referred to as Databits Tethers or $DTBT in the whitepaper). Several people have asked ""why $DTB can not be used"" and quite simply App stores, Apple, Android do not allow Crypto Currency in game, so, as per the white paper V2 we have to create a system where $DTB will still be used (we want it to be the main Token for Augmentors Game) but we need this ""Bridge"" for the App stores.  People will be able to convert Emeralds into DTB They will want to do this as we will give a nice incentive for using $DTB over money purchases The majority of players will get emeralds as part of every pack they purchase  This is all i can mention for now, other than what is in the article above as all the fine details are still being worked out.  [/list]  The second part of the news is that we intend to make the Creature Tokens ERC721 . As you will be aware ERC is Ethereum and $DTB on BCT/Counterparty.   So we are also planning on how to merge the two and it could well be a case of having a token swap on Bittrex that would convert the $DTB into a ERC721 token also so both tokens are fully compatible.  So, as you can see our entire team is hard at work and we really dont stop, it is our pleasure to be working on such a exciting and big Blockchain Game and we intend to delivery the best possible game for mobiles devices.   Every step of the way we are thinking about the community and how we can best serve our community and future gamers with the best mobile, blockchain based game, the landscape is forever evolving and we will move with the times to ensure we have the most up to date foundation and developments on offer.

Should this happen, then it would be a straight forward swap take place on Bittrex (like other coins have done before).  The team are keeping a very close eye on how ERC tokens develop and also are fully aware of other developments to create tokens, one thing is for sure, nothing will be finalized unless the Team are 100% happy and satisfied, that the choice they make is the most secure choice and most beneficial to the game and community.

In this week’s update I’ll be giving you insight into the current development of the game!  As discussed in our updated roadmap, we have incorporated a lot exciting new features off the back of the Token Holder Alpha feedback. This week, we would like to share what the team is currently working on, and give you some insight into the underlying mechanics.  Bello Realm Honor We are really excited to introduce a new concept called “honor”. We have designed honor to accommodate many different uses in the game, which are described below, including matching players with more suitable opponents.  Each player in the game will have honor — which indicates the skill level of that player. A player’s honor will increase after every battle won and decrease after every loss. This means that a player will be matched with other players of a similar skill level.  Leagues We will introduce eleven different leagues, ranging from Beginner all the way up to Platinum, each requiring a higher amount of honor than the previous.  When new players start the game, they will automatically start in the Beginner league, and will have to battle their way up.  Promotion and relegation Once you have gained enough honor you will automatically be promoted to a higher league, similarly, if you lose enough battles you will be relegated to a lower league.  Arenas As a reward for getting promoted, players will also unlock new Arenas in which they can battle. Each new Arena will have a higher entry fee, where the winning player takes all the fees.  Each arena will represent a different region in Bello Realm, and once you’ve unlocked an arena it will stay unlocked.  Seasons Seasons will run for a set period of time (we are still working on the exact season length) and at the end of that period, the leaderboards are reset. After every season, prizes proportionate to the league you’re in will be rewarded, and then all players’ honor will be reset to the minimum honor of their current leagues, and the battle begins again!  User Interface Update  Sky Point Mountains As you might have seen in the updated roadmap, we are well underway with an entire UI revamp.  We are currently updating all the screens; ranging from the main screen to the battle screen and we are sure certain players are going to love the updates! Watch this space for more updates.  Social  Amber Woods We are adding the ability to allow players to manage a friends list, allowing them to add and remove friends as they please. Players will then have the ability to challenge their friends directly whenever they are both online.  Last but not least, time for some small (but fun) stuff! Players will have a flag above their profile while they battle for dominance, showing which country they come from. Further to this, we have enabled a simple in-game chat, along with emoji’s, to share your experience with your opponent.",False

There has been some discussion in our community channels this past week around our virtual economy, Databits (DTB) and how the in-game currencies will work. In this week’s update I’ll clarify these elements and hopefully answer all your questions.  If you haven’t done so already, please read the Databits Economy Design V2.1 before you continue to give you some background.  https://www.augmentorsgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/25052018-DatabitsWhitepaper-v2.1.pdf  We have updated this paper (from V2.0) to reflect the naming convention of the premium in game currency, Emeralds.  Databits (DTB) The Augmentors economy has been designed in such a way to align the interest of the Augmentors business, the backers, the players and all other participants in the network.    Emeralds is the premium currency in Augmentors, and is locked to DTB at a fixed ratio. Emeralds can be traded into and out of DTB. Augmentors will keep DTB in a reserve to maintain a fixed ratio of 1 DTB to 1000 Emeralds. So as the game gains popularity, the amount of DTB stored in the reserve will continue to grow due to increased number of Emeralds in circulation. This was done because using DTB directly in the game introduced technical, UI and regulatory issues.  Emeralds will be purchased through packs, but players may want to bring DTB directly into the game which they will be able to do. Players will also be able to take their Emeralds out of the game in the form of DTB.  Illustrative example (not indicative of the weighting of packs):  A player buys a $10 USD pack from the in-game store. In this pack, she receives two creatures, five relics, three skins, two spells and $4 USD worth of Emeralds. At the time, one DTB is worth one USD, so she receives 4000 Emeralds. The in-app store automatically transfers four DTB to the DTB reserve to maintain the DTB and Emeralds ratio. Through extensive playing, she gains another 1000 Emeralds. After levelling up one of her creatures, she decides that she wants to sell it and lists it on the auction house.  The creature is deemed valuable because it is rare (one of 100 ever made), and because she is skilled, it has never lost a battle. She sells this creature for 10,000 Emeralds.  She now decides to cash out her Emeralds. She logs onto the website and completes the required KYC and withdraws her 15,000 Emeralds. These are removed from circulation and the proportional amount of DTB — being 15 — is sent to her counterparty enabled wallet. She then decides to sell the 15 DTB on the secondary market and because the game is popular, the price of DTB has risen to $2 USD each. She sells these 15 DTB for $30 USD.  Currencies in the game “Most free to play games these days have opted for a multiple currency model for their economies. This all stems from the initial formula used with early free to play games that featured a dual currency system. One “Soft Currency” that players earn through gameplay and one “Hard Currency” that can only be purchased through an IAP. These days a lot of free to play games have more complex economies than this, but the principle remains the same: your players can play a lot for free and earn the Soft Currency, or trade money for time and acquire the more valuable “Hard” currency to speed up in game progression. This is by far the most popular model for free to play games, especially mobile free to play games.” — Gamesparks We have followed a similar model and will use Emeralds as the “Hard” currency (locked to DTB at a fixed ratio) and Gold as the “Soft” currency.  Emeralds (Premium currency locked to DTB at a fixed ratio) How do you get Emeralds?  Emeralds are the premium currency of Augmentors. Emeralds can be earned by purchasing packs of creatures, relics and other items for fiat (i.e. USD) in the game. Emeralds can also be gained by bringing your DTB into the game and as special rewards when playing.  What can you do with Emeralds?  Emeralds will be the currency used in the Auction House, the in-game marketplace, for creatures, relics and skins.  Emeralds will also be used to immediately open packs in the game and to buy Gold in the store.  The amount of Emeralds a player has accumulated will also reflect on their game profile as prestige, a cosmetic addition. This mechanism can be thought of as a staking mechanism to encourage players to hold Emeralds. This has been done to ensure the game remains fair and gamers cannot pay to win.  Emeralds can also be taken out of the game in exchange for DTB.  Gold How do you get Gold?  Gold is the secondary currency in Augmentors. Gold can be earned from winning matches, opening of packs and by trading for Emeralds.  What can you do with Gold?  Gold can be used to upgrade spells and to play in certain arenas.  I hope this post clarifies the in-game currencies and how Emeralds are locked to DTB. If you have any questions feel free to ask them below or in our social platforms.

Next testing, will be start of Q3.  There has been a lot of new people sign up and the wealth of feedback they give from testing will be more than enough for the team to make a big impression on the launch of Augmentors Game.   If anyone here would like to chat , please make sure to join the Augmentors telegram group and of course follow the weekly updates on medium.  The post from Michael outlines the use. Ase for DTB, its as simple as this, if people want to ""cash in"" thier account tjen they would do so by selling items for dtb, then sell dtb for btc and fiat.  Also, for every 1000 emeralds sold, 1 dtb will be needed in reserve for the game. So imagine when there are 100k players (i expect many more soon after launch) each player will want a minimum of 1000 emeralds and more, so you can also see the positive effect it will have for dtb.

Some really amazing AR  (Augmented Reality) location pics.  So as promised here we go.... We had 5 creatures to choose from as seen in the Medium blog updates. Ki, Sha, Tiska, Markik and Tundris. All have their own special ability (Spell) along with all the usual Spells, which are selected  before battle in the ""Card Deck"" area. You arr able to customise 3 card decks, but only use one deck in battle, so if you find yourself being beaten, you can go back and choose a different card deck that will hopefully allow you to beat your opponent.  Alpha testing has been a huge success, the overall feedback has been very positive and the vibe during the weekend was ""Buzzing"" with excitement. Here are some of the photos taken from real locations around the world, from a Beach in South Africa, To woodlands in the heart of Europe to old World War Fortress in Belgium.  Taken by Gert Augmentors CEO while at the beach in South Africa.   Ki vs Markik.  This is really bright Summer Sun also.    Tundris VS Markik. Markik unleashing huge rock from a portal that opens up to drop on Tundris Head. Tundris reacting quickly with Glacier Shield to deflect shot. Players have a split second to see what the other person intends to do and react to it.      Markik has one of the most impressive AR spells, as shown here, when on a ""earth""  real world ""platform"" the ground looks like it has opened up to reveal a volcanic surface below, picture does not do it justice as when playing you will look at the ground (away from phone screen) just to make sure it is not actually opening up and on fire!    The Developments team have gone to great detail, clear a lot of thought and dedication to detail has been made during the developments, this stands as testament to the quality of the game they are producing, and make no mistake about it Augmentors Game looks set to become a world wide success. Before Battle, your creature will Appear on screen via Portals, all portals have different designs, here we can see two portals appear a second or two before the creatures explode onto the screen.      So much more to come which will be shared on Social Media, Twitter, REddit and Facebook.  But i have to say, im saving my own personal favourite till last, again Markik this time unleashing his ""Flaming Phoenix"" attack, i tried to capture this shot ten times and was not able to, user ""team Belgium"" nailed it, im sure you will all agree.

Here at Augmentors HQ we have completed our greatest testing to date, Token Holder Alpha.  Spread over 4 fun filled days, the community members who sign up to our website and help some $DTB were able to participate, nearly all phone were able to try the non AR mode, so they could at least Battle and see all the Big Improvements we have made and others with newer phones were able to try out the AR mode and as we can see from the images above, there were some stunning locations. Some testers were able to live stream footage also drawing more attention to our game and current developments, a BIG THANK YOU to all who took part.  AR is still relatively new technology, the Augmented Reality developments world changes all of the time, thus, we could be working in ""one direction"" only to have some new tech, that allows us to do things better and take us in another direction.  The road to Full release is not a straight one and there will be times when we will have new ways to development the game, that were previously not possible.    So i hope all here can understand the reasons why developments take the time they do, first impressions last and we intend to make the Best first impression possible and we can proudly say, everything is looking great and coming along, at a rate we are happy with.  Please bookmark and view our weekly updates here: https://medium.com/augmentors  Speaking of ""new ways"" there is a recent development that is very big news for AR, previously not possible, was the ability to be able to let another user view your surroundings.   Example: Im having a Epic Battle with Vintage.  Vintage happens to be on holidays in Egypt and is standing in front of the Great Pyramids, with this new development in AR i would be able to battle and also see his location/background, in this example we would have a BAttle were the great pyramids were in the background.

The game has come on leaps and bounds, really impressive as you say, but not perfect, the team are not going to settle for 2nd best, Augmentors Game intends to raise the Bar in AR gaming and i have full confidence, thats exactly what it is going to do.  The community keeps growing and attracting gamers from all around the world, by next Alpha testing there will be hundreds of people eager to take part, by beat i expect this number to grow into the thousands and not long after full game release, lets say this time next year, so all go to plan, we would see hundreds of thousands of downloads and active gamers.    So lets see where my Bold prediction will be, this time next year.   The feedback i have received from all the people who took part in Alpha testing has been overwhelmingly positive. All Token Holders Alpha Testers could not be happier with how the game has progressed and many saying its looking really great for the future.  Needless to say they are very eager for the next Alpha testing in Q2.    Then come Beta Testing in Q3, the game is going to be pretty much the finished article and ready for Full Version in Q4.     Of course a lot changes in this AR space, as per your post above, new tech comes along and can lead to new areas and enhancements, which in turn requires a little longer to implement, like we seen with the Creature Token swap, that has been pushed back a little to make sure the best ""platform"" will be used.

Like a lot of things, if you want to use the latest tech, you need a device that supports the latest tech (in the early days) until they release it for more wider devices.  The difference between AR and VR. Well, as quoted best by the Franklin institute.  ""Augmented reality (AR) adds digital elements to a live view often by using the camera on a smartphone. Examples of augmented reality experiences include Snapchat lenses and the game Pokemon Go. Virtual reality (VR) implies a complete immersion experience that shuts out the physical world.""  AR = Uses the world around you VR = Full Virtual World.  Both have huge benefits in the modern world.

Febo, he asked if it would be possible to play the game with tech like the ps VR headset, i read it wrong at first also.    So a really good question that i will have to research.  It is something i have thought about also.   So...  As things stand now, Augmentors game is played via mobile devices, phones and tablets.  Now, there is some Avengers type mask/helmet that allows you to insert your phones and view everything in a AR setting.  Marvel Hero Vision Iron Man AR:  https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/12/hasbro-iron-man-ar-helmet/  I could totally see something like this for Augmentors Game!  Surely the leap to allowing this set up with AR can not be too difficult to do.  Damn im very excited thinking about this.  Imagine.  Augmentors game mask you wear and (for now at least) you can put your phone inside helmet that allows you to view the battle in a  AR way.  You would then need to control the battle, if this could be done with some glove type device, boy, ooh boy! (like in the article above)  You would be able to free roam around the battle the beauty of AR means you can view the battle or the creatures from any angle also the controls are quote basic (compared to console or pc games) making it ideal for this type of set up.  Wow.  Im going to say it is very likely to be possible within 12 to 24 months from now.  Then we see kids and adults in homes, back gardens, playing fields, even shopping centers, wearing Augmentors Masks and having battles this way.  Combine this with motion control and its a double win.  I can just picture myself and my partner wearing Augmentors Masks, say, me, Tundris and as he is a wolf, id have a Wolf like Claw glove VS Markik whos have a claw like glow as he is a bird type figure.

I am trying to find a reason to use CoinSwitch over an exchange like Bittrex... The only reasons I see are: 1. The users is new to crypto and cannot register on a exchange, as the new user registrations are currently closed 2. For some people, the reason not to buy from exchanges, are the currently enforced verification policies. So I wonder does CoinSwitch provide some advantage for those people?

From the owner of the exchange himself, anyone can buy up to 3BTC of crypto without any KYC stuff.. thats a good amount right there.  Then i guess if you wanted more, a VPN would easily do the job.   And you hit nail on the head, people cant really sign up to Bittrex right now, yes, there is theat application form, but its 4 weeks since i applied and still no message, not holding my breath, so this service from coin switch is really great for anyone wanting to buy Bittrex only tokens, or ANYWHERE that you cant sign up to.  But not only that, i found the fee the same as Bittrex and for anyone new getting into crypto, the process is so super easy, it is the ideal ""bridge"" for beginners to know how to buy crypto and then send to a wallet.   I tested about 5 transactions and all went through quickly from 15 to 30mins, only times it was slower was when ""America"" was awake.  You can sign up to coinswitch easily.  1. email address (can be any you like) 2. Phone number (can be any you like as its for sms verification, i used a online service for free to get the verification code) https://www.receive-sms-online.info/  (it is all in the video i made).  So overall really great service, a absolute shapeshift killer as , far as i am aware, shapeshift give you one exchange rate, Coinswitch is like a price comparison site also and will let you, the buyer chose the best deal.",False

See, unlike the card only based games, Augmentors game creatures are playable and upgradable plus since its first use, the creature will have all stats, so this adds another layer of desirability to the creature and also making sure that no two used creatures are the same as it will be very unlikely for 2 of the same creatures to have identical stats.

Is it safe to call it ""selective blindness""?  Regarding the Bittrex delistings - of course nobody is guaranteed against that, as Bittrex makes decisions just based on their internal needs, and they are not always obvious. I am not sure about 1ST, but according to some info, AGRS and MAID were delisted because Bittrex decided to remove ""pre sale"" tokens (the ones which are supposed to be replaced by the real coins somewhere in unforseeable future).

The BTC transaction spam is gone now, and BTC TX fees have dropped tremendously, so I am unsure of the reasons of the move. If the same kind of spam attack starts on ETH network, there will be the same problems as BTC had, so moving to ETH because of the low fees there doesn't seem to be a well thought decision.

Counterparty works fine, but is lacking in development, it takes a long time to make progress and is more complicated tp issues tokens.  However another option has been suggested, so this is another reason for the delay in the creature token swap, the landscape is changing quickly and something more suited might be made available soon.  So its not set in stone yet, which direction the creature token will take.  I can confirm dtb is staying on xcp/btc chain. As you correctly point out, btc fees are super low and transactions much quicker now the spamming has been crushed.  Many thanks for your views, very much appreciated.

In general it seems to me, the transfer speed and even the cost of the creature transfer should not be too important, as those creatures are supposed to be pretty valuable, and the act of 'handing your creature to the new master' is not something to be taken lightly and done every now and then  I guess the choice of the best chain to keep creatures on, is mostly up to the ease of usage. The one which makes it easier for average user/gamer should be the most suitable - unless the Augmentors tech completely hides all the tech details from the end user - as in that case the ease of use becomes secondary, and security becomes most important.

The main problem is simply this.  To get on Binance or Kucoin exchange now, most often you need to vote, they have this voting system, because you need to own the coins of the exchange.  EG: BNB  (Binance Token) or KuCoin Shares (Kucoin exchange token).  They are able to print these tokens out of fresh air and people then need to buy these tokens to vote, clever system right.  So these exchanges wont add new coins because they like the look of them (maybe at first not now) they have their system in place so people have to buy the exchange coins to then vote for a coin to be listed.  It is no problem to buy the tokens.  The problem here is we simply do not have a big enough community that would give us the votes we would require. You need around 700-1,000 people to vote for you to get on Binance or Kucoin (both decent exchanges that i use myself).  Not only that, we are currently on Bittrex and Volume and Buy support there is pretty thin, so no need to be on another exchange as there would be little volume or buy support, thats being honest.  OR  There are forms to contact the exchange directly to be added, but there has been some wild numbers flying around, like 90BTC to be listed on Binance, i will pass the Coin Request Forms onto Gert, the CEO for Augmentors Game and then will give response here, but most likely they will want a lot of money to be instantly added, money that can be much better spent on developing the game.  BUT.....    The Augmentors Game Community grows daily and every week at least one new member reaches out and asks how they can help, this is really great, once we have the community helping out, we can then be confident to get on the above exchanges via community voting.    So its a waiting game,  the New Alpha testing will bring a lot more people to the community, so everything possible is being done daily to grow our community.  We are extremely thankful to all who offer help and stand by us, its a great feeling and looknig forward to more people joining.   ",False

Marianna is a marketer by trade (backed by a Marketing degree) who joins us all the way from Greece. She will support Augmentors in community management and growth (along with our crypto community liaison Simon, aka Vintage Bazaar), and a host of other marketing areas. She’s worked in numerous countries and industries, including gaming (of course), and is fluent in English, Italian and Greek so feel free to chat to her on Telegram in any of these languages. She is also learning Japanese and knows how tough it is! Her motto is 悔しい (Kuyashii — use the words of doubters as energy to succeed or simply prove them wrong). The reason why you haven’t seen her on our Augmentors Team page yet is because she still needs to choose her favourite Augmentor to join her on screen. If you have any suggestions do let her know.  We do have all areas covered and we will do have a ongoing marketing strategy that is going to gather pace as we get closer to full game launch, so please bear with us, we are in good hands and  we want to make sure all efforts and time spent on marketing and developing the game are used in the best possible way.

DTB you can trade beside Bittrex also on Tux Exchange.   I did not used Bittrex much in last few years and had legacy account that was last year reset to ""beginners"".  On Sunday I finally decided to do enhanced verification. It took 5 days. This morning i saw i am enhanced verified. First i was not happy to send my selfies around, but lately when most if not all exchanges stopped new registering I realized I should rather do it, so I will not be one day sorry when i will need it fast.

Simply No, not right now, Bittrex is the No.1 altcoin exchange, so DTB perfectly fine here.   There is no better exchange than Bittrex, thats why it is the most popular and most trusted.   Poloniex is very much out of favour with traders and to be honest, not to be trusted, i was trading there for 4 years until last April, when something really ""fishy"" happened to a couple of big margin trades i had, long story short, i close them when they should of been in very good profits and my balances had less btc (i know how to margin trade also).  Ideally $DTB needs to be on a popular Chinese , Korean exchange.  This often requires community voting and considering, very few people can be bothered to do something as simple as a retweet, then there is little chance of getting  community voting on a exchange right now, community needs to understand, the big coins get to where they are because they have really strong community support, its a simple as that.   Posted 2 days ago: From Official Augmentors Game channel on Twitter.  https://twitter.com/AugmentorsGame/status/951786811856228352  Stats: 1 Retweet....        ............................................................................... ................   So some of these cards, or characters were sold along side the presale of DTB?  Correct, there are a limited creation of ICO creatures.  Founds here on website > https://www.augmentorsgame.com/creatures/ People who bought into the ICO where given DTB and 1 creature token.  The token will be swapped end of Q1 for one of the rare ICO creatures, other creatures wont be limited like the starting creatures but these ICO creature will never be reproduced.  I think these stats are up to date:  Rookie - 263 Champion - 92 Ultimate - 120 Hero/ Villain- 85 God - 51  As you can see, should/when this game goes viral and has hundreds of thousands of players, even millions, all who want to own the rare ICO creatures, you can see the demand there will be for them.   ............................................................................... ..................  Will there be a mechanism for DTBT outside of the app? Will it be traded on exchanges?   No,  (it wont be called Tether either, thats just  a ""place holding tag"")  It only serves for in game, as DTB has big value there has to be ""tether"" that can act as tiny pieces of DTB basically, then people can ""cash-in"" this dtbT for the real deal $DTB.  All explained here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXe9qp1e4ws  ............................................................................... ................  Lastly when will this discord for testers be launched? Is it available now? Yes, its available now and has been since the very first pre alpha testing way back in May.  It will be open to people who get to test the game (for now) and later on it will be made public for full game release.  Discord is the No.1 place for Gamers to untie and chat and talk about games, so a perfect place for Augmentors gaming community.  IF people here have not done so already, please sign up on the official website for alpha testing.  https://www.augmentorsgame.com/  Front page, half way down. Enter your email address and you will be notified as son as next alpha testing begins, you will need to act fast with the emails.  ............................................................................... ........  Many thanks for your Questions, all i ask, it that the community can take a few moments now and then each week to try and help Augmentors Game awareness, there is a big marketing strategy planned which will be revealed closer to full game launch, in the mean time all i ask (beg) for, is you guys can spare a few moments, to give likes, retweets (twitter) maybe write a a blog post or make a video like a community member done here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khZgwJrUcTQ   Thank you.",False

The medium blog post is updated every week, so please make sure to bookmark and read, thank you.  https://medium.com/augmentors  We have been working incredibly hard since the ICO ended successfully at the end of February this year, we had a target of $1m USD which we reached, due to having carefully and thoughtfully budgets for the full game development , we sold the Bitcoin once all DTB ICO investors had been paid out. So we did miss the big Bitcoin price rise, but no one knew that Bitcoin would reach all time highs like this and it would not have been responsible for us to hold the bitcoin and risk our developments, we hope you understand.  Next, we are gearing up for Pre Alpha testing, this is initially open to the ICO backers as stated previously. We must stress, this is pre alpha testing, the very first testing stages of our new design.  A lot has changed in the AR world over the last few months, Apple iOS were first with their ARKit which gave us more options when developing the game, now quite recently Android have released ARCore so we have are able to develop and create a game with many more options that we had before.    So i hope people understand, that the compatible phones for android are limited due to the kit being so fresh.  FEEDBACK: Feedback is very important to us, we have had a lot of feedback already from our previous screenshot and we can see that there are improvements to be made. We listen to all feedback, we always read posts, here on Bitcoin Talk, twitter, you tube comments and our active Telegram group.  I will be personally posting more, we have been so busy with game development and making sure Pre Alpha testing was ready by the end of the year, every moment has been fully focused on the game developments, so not long to wait now.  Thank you all for your continued support and faith in our project and team  (oh speaking of such, have you seen the new team profiles on our new website?) https://www.augmentorsgame.com/meet-the-augmentors-team/  We have a long journey ahead of us, Full game release is scheduled for Q4 2018.  Our team is passionate and talented and we wont settle for anything less than the Best Augmented Reality game.  Keep Battling!",False

So he destroyed DTB value with new economy presented in a white paper and rendered previous white paper (used for ICO) as a toilet paper.

No original terms have been violated at all, far from it, the new economy makes sure that DTB stays on Bittrex and is also able to be added to other exchanges, any sort of burning of tokens is simply not good for the future of any token.  Tether, if you actually bothered to read anything, you'd know that ""tether"" is not going to be the name  and that this other ""token"" is needed for the economy and it will have a very small value, unlike $DTB (currently 68 cents each)  Everything is being done to secure the future for Augmentors game and in turn DTB.  Also, ICO ended 28th Feb.  10 months ago and a lot has been done in that time, the game as clearly seen above, has evolved a lot since the first creation.  The team has been working hard to change and adapt and work with the new options that weren't there before, options which will actually make the game look and feel way better, as with all developments it takes time .  Let me also clear something else up.  Vinny Lingham has little to do with Augmented Game, as you pointed out, he got a nice chunk of the company for peanuts, he and everyone else is smart enough to see the future for Augmentors Game is fine.  One again, view the you tube video for the webinar explaining the white paper and why it was changed.",False

Quote (From Christian Moss) Hi yes I did it can be found here https://ledger-cp.herokuapp.com/ it uses the bitcoin app on the ledger so users see they are sending the bitcoin dust but not the token, so  in order to complete the package somebody needs to developer a ledger app for the device as well that can unpack the transaction and diplay the token being sent  the code is open source here https://github.com/mandelmonkey/ledger-cp …  unfortunately im not a c developer so didnt get round to creating it but my understanding is youd need to start by forking the official ledger bitcoin coin app  So ideally we just need a C dev, to finish the process to make it ""whole"".  Which i am actively working on. (finding a C dev to finish the work).  Thank you for the reminder, trezor and actually Ledger wallet support is being worked on, j.dog from Counterparty is doing a great job so by the start of 2018 I'm sure we will see dtb and xcp assets on Ledger at least, as they are far more supportive of altcoins.

Gameplay A number of community members have asked about the game mechanics and how it has changed. Although this will still be refined in the coming months, I’d like to share a high level overview. Before I dive into the new mechanic, some background on the old mechanic. Although the game was well received in the first pre-alpha, we received some great feedback about the turn based dice mechanic that led us to review the game mechanic. The main problem with the turn based dice mechanic was that players would spend a lot of time waiting for the other player which slowed down the game. The mechanic also meant that it was difficult to add a lot of depth to the game. After many iterations over the past two months, we have landed on a strategic real time game mechanic.  Spells and abilities will be represented as cards. Players will be able to add spells and abilities to their creatures over time, and be able to choose a subset of cards before going into battle (similar to deck building in other games). At the start of each match, both players will receive a hand of randomly drawn cards. Each card has a mana cost associated with it. At the start of the match both players will have the same amount of mana, and during the match mana will be produced at a constant rate. When a card gets used a new one will randomly be drawn. This allows players to play their cards at any time removing the delays necessary in a turn based game. The new game mechanic will offer more depth, as players have access to endless (well almost endless) combinations and strategies. It will also allow Augmentors to keep releasing new spells and abilities over time, ensuring that the game stays fresh and interesting. We will keep you posted over the coming months as the new game mechanic is refined.  New team member I am happy to share that we have a new developer, Stefan, joining the team in November 2017. Stefan has a lot of game development experience, and is a welcome addition to the team. As you know we have a lot of big plans, and cannot wait for him to get cracking.  Website The new gamer focussed website was very well received and thank you to all of you for the excellent feedback for future iterations. We’ll do a website update in the next few weeks and include team bios (as many of you requested). I have also heard that the community is working on a “Beginners guide to buying DTB”, if this is complete it would be great to add it to the website with the next update.  Competition — Name the next Augmentors creature and win! Now onto something very exciting, the community competition! We would like to take you all on the journey of creating a new creature. This journey will last 3 weeks and culminate in someone from the community naming the next creature, winning a 3D printed model of the creature and a digital in game token of the creature! Runner up prizes also up for grabs!  3D Model of Anta We will share progress updates like artwork and models during the development of the creature. We kicked off the competition creature journey this week with the first sketches below. As you can it’s already taking shape.  Character development While we share progress updates over the coming weeks you’ll need to get those creative juices flowing. After the 3D model has been shared on November 10 the competition will officially open allowing you to submit the best creature names of all time! The Augmentors team will then choose a shortlist that goes back to the community for a final vote of the winning name! The competition timings:  Competition timings Competition prizes: Winner: Awesome 3D printed model of the new creature. Digital in game creature token (token will be sent to the wallet address of the winner provided during entry). Second prize: An A1 printed poster of Augmentors artwork. An Augmentors branded T-shirt. Third prize: An Augmentors branded T-shirt. Rules: Only Databit (DTB) holders can take part in this competition. Each Databit (DTB) holder can submit a maximum of 5 new creature names. Submission details will include your name, wallet address and entry names. The Augmentors shortlist will be the final shortlist that goes to a vote. Voting will be limited to community members who have entered the competition and be weighted based on Databit (DTB) ownership. The creature name with the most votes wins. If the winning creature name was submitted by multiple participants, the first entry will win.  Crypto meetup  I would like to mention the Crypto meetup organised by one of our community members cr-mn taking place today. You can find more information here. Veel dank cr-mn! Wij waarderen de steun! Thank you very much to Simon for organising some Augmentors t-shirts for the event. Lastly, I would like to end by thanking all of the community members for their support. I realise it is a long time from the token sale to game release, and thank you all for your patience! This community is vital to our success, and we will support and grow it over the coming months.

I have been very vocal (to the point they probably are sick of me already, but if i am having to message them so much, then clearly something needs done) about the importance of $DTB and the volume and buy support.  I think my words have been listened to and the team are now fully aware of the importance of being ""Healthy"" on Bittrex.  Ive also stressed how important it is for databits to always remain on the worlds No.1 altcoin exchange, Bittrex.      At this moment in time it is a mexican stand off.  No one is willing to buy dtb with bitcoin  with BTC in  full Bull mode, other people are happy to have Bitcoin sitting in BTC for the BTC gold freebie and others are simply to afraid to put bitcoin as buy support.   I was asked ""How can we help improve this"" (bittrex situation) and i simply put it to them, buy support = trust.  So clearly there is a lot of work to be done here, to gain peoples trust. There is a hell of a lot more that also needs to be done still on the social front.  And what makes me want to bang my head of my desk daily, i know, as i have seen it first hand, theirs a whole ""Treasure Chest"" of amazing updates they could give....  but the powers that be, are very ""picky"" and unwilling to release much info at this moment in time,  they seem to be under the impression it is best to leave most of the news for when game is fully launched then make a big push on the promotion side.  So we shall see, but i am really frustrated that after countless times explaining and wanting the team to be more active, i am yet again having to try to get them to understand.   I am doing all i can every day, 7 days a week...  i expect some extra support from the team   One thing is  for sure, if this was my start up, id be making sure people put in the ""extra mile"" and effort and made sure everything was on point and nothing was left ""wanting"".   There is NO EXCUSE for team members to so silent on the social front, a lot more effort (and how easy it is to make a FB post, tweet and such) is needed.  In regards to current developments, hopefully we will see new website this week (it is being done by a 3rd party, so out of the Augmentors Teams hands) Then we should see a white paper before Pre Alpha is released for testing, to supporters of the project, some point in Nov  (lets say end of Nov).",False

We will send out public invites once we've managed to formalise things a bit more with the channel and the new mods.  A few rapid-fire updates from the team:  1/4) There were a few concerns raised with the visual changes coming to some creatures and we just wanted to explain our reasoning. We’ve been adding some extra detailing and polishing work and, in some cases, the changes were to make the modelling and animation perform better. Some creatures, for example, have short limbs which makes for uninspiring rigging. Additionally, some of these changes are to better align the creature appearance to their home-realm. So, while dark and grungy has been the theme so far (and we’re not getting rid of it), we’ll also be aiming for a greater variety of light/dark creatures depending on their history and origin. Tidus is the most extreme change as we felt he was looking far too similar to Lionaire. See the Anta face-lift below.    2/4) The latest iOS release has introduced ARKit and boy are we EXCITED. They’ve really notched up what is possible on AR and it’s going to bring a lot to Augmentors. We’ve also been taking a look at ARCore and it’s looking promising too.  3/4) The new website will be launching next month. We don’t want to say too much yet but we can’t wait to show it off.  4/4) Last but most certainly not least, we’d like to take the time to introduce our new team of Mods! VintageBazaar, ViciousDad, Sarutobi and BBristow79 will be joining Adam and working closely with Slade to grow and develop the community, as well as swinging their banhammers on the spammers that have been infiltrating Slack channels crypto-wide.

A lot of hard work has gone into the use case for databits, this has been a long and hard thought out process, thankfully the team have the first class experience of James, who works for Newtown partners and himself and others come up with what I would consider a ideal solution.  There are many legal requirements, not only in crypto but also concerning apple and Android store, so it was no easy task to work out a solution that benefits the game, the holders of dtb and most importantly one that is in line with all laws and regulations, so I am happy to say, it all looks solid, nothing to worry about, especially with recent events on Bittrex, dtb is fully in line with all rules and laws.

The most popular Esports Beat 'em Up Game.  Here you can see some impressive stats https://www.esportsearnings.com/games/434-street-fighter-v  So i will have to beg to differ that people don’t care about a console or mobile game and Esports. Also since mobile gaming, is quite simply booming, it will also work its way into the Esports world,  I highly recommend you read this article  https://www.dexerto.com/news/the-rise-of-mobile-esports-vainglory-clash-royale/30510   Whether mobile Esports is the model of the future remains to be seen. What we know now, though, is that it is a viable platform that has the foundation to succeed and possibly rival the success of the console and PC sports that preceded it.   So i can say with a lot of confidence, Esports is welcoming mobile gaming and the right games will do very well and find them-self on the Esports stages. I know many people are going to be pleasantly surprised by the big impact mobile gaming is having in this space. Augmentors Team can see a opportunity, not many new game developers are thinking about, Augmentors Team have already been forward thinking by using the Bitcoin blockchain, aiming for the Esports world again proves this is a serious team with big ambitions, let’s not forget South Africa is a country with big Esports ambitions.  https://www.redbull.com/za-en/mettlestate-esports-announcement  Augmentors Team is in the right place at the right time.

Also someone from the Bitcoin Foundation involved and yet there is no market maker or support is allowed to be broken time after time.  No other crypto asset performs this badly, basically from a PR perspective appears like an abandoned project at this point. It's all very well saying focused on developing long term value of the project, but neglecting short-term value undermines this. If key support levels are broken in the market, it will never be able to hold long term value and will be a low value token with massive spikes on software release, returning to test lows shortly after.

If the marketers are telling them the main market for a blockchain funded/based game isn't crypto (an industry which has grown exponentially over the past few months and including new major Asian markets) then they have the wrong marketers.   Jesus, just looked on the website and it still says Alpha Release 30th May 2017. Did marketing tell them to leave that up there? There needs to be a change of culture, you can't raise money from a community and then disrespect and resent it by suggesting anyone who cares about there investment is a greedy pumper dumper.  The whole team needs to wake up to the fact that the success of the game depends on us and their 1st impulse should be popularize the game in the lead up to pre-alpha. Right now they have zero online presence. Huge mistake to think they can set the world on fire overnight and that the game will have any longevity is they disregard pre-existing user base.  We are the only people talking about this game, no gaming forums, no facebook casual user groups. We are the basis for word of mouth that would spill over into crypto then mainstream press and ensure that this game is not lost amongst thousands of other games that are released each year. Look at how many followers older crypto users have (10s of thousands, up to 50K) they don't have the budget to buy that kind of publicity and if they had any brains would be harnessing its potential.  BTW I'm not sure they actually read this forum, which is bizarre, seeing as they paid for research as to where to test the pre-alpha and it led them to conclude Facebook of all places where they have miniscule presence and engagement would be the best.

While so far our comms have been focussed on Slack, I thought I'd start by copying some feedback over here:  ""Regarding the timelines shared last week, @svenpetter was spot on when he mentioned the game mechanic change was a big setback.  We have had to go back to the drawing board, and reassess our current situation. Although it is does not seem like good news, we are in a much better place and I know we will deliver a really good game that will increase the long term value of Databits.  I am very sad to see Vintage Bazaar leave, judging by the feedback I’ve seen, he was a very important member of the community.

I completely understand the frustration that you, our backers, have been experiencing and I’m here to help fix that. Your voice and opinion is invaluable to us.  I’ve seen quite a few questions regarding my credentials and suppose it’s not unusual for some of you to be asking so let me tell you all a bit about myself.  I studied a Business Administration degree in Brand Building and Management and have worked at performance digital marketing agencies.  I have also been actively involved in the cryptocurrency space for almost 6 months, spending every spare minute studying and learning everything I can.  I’m an avid gamer and player of logic puzzles. I can solve a Rubik’s Cube in under a minute and regularly play Minesweeper. I am currently playing Battlefield 1, Overwatch and occasionally League of Legends (don’t hate, I’ve been playing since beta). My greatest gaming claim to fame is having held Rank 3 Battlefield 4 pilot in South Africa for a period and also having been one of the highest level Pokemon Go players in the country during the first two months (promise I’ll keep future non-Augmentors gaming talk to #random)  I like to think my skills put me in a position to really help us achieve our goal of making the most kickass mobile game out there. It’s not something that’s going to happen overnight but I truly believe we can make happen if we all work together.  So please, keep the feedback coming. We are listening.

Would you be open to this? We’d like to fly you down and think it would help restore your faith in the team and project.

In that time i have invest in several projects and gained a lot of valuable experience, one of those which we have seen first-hand here in the last few months, is the importance of building and keep a strong community, it just takes a little effort from the project developers and great communities can be built.  It is my mission and long-term goal, to help Augmentors Game grow far and wide within the Crypto community, a community when kept informed, when kept up to date can make great headway in helping this project reach the masses.   How often do you get a opportunity like this in life, to make a investment into a mobile game, that also is aiming towards Esports stardom? Not very often! All of us here, have a chance right now, to make a big difference, I will make sure all investors will have all the knowledge, answers and help they need.  In return, all I ask is that the crypto community will think of ways to help also, no idea is bad, the only bad idea is the one you don’t suggest, I am open to all offers and suggestions.        Now, thinking into the future, when all goes well with the developments of the game, which i am sure it will, then we are most likely to see Augmentors Game go global with Esports.  I would really love to create a Augmentors Esports Team, Built with the most loyal and dedicated supporters of the game and the most adroit players. We would be the First ever gaming team made up from a crypto community and forever be in the history books.  i will let this all sink in..",False

Price is only down because no PR from dev team generally and last couple of days pump/dump of btc. If roadmap proceeds as planned and devs start to actually engage with crypto community, it's a solid buy at these prices for those prepared to wait a couple of months for larger gains.

Thanks to everyone for the kind words of support, been really amazing to see and read. I was not going to post here again, hell, I spent yesterday removing my posts here, ive never done that before, I cant express how much I feel stabbed in the back by the Augmentors Team, so I will mention a few things to give you a idea and understanding as to why I could no longer support the project.  As many people know, I was a ICO investor and been highly involved in helping other investors and community members here, since day 1. I had a big passion for the project and was doing my best every day, 7 days a week, to keep the positive vibe up in the Slack chat, I put in countless hours, trying to build the community, thinking of all kinds of way to help promote the project and get as much public attention to it as possible, to which everything was all going good, the Devs were actively giving us updates, showing us animations of the creatures, showing us artwork and cards for the creatures, all kinds.  Then things started to go quiet.  I used to speak with Kyle on skype, probably once a fortnight, as I was one of the biggest investors and clearly devoted to the game with all the hard work and hours spent helping the community he would give me little updates, which was great, it is the little things like that, that fuels the fire that drives the passion.  Then… about 2 months ago, everything began to get quiet, the little communication I now had with Kyle, I was constantly trying to explain how important the community is, how we should not be “Left in the Dark” and how valuable we are to the project, how we  can help greatly with the building of a strong community and also by offering our services and skills, most likely for free ,to help any other way we could with the game…  All Kyle would ever tell me is ""its up to marketing"" this is the reason ""stone wall"" reply he would give when i was asking for them to give something to you guys, some little update, a creature development, screen shot, just something... but same old and tired reply ""i will see what marketing says"" ..  Well, where is marketing? Who is this marketing team, who, wont allow the Augmentors game to release any info? Seriously? They must be the worst marketing team on the planet if they think holding back information from a community is a clever idea.  You know how frustrating this was to hear.  Sadly and painfully clear, all my advice was falling on deaf ears, i have nearly 4 yrs in Crypto and seen many projects come and go and a lot of the other members who have left had a vast knowledge and could have really helped keep momentum rolling and spirits high even in these quiet times, as long as there was just a small bit of help from the dev team, i was not asking for much, fine have updates only twice a month, but please give the community something to ""chew on"" as i said above, provide a screen shot or two or some animation of a new creature, anything so we could see work was being done and developments were progressing along.  Now we are at this horrible point, where the community is feeling battered and bruised and kicked to the kirb.  I am absolutely furious, how this was left to happen,  Myself and to be fair, at the start ,Adam from Tokenly, helped to build a great  community,  the choice to go almost silent from the Devs, they let it all crumble, to fall apart and left to die.  Just check the twitter account and Facebook, not a single post for nearly 2 months, it does not take 2mins to make a tweet or facebook post, hell, could do it sitting on the toilet, instead of letting the community go down the toilet. There's only so many times a person can ask for help, i felt like i was treading water, calling out to the captain of the boat to throw me a life ring, to keep me afloat, to help others around me, but in the end, i was left to drown.  Then, the final straw that broke this donkeys back, I learn from the new CEO who I spoke with about a week ago, for 30mins, that there was going to be a new community manager.  The Devs actions  of the last few months have pretty much killed the community, so there is hardly a community left to manage and now they are going to bring in some unknown person, that they think this person is going to help the community, how sadly wrong they are.  With the talks I had with Kyle, it was mentioned several times that he was pushing for me to be community Manager, i mentioned how id love to be officially named as the Community Manager since i had been in the role un-officilay since day 1. Now, I don’t know if he said this to keep me “happy” until they got someone else in, but clearly that’s how it looks.   A lot of people wanted to see me as the Community Manager and I would of done a far better job than Kyles mate will do. Clearly it is a friend of the Devs who took the job, often in life, the “Right man” gets screwed over, due to the Boss's friend getting the job. So be it.  Would have been nice to hear it from Kyle and not from the CEO, who id never spoken to before, someone who i thought was listening also to my advice, but clearly as we have seen in the last few days, simply does not care.    Lets rewind a bit, to the earlier days when I was talking with Kyle, he was telling me how they had this big Esports company , he really made it sound like it was one of the well-known companies and that big deals were being made and how they have this amazing Esports advisor to take them into the future…. Well, scroll back about 10 page and you will see .. Marshal Longs face. Serial Crypto scammer, who, if it was not for some other community members bring it to my attention, then myself pushing Kyle and Vinny to look into this person, he would still be advising Augmentors Game. Yeah, I should of know then, I put it down to a “noob mistake” on their side..  Clearly, the team, got what they wanted from the Crypto community, the ICO Bitcoins.  You have all served your purpose here, so move along nothing, like, really nothing to see here anymore.  For the record, Kyle did not even message me to ask why i left, he must have a guilty  conscious and is probably to ashamed to speak with me now. Also, i had not  sold a single $DTB in all the time i was helping the team, for some stupid reasoning, (this was another excuse i was given for the lack of updates) they believed most people here were just in it for the money and did not care about the project.  Well Kyle or any of the team who are reading this and previous comments, how sadly wrong you are, clearly a lot of people here has a passion for the project, not all people in crypto are in it for the money. There are a lot of great people who i have met in Crypto, many who supported the project and  looking forward to being on the journey to see the final, finished developments and play the game. I was really looking forward to showing the game to my son and telling him how i and the community helped to have it made, something i and other people would of been proud to talk about the Augmentors Game. My disappointment in how things have turned out, runs deep and painful.   I want to  take this opportunity to apologise to every who I talked to about Augmentors, how I was singing its praises and I really did have absolutely faith in the team and project, I thought Augmentors Game was going to be my last ever investment in Crypto and I had a vision of being there to help the team for ever, all FREE of charge, I never asked for nor ever would have asked for anything in return, other than to be kept up to date with the developments so I could help and advise the community to the best of my abilities, as an investor I was more than happy to work for my investment and help any way which i could.    So please accept my sincere apologies. For the record I think the game will be a success when it comes out.   I am sorry to all, who i feel i have let down by not being able to turn things around, i gave everything i could, but in the end, it didn't really matter to The Augmentors Game.   But every cloud has a silver lining right?   ",False

Augmentors was one of the earliest ICOs in early 2017. Communication is never the issue and never will be the issue. It's the amount of work the developers put in. There were many many crypto projects that have silent devs but you can see from their github activity they were all coding all the time, so no worries. In fact, when the platform/product is finally released, the price has already climbed 5x - 10x!  What about Augmentors? Ok, the creature developments were a good sign of progress but then as Vintage said complete silence. That in itself is ominous. So, what's happening? Devs giving up? Too much alcohol in Ibiza? Then the confirmation comes. New team, roadmap pushed back.  Yeah, ok. I'll just hold while these guys take their time as they work leisurely and unprofessionally. This is not fud. You can check their past promises.  IMHO, there is a large chance nothing happens on ""second half of 2018"". LOL, Android game developers can push out new games in three months! I don't think the gameplay of Augmentors is that complex to take almost a year with nothing to show.  Furthermore, it's all excuses and excuses. This has happened before. Don't fall into the trap that ""This time it will be different"".  Fucking amateurs passing off as revolutionary game devs. Sell and take profits while you can. If wrong, ok.

The Augmentors creators and founders (Michael Deon and Kyle Haffenden) have realised that in order to achieve their vision for Augmentors they need to focus their attention on game creation. Realizing this, and in collaboration with the Augmentors advisors, they have brought a CEO on board to support and guide Augmentors to greatness.  We’re thrilled to announce that Gert Kruger (https://www.linkedin.com/in/gert-kruger-19b04b7/) has joined the Augmentors team as CEO. Gert has a technical and engineering background, and brings a wealth of business expertise. He is an avid gamer and we are very excited to have him on board. We’ll make sure that you get to know Gert a little better in the coming months.   The Augmentors white paper has been finalized and will be made available to you as soon as possible. The delay is due to a patent investigation that is currently underway to protect the value of the game, databits and the unique way that databits will be used in-game. Hopefully, this will be another world-first.  Following extensive market research, we’ve realised that Slack is not an appropriate gaming community channel and this Slack group is thus not where we will build our primary gaming audience. This channel serves as a medium of communication between ICO backers, databit holders and the Augmentors team.  Significant marketing progress has been made and we have a clearly defined target audience. To ensure that we get valuable and actionable feedback during Alpha we need our target audience to be our Alpha testers. We will build a community for Alpha (using Facebook) and will confirm an official Alpha date soon. We would love for all of you to get involved, if you don’t already, ‘like’ us on Facebook.   The Augmentors team is completely focused on producing a world-class, globally successful game. This in turn will create long-term value and growth for Augmentors and databits. We realise that some of our backers in this Slack community are short term traders and we would like to clarify our position on databits. We are not focused on the day to day price of databits nor on short term price hyping. We are focused on long-term value and hope you will join us for this exciting journey.

The last update said: ""We are not focused on the day to day price of Databits nor on short term price hyping. We are focused on long-term value and hope you will join us for this exciting journey."" In other words, they are confusing basic PR with hyping. This is naive and will result in exactly what they say they don't want: with little community engagement and marketing there is little interest in this project/game/coin, but interest and price will spike upon release of the game, resulting only in a hyped pump and dump.

I still insist that $5.0 per DTB is pretty real target (for the start).  For comparison, BitcoinDark marketcap is $93,806,096, circulating supply is 1,288,862 BTCD, price is $72.78 per BTCD.  The difference is 20x less coins, but price is 100x higher.  Main difference is that BTCD is useless abandoned coin with no development, DTB is limited supply of game tokens and the project itself backed by well known players in this space like V. Lingham (check out CIVIC) with real development.  Also there is a Byteball cap of $210,923,398. This is free coin for bitcoin holders.  So what this all is about?

Answer: Augmentors Game will still be the best AR Game based on the Blockchain, allowing players to truly own their creatures and to train/nurture them to become the best in the field. We like to refer to our creatures as pets that everyone can carry around with them. Let them become your companion!!

If i had to guess he bought in royally and is planning to use the momentum from the early alpha release to do a quick P&D.  Reason why i'm thinking this is that from what i know of this guy, he doesn't do anything unless it directly benefits him. Taking this narrative he probably got the advisory role to get some insider info, and when he realized progress is coming along nicely, he figured out he could capitalize on it quickly if they release it in an early alpha and the positive noises give an impulse to the coin.  Don't take my word for it, but i'm positive this guy is bamboozling one way or the other.",False

LOL More then 2 months after ICO ""finished"".  I put it in brackets because of reason since it had not finished before everyone have their exact creature and not a token, but a creature and everything that was not sold in ICO is burned. All this worries me but I just hope that since they were sort of thrown into blockanization by Vinnie they are way better at making a game then this sort of simple distribution and burning.  My humble expectations was that it will be done till end of April. And I say humble. Not to mention only timeline there is is End of May to have working alpha.  The worse thing will be if everything will be same as it is now when end of May comes. ICO not finished, no road map, no alpha.

Over the last few weeks, we’ve received a few requests from the community to re-evaluate the economies of Databits. Thank you for reaching out with all your comments and concerns; we’ve taken them all into consideration.   We said during the ICO, we would retain 30,000,000 Databits for use by the company during development of the game. After the ICO, and after the feedback received from our backers, we considered and debated whether the current agreement is in the the best interests of our most important stakeholder, our backers.   After  studying several options to determine the best way of adjusting the Databits allocation so as to  ensure that all stakeholders are correctly incentivised, this is our final decision on Databit allocation:   1.   As described during the ICO, we will burn all unsold Databits from the 70,000,000 allocated for the ICO. During the ICO, we sold 15,217,819 DTB and thus, the remaining 54 782 181 Databits will be burnt.1 2.   The company will reduce our Databit holding to 30% of total Databits in circulation and not the previously advertised 30,000,000 Databits. Thus, the company will retain 6,521,922 Databits.1 3.   This means that the total number of unburnt Databits will be 15 217 819 (from Backers) and 6 521 922 (from the Company) or 21,739,741 Databits and the total number of Databits to be burnt will be 78,260,259 Databits.1   We believe that this action will protect the interests of our community and that stakeholders’ interests are aligned. Backers will now control 70% of the market cap of Databits. Furthermore, as a company, we are confident that we can execute the development, marketing and launch of the game using the ICO funds and remaining 6,521,922 DTB.1   In terms of process, all outstanding Databits earned during the ICO will be distributed prior to the 1st of April, as indicated in the terms and conditions. The bounty campaign Databits will be distributed over a 3-month interval starting on the 1st of April. Lastly, once all Databits have been successfully distributed, the outstanding Databits will be burnt. An update with more details will be released closer to the time.   Thank you once again for all the support you have shown us. We look forward to sharing an update on the progress of Alpha’s development soon.   Many thanks,   The Augmentors Team",False

No problem at all. I just want this thing to be explained then... The statement from Slack looks to be ok, given the fact the amounts were later sent out from that address. Though it is not clear why God tokens need to be distributed from a special address, while ALL other tokens are distributed from the original one !:)). Well, thats minor thing. BUT! I know one thing - a fact! - At the time when CryptoRials posted ""I just received my god token."" , according to counterparty explorer, GODTOKEN was EVER available ONLY at two addresses: 7 tokens at the original distribution address (1Rjkk2nrfmFbYN3fvxkdsEQi6QtJPnWKS), and 44 tokens at another address (1HfaBHd8ShsbNAJQ8HG2SjrS5R2N8nwKMz).

Over the last few weeks, we’ve received a few requests from the community to re-evaluate the economies of Databits. Thank you for reaching out with all your comments and concerns; we’ve taken them all into consideration.  We said during the ICO, we would retain 30,000,000 Databits for use by the company during development of the game. After the ICO, and after the feedback received from our backers, we considered and debated whether the current agreement is in the the best interests of our important stakeholder, our backers.  After  studying several options to determine the best way of adjusting the Databits allocation so as to  ensure that all stakeholders are correctly incentivised, this is  our final decision on Databit allocation:  As described during the ICO, we will burn all unsold DTB’s from the 70,000,000 allocated for the ICO. During the ICO, we sold 15,217,819 DTB and thus, the remaining 54 782 181 DTB will be burnt. The company will reduce our Databit holding to 30% of total Databits in circulation and not the previously advertised 30,000,000 DTB. Thus, the company will retain 6,521,922 DTB. This means that the total number of unburnt Databits will be 15 217 819 (from Backers) and 6 521 922 (from the Company) or 21,739,741 DTB and the total number of Databits to be burnt will be 78,260,259 DTB.   We believe that this action will protect the interests of our community and that stakeholders’ interests are aligned. Backers will now control 70% of the market cap of Databits. Furthermore, as a company, we are confident that we can execute the development, marketing and launch of the game using the ICO funds and remaining 6,521,922 DTB.  In terms of process, all outstanding DTB’s earned during the ICO will be distributed prior to the 1st of April, as indicated in the terms and conditions. The bounty campaign Databits will be distributed over a 3-month interval starting on the 1st of April. Lastly, once all DTB’s have been successfully distributed, the outstanding Databits will be burnt. An update with more details will be released closer to the time.  Thank you once again for all the support you have shown us. We look forward to sharing an update on the progress of Alpha’s development soon.  Many thanks,  Kyle & Michael",False

I don't know any Counterparty compatible wallet for Windows, however IndieSquare is a great XCP mobile wallet. There's no central server with regards to Indiesquare connecting to XCP nodes. You can also use Tokenly.  The browser-based wallet (Counterwallet) uses HD addresses which all your addresses and private keys are derived from the passphrase. You can interchangebly use the same passphrase with Indiesquare. Though I don't know the exact derivation path it uses. Maybe you can find out for us and share here. https://iancoleman.github.io/bip39/ Thanks.",False

However how does it keep the information about all the additional addresses I have created? How does it know how many addresses I have in my wallet currently?

I don't blame them considering people will invest regardless, you might as-well try and protect yourself as best as possible. Likewise a-lot of the stuff was to cover regulatory issues.  As I've said to a-lot of people most ICO's and cryptocurrencies are done on good faith. It's at the core of a-lot of things. I agree you take the risk but that's part of investing. I do see where you're coming from though. Unfortunately or fortunately that's one of the elements of crowdfunding. If you were a VC you'd probably have a-lot more negotiating power.  Likewise I disagree with the binary of it's either going to succeed massively or not. Look at past similar crowd-funds (SoG & Beyond The Void) both relative successes before their products had even come out. Similarly blockchain collectables like ""PEPE"" haven't even required mass adoption to be a 'success'. In my opinion mass adoption in a global market is just one opportunity for this to be massive but it could easily be a success just amongst the community here (believe it or not).

It also tends to be the 'whales' with enough brains to discern a potential profitable ICO when they see one. Likewise small-time investors are put off by other factors like potential scams and again sadly aren't sometimes able to tell. There's lots of different factors really, including the early notification to SoG investors who were already knowledgable in the area and probably wealthy enough. Could get into it but would probably end up going off on a tangent for ICO's in general.    Well I don't mind posting, I know other 'whales' are deliberately not shouting from the roof-top. Personally I'm hoping for over $1 million of investment so I want to keep awareness up. It would be remiss of me to say the project still represents good value if you get in now or later. I said to someone earlier I don't enter ICO's for 20-30% profit Furthermore the added package incentives such as limited cards can be played to your advantage if you choose the right package/creature. I am bias none the less.  1. It's quite clear to me that the investments are real. In a multitude of ways, not least the fact that if they weren't would imply the whole thing a scam. The escrow address can be viewed here FYI: https://blockchain.info/address/32m58KhzMxYFh5L6UVG6U2ort65snJffP9. I'm also one of the most frequent faces amongst cryptocurrency Slacks (I know it's terrible, but I like to know everything I can), so yes I recognise and know some active big 'whales'. With regards to Bitcointalk activity unfortunately I/we get the feeling the Augmentors team aren't the biggest fans or most experienced of Bitcointalk. This 'issue' has been raised. Likewise as you said people may be keeping quiet for fear of dilution. There may be other reasons too.  2. Of the listed team members two of the developers have years of experience behind them: http://bit.ly/2kfPDrF http://bit.ly/2jW4tov. The founders also have design, branding, management experience and innovation/ambition. Likewise the mentoring of verified, public figures in the two 'shark-tank' investors they have on board.

Nice observations.  For me, the risk/reward ratio is good on this one, not just for the valid points above, but also because of the work already gone into it, together with the stated intention to release an alpha in 3 months. This is not a game project at the start of its journey. Therefore a large amount of risk has been removed or reduced, already. I would avoid like the plague if this was just starting, as the percentage of newly born game projects that go on to release, is small. Also, it would not be absolutely correct to approach this in the same way as coin release, where extra features, and updates, and news, etc. deciding what value it has at any given time. For me, its binary....it gets released within 6 months, and is used by thousands, or it does not. Stress-free gambling works for me.    ",False

There is just one more question raised by @stereotype post... I exactly had an impression this is a game project at the start of journey, as I have not seen any 3D animation or such parts of the game released for public to get some feeling of the game. The 2D pictures of characters, and two videos are not telling me much, as that could be done by painter and video artist, without any real 3D rendering. So when you tell this game project has a lot already, do mean there are real things to look at - such as parts of source code, some 3D animated user controlled flash pieces or .3DS files? Or you base on the pictures and videos only? BTW, it could be helpful to tell the developers to release few working pieces, so people get the feeling there is something already achieved during the pre-alpha stage...

The short answer to your question is: I don't expect to have that level of development presented in ICO like this.  I don't know if you meant this question with regards to 'proof' or from a point of analysing the effectiveness or otherwise of the code. I only mention this as you previously questioned whether funds were actually being invested. Not trying to be rude and it's certainly a good thing to ask questions  I believe parts of the code/imagery have been developed already. As I said I rarely see an ICO with more than a proof-of-concept. Normally because the funding is required to fund the development of the project. In this sense any additional content/context such as pictures/videos as you've mentioned is useful.  I agree the more of the finished product released could bolster investors interest. I would imagine there may also be disadvantage with releasing unfinished code as-well though. Either way I'm happy with the current progress of things so I have no reason to request such things.  Lastly I'd note the Slack is useful in communicating with the developers and the rest of the team. They have on occasion posted pictures of game development. See below:,False

Would appreciate any info, probably I have missed a lot of info on this project.  My first impression on this was - ""this is scam"". Too many question raised:  1. The game is developed since Mid-2016, but is there any live demo or pre-alpha to look at? Are those developers capable of creating such game? Any info of their previous projects?  2. T&C put all the responsibility on shoulders of investors. Developers guarantee absolutely nothing. So theoretically they can work for a year, spend all the money by getting high wages, and having fun, and then just tell ""sorry the public was not interested in the game, and we decided to stop it at alpha stage. No sources, no demo, sorry. Bye"". What prevents them from doing that?  3. The ICO progress doesnt seem to be traceable. Is there a way to check whether all those money were really invested?  But then I saw few BCT old-timers here backing this project, and I actually know and respect some of them... So my question is - what do I miss here? What makes you guys think this project is not just another money grab? Any links to info which makes you think the team is real, capable and is actually intending to complete this? Is it just the ""famous"" South African investors, who make you believe this project? As far as I can see they invested way less than crowdfunding goal is, so they may be a ""part of the deal""..?     EDIT: see what is happening at Ascendancy ICO thread...! And they had actual escrows, who are responsive to Bitcointalk community, unlike this project! If something happens, will those ""real-world"" escrows give a shit to Bitcointalk backers?

Or take the MASS Network project, which I actually invested in. Brilliant, well-thought idea presented in whitepaper with all kinds of real-world advisors involved. I personally had extremely high hopes to it, was excited to the extend I even recommended it to some people, which I typically never do. Now their ICO is over, the half of the team has silently left, and they left people wondering if there is anybody still working on the project... That specific case raised my internal FUD susceptibility a lot    I hope this one is different. Funny, Lingham invested 50 BTC for 20%, now they ask more than 1000 BTC for 70%, so Lingham had more than 5x bonus already compared to us regular investors. Not bad The T&C may be standard for ICOs here (I dont know actually), but they sound really bad and are unacceptable for real world business investors, as at least commitment should be made for actually producing a working software, even if it's not popular. I cannot imagine a serious businessman providing money to some team, with them promicing him nothing back, except their ""reasonable efforts"".

I know for a fact a-lot of people currently involved aren't talking/bumping the subject too much because they don't want to dilute their share.  I feel obliged to at-least post once on the ICO thread  You'll have to excuse the rather silly bitcointalk and bounty related issues. It's my understanding the directors don't have much experience on bitcointalk and that's the reasons for those issues. Trust me, I don't like to see them either.  One the main things I liked about the project was the economic model that actually gives some real value/utility to the crypto token (50% of fiat revenues is converted to DTB and then burned forever).  Likewise the mention of reputable investors in the space puts my mind at ease.  Downsides are it's a little rough around the edges and the game itself has to work. However as it's already raised over $500k and increasing today I can see it easily reaching it's $1million target. As a backer/trader I think just over $1million would be the optimum amount I would want it to raise. Whilst I understand people don't want them raising too much as it dilutes their own holdings it does come with several benefits such as: more resources to complete the game, increased expectation/necessity to produce a quality game & actually dilutes the influence/risk of the remaining development/bounty funds whilst actually increasing their worth/capability.  I am fortunate enough that I have made a profit in every ICO I have entered so far. Just waiting for some bad luck now  Anyway pop over to the Slack and join the Augmentors community today!

Let us introduce to you Augmentors Game.  A new dimension in gaming has arrived. Unseen by many, controlled by the highest-ranking DESTINED, it’s where reality and illusion collide as you summon your creatures into the real world to do your bidding.  Only the strongest succeed as you trade, sell and buy creatures, relics and potions in the battle to be the best of the best!  Official Website - Packed with lots of information.    www.augmentorsgame.com  Meet The Team   https://www.augmentorsgame.com/meet-the-augmentors-team/  WHITE PAPER  DATABITS ECONOMY DESIGN 2.0 – WHITEPAPER  https://www.augmentorsgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/25052018-DatabitsWhitepaper-v2.1.2.pdf  Important: You Tube recording of our Webinar explaining the white paper in more detail (Must View)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXe9qp1e4ws  TOKEN SALE AND PRE SALE (ICO)  Augmentors raised $1 million USD (895 BTC) during the 30-day token sale, which ended in February 2017. At the time, it was the most successful token sale ever conducted by a mobile video game project and it was also the first token sale conducted in South Africa.  We created 100 million Databits in total for fundraising and the exchange for 1 Bitcoin (BTC) was 15 000 Databits (DTB).  23 million (22,747,809) Databits were issued during the token sale and the remaining 77 million (77,252,191) were burnt.  Of the 22,747,809 Databits issued, 70% was utilised in the token sale crowdfunding campaign and the remaining 30% will be used to fund the development of the game, to create awareness and for promotion.  Augmentors also did a pre-sale exclusive with Spells of Genesis where we released a limited edition Augmentor,  Genesis of Light, which would not be available at any other time. Out of the 1000 available to supporters,  67 were sold, 20 were sent to Spells of Genesis owners, and 913 units were ‘burnt’.  Those who supported the Augmentors project received a special portion of Databits, and a selection of rare,  one-of-a-kind creatures relating to the size of their contribution. For the token sale, 25 of the 50 total creatures were allocated and are never to be re-released. Those who purchased more Databits received higher level Augmentors,  such as Champion, Ultimate, Hero, Villain, and god status. The only way to obtain these rare creatures now  is through a trade or sale with another player. Token sale participants will be able to select their rare, one-of-a-kind creatures before game release.  TERMS AND CONDITIONS  Augmentors token sale – Sales agreement   https://www.augmentorsgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/170130.cln-Augmentor-ICO-Sale-Agreement.pdf  Augmentors token sale – Terms and conditions  https://www.augmentorsgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/170130.cln-Augmentor-ICO-TCs.pdf    PARTNER, PREMIUM AND PUBLIC CREATURE STORES  During the token sale some participants received partner and premium store access for their contribution. Premium and public Augmentors creatures, relics and skins will first be made available to these participants  in the partner and premium store before remaining assets move to the public store.  PARTNER STORE (PLATINUM PACKAGE)  The partner store will offer public and premium creatures, relics & skins (assets) for Databits. All the public and premium  assets will be first available at the partner store. One month later they will then be offered on the premium or the public store.  70% of the total supply of each public asset and 30% of the total supply of each premium asset will be available  at the partner store. Each package is subject to discounted rates depending on the package bought.  PREMIUM STORE (GOLD AND DIAMOND PACKAGE)  The premium store will offer 50% of the total supply of the premium assets. Those will be available one month after the asset release on the partner store. Each asset will be on sale for a week. If there is any stock left,  it may reappear later. Augmentors will keep 20% of the total supply of each asset. For the assets produced  in partnership with another project, Augmentors reserves the right to allocate a reasonable amount of the asset supply (out of the 20% kept by Augmentors) to the partner project. Each package is subject to discounted rates depending on the package bought.  PUBLIC CREATURE STORE  The public store will sell public blockchain creatures, relics and skins for Databits and distribute free assets , including free creatures, relics and skins. The public assets will be available approximately a month after  their release on the partner store. The number of assets available for sale will be limited for each sale.  All items will be sold using flash sales, lasting a few hours or days.   DATABITS (DTB) AND WHERE TO trade  once the game has been released will be able to use their Databits to purchase creatures, relics and skins.
