""We are proud to announce the launch of E-XBRL! This financial reporting solution marks the first real-world business application of the SophiaTX Blockchain. Yesterday, we officially announced the launch of our first product and first application of the SophiaTX Blockchain in business – E-XBRL. The solution is designed to simplify and automate financial reporting and operates in line with the recently introduced Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM) requirement for all public and private companies to digitally file their annual financial statements via the Malaysian Business Reporting System (MBRS) platform. Here’s how it works:  The E-XBRL solution focuses on accelerating and improving the accuracy of the financial reporting process by enabling users to bypass the cumbersome and costly process of manual data entry by auto-generating submission-ready reports from data input into the MBRS-ready master template developed for E-XBRL.  MBRS reports generated through E-XBRL are permanently recorded and encrypted on the SophiaTX Blockchain, allowing for the immutable sharing of data across the financial data supply chain while impeding data tampering and unauthorised revisions. Thus, data shared on E-XBRL is more accurate, consistent, and transparent than when pushed through paper-based processes which slow down productivity.""  https://www.sophiatx.com/e-xbrl-launched-we-proudly-present-our-first-product/",False

Even the chief shiller on twitter called the swap a debacle: https://twitter.com/cryptobuffsaur/status/1022170072016666626  Do we agree as well, the sentiment, scanned by trading-bots, on twitter is pretty negative now about SophiaTX and the swap execution? https://twitter.com/crytolee/status/1015330652357562371 -> Here they claim exchanges will do the swap! https://twitter.com/rustam_entrp/status/1021810606360420352 https://twitter.com/Pubic_hash/status/1025017812794916864 https://twitter.com/mr_crypto9/status/1034430303119519745 https://twitter.com/cryptodildo/status/1022063127532396547  4) Why does it take so long to implement the mainnet for the exchanges?

It is true that the remaining ERC-20 tokens can be sold onto a second market (by the person who still holds the ERC-20 tokens, not the SophiaTX team), however the SophiaTX team already has announced that they will have a buyback program for these old tokens:  Quote The team has decided to introduce a voluntary “Buy-Back” program for all “old” ERC20 tokens. As per previous communication, the “old” ERC20 tokens are no longer valid for the token swap for ""new"" tokens (native to new mainnet). The “Buy-Back” will be done at the rate of 1 “new” token for 20 ""old"" ERC20 tokens (1:20). These tokens will be bought back by the team and represent a fair mechanism; this allows the SPHTX team to distribute more tokens to the existing community, which has been very supportive of the project. At the same time, it allows for the process to eliminate “old” tokens from circulations. The procedure will be available later in August, and the “Buy-Back” campaign will last until at least the end of September.  https://www.sophiatx.com/storage/web/SophiaTX_Update.pdf?_t=1533037375",False

I would consider the token swap as failed : •   Trading was not stopped on exchanges after/during the snapshot and swap. •   People were told to keep their tokens on exchanges in order to participate the swap automatically •   Unfortunately some exchanges did not participate and did not even know about the swap? •   Currently funds are locked in the web-wallet? All exchanges locked the wallets, e.g. no deposit or withdrawals possible? •   No public communication available when deposits and withdrawals are available again? No estimate, no outlook, , no transparency no nothing?  People go to SAP because they know how to handle upgrades, complex landscape transformations and core business processes. If you consider a token swap as a core business process of a blockhain company, I would call this one a fail.  This is not how you qualify your company for large-scale Enterprise IT, by demonstrating excellence in execution.",False

Sure it allowed to check and operate pre-existing balances, but without new address creation option it was mostly useless to the people who didn't register their tokens before the mainnet launch. So that no one could buy tokens on an exchange and withdraw it to one's own address and so on. Very few people would bother to install the full client. So with the ERC20 tokens obsoletization and no convenient options to move the new coins around its trading has been practically stopped.  Now that you can at least create a new address on the new blockchain, trading will finally recover, I hope.  There aren't many projects that had an ICO that at least seemed fair, with real faces representing the team, with a plan that looks serious and with real work being done and released, not just rebranded fork from another coin.

In July (date to be defined) SophiaTX will launch its mainnet and this means a fully independent chain with its own tokens, and from there and forward you will need to exchange your ERC20 token for the new ones that will be created in the new chain, this period is called swap period. I don't know this yet but maybe some exchanges can manage the swap and in there you don't need to do anything just keeping the coins inside the exchange, but I prefer to have my tokens in my own wallet.  If you have more questions don't hesitate to ask.",False

Especially in regards the certification and the indirect usage topics.  My feedback: Very general and vague, I have never raised the question if SophiaTX will compete in the area of ERP w. SAP.    This answer somehow gives the impression their only strategy is to make my questions look ridiculous, because they won’t provide a precise answer.  As well these guys seem not to have noticed that SAP is not an ERP-only company anymore, but became a cloud- and platform-technology vendor in the recent years. And in this area of cloud-technology Leonardo Blockchain is obviously highly strategic for SAP.  https://www.sap.com/investors/en/reports.html#pdf-asset=46e32ecb-ff7c-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff&page=7  My question was if they plan to compete w. SAP in the area of Blockchain-solutions and if they are confident to compete against the SAP manpower and salesforce midterm.    My guess is, that they will be locked out by SAP either by the customer relations of the SAP salesforce, or due to violation of license terms like 3rd party usage. As well the independent of SAP story is very suspicious to me; there are many certified partners of SAP that have other competitive strategic partnerships as well.  https://www.opentext.com/what-we-do/partners-and-alliances/strategic-partners https://www.mendix.com/solution-providers/ https://www.sas.com/en_us/partners/find-a-partner.html#global-partners  What really sounds pretty strange: They pretend not to be a partner of SAP, but to be independent on the one hand side; on the other hand side they have a banner behind them which claims: “World’s first open source Blockchain for SAP”. And even this claim is obviously wrong: https://blogs.sap.com/2018/01/15/build-business-blockchain-using-scp-hyperledger-composer-and-scp-cloud-connector/  But hey, this is crypto. Even Dogecoin has a market cap. of 600 mio.    I leave it to the community to get in touch w. Raimund Gross on twitter: https://twitter.com/grossrai?lang=en  PS: SAPPHIRE is probably a good opportunity for SAP to announce hot news about strategic hype topics like Blockhain? https://events.sap.com/sapandasug/en/home.html?bc=1",False

The reason for being independent is that we service and integrate equally with many other software vendors and want to be commercially free from any particular restrictions. Example of such a strategy is Salesforce www.salesforce.com, also the one who got away.    It is possible that some of our products may become certified by SAP, however that remains to be decided when and if required.  In terms of capability to compete with SAP, the question is rather larger, is SophiaTX capable of competing in large enterprise blockchain segment?  The answer is yes, we are able to compete on several dimensions: costs, speed to market, and professional service.  Of course only future will tell, however who would would think that online bookstore would turn into one of the largest companies today.  At the same time it makes sense to ask the question if large software providers such as SAP can compete with blockchain industry:  speed to market, low cost base, and true innovation.  Again, there are countless examples that SAP and other large players have been outcompeted and disrupted.",False

In case they see themselves as a partner, the following questions come into my mind:  1) When will the SPHTX solution be certified by SAP? https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2013_09_adpd/enEN/#/solutions  2) When will we see a joint press release about the partnership other than recent one from SAP Africa? https://news.sap.com/africa/2017/10/02/sophiatx-open-source-platform-to-integrate-sap-blockchain/  Shouldn’t it be published by SAP Germany or SAP Swiss, why was it published by SAP Africa in the past?  3) Any joint presentations at SAP conferences like SAPPHIRE or TechEd planned?  4) Any public opinion or statement by Raimund Gross, Innovation Blockchain Manager@SAP, about SophiaTX available? https://twitter.com/grossrai?lang=en https://events.sap.com/teched/en/session/36837  In case they see themselves as competition, the following questions come into my mind:  1) Why should a CIO invest in a crypto start up Blockchain solution, if he can have a strategic Blockchain solution by SAP? http://assets.dm.ux.sap.com/TechEd/TechEd_Vegas2017/pdfs/CPL200_49430_Presentation_1.pdf https://blogs.sap.com/2018/01/15/build-business-blockchain-using-scp-hyperledger-composer-and-scp-cloud-connector/  Isn’t an integrated solution provided by the vendor superior to 3rd party tools, especially in regards to software standardization which is always the main focus of SAP implementations?  2) Does the SPHTX team think they can compete with the developer manpower and unlimited resources of SAP to compete with future Blockchain innovations by SAP? https://www.sap.com/products/leonardo/blockchain.html  3) How does the SPHTX team position their B2B Blockchain solution compared to SAP best-practise and reference architectures and tools like HANA Cloud Integration or SAP Process Orchestration? https://www.sap.com/germany/products/hana-cloud-integration.html https://archive.sap.com/documents/docs/DOC-27464  4) Can the SPHTX team confirm that their solution is complaint to indirect access license terms by SAP?

Ernst & Young (EY) and Equidato Technologies AG (Equidato) are pleased to announce that at the NEWMATEC 2018 Conference (13 to 14 March 2018, Partizán Hotel, Tále) they will jointly present a concept of automotive supply chain management support using blockchain technology.  One of the biggest challenges which car makers currently face is undoubtedly the management of supplier relations. Manufacturers and large suppliers at higher supply chain levels typically use robust ERP systems, whereas suppliers at lower levels of the chain use less sophisticated solutions or even office applications. Heterogeneity and interconnectivity of IT environments and insufficient visibility of relevant information among individual actors in the supply chain represent the main technical problems requiring a response.  One of the possible solutions seems to be the use of innovative blockchain technology, which includes features such as a shared ledger of transactions, ensured trust without the need for central authority, a shared consensus principle and a timestamp. Last but not least, blockchain technology is capable of ensuring the availability, scalability, irreversibility and retrospective verifiability of transactions using the most advanced cryptographic algorithms.  The specific concept of blockchain technology use in automotive supply chain management is being jointly developed by EY, a global leader in provision of professional advisory services, and Equidato, a technology company developing the SophiaTX Blockchain platform, focused on integration of blockchain with enterprise systems of the ERP type. The companies plan to present their concept at the NEWMATEC 2018 Conference, which will take place on 13 and 14 March 2018 at the Partizán Hotel in Tále....",False

To facilitate transactions of data and of their proprietary BTRN token, and to host smart contracts between data providers (our users) and data customers.  To reduce the significant investment in infrastructure Biotron decided to seek a partnership with an existing blockchain solution. The sheer volume of transactions and smart contracts (required to provide customers with Biotron’s analytics products) meant that solutions such as Ethereum, Multichain, Waves, and Ark, would not be sufficient. Of these blockchains, only Ethereum is capable of handling smart contracts in limited amounts. However, their transactions are expensive and the blockchain is notoriously slow.  “When deciding on a blockchain, we needed to think about how our analytics could be easily assimilated into an organisations’ existing ecosystem too.” – Pavol Magic, CEO  Biotron sought a partner with an organisation that was just as business focussed as their data analytics’ solution. One that understands how they are using analytics to drive business decision making; and in turn, how businesses will use those analytics. Naturally, the solution had to have all the features required technically and be robust enough to handle potentially hundreds of thousands of micro-transactions quickly.

They are developing their own blockchain platform purpose-built for integration with enterprise applications such as SAP, Oracle and others. The team announced that items planned for delivery in Q1 of 2018 are already complete and overall the project is almost 2 months ahead of schedule.  Since the end of their successful TGE (Token Generation Event) in late December, they opened a pre-registration for an Early Adopters Program. The program is intended for individuals interested in partnering with the team to prototype and develop SophiaTX based applications. As of today, more than 3000 individuals have pre-registered. The program is being finalized and will gradually be launched in late February and March .   “The Test Net is available only via full registration, we will collaborate with participants in designing, building and using SophiaTX right way.“ said Jaroslav Kacina, SophiaTX CEO in a recent interview.  The SophiaTX Marketplace is currently being designed and will be delivered ahead of schedule in May 2018.

Their goal is not in exchanges but much bigger target: BRANDING like SAP ""did"" (& they both shake hands as neighbour, like Switz & Bavarian always do, do u know what i mean?). We all know SophiaTX is the A+ grade product(s) with highly experienced team & corporate(group) which put a highlight from Forbes, Nasdaq, etc, and it didn't need massive crowdfunding like startups bcoz the group is already top companies. We invest in the right highly precious gold mine.  We're nothing compared to team's dilligency and high integrity.  Ask ourself what we can do for the team & our asset.  The group has given its investors multiplied profits but it's just only the beginning of unlimited profits : there will be time when fractions or all top Fortune 1000 (or Forbes 2000 or Inc.5000) companies started to use SophiaTX advanced versions and you can see how much cash flow from those giants will flow into Sophia' group & affected yr asset (SPHTX)  By the way, the market needs weak hands either, they're assumed as serum of immunization.  But the coins with bad structure (like EDR and many others) or ponzi coins will never recover.   SophiaTX is in the elite league, no doubt about it.

The project, led by CEO Jaroslav Kacina, has made some noise in the blockchain world as of late. A true testament to that was proven in the first round of their TGE when they generated 30,000,000 SPHTX tokens in just over 24 hours.  That first round set the bar pretty high and the team seems to have rose to the occasion, raising a total of $23,470,356.50 (according to coinmarketcap rates on Monday, December 18, 2017), despite BTC hitting new all time highs, some major exchanges having transaction problems, and the Ethereum network being bogged down.  The total amount of tokens generated came out to 49,145,275.140035644 SPHTX. One of the unique features of their TGE was that all 150 Million SPHTX tokens will be distributed (not burned) as promised to all participants on a pro-rata basis.

It should be: DTC/BTC 0.00003916320000000001 because 1DCT costs this much BTC. So:  0.00003916320000000001*53862.0634988 =2.10941076522 SPHTX for 1 DCT + 10 % = 2.10941076522*1.1 =2.32035184174,False

I think we should consider such a scenario: suppose in the first round we will not buy all 30 million tokens and the amount of 18837ETH will not be collected. Then the round will still end in 48 hours or will it continue until all the tokens are purchased? If the round is over, the second round will begin with the sale of another 30 million tokens at a higher price, and then where will the unsold tokens disappear? Are these unsold tokens moving to the last fifth round?

Another project solved that by, after reaching a threshold, reallocating funds from development to the bottomless pit called marketing.  On a side note, I found an old article about the funding of Ethereum itself.  https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-bitcoin-decline-9-million-funding-shortfall/  They raised 31,529 BTC, then worth $18.4 million.

Anyway, my point was to put SophiaTX's hard cap into perspective. It is more than Ethereum needed, but it also less than the theoretical value of BTC they raised. SophiaTX can probably cut some costs by benefiting from the knowledge gained from other projects too.  Quote from: SophiaTX on December 02, 2017, 11:48:45 AM Even though our roadmap is maybe optimistic, you have to take into account that creating something better from a scratch is always easier than updating the running system. Ethereum has a lot of problems that need to be fixed first for it to be even considered to be used by serious businesses. It wasn't created with international corporations and wast supply chains in mind but SophiaTX is. And blockchain is evolving fast so when they were creating the Ethereum they couldn't know a lot of things that we know now - partially thanks to them. New projects are learning from the mistakes of their predecessor. Until they solve one problem on a running platform we will avoid five just by designing it with the problems in mind.",False

We want to motivate people to invest in the earlier rounds. There has to be some kind of mechanism to reward early investors since most of the people are aversive to a risk and therefore are waiting until they see that the TGE will be successful. If everybody (or just most of the investors) would wait until the last round to see if it will be successful it could fail even though there actually were enough people and enough money for the TGE to be successful.  So if they want to be sure and are willing to pay more for being sure, they can wait until the last round. But if they really believe in the success of our project they are willing to take a little bit of risk to be first to invest and they will trade this risk for more tokens.

For companies to benefit from blockchain they must understand what blockchain is, develop business use cases and ultimately redefine their business models. Blockchain will impact businesses in a similar fashion that dot com revolution did.    Benefits of Blockchain       Fewer Intermediaries  Blockchain is a true peer-to-peer network that will reduce reliance on several types of third-party intermediaries such as banks, lawyers, and brokers.      Faster Processes  Blockchain can speed up the process execution in multi-party scenarios and allow for faster transactions that aren’t limited by office hours.     Transparency  Information in blockchains is viewable by all participants and cannot be altered. This will reduce risk, fraud, and create trust.       Cost Reduction  Distributed ledgers will provide quick ROI by helping businesses create leaner, more efficient, and more profitable processes.       Security  The distributed and encrypted nature of blockchain means it will be difficult to hack. This shows promise for businesses and IoT security.      Automation  Blockchain is programmable – which will make it possible to automatically trigger actions, events, and payments once conditions are met.
