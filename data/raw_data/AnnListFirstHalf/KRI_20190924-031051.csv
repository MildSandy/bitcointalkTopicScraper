We are delighted to inform you all that Krios has been acquired by The Digital Track (TDT). https://www.thedigitaltrack.com More will be revealed about the new lead team soon.  We are now listed on cryptobridge exchange which TDT was responsible for securing. Sign up here https://wallet.crypto-bridge.org/?r=823399 to begin trading  Some of the key points of this new management is: - Firstly all your KRIOS tokens are safe and relevant!! - KRI will be changing from a Utilitiy Token to a Security Token with all relevant documentation and legalities - Dividends of TDT will be paid to KRI holders (much the same way that share holders receive dividends - you will receive ETH simply for holding KRI in your own wallet) - the current business model will now be greatly expanded throughout the Marketing Industry -TDT is an already established marketing company and bring a wealth of opportunity to the Krios project, both through their current networks, and from the team behind TDT. - Dwight Ringdahl is our new CEO and brings a wealth of experience and knowledge in marketing. - a video interview with our CEO will be posted here shortly  With the new ownership, and a new leadership team, this obviously means that the current team will be transitioning away from the business, we thank Chris and his team for all their hard work up until this point and wish them the best in their future endeavours  I'm sure you would all agree that this is the beginning of very exciting times for Krios and we can't wait to begin this new chapter of the company",False

All i can see is still no app in the app store, still no working product, nothing.  A new thing has popped up - they are not distributing that weird ""2nd Bounty"" they did over the time they listed and not giving any answers.  These guys need investigating  I have heard the Australian authorities are watching the telegram & social media and gathering historical things they have said - but I don't know for sure.  Someone said something popped up in the chat from a document or report - she didn't screenshot but sounded alarming.  Matter of time before they get checked out with a fine toothcomb by authorities.  They are pretty much screwed unless they shutdown & hide and get forgotten fast though, the evidence of lies all around the web is overwhelming, and they offered dividends which I would be very alarmed about if I was involved in the project.  Any team member or admin needs to delete all trace and get out and not be implicated by making false claims by proxy.  https://www.smartcompany.com.au/startupsmart/news-analysis/asic-makes-first-moves-against-australian-ico-after-dividend-structure-throws-up-red-flags/  They break almost every rule from the ASIC  https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/digital-transformation/initial-coin-offerings-and-crypto-currency/  They are screwed as it's over and they can't back out or go back and create a prospectus, but check out this from the page:  Application to ICOs When an ICO is created to fund a company (or to fund an undertaking that looks like a company) then the rights attached to the tokens issued by the ICO may fall within the definition of a share.  The bundle of rights referred to above may be used by ASIC to help determine if a token is in fact a share. If the rights attached to the token (which are generally found in the ICO's 'white paper') are similar to rights commonly attached to a share ‚Äì such as if there appears to be ownership of the body, voting rights in decisions of the body or some right to participate in profits of the body shown in the white paper ‚Äì then it is likely that the tokens could fall within the definition of a share.  Where it appears that an issuer of an ICO is actually making an offer of a share, the issuer will need to prepare a prospectus. Such offers of shares are often described as initial public offerings (IPOs).  By law, a prospectus must contain all information that consumers reasonably require to make an informed investment decision.  Importantly, though an ICO may look similar to an IPO, the ICO may not offer the same protections to consumers and may result in liability for the issuer and those involved in the ICO. Issuers of an ICO need to be aware that where an offer document for an ICO is, or should have been, a prospectus and that document does not contain all the information required by the Corporations Act, or includes misleading or deceptive statements, consumers may be able to withdraw their investment before the tokens are issued or pursue the issuer and those involved in the ICO for the loss.

""the Krios platform will be ready by year's end""  Nope.  Another month of nothing from the Krios scam, just like the other 14 months.  No iPhone app - longest app approval ever (Just kidding - we know it doesn't exist and Chris Quinlan lied to ICO contributors about it for months).  I think the earliest record of Krios ICO Scammer CEO Christoper Quinlan lying about the iPhone app to ICO contributors is about in April 2018, when they said it was initially submitted.  10 month app approval haha...  Then a flood of lies in the whole ICO before that.  Paul Holland seems to have exit scammed, nothing from him for months, I actually don't blame the guy for exiting, it's the only thing they could do.  If Paul did rear his head I think people might be scrutinising his comments very closely for reporting to the Australian authorities - may as well stay quiet.  Something to think about:  They said platform by Q1 2018 - we're in Q1 2019 still without anything - kind of funny.  Looking at the psychology in the telegram group is quite interesting, how they still believe and seem emotionally attached to an ICO?  The regulars are types to get emotionally attached, blindly believe what the CEO says (instead of scrutinise to HELL) & chase losses by ""adding to their bags"".  ^ These are the types that lose money in Crypto  ^ The types that make money have unemotional zero bias, make practical decisions based on scrutineering, and look for confirmation/proof of what's happening.  The Krios group of emotionally attached fans is fine with a .pdf file with words on once in a while - really strange.  So far Krios has got away with an android wallet app from Fiverr, video of a not working website platform and a few .pdf files - total cost maybe $200-$800 depending on which Fiverr gigs they bought.",False

Sorry to disappoint but things take time and with crypto their are no guarantees..  Secondly your quote; What have you done with my good friend Krios Whale's money? Why do you keep lying to him? We're certainly NOT good friends, I don't even know who you are. Furthermore dislike you speaking illy on my behalf.   Yeah okay we have ""waited"" awhile but I'm sure you'd rather wait for Krios and or any other project to produce something of a high caliber and quality rather than a trashy unusable service. As obviously this would naturally reflect the coins market value on an exchange. Four years ago (my company at the time) partnered with a platform (not to be named) as a reseller of their world-class digital service, I personally saw the enormous number of hours it took in developing and refining their streamlined platform, assisting businesses across 30 countries and 80+ industries. My point being is that this company had System Architects spend nearly two years building, testing and fine tuning their platform prior to its fully functioning release. Krios will be launching their platform in Q4 this year and have 20 developers on board in achieving a working product within under a year of its conception, so in my opinion their doing bloody well. Their are many coins out there that are months and years off having an actual working product.  Reading your posts did make me chuckle you're practically nit-picking and twisting every bit of info to Krios's detriment, claiming and shouting scam... I firmly believe you're the one that hasn't done his research, it was just the other day that Krios posted a video containing a tutorial walkthrough of the platforms development and progress thus far. So your claims of it being non-existent have just been debunked in the first 1 min of this post.  I've met with Chris and the team previously on two occasions, everything was above board. Their office was slick, professional and complete with a boardroom. The staff were working hard and had been doing plenty of overtime just to get things finished each day; Coin distributions, updates, liaising with developers etc. I left feeling even more confident and excited about the future of Krios than I had before, hearing and seeing their progress for myself.   1.5 million people saw the Krios scam advertisement on facebook in November 2017: https://i.imgur.com/SMnBPO5.jpg   1. Krios scam has nothing to do with Bitcoin. Lol Correct it doesn't. Well spotted Captain Obvious. Krios were simply pointing out to people that had missed the boat of buying Bitcoin whilst it was cheap, that KRI could be their next opportunity to get in on a new crypto coin early.  2. Krios scam now claim that KriosCoin is not a ""cryptocurrency"" after stating that it is in their advertising.  Yeah ok they didn't specify it as a utility coin, so what... It's still a form of currency, people using the platform will be paying for services via KRI as the platforms native currency. At that point in time 'crypto currency' were the buzz words for all cryptos regardless of their type; Currencies, utility tokens, stable coins and privacy coins. But at the end of the day you saw the Krios post though didn't you    thanks to keywords!  3. Krios wasn't disrupting anything in November 2017 and still is not disrupting anything. How can something that hasn't yet been manifested do or disrupt anything. You can't expect anything to happen without a product or service to offer.  4. The price in November 2017 was $0.07, the advertisement states 0.07c ? Same, same..   The Krios ICO scam frontman also has what appear to be false and misleading statements on his website that is selling ""phone discovery sessions"" (for what? Not sure) : https://www.christopherquinlan.com/ The link doesn't work, regardless it's obviously not Krios related and must have been apart of a previous service he may have provided. Your doing well with accusing and assuming using the word 'appear'. Regarding your rally to get people to report Krios to the ACCC, they won't do anything nor will you have a leg to stand on without any cold hard proof of your accusations. Krios haven't failed to provide a product, they've released an Andriod Wallet App in the interim of their platform being built and launched. Krios haven't failed to list on exchanges, they're going through the same processes all other Coins undertake in order to be listed. Regulations have tightened which would certainly slow this process down. Anyway it's not a bad thing at all, if anything protects people from actual scam coins that could've listed. Their are a multitude of hoops to jump through and requirements that must be met in order to be listed.      https://i.imgur.com/RFXH1a6.jpg  See 1, 2 & 3 in red for false statements: https://i.imgur.com/MvhmBPa.jpg  1. Krios $20m revenue - is this the total amount raised in the ICO? What revenue? There is no platform to generate revenue. What is this claim? What have they done with the money? I can't speak on behalf of Krios as I don't work for them or know how they allocate their funds raised however I do know as mentioned before getting a custom platform developed especially one that runs off the blockchain would be an incredibly costly and timely exercise. As with any company marketing and advertising also chews into capital. Those are just two examples of where money would be being spent.  2. No, Krios is not a digital marketing platform, there is no digital marketing that has been done on anything produced by Krios so far. 3. Cryptocurrency? You sold a currency through PayPal? Launching in early 2018? What the Krios platform?? - no it did not. Correction. Hasn't yet.  Let's make that clear - no Krios marketing platform launched - no marketing can or has been done with KriosCoin - platform does not exist. Does not exist!?? Haha the platform was shown off the other day. It does exist. They couldn't have done it any sooner as 95% of it would have been just coding, wireframes and looked plain ugly. No marketing? Marketing is what lead you to Krios in the first place, or you would be none the wiser to its existence. Facebooks temporary ban didn't help but hinder all ICO's.  10 Months - nothing, what have you done with the $20 million ""revenue"". Likely misworded by the writer and Business Valuation at that point in time was intended. (I don't know, again I cannot speak for Krios).  What have you done with my good friend Krios Whale's money? Why do you keep lying to him? I addressed this point earlier.  Everything the Krios ICO scam releases now is to fool both PayPal & gullible ICO buyers that still cling to the project. Blah Blah..  Every partnership ""announcement"" is pointless, every email that comes out is to delay gullible ICO buyers, everything that has been said about a ""working platform"" is a lie - nothing about the platform in the whitepaper has come true, it was all false and misleading claims to sell ICO tokens. All companies experience delays and set backs. Not all projects finish on time. Companies have to readjust and adapt to and with their market. Majority of ICO's haven't gone according to plan and have slightly deviated from their original whitepapers, If they refuse to be flexible and adapt they'll be left behind. Tech and Regulations are changing constantly.  CEO of a ""$20m revenue"" company & and selling phone sessions? A scrambled web of senseless compulsive lies.  Why is the CEO selling phone chats? It sounds like Krios has no money? Is there any proof of Krios having any money to develop anything or where the money is? No - there is no proof that Krios even has any money to create a marketing platform. Proof was released the other day, the platform tutorial video. They have money or how would they pay their developers for even creating the platform. Selling phone chats; I don't know what that's about, as stated earlier must be part of something previous to Krios and entirely separate.  I believe this will be the next move for the Krios ICO Scam to fool Krios Whale and others in to ""waiting"": Yes we've been waiting, no I don't need to be fooled, I expected to wait. If Krios came out with a platform 5 mins after the ICO id be hesitant and wary of how well it'd operate and function.. how well the backend had been built, how many bugs it'd likely have having probably not gone through vigorous beta testing. It also wouldn't have anywhere near as many features/integrations.  A wordpress or wix template will go ""live"" with a ""closed beta"" of the platform and there will be a big hoo ha from the 5 brainwashed Krios victims in telegram. - this will be a white label or out of the box ""freelancer"" style template like this: https://www.enginethemes.com/themes/freelanceengine/ - costs a few bucks on fiverr just like an android wallet app does:   https://www.fiverr.com/starz_developer/develop-any-cryptocurrency-wallet-app https://www.fiverr.com/gracee011/develop-a-ethereum-exchange-and-erc-20-token-wallet-app  ^^Incorrect. You can't get an ""out of the box"" decentralized blockchain/ smart-contract integrated platform that's fully customized.    Think what you will, but it's pointless posting all this here. If you're fed up and wanna sell your coins being a Whale Id happily take them off your hands haha.  PayPal won't give you your money back because you did actually receive what you bought. You bought and received KRI tokens. You technically purchased future advertising & marketing at a discount rate to potentially use on the platform. I'm guessing here but PayPal would probably view it like you've bought a voucher. Meaning no refund.  Krios is NOT a SCAM. I wouldn't be a Whale to simply just throw my money away. Again, I won't and wouldn't be taken for a fool John.  - KriosWhale  #WeAreKRI",False

Ok, sure, things have taken a while to get to this point, however, there has been a reasonable explanation for every move, which some people seem to ignore.  I‚Äôm not going to start with my strongest point, but I will say that if it were a scam the core team would have been long gone by now. You can see they have had to deal with a lot of flack due to the ever changing crypto landscape on the whole and it doesn‚Äôt take a genius to see this at least warrants some merit.  Secondly, if you have been following their social media channels you can see that as recently as a few days ago they posted their first video in what looks to be a series of tutorials on how to use the upcoming platform. This tells you two things; 1. They have a working product that is crazy close to being released and; 2. They want you to know all about it. For gods sake, do you really think a scam project would do that....really?  I have been following this ICO closely since the beginning due to my interest in the digital marketing sector, and while the delays have been unfortunate and perhaps could have been communicated more quickly, that would be my ONLY complaint. The team has made it clear on several occasions that they have been listening, and they have implemented a community competitions prize pool, that is obviously aimed at nurturing a positive and active community.  As someone who has supported the project from the very beginning, and I‚Äôm talking pre-sale, I really hate seeing unwarranted hate and lies spread by people who clearly haven‚Äôt been paying attention, I‚Äôm a lurker and I generally don‚Äôt like publicly commenting, but when I see this garbage it makes me angry.  Good luck to you Sir, because you are going to need it if you are going to remain so rigid and don‚Äôt pay attention in an ever-evolving crypto world.  #WeAreKri          ",False

This one's a classic: $5 on the platform, felt very tempting to purchase hearing that, maybe I thought the coin can go to $5, it wasn't to mislead, was it? The $5 platform price doesn't work due to basic economics - $5 has to pass through the whole system and be worth $5 when it is withdrawn. There is no point of implementing an ERC20 token on this non-existent marketing platform even if it did exist KRI has zero chance of gaining any value close to ICO price, the cap is too high anyway and too many were given away free Delisted from IDEX for multiple bad reasons  Oh but guys... they have completed so many thousands of hours of development and it's all in the background and and and... what since November 2017???

It also allows Krios to incentivize participation in the Krios ecosystem by offering special discounts, redistributing a portion of the fees, and allowing advertisers to purchase ad space with KRI (paying for advertising utilizing digital currencies is another point of value).  The smart contracts established through the Krios Platform ensure that funds get released to the members of the campaign once the work is complete. The content creators and other professionals on the platform need not worry about whether they will be paid, as the funds are held in the smart contract awaiting the successful collaboration of efforts.  We would also like to point out that although there is no pre-mine, Krios is certainly not ""taking all the money"" as you can see in the crowdfunding distribution portion of the whitepaper. 85% of funds raised go directly towards the Krios project, and the other 15% is primarily reserved for current and future members of the team & to pay for expanding the team and ensuring that Krios has a healthy future. Krios will be transparent with the community regarding how the funds raised are used.  Also, Krios is definitely not reserving 23% of the KRI for ourselves. 77% was reserved for the public sales, and the other 23% of tokens go to angel investors, bounty campaign participants (up to 50 million reserved coins for bounty!), the developers and the team. The Krios team will be transparent about the way in which KRI tokens are distributed. There are several projects which offer 30-60% of the supply to the public. Krios has over 80% of the tokens going directly into the hands of the ones who believe in the project and the ones who will be using the project!",False
