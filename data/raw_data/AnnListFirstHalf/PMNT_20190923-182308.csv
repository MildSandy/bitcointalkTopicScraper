Both companies are developing technology for the crypto industry. Paymon is focused on creating a new Hive blockchain system, which will allow users to transfer PMNC (Paymon Coin) without any commissions or delays. The company is also creating a universal infrastructure for working with cryptocurrency assets.  Cryptocean is developing technologies for transferring cryptocurrency into fiat money. The startup is creating a technological franchise that will allow any bank or FinTech project to enter the market with its own plastic card, wallet, and a set of services to meet its customers’ needs. Both companies have achieved impressive results in 2018 so far. Paymon successfully conducted its ICO and will soon release the final version of their own blockchain. Cryptocean established a collaboration with a German bank on the cards issue.  “Not all projects manage to sign actual contracts with major market participants,” explained Paymon CEO, Semyon Gleim. “Therefore, for us, cooperation with Cryptocean is kind of a ‘window to Europe’, and we are a qualitative technical base for them.” “Paymon has great technical experts on board, so we decided together to implement a pilot project to run our technological franchise. This is a win-win situation, when, on the one hand, a FinTech startup gets a turbine that speeds up its entry to the market and, on the other hand, it is another B2B client for us,” explained Yury Myshinsky, CEO of Cryptocean.    So, what are the card’s features? The Fiat card will be connected to the customer’s bank account as usual, but there will also be cryptocurrency operations available in addition to the standard fiat transactions, thanks to integration with the Paymon app and Cryptocean technologies. In the end, the client gets an incredibly interesting product — a card tied to their cryptocurrency account. Card registration will be open in two weeks on the website, www.paymon.org.  source:https://medium.com/@Paymon_official/paymon-and-cryptocean-announce-the-launch-of-crypto-debit-cards-582f43398cf9",False

I've just looked at what kind of company that is. When I view the website, it looks legit with a strong team of developers and advisors and work plan. Cryptocean is currently in the pre-ico phase.  I have to say that I have not googling the team members yet or other things have been sorted out. but overall it looks like a legit project  Here some description about cryptocean that I put in a quote so it is not to be confused with the paymon related topic           I have never had as much confidence in a presale ICO investment / project as Paymon.  It is a young team that is reliable and honest about everything. You can see that they are fully committed to making paymon a success and earn their living with it. They are fully committed to making this project a success and a success.  Even their ico token price was cheap. Paymon ICO has already ended a few months ago. I thought it was one of the best icos. One of the few projects where there is sufficient room for a large profit in the long term. Also one of the few projects where you really have something to the tokens. They have raised between 1 and 2 million dollars when it is good.   I must say that Paymon has done a good job before and during the ICO and all promises have been met neatly.  Even now that the ICO has long been over, they are doing a very good job. Their official telegram group is also very nice to be, even think it is one of the best telegram groups. Almost every telegram group in the crypto world is like a chat group with toddlers, spammers. The Telegram group of paymon is completely different. At least there is talk at the level as it should and free of spam messages (hodl, when moon, when micra, and so on).  Many of their team members are very active on telegram. Technical questions can almost almost immediately be answered. What is also a positive point of paymon, that at least they listen to the community. If you have good, strong advice or improve or security points in the development of the entire project, then it is neatly viewed and treated by the dev team. If the item is of added value, it is possibly included in the development.  Here 3 paymon telegram groups OFFICIAL GROUP. (project related questions) https://t.me/paymoneng UNOFFICIAL GROUP (Prices, and non related project) https://t.me/paymon_unofficial PAYMON INFO CHANNEL(Latest update news)  https://t.me/paymonchannel  I have already tested the new blockchain. Sending transactions is super fast. you send it, the receiver has your coins.  Everything is handled sensibly. They just want a healthy natural growth. Developing the blockchain / platform is their priority NR1. If she is a complete working project, they will start marketing. Masternodes would also come or be worked as well.  Paymon is under the radar at the moment. Huge under the radar. For a very suitable price.  It is a brand new blockchain developed by paymon. called HIVE: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). DAG is a better, improved version of Blockchain.  HIVE blockchain from paymon is better on all points than any other type of blockchains available, such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, EOS, NEO, Waves and the rest.  Paymon is better on all major points when it comes to payments. unlimited transactions per second, transactions free of charge without fee, processing time transactions with light speed, smart-contracts, cross-chain, atomic swaps, payment cards. go on.  This is what we missed in the crypto world. a coin that can be used in daily life. Buy and pay without additional transaction costs or processing time. A coin that you can quickly pay anywhere at any time with a pass in the supermarket, pumping station, online purchases and much more.  Forget about other projects with Dapp bullshit, smart contract shit and more. This project has the future. Crypto money that is used for daily purchases in the normal world. This project can replace Fiat money, soon even though. Because there are no transaction costs or delays of transactions when it is busy.  All other blockchain projects currently have no future to replace fiat money. Bitcoin either. That will be the digital gold of the future. all inconvenient in use. hard to understand for people who do not know anything about crypto, Traage with transaction speeds, High transaction costs, etcetera",False

This project is going to simplify the interaction between cryptocurrency holders and blockchain technology users. We are bringing the existing in the industry services to a new level and, moreover, introducing new ones.  Paymon suggests its own view of standard Blockchain, introducing ways of dealing with most issues of existing cryptocurrencies: the scaling problem, archaic architecture and high transaction fees. Our platform improves all cryptocurrency instruments: from technology and infrastructure to regulatory compliance with current regulations.  Business platform Profit, developed under our project, will be a universal solution for everyone: from developers and basic users to commercial organizations. Moreover, the project is a great investment opportunity in virtue of its tokens.

I even think that this is the first in his class. the first ico from Russia that is not a scam  All other Russians who start an ico can accept an example of paymon how you can keep an ico and then just develop everything while the ico is still going on.   I am not planning on selling my tokens anyway. I am especially curious about what we are going to see when everything is ready, both prices of the token, transaction speeds of the blockchain, use of smart contracts and such things   Keep up the good work!

Different governments of states declare that it is necessary to regulate crypto-currencies, but for some reason all regulation is limited mainly to restrictions and prohibitions. In those countries where they are more loyal to the development of crypto currency, the main problem there is that the business is still afraid to use crypto-currencies.  And trubles is that not enough convenient applications and services.  A large number of ICO focused on the use of blockchain technologies in various fields, but for some reason, few developers think about the need to create infrastructure projects.  I think that such projects as PAYMON should become more. And they will have a chance of success, if the team will focus on the introduction of convenient functionality for business.
