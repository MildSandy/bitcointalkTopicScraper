The company has the mining licence (peat) for 25 years on the “Chistoe” deposits. in the Ozernyi village of Rezhevsky district of Sverdlovsk region.

This volume of production we expect to reach in 2018 (without additional investments). At the same time, if we uncover the entire area allotted for production, the annual volume of extracted peat can be increased up to 750 000 m3 .  To increase the volume of peat extraction with subsequent processing up to 750,000 m3 per year investments are required in the amount of 10 000 000$ .  For the purposes of the ICO will be released 17 500 000 PeatCoin tokens. PeatCoin is a derivative, provided by peat: 10 PTN = 1 m3 of peat. Every PtC owner will be able to exchange their tokens on the peat multiple of one cubic meter.
