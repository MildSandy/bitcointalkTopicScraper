Please register on our website: HTTPS://CRYPTOSTARTER.IO  Motivation background & problem statement:  Crowdfunding lets new ideas and businesses raise money by selling the future product directly to the customers before the product creation. This allows direct validation of an idea by future customers. This also creates a relationship with the future customers instantly, alowing a quick communication channel and feedback. However Crowdfunding faces challenges. Compaigners have nothing more than a promise to give back to backers. Ownership of a future product can not be transferred to others. Setting up crowdfunding campaign to accept crypto currency is complicated.  The challenge that CryptoStarter attempts to solve is to connect crowdfunding and  crypto currency, at the same time making it simple to use and accessible to non-technical artists and entrepreneurs.   Despite rapid development of crypto currency markets not all potential participants were able to use crypto currency advantages due to a number of reasons. Starting from the country where crypto currency lacks local support and up to simply the lack of knowledge and motivation to learn how to use crypto currency.    CryptoStarter description:  With CryptoStarter campaigners can create their own project tokens,  tokens can be redeemed for a product , can be a 'digital share of future company' (ICO), tokens can be traded.   Cryptostarter gives instant marketplace for project tokens.   Since the amount of project tokens is set to be limited, the price changes. Buy, Sell project tokens  right before the future product release. Simplicity of use Cryptostarter is designed to be used by anyone.  Launching your crowdfunding  project is 1 click away. Anyone holding a cryptostarter token IDEA-coin,  receives 3.5% Rewards from every crowdfunding campgain on the platform.

Turns promises into tradable tokens.,"   Our consensus algorithm at the early stage of the project  is not Proof of Work, it is generic PoS initially. 100 million IDEACOIN tokens (IDEA) has been created and will be distributed during 3 periods:  pre-ICO ICO and post-ICO periods.  Although the final total supply will be defined by the amount of distributed IDEA tokens. The rest of undistributed tokens will be burned (sent to an account with no private key and lost forever).  That means that the total supply can be much less than 100 million.  It can be between 1 million and 100 million. For instance  assuming 30 millions were distributed during ICO periods, then 70 millions will be burned forever.  Initially planned ETH/IDEA ratio is 1:1000  You can have a look on ETHERSCAN.IO at the source code of our ICO smart contract, which will be autonomously distributing the IDEA tokens during ICO. It has already been successfully verified to comply ERC20 Standard. Here is the link: https://etherscan.io/address/0xa6047765e275522bfa0ef6638cbc402de023aa86#code  You can find more details about upcoming pre-ICO on official website of CryptoStarter project: https://cryptostarter.io",False

Regarding the price for the token  on pre-ICO and ICO,  they have a telegram group, I've talked to somebody from their team and  as far as I understood, they're gonna lower the price to adjust it to the recent higher price of Ethereum.   I haven't seen the announcement yet, but i think they're gonna make one soon.   I've read their whitepaper, i like the idea, it's viable, the platform will let you generate your own tokens and perform your own ICO or crowdfunding via crypto, plus the results from ICOs & crowdfundings conducted via platform will be shared among all  participants of the platform who holds CST, i don't remember what % was it though.    I think I'm gonna definitely invest in this one.",False
