Hackers accessed up to 4.5 million patient records stored on the UCLA Health System‚Äôs EHR. February 5th, 2016. Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, fully infected by ransomware, had to pay $17,000 to the hackers to release their systems. August 4th, 2016. Advocate Health Care had to pay $5.5 million to settle lawsuits caused by breaches of their IT infrastructure that may exposed the medical records of 4 million patients.  According to a 2016 report, what‚Äôs the second-most targeted industry by hackers? Healthcare. These breaches won‚Äôt stop. Why would they? A single medical record fetches at least 400 times more money than a credit card number on the black market. It makes financial sense for hackers to focus on the things that make them the most profit. However, current EHR solutions, the Epics and Cerners of the world, just don‚Äôt offer the necessary security and stability. Let‚Äôs look at a well-known high-end EHR provider that has a name based on a type of literary composition. It‚Äôs built on a 50-year-old backend (InterSystems Cache, a direct descendent of MUMPS). Meanwhile, the frontend is coded in a programming language no longer supported by the company that developed it (Visual Basic 6, support ended in 2008). The others aren‚Äôt any better. Let‚Äôs face it: modern EHRs are big, bloated, and insecure. So, that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre seeing the leaks and hacks we are.  Enter HealthHeart. Developed by veterans of the EHR and network security spaces, the HealthHeart EHR is designed from the ground up for security and stability. HealthHeart uses blockchain technology to securely fragment and reassemble patient record fragments on the fly, ensuring there will never be a single location on the network that a hacker can target. Built-in redundancy ensures that even if some computers on a network are compromised, providers ‚Äì and only providers - will always have access to the full patient record. With the immutability of the blockchain, patient records cannot be modified except by the clinician; any incorrect additions, modifications, and deletions are automatically thrown out as invalid. Being built on open-source technologies like Ethereum ensures that HealthHeart remains affordable to everyone, from a single-practitioner office to a multinational hospital chain. Even better, with HealthHeart, functionality and attractiveness go hand-in-hand. Designed from the beginning with input from medical professionals, HealthHeart guarantees that primary workflows are easily accessible, no bloat or obscured functionality allowed. Customizability ensures that no matter the specialty or need, a clinician will always have exactly what they need at their fingertips.  Secure. Stable. Affordable. Attractive. We are the future of healthcare. We are HealthHeart.  Our website: https://www.healthheart.io/ Our introduction video: HealthHeart - The Next-Generation EHR Our product: http://www.healthheart.io/see-our-product/ Our whitepaper: HealthHeart Whitepaper Legal analysis: Legal Opinion of HHT   Why We're Better  Unlike current EHR solutions, we are built with cutting-edge, secure technology. We‚Äôve also involved medical professionals in the design of our product since Day One. There are other competitors focusing on integrating blockchain technology into healthcare, but our product is different in three ways:  We are primarily focused on meeting the needs of a specific market segment, small- to mid-size private practices and hospitals. We are the only company to have a Medical Advisory Board of certified medical practitioners advising us on our product; no one else has the support of actual physicians for their work. We have an actual product in the works and have posted images of our progress to our site. Our software is extensible worldwide.[/i] For further details of HealthHeart‚Äôs strengths and benefits, please see our whitepaper.
