As I said there, I think it would be a fantastic idea as we could build upon the already huge development that has, and continues to happen, in Ethereum as well as other ERC20 tokens. With the amount of devs out there building upon Ethereum, it can only work wonders for GX in the future. While I understand that some people may wish to stay with Waves tech, they must realise that the speed of development that is happening on the Ethereum platform is miles ahead of and Waves develpment. I don't mean for that to sound insulting to an Waves devs out there; it just the way it is.  If this were to happen, will the token swap be a one-one swap, and if so I assume that users who have their token stored with you guys via the official GX site, won't have to do anything as the swap will be done by yourselves on our behalf?  Once again, thank you to the team for their continuing development of all things GX. The future of GX is looking exciting.",False

An email has been sent to these users before that to get their details of purchase. If you didn't get this email, that means your submission is removed automatically. It happens if you have had multiple entries to cheat the system or gave invalid / wrong information on your submission form. You need to use Contact Us page on GameX to reach the team for a review, if you think that you are eligible but didn't get your bonuses.  Quote from: Dieniz on April 15, 2018, 05:35:21 AM Hi!

If it's a bad one, it's bad everywhere. And Waves-DEX is just another exchange, a project can't get enough market volume with one exchange anyway, you need to list your token on many. But yes, we were aware about Waves' popularity while making this decision and currently we ok with it. Of course, coinswap is always an option.",False
