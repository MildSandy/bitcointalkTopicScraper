The ICO ended 7th October 2017 but the company have gone silent and are not responding to any communication.  I'm very concerned that I may have been scammed.  Has anyone had a similar experience with any ICO?   http://7ype.com/ https://twitter.com/7ypeCoin,False

They have 23 movies listed and it looks like the website was designed in the 1990s.  You must be stressed right now and I feel for you but may I ask what made you think to invest in that project?,False
