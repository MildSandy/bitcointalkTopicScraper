We been doing this for last 2 years, so this been very long road in relative to other crypto projects.     We are pretty F*** sick of all bad service Crypto investing receives at private banks.  We trade a lot our selfs and for some reason if we want to get the money we made back into fiat, private bank will close our accounts, because of association with AML.    This is bull**** and needs to be fixed.  Crypto NEEDs to be Institutionalized.  It NEEDs to be a proper ASSET CLASS.  Relative to other asset classes.  But today it is associated with drugs and only black stuff....      This limits development, as pension funds would never use such ASSET CLASS.      We believe that DIGITAL ASSETS are a new asset class.  Our Bitcoin Global Note (and similar products) are a way to separate GOOD and BAD, as bad guys will never want to convert BTC into Bitcoin Global Note.  Its would very stupid thing to do!

Business concept is quite understandable and easy for experienced investors, economists and traders. However, cruptocurrency market is becoming adopted among masses of people that have very basic financial knowledge. How would you deliver the concept of your company for an average potential customer?  Legalize bitcoin market will get you 100,000USD/BTC price point.     If you don’t legalize BTC, next year will be a wave of litigations and market may crash!    You need institutional capital to survive.   2. Considering how fast people switch their attention from one project to another, how are you planning to keep your project developing and increasing its value with time? For example, back in June and July 2017, Siacoin, Digibyte, Library, BAT were quite popular and got a lot of public attention. Few month later, people barely remember them.  We have a huge pipeline of news.  First all coins that will join. NEM, DASH, LTC, etc with all we can do cross promotion within their communities.  Second all the clients.  we meet with Oman royal family fund, Russian soviern wealth fund, pension funds in scandinavia, banks in Austria.  All are info news for the PR.   What's your plan to prevent your coin from losing its value in 5 month, and what would motivate your investors to keep the coin, instead of just massively dumping it after reaching 100-500% profits?  The instrument CABS will be very volatile.   The downside is 2%.  Can it go lower, yes.   but at zero we will not do any securitsiation.  Plus their is a huge demand so this is unlikely.   Can it go up to 100%, yes it could as Bitcoin Investment Trust just on BTC was trading at 100% premium two month ago.  So downs 2%, upside 100% is a very good ratio.  3. Will project disclose investor's information per KYC requirements if requested by foreign government?  YES you will need to do KYC in order to USE Securitsiaton platform.   Passport copy + utility bill with address is enough.  We do online KYC via selfy-photo with data and passport.   Keep in mind that, Bad guys will never use Bitcoin Global Note.  They need Monero or BTC.  AS Bitcoin Global Note is fully compliant and can be frozen by Luxembourg Judge.   Only good guys need our service.  Only investors with need have legitimate exposure to DIGITAL ASSETS.  These folks need and value things like 1) regulatory compliance, 2) risk free clearing, 3) tax clarity 4) cyber security and 5) ability to book digital assets the old fashioned way via auditor and ""debit/credit books».     Our service will separate Good and Bad actors, which is needed, as now we have all in car, smelly indians and british lords riding on each other laps.   4. Do you have any current or upcoming agreement/deals with exchanges? We will list it at C2CX 24 hours after the end of ICO date.  WE are also negotiating with Bitfinex, Bittrex, Poloniax,    WE WILL NOT LIST ON HITBTC OR ETHEREDELTA  5. What will stop your competitors from copying your business model and out-compete you on the market? Takes about 1.5 years. so they will copy but their is a huge advantage in first mover.   Plus we will need to get sales going.  It is very difficult to switch clients especially large isntituationl clients that are happy with the returns….   AND our clients are very happy with the returns as they FRONT RUN later institutional investors)   6. What's geographical and economical zone is your target market? North America,  Europe, Sophisticate Asia, Australia&NZ   7. White paper has several statements that this project solves legal problem for people around the world. However, various countries force law against people who trade securities / derivatives without proper registration. In fact, some countries might limit ability to have any assets abroad. Do you have plans to work with different governments to solve this problem? Because this problem might seriously limit amount of potential investors  Luxembourg is a great jurisdiction pretty much for all invstituinal investors, as it give pass through taxation, so you only pay taxes at the level of an ownership.  For example if you are in North America, you will pay relevant income tax, if you are in Japan you pay Japanese taxes, if you are in Dubai, you pay Dubai taxes, if you BVI you ""pay» your relevant taxes there.   8. Per Whitepaper, at least 10 million dollars would be spent on IT system development, Ethereum front-end, gateways into Clearstream and OTC markets, sales forces and back office automation.  Yes, we have a huge plan for IT.  We going to do a video on that.  Best to do an interview with our technical team and ask them TECHNICAL QUESTIONS.  They actually want 15 million (but we scaled them down)  as they say that in order to build #1 global crypto custody we need a lot of traditional, scalable and secure technology that already exists and needs too be merged together instead of building from scratch.   Our IT head following soft cap will be ex-Duetshce Bank VP of Technology.    What sort of IT system and Ethereum front-end will cost that much money? Are you planning to have any legislative spendings, since you might have to deal with constantly changing regulations?      We use INGRID memerogy and butch of non blockchain technology.  But ETH will service its very important role for account management and crypto LINK.  9. Will your platform work mainly with large coins like ETH and BTC, or eventually all cryptocurrency could be ""covered"" with your project?  Yes we will securitize all top 20 liquid names next year. CABS token will be universal for all.",False

CyberTrust is a financial services company providing a traditional investment vehicle - Global Crypto Notes - which is titled and auditable. Institutional investors can use these to buy, sell and short cryptocurrencies, as well as create derivative products. CyberTrust provides sales & trading, research and asset management services for institutional investors.   The Challenge  In order to build out decentralized blockchain infrastructure around the world trillions of dollars are required. As much of the money/liquidity is concentrated in the hands of institutional investors, we as a community need to develop solutions and products to bridge fiat and crypto and thereby obtain the necessary capital we need to develop our vision for decentralized future. CyberTrust’s Global Crypto Notes (GCNs) are a key component facilitating adoption by large institutional investors.  Note that these GCNs are not like ETFs targeted at retail investors, which face much higher regulatory barriers. Instead, they designed for institutional and to some extent accredited investors.  GCNs give institutional investors the elements they need: titled ownership, tax clarity, clearing & settlement as well judicial recovery. All of these are musts in order to drive adoption.  Unlike the existing Grayscale Fund, CyberTrust GCN quantities are not fixed. And again, unlike Grayscale, GCNs are not just limited to bitcoin.  The availability of a securitized form of cryptocurrencies enables the creation of new derivative products. This in turn will drive demand for these securitized assets.    How it Works  Cryptocurrencies are stored in secure offline vaults where ownership is titled. The vaults are located in Deltalis’ hyper secure data bunker in Switzerland. Those placing funds with via CyberTrust’s platform will undergo AML and KYC processes to make the assets legally tradable. This means institutional investors can be sure the crypto-backed derivatives are not based on funds from criminal activities. When crypto is withdrawn by clients, they have the option to receive the exact currency they deposited in storage.      CyberTrust has created a vehicle which allows investors to profit from the price difference between securitised and unsecuritised cryptocurrency: the CABS (Crypto Asset-Backed Securitisation’) token.         Read The Whitepaper    CyberTrust has a unique team of dedicated professionals from varied backgrounds whose experience compliments each other, facilitating innovative ideas and an approach to investment like no other.
