The airlines have to pay the money regardless in the European Union because of Regulation 261.  Because they have made this process of filing the claims so arduous, users have gone to third party companies and are paying them 25% or more to process their claims.

The passenger now does not have to waste time in filling out forms or calling into a call center to get their compensation.
