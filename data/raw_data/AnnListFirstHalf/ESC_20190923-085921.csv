The Ethersport team welcomes everyone!  As planned, we are informing the community about the development stages of our project. And, considering lots of questions and suggestions in the chats and forums, the Ethersport team has decided to share their plans and vision of the project‚Äôs development in more details, in order to clear up all the controversial situations and thoughts of our community, including forecasters, long-term partners of the projects and ESC token holders aimed at getting a quick profit through trading our tokens.  As initially stated in the white paper, the project will be launched in any case, regarding of the investment raised thought the token sale. We confirm that we are moving according to the plan, and the first development efforts can be checked out in the MVP. Thanks to the MVP, we are investigating project‚Äôs moments, in order to fully and reliably implement the platform‚Äôs conditions into the smart contract and prevent all the possible problems. It is important to understand that the work of the projects powered by the blockchain and smart contracts significantly differs from the standard computational platforms on the web. And we are facing many problems with finding specialists who are working with the smart contract. We do not want to work on the project quickly and unreasonably, as it can later result in inconveniences for the forecasters and partners of all types, related with the specifics of the smart contracts. Moreover, the conditions of working with the Ethereum platform are constantly changing, which considerably extends the number of questions related to the project‚Äôs optimization that are being solved by our team. Despite this, all the issues are being solved by the Ethersport team in working order.  Considering the above mentioned, we would like to present the project‚Äôs development strategy. We understand that the Ethersport community mostly consists of 5 parties concerned:  Partners who have purchased ESC tokens with a speculative aim; Long-term holders interested in the project‚Äôs development and long-term profits through preserving the project‚Äôs tokens; Project‚Äôs forecasters who are willing to get awarded: win the jackpot using their knowledge in sports, intuition and experience. We treat them as the main participants of the project that will be growing all over the world and is the fundamental part of the project; Forecasters who are willing to get the right to become the Lotters on certain conditions, release their forecast lines for the platform‚Äôs participants and get rewarded with commissions for their work; Project‚Äôs founders, the team interested in a sooner start of the project, getting commissions for their idea and efforts on creating the platform, as well as growing the market price of the ESC tokens.  The first two categories also include the bounty campaign‚Äôs and other participants who are working on the project and have received awards for their work.  We‚Äôd like to particularly point out that even through the aims of different participants are tactically different, everyone is interested in the platform‚Äôs launch, the growth of its users from all over the world and getting a certain profit from a successfully operational project. Thereby, it is understandable that the participants of the first category who are most active in terms of the token listing on the exchanges, have to understand that they can do harm to the whole project and its development through their intention to trade tokes. They should also understand that the successful development of the project drives the price growth of the ESC tokens, the holders of which they are. Ethersport team understands this situation well, which is why it doesn‚Äôt force the ESC listing on the exchanges up to the project‚Äôs test version release on the main Ethereum network and a fully operational smart contracts. However, the team is constantly holding negotiations with such platforms to get the most favorable terms of trading in future.  We‚Äôd also like to direct the holders‚Äô attention that there are many people who would like to purchase the ESC tokens, even though there is no official possibility to do that. After a detailed and public annex to the white paper, the Ethersport team has decided to continue the ESC token sale. We are confident that additional investment will assist in the project‚Äôs promotion in the world sports community, its advertising and attracting the maximum participants.  We are especially emphasizing that the Ethersport team has decided to give the chance to buy ESC tokens to all interested individuals, considering a large number of requests. The smart contracts is already prepared for that, and the price and other conditions will be published additionally.    We‚Äôve also decided to combine the next stage of the platform‚Äôs prize testing with the ESC token sale. Everyone who is willing to get the project‚Äôs tokens can choose in which way they‚Äôd like to do it, either through purchase, or through participation in the testing, after making a certain investment in ETH. The direct token sale will start on March 26th, 2018. Approximately in the same time, it is planned to begin the new prize testing with a certain contribution. This testing will be partially held with using with smart contract‚Äôs infrastructure on the test network. Thereafter, it is planned to hold the prize testing only on a smart contract.  Within a month, after the 2nd Token Sale round is over, we are planning to list the ESC token on several partnering exchanges.  All tokens distributed within the Ethersport team will be locked up for 1 year since the platform‚Äôs launch. Moreover, 15% commissions from each line will not be credited to these wallets. The participation in the platform‚Äôs prize testing will require wallet and email identification of the forecasters and contribution in amount of 0.01 to 0.02 ETH, depending on the prize fund of a certain game. The prize fund of the testing period will be 250,000 ESC and 3 ETH. There ability of participating in the testing only through the ETH contribution will be preserved as well.

This adjustment to the playing process applies to every forecaster and may change the lines outcome.  The EtherSport Lottery 11 smart contract has a fixed lifetime. It is programmed to stop and calculate all payouts within a few hours after the last sporting event‚Äôs scheduled end. If an event gets delayed and postponed beyond that point, the contract will not receive the correct result, which may cause erroneous prizes.  Previously, we have marked such delayed events as a draw or a victory of the 1st team, if the sport discipline can‚Äôt have draw results. As far as using this situation is not against the platform rules, it may be used for increasing the winning chance, which harms the fairness of the process.  To avoid this possibility, all lines after January 31st, 2018 will be simply cancelled in case of cancellation, postponement or a delay of any match in the line.  This change may be also applied to the smart contracts for following platform versions and to the EtherSport Lottery 11 ruleset, once we test it during the current prize-winning testing period.

Of course, there will be lots of changes of the MVP to optimize the prediction process and to ensure capitalization of the project, so we welcome you to check the new functions sometimes. Also, we are announcing a test net prediction competition. All registered participants are welcome to predict the outcome of all lines to receive a prize in ESC tokens. 1st place will win 3000 ESC, 2nd will achieve 1500 ESC, and 500 ESC will be granted to the 3rd place. The more matches you predict correctly‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe more your chances for a prize!  We tried to keep the interface as simple as possible, so there are no distracting factors. Currently, the MVP includes the player interface and EtherSport official lines, but we are working on the independent Lotter capabilities and will add them really soon.  During the early testing stages, testers are welcome to fulfill three lines a day, provided by EtherSport.  To predict the results in one line, just press on it, enter your predictions and press ‚ÄòTry.‚Äô And that‚Äôs all, enjoy the sports and wait for the results!    The possibility to become a Lotter and create your own lines will be added later, after we will determine the conditions for becoming a Lotter based on the gaming process and develop the appropriate functionality. These conditions will be developed in a way offering the best utilization of blockchain and smart contract technology, and to keep the amount of Lotters and their lines at an optimal point.  Thank you for taking part in the MVP testing and we wish you the best luck with the determination of lines provided with the test product and taking part in the competition!

We have allocated 10,000 ESC tokens for this two-month test lottery period, which will be divided into one-month periods. Each period, there will be three winners, eligible for 3000 ESC for the 1st place, 1500 ESC for the 2nd, and 500 ESC for 3rd place.  Each lottery has free tickets, and wins give players the points. A player who correctly predicts the outcome of 7 events in a line, will receive 1 point, 8 events will give 2 points, 9 guessed sports events will make players eligible for 3 points, 10 events for 5 points and 11 events will give players 8 points. Amount of collected points and results of all events will be published on the platform, at https://mvp.ethersport.io All lines before 00:00 UTC on 17th December 2017 will be annulated and not rewarded with points.  In case of a delayed or canceled event or an erroneous event in the line, the result of such match will be published as a draw (X). If the sport doesn‚Äôt allow draws, the event will be marked as the victory of the 1st team. This condition is required by the smart contract for faster determination of results and to keep 11 events in a line instead of making smaller lines, for keeping the chances equal for all lottery participants.  Each EtherSport player has an ability to play no more than 5 lines daily (in an exact 24-hour period) during the testing period to equate the chances of a win. This will be re-checked during the calculation of test period rewards using both login and IP data, and all violators will be excluded from the rewarding list.  EtherSport will keep the right to make changes to the site and game process during the testing period for the sake of tweaking it to the best possible outcome for all players, with keeping the sports events results and the achieved points without any changes by EtherSport. Thus, the most updated rules will be posted in the Medium story available here:  https://medium.com/@ethersport/ethersport-starts-the-prize-winning-testing-143d1ab47600  Once the testing period is over, we will contact the winners via the email indicated during the sign-up process and will ask to provide their wallet addresses for token allocation.

The EtherSport‚Äôs ICO white paper contains the rules and algorithm of this ICO. The team was developing it in accordance with expectations of a stable ETH price of no more than $400. All the prices in ETH are outlined using this exchange rate and it was considered as obvious, regarding the then-stable ETH exchange rate. We consider the situation of the rapid increase in the ETH exchange rate to up to $510 a force majeure which brings the prospected token prices out of the reasonable margin. This is why we decided to introduce an additional compensation (i.e. bonus) for those who invest in the ICO without a reasonable token price, to bring the value of tokens they obtain to a reasonable and ordinary range. We only go for such measures for the sake of caring about all our investors and their comfort and to bring EtherSport back to progress. We admit that the EtherSport white paper lacks any interpretation of such measures, but it is still yet a force majeure for us which could not be foreseen with the stable ETH exchange rate during the time this white paper has been developed.  The EtherSport platform is built utilizing blockchain technology and Ethereum smart contracts. We also urge to provide a decentralized system which will not require any KYC procedures required by systems working with fiat currencies. Hence, we are forced to bond all calculations and ESC token to ETH first, instead of bonding it directly to USD and/or other fiat money. We know that most of our investors use fiat currencies for investment, using ETH only as an exchange medium. This is an essential situation for a project that doesn‚Äôt only count on cryptocurrency enthusiasts who have ETH naturally, but also targets a wide community of gamblers, lottery players, and bookmakers, who don‚Äôt usually have an ETH balance and make all their considerations in fiat money. This is why we say that the ESC price is tied directly to the USD price, and ETH is being used as a conversion medium only. We would love to develop all prices in ETH and skip a lot of unnecessary conversions as well, but as this market is too volatile and it has a USD price, we simply can‚Äôt do this.  We have indicated a target exchange rate for ESC tokens in dollars instead of ETH, as a logical value regarding the principles of platform operations and the price of a lottery ticket. Of course, the real value will be decided by the community and the market once tokens hit an exchange, but there should be a target exchange rate used at least for determination of the token price during the ICO and calculations of all future operations within the working platform. And yes, we set this target exchange rate in USD, as 99,99999% of the world base their considerations on USD, and the majority of our investors use fiat currencies in their everyday life and they can comfortably decide the value of their investments without complicated calculations. Of course, when the Ethereum community will grow times more it‚Äôs currents size, this bond to USD will become obsolete and we‚Äôll be able to omit it, but now it is absolutely impossible. In case of the ETH exchange rate changes drastically again, we will implement similar measures based on momentary USD price of ESC tokens. Current 50% bonus corridor we have for the new-coming investors is at 430 to 600 USD per ETH. If the exchange rate falls below, we will cancel the bonus for new investors coming after that moment. If the exchange rate hits the next corridor of 600 to 800 USD, we will implement a further 50% bonus to obtain back the economically reasonable USD price for our ESC tokens.

Also, if I am correct, by way of authorized Lotters, many different cards can be played from different sports, so this is a start although it will be limited to the same Lottery 11 format.  Where I don't agree with you regarding your comment on the 'game offering' where you say... ""You are failing during pre-ICO because Lottery 11 idea sucks badly"".....What Etherport is essentially doing has been around for generations (in terms of the game offering), and in the UK one example is The Football Pools, formerly owned by Sportech before they sold for ¬£83M earlier this year. And even The Football Pools was limited to just Football (Soccer), and where players were even more limited to just picking DRAWS in 10,11, or 12 lines! With Etherport, players will be able to choose outcomes under the 1 X 2 format where relevant and over many different sporting events.  Bottom line, these Sports Lottery type games (Sportech reported ¬£28M revenue in 2016) are popular and always have been, although, National Lotteries providing traditional draws create competition for these types of games.  Now, in regards to the proposed P2P betting (betting exchange), again, nothing new here as this has been going on since the late 1990's with the advent of Betfair, and Ethersport themselves say, ""We are not going to convince you that we are creating something extraordinary or genius, as most of the ICO campaigns state"". The idea that players can become their own bookmaker, and rid of the built-in margins and fees from traditional bookies is very popular all over the world. The problem that may be faced here like in all exchanges has to do with available liquidity so players can bet in amounts that can guarantee a matched bet.",False

Four general ICO rounds will last from November, 22nd to December, 21th. The first round of the ICO will last for 1 hour and will offer ESC tokens for a discounted price. The ESC tokens will be used as payment medium and for additional funding of the platform, built on Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts, which will make it a progress relatively to older outdated systems.  EtherSport is a new and revolutionary platform built for taking a new experience of combined lotteries and sports betting to players from the whole world. The newly developed process will allow players to use their sports knowledge and analytics with lotteries in a fully decentralized and transparent manner. EtherSport is built to maximize fairness of the gaming process and to provide the best profitability possible to all players, the platform, and its partners.  One other major goal of EtherSport is to bring black gambling and bookmaking markets into a legal plain, as by European Gaming and Betting Association (EGBA), the official gaming industry market size is over $86 billion, as the black market is measured at $430 billion.  The main EtherSport idea is in Lottery 11, that uses precise determination of sports events instead of generating random numbers, for drawing its results. This makes the lottery results auditable by all players and completely impossible to affect or change in any way to rig the lottery.  This principle also offers EtherSport players to increase their chances in a lottery by using their analytic abilities and sports knowledge to predict the results with more precision.  Advanced security, easy signup process, complete anonymity, transparency of all money operations, almost instant payouts and absence of hidden payments or commissions are the EtherSport‚Äôs advantages accomplished thanks to using of the latest blockchain technologies. These are impossible with usual centralized betting and lottery systems.  EtherSportCoin, or ESC, are Ethereum tokens that are used for financing the project and will be used as a payment medium on the EtherSport platform. Also, ESC token holders will be eligible for receiving their share in 15% of EtherSport‚Äôs operational income.  4-stage ICO will start at 8 pm UTC on November, 22nd and will end on December, 21st, or if all tokens will be sold out. The first stage offering tokens for the lowest price of 0.001 ETH will last only for an hour and will be followed by the second 24-hour long stage with ESC sold at 0.0013 ETH. The third stage will last from November, 23rd to November, 30th, and will offer ESC tokens for 0.0017 ETH. The last stage will last for three weeks afterward and will allow purchasing the tokens for 0.002 ETH.  Taking part in the ICO doesn‚Äôt require any registration and will be easy and straightforward. The only required action will be sending your contribution to an Ethereum wallet address provided at ethersport.io page, after which you will receive back your tokens automatically.  You can also obtain the ESC tokens for free by taking part in the generous bounty campaign.  The first ICO round will last for 1 hour only, so don't miss your chance to get the ESC tokens at their cheapest!",False

Ethersportcoin (ESC) is an ERC20 token built on the Ethereum platform.  ESC tokens can be used as: platform currency for buying lottery tickets; an partnership bond to get profit share 15% of the raised money from each lottery; a speculative commodity to trade on an exchange.  The Token Sale Round 1 has raised $250,000 which will be used in accelerating the development of EtherSport platform.  TOKEN ALLOCATION  BUDGET ALLOCATION [/center]  The main idea of our project is that our lottery, contrary to many similar services, is not based on guessing the random numbers, but involves exact determination of the sports events results, which cannot be influenced by anyone. This implies that the players have analytical skills. Such lottery type allows players not only to guess the game results by using their knowledge, but also get an additional satisfaction from the view of the sports events and support of their favourite teams, which they have chosen in the ticket. The same can be said about the bets placed between the players within our project, an analogue of the betting exchange.  EtherSport improves the service in this business field by new technologies, namely, blockchain, smart contracts and cryptocurrencies. Such improvement is directed not only to the convenience of the technical service for the players, but also to the guarantee of the fairness and full transparency of the process, which is done thanks to the new technologies.  OUR MAIN ADVANTAGES  ‡πè Simple registration to participate in the draw games All the world bookmaker companies, as well as lotteries and betting exchanges are very demanding in terms of the identity verification towards the player who is willing to participate in the draw games. They say, it lowers the unfair game attempts of the users. The smart contracts system automatically eliminates the fraud probability, which is why you only need to register a wallet and play anonymously.  ‡πè The ability to use as much funds as possible   When it comes to the EtherSport decentralized system, there is no need in limiting the betting amount for players, which is common for the centralized services. Thanks to the smart contracts, the system tracks the financial status of the players, betting fairness, and distributes the rewards.  ‡πè The ability to get an almost instant payout   Contrary to the traditional gambling companies where the big payout is withdrawn in pieces, our players can withdraw the ESC rewards in the shortest time. There is no need for the billing system or payment cards. Only the player is free to choose how they will use the reward.  ‡πè Full independence   EtherSport is fully independent from regulation, including the governmental one, which usually leads to financial losses and possible problems for the players because of the unforeseen obstacles.

First, players fill the $1 tickets to take part in a draw based on 11 sporting matches results. A smart contract accepts the ticket and payment in ESC tokens and stores it in the blockchain. All bets are closed 1 hour before the first event of a ticket.  After all matches are played, the smart contract collects their results from three reliable independent sources and calculates the winners. If anyone have guessed 7 to 10 lines, they receive a corresponding share of the lottery's bank.  If someone marks all 11 lines correctly, they hit the jackpot!

EtherSport‚Äôs lottery, contrary to many similar services, is not based on guessing random numbers, but involves the exact determination of sports events results, which cannot be influenced by anyone.

The lottery mechanism is handled via the Ethereum Smart Contract process, which affords participants completely fair and transparent results, which avoids unnecessary risks and scams. The use of smart-contracts also guarantees transparent and immediate payment, eliminating hidden fees.

What challenge is EtherSport addressing? EtherSport is building a decentralized technology of running lotteries and player-to-player bets without risks of getting fooled and paying outrageous commissions for nothing. Moreover, EtherSport suggests truly random and yet verifiable lottery results, as most lotteries provide just numbers and can‚Äôt even prove that they are random indeed.  What is the scale of this challenge? These kinds of gambling have an official capitalization of $86 billion, and it is believed that black market and unofficial lotteries turn over $400 billion a year. All these people may want to have a real breakthrough in their approach to gambling, so that‚Äôs a pretty tough challenge to get to them all and provide a product that would be viable and clear to anyone.  How does EtherSport turn this challenge into an opportunity? EtherSport is transparent, means every aspect of the lottery can be viewed and verified, EtherSport is decentralized, so that once we deploy the lottery smart contract into the blockchain, it can‚Äôt be changed and compromised, EtherSport has clear and understandable source of drawing results, and everyone is able to follow this process, and EtherSport‚Äôs input threshold is only $1, so practically anyone in the world can buy a lottery ticket and have equal chance to hit the jackpot. Also the system itself will be open-source, the smart contract and lottery bank collection and distribution code will be accessible on GitHub.  Can you showcase some team members/advisors which have a strong background? What is their connection with this particular project? The main advisor is Timofei Bezruk, Ukraine‚Äôs leading bookmaking specialist who took his part in creation of dozens of betting platforms. Thanks to Timofei‚Äôs experience we have created a great system you will be able to put your hands on soon. The other advisors are planned to uncover in one week before the Pre-ICO.  Does EtherSport have any strategic partnerships? We are negotiating with three independent sources of sports events results and plan to sign a strategical partnership contract with them. Also the development studio that works on our platform is our partner. We plan to disclose our partners with the start of the Pre-ICO.  Does EtherSport have a viable product at this time? Yes, we already have most of the architecture coded down. The MVP will be presented to everyone in December.  What is the status or this product? (Alpha Beta or production) It‚Äôs only alpha now, but we are going to release the beta for public testing on the test network.  How many users are actively using this product? It is still being used internally for testing purposes.  What is the structure of the ICO? (Bonuses, Dates, Market Cap) The ICO will start on November, 13th, and will last until December, 20th, through a pre-sale and 4 ICO stages. Generally, the earlier you invest, the more tokens you get, thats kind of a bonus scheme we have.  What are the requirements to participate in the ICO? There are no major requirements: you need only will and an Ethereum wallet to take part in the ICO.  What are the pros and cons for the token holders? The pros are obvious for most ICOs: you can trade tokens on an exchange, use tokens to play at EtherSport, but there are more. Token holders will receive bonuses from every single lottery at EtherSport, and also we expect the token price to be somewhat predictable around times when forced jackpots will be announced. We expect them to rise.  Was there a pre-ico? Pre-ICO will be held from 13th to 19th of November.  What is the price of the pre-ico and the price of the ico? The Pre-ICO price will be 0.0005 ETH, and during the ICO the price will range from 0.001 during the 1st stage to 0.002 during the 4th.  How many tokens will be issued? 100,000,000 ESC tokens in total.  Is there a cap on the ICO? Yes, the hard cap is 90,000 ETH.  Would you like to add any further info? All details and information on the EtherSport project can be discovered on our site, ethersport.io, where you can download the white paper with full description of the game process, system and development plan.
