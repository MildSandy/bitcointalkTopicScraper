There remains in the Smart Contract: 349,989,096 GFL  That means there is currently: 150,010,903 GFL in circulation  (100,000,000 are reserved by the team )  so that leaves:  50,010,903 GFL in the public's hands.  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DWLdgKfVMAAGSyz.jpg:large  As far as I can tell, no more GFL will ever leave the smart contract as the price to buy them is 50x higher than the market price. So they will remain there forever.  Golden Fleece have said they will use 30% of their mining profits to buy back GFL from the market and burn it.  Their current mining capacity is: 9 GigaHash LTC 1300 MegaHash ETH  A quick calculation shows that they are currently making:  LTC = $6,168.32 / month  ETH = $2808 / month ---------- TOTAL PROFIT  = $8976 month  30% = $2700 / month  The current GFL price is 0.04 USD.  = GFL burnt per month = 67,500 GFL  = GFL 810,000 / year burnt  if they really get 3 HDMU's running and x3 their current profits, then they will burn: GFL 2,430,000 /  year.  I mentioned this to the team and they suggested that 2,000,000 tokens burnt per year sounds very low. They predict it to be much higher.  So let's see. If they can burn 3 or 4 million per year. Maybe with their new incentives to payout 2% per month to people holding more than 20,000 GFL, maybe that can create some more scarcity for the token too.  Currently they are offering 2 options for GFL staking:  Option 1 - minimum stake is 20,000 GFL - you get paid 2% per month in GFL dividends. Option 2 - minimum stake is 50,000 GFL - you can get up to 6% per month in GFL dividends.  That is pretty juicy, if say 1000 people all stake 50,000 GFL - then that's 50,000,000 GFL all gone. There are only 50,010,903 GFL the public circulation remember. That could pump the price up considerably.  Let's a very conservative look:  There are currently 23 Token holders that have 20,000 and over. We can guess that they will all stake there 20,000 GFL There's also about 22 holders that have betwee 50,000 GFL - 100,000 GFL, so we can guess they will stake too. That's about 2,000,000 GFL staked.  So if the team manage to burn 4 million per year we could possible see the following:  GFL in circulation: YEAR 1 - 48,010,903 GFL YEAR 2 - 44,000,000 GFL YEAR 3 - 40,000,000 GFL  Maybe we will see a 25% rise in value of GFL in 3 years. Of course this is crypto so as soon as GFL gets on a decent exchange the price can go much higher. Especially as this token has a 2% dividend each month.  [my figures are probably way off - but just to give a very rough idea]",False

There is a lot.  Even If we give to these guys 10 mil tomorrow, they dont even have a source to buy Hardware. Bitmain is Sold out. Did they state the source of buying GPUs and which ones?  Etherium is switching to PoS meaning no more mining just STAKING !  To me investing in Cloud mining seems a better idea that this. Whole point of investing in Actual/Real mining is that  cloud mining pays you only about 40% of revenue, this is exactly the same number what these guys promise to pay their shareholders who hold large amount of tokens.  There is no 20 megawatt of electricity power from Hydroplants at the location they state. If there is, how much are they paying to get transformers that generate this much electricity? They want to compete with Bitfury which is using up to 25-30 megawatt and is worlds leading Mining company. Experienced in every way and aspect of mining, they do produce mining chips and sell block containers with 7.5 Petahash @ cost of 800K USD.  They have built a 2-3 mining rigs with 20 GPU's thinking now that they can make one of the largest mining farm with T-shirts saying mega data center.  Who is going to benefit from this ICO and raised capital ? Founders This project is going to make millionaires only the founders. Period !  I would wish to see who their supplier is going to be with GPU's and ASICs? They need to find supplier first and then do the rest. If they raise 10 mil for example, its going to be sitting in their account for months because all mining equipment inc GPUS and ASIC is sold out. When they cant buy nothing for long time, it gets boring, then money gets distributed within the team.  If bitfury was going to do ICO, id invest, because they have already build a lot, and asking money to expand. This guys asking money now, saying to build something in 6 months time, and start paying dividents only 40% of revenue ? invest in cloud mining or get your mining rig.

In my eyes, these are not negative questions but rather helpful questions. As I like to say, ""a dumb question is a question that isn't asked"".  As an investor/trader myself, I would have the same questions as all of you have, and it seems that Vakhtang has answered them in their entirety.  There are many ICOs that come out for the sole purpose of taking your money. I fell victim to one such ICO (coinjob) as I was one of the first 10 people to send my 1 ether to them as soon as they launched and I STILL have not received any Jobis back. I asked the owner, Max, on how I could acquire my 1500 Jobi but he stopped responding. I am sure some of you have fell victim to these scams as well and I do not stand for such people or projects.  Golden Fleece is different in a sense that they are honest and transparent. So far I have seen in this forum that despite the constant bombardment of skepticism and doubt, they have stood firm and honest will all inquiries and are even willing to personally talk with you.  In my cryptocurrency trading career, I personally have not seen any member(s) of an ICO/company who are willing to answer any questions asked in their entirety or even waste their time answering small inquiries I have, keeping in mind that I am the type of person to ask questions before committing. When I meet someone who is able to not only take my skepticism, but is ready to answer my questions in such detail, I personally would say they are not here to steal my money.  Golden Fleece seems small and might lack a fancy website like all other ICOs, but the point of an Initial Coin Offering from my understanding is for a company to open up trading (offering of coin) to the public in order to raise money to improve the business. I am sure once funds come in there will be a fancier website and all the other quirks people want to see.  I will end this post by saying this, trading is a risk. You will lose money to scammers (as I have had the unfortunate experience)/ and by not being a skilled trader, or you might make a big profit in a company that is starting up and have lots of potential (FOMO is always the worste). Always trade with money that you are ready to lose, and if that isn't what you are doing then my advise would be not to trade.  I may get some love/hate responses to this post, and that's ok.

Bitfuty is using electricity produced by the hydropower plants.  There is no electricity produced by the Black Sea. The land of Colchis (nowadays territory of Samegrelo region of Georgia) is at the eastern coastline of the Black Sea where the largest hydropower plant in Georgia (and one of the largest in the world!) called Enguri HPP is located; installed capacity of the Enguri HPP is 1300 MW! Again in Samegrelo, there are two more large HPPs (name: Vardnilihesi I and II) with installed capacity in total 340 MW. Thus, one single region of Georgia produces solely 1640 MW of electricity! YES, 1640MW!!  During spring/summer times Georgia is net exporter of electricity and major supplier of electricity for such a big market like Turkey. You can find more info and links here http://goldenfleece.co/index.php/2017/07/20/electricity-price-in-georgia/  In addition, some portion of electricity consumed by the Golden Fleece mega mining datacenter will be produced by small scale solar and wind power plants that we will built next to the our facility in consultations with our British partner http://gjrenewables.com  Furthermore, currently we are in negotiations with Free Industrial Zones (tax free) all over Georgia; initial agreement reached and in the near future we will sign the MOU to secure space for our mining datacenter. As soon MOU finalized it will be available to public through our new web-site (new web-site will be launched soon).   Profit distribution details:  Profit distribution will be based on token repurchase. After datacenter will be operational, company will allocate half of its mining profit to repurchase token with market price (2-5% of tokens monthly). Repurchased tokens will be destroyed. Other half of the profit will be used for further increasing datacenter capacity and possibly building the backup datacenter in other country.  Answering your previous comment: yes, GFL will be available on major exchanges after the ICO.  We call on you, respect Georgian people!!! Georgians are mature enough and smarter then you can imagine to define difference between Bitcoin and altcoin.   DO MORE RESEARCH ON GEORGIA!

Nobody know Georgia better than me, and I wouldnt suggest anyone investing in This ICO. For the Sake of ICO's being not just popular and money making machine, but a reliable source of raising capital, that would support real, legit ideas.  What can you build on etherium ? what can you build on Waves? A mining FARM ? A fake ICO fool people raise money and run away... That would fu.ck up the reputation of ICO's in General, Forever, until SEC regulates it sometime in Future, before that, Big NO NO!    I see the attempt though, guys really spend time some time on it... Just not Enough. Its just not convincing. ICO's are not just seeing lots of money in the sea and chasing like Sharks, No guys!

Do you guys even know how much is 20 Megawatt of Energy ? Bitfury Georgia mining farm generating up to 45megawatt and holding around 3.5% of hashing power of the total hashing pool. Their vote in the recent BTC fork was up to 3% 2. What coin do you guys want to mine and what hardware do you want to purchase with that 50 million USD?  I wouldnt invest in Just etherium mining, maybe diversifying would help you a lot, such as Scrypt, X11, SHA-256, Dagger-Hashimoto (UBIQ,Zcash) Pascal, Sia  Contact Bitmain, Contact InnoSillicon. If you somehow raise 50 million they will provide you with D3's, S9's, L3+'s, but in December, January time)))  What Graphic cards are you going to be buying? Source ? Radeon, Nvidia ? By the time you build the plant Radeon/Nvidia would produce new GPU's that would be sold out.  20 Mega watt = 10000 S9 Miners 5000 L3+ Miners, and 10000 GPUS  I wish someone could really have 20 megawatt of hydropower in any country at a cost of 0.05cents.  If you reach 500K Goal, count me in for help)) After you reach 1 million, after I know all your hardware sources, your energy source (Real, official documentation), then maybe Id invest, and explain to others why should they  Georgia is very attractive for mining, no wonder why Bitfury started there... But there is physical impossibility to Generate this much power from the hydropower from black sea. there are no windmills at black sea, which belongs to anyone but government (if there is any)  And finally: guys build something first, raise angel investors money, raise some venture capital, reach 1million goal, in the end its a mining farm not a new technology, start mining yourselves, reach some hashpower, eg: 1peta hash (1000THs) of SHA-256, 10000-20 000THS of Dagger Hashimito power, 50 000 Scrypt power, at least 200-300 Ghz X11 power and Come again and I assure you people would invest.

Let me elaborate on points you have made:  CONS: 1. It is not quite a right time to do this type of ICO        -Thats subjective point, can you state arguments for it?   2. Etherium Mining is not profitable                              -What do you mean by not profitable, what is your Required Rate of Return? Payback of less than a year is very profitable and achievable with GPU mining, with current ethereum prices. 3. There is no 20 Megawatt of electricity power in Georgia at cost of 5-6 Cents           - I can argue with this, pleas read our post regarding electricity prices, you can find sources with latest historical electricity prices. 4. Specify: Is it 0.05 or 0.06 cents per kw                         -It is 0.050.06 USD - or in other words 5-6 dollar cents per kw/h 5. 0.05 Cents in REP of Georgia is Only at free economic zone  which is Located only at www.TBZ.Ge                    -I can also argue with that, I work in Electricity company and have market knowledge,  the only difference for FIZ is that you dont pay VAT on electricity purchased, so thats 18% over price, but you know this VAT is not an expense at the end but differed tax asset which you can claim. 6. There is no hydropowerplant in Georgian Black SEA.        - No one claimed Hydro Power Plant in Black Sea, we were reffering to Hydropower Plants that are in western part of Georgia, NEAR Black Sea cost. 7. There is impossibility to exist 20 Megawatt of electricity in Todays Georgian Economic Situation.         -I don't get this point, what do you mean? One single Enguri HPP has 1300 MW power, and there are dozen hpps with more than 20 MW power production. 8. To generate 20megawatt of HydroPower you have to invest around 2.5 MILLION USD, especially in the SEA.       -Same point, we didn't mention HPP IN the SEA, I have never heared of Hydropower Plant in the sea. 9. Nobody has yet made this much investment in hydropower Electricity in GEORGIA                           -There are several HPP cunstructed and in construction process which have several million dollar investment, I will name a few: Nenskra (1 billion USD), Shuakhevi HPP (400 mln USD), Namakhvani HPP (700 mln USD) and many other smaller ones, you can google them. BUT we are not building HPP, we newer claimed it, we will just use their power. 10. This type of investment is never done in Georgian without GEORGIAN GOVERMENT being in CHARGE        -I can also argue with that, I am directly and indirectly involved in many large projects done in Georgia. Georgian government supports foreign direct investment, they adore investors and help them as much as government can help. 11. You do not have any hardware bought at this moment.         - We have currently 96 gpu-s in 24 mining rig-s shown in photos, we have made another order already, we have bought land for construction of final datacenter, and we own building in which current pilot mining datacenter is located. 12. What type of hardware you want to buy with the gifted money that people would invest?        -This is not charity, please be respective to what we do. 13. Website in World Press                           - I have stated many times that we are working on new website, sorry for delays. 14. Team = non existant , foreign names          - All three foreigners Georg Van den Berg, Moses Ilunga, Leon Lim are in my facebook friends you can find them and contact directly, I will post here links to their profiles in the same order:  https://www.facebook.com/georginizmir https://www.facebook.com/moses.ilunga https://www.facebook.com/leonlimjh  Pros: 1. Georgia basically legalised Crypto currency and One of the major Georgian bank is trading it.        -Oh finally Pros thank you, thats true point. 2. Bitfury is really located in Georgia and has expanded since 2013          -True 3. Georgia really has free economic zone with no taxes and electricity cost with 0.05cent (The problem is they cannot provide electricity, you have to go out find your own source, that is physically impossible)       --There is NO link between FIZ and electricity! Being in FIZ doesnt grant you any better conditions in finding cheap electricity. The only difference is in taxation scheme. 4. Ministry of Justice of Georgia uses blockchain technologies to register land ownership in Georgia.        -Also true  Sorry if my comments were emotional. And thank you once more for spending your precious time to write this post.  Today I had interview on national TV with very good feedback.

I had interview on national TV yesterday and we were blown away by messages and meeting inquiries locally. Today we had meeting with Techno Park (Georgian Innovations Agency), we talked for two hours, they expressed interest and support for our project. They will provide legal/financial/business consultancy by Deloitte, they will provide us with 24/7 modern office infrastructure and will help to promote project both locally and internationally.     1. You have 96 GPUS ? What Are they ?         - we have MSI RX580 2. What are you going to Be mining Exactly ? Altcoins, Specify ? What about Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash ?      - we plan to have following portfolio (may change slightly): 50% ethereum, 20% bitcoin, 10% dash, 10% monero, 10% zcash. 3. How many more GPU's have you ordered ? Can you show us the invoice and the payment made and expected date of the order arrival ?       - we have ordered RX580 sapphires and P106-100. sorry but I cant provide information about our suppliers, it will also bring their stocks down, which is not in our interest. 4. Who is your main supplier ? Do you have any further connections with them ?     - we have three main suppliers, which we consider for bulk purchases, one is in Dubai, one is in Singapore and one local representative for peripherals.   5. 96 GPU/7= around 13 mining rigs. My friend has 12 Mining rigs at his garage, why should I give money to you and not to him ?       - This is PILOT mining datacenter, this is not collateral for your investment, nor it is to show our financial input. 6. Why do you need 50 Million USD ? Can you Specify allocation of the funds ?    - Datacenters will be built in several stages, it is not one stop shop. First stage should be finished by February if all goes well. Fund allocation after project is full funded will look like this:  Grid connection        1,238,542      2% Servers                   40,000,000      80%   (including networking infrastructure) Building                     1,333,333      3% Ventilation/Cooling        266,667      1% Other costs             1,000,000      2% Working Capital           2,000,000      2% The rest amount will be spent on coin repurchase.           The aim is to spend as small amount as possible for anything other then GPU/ASICs, thus bringing down $ cost / MHs.   7. Are you going to buy mining just with GPUS?       -No, ASICS also, but with smaller share ~20% 8. What is you profit after electricity costs and maintenance currently at your 96GPU & hashrate?      - We pay around 700$ for electricity per month, hashrate is ~2,800 MH/s, Profit is 5-6 k $. 9. Can you provide us with the info to look at your hashrate on blockchain ?         -Sure:     http://dwarfpool.com/eth/address?wallet=3f5ad69e3609c5e8f0922a44f5e7baa0ed9dec78 10. Why do you think you can raise 50 Million so easily ?             -Nobody says it will be easy, though we are determined. We don't plan actually raising all of that amount through crowdfunding, we are negotiating with several investment funds and private investors, we already booked 25% and will book another 10-15% of total cap for private investors. We will announce names once deal is signed, I hope it will be before ICO. EOS did it because it has technology behind, great team, motivation and a specific goal, and it hasnt succeeded yet, same goes with Tezos...           -Their business model is software based, our business model is hardware based. For hardware projects 50 million is not a big deal at all.  11. Why do you need to mine Etherium, to Issue your Own token ? Why just issue your token based on etheirum blockchain ?       -We are considering double blockchain option, working on it. We don't want to delute total number of coins, trying to figure out technical ways. 12. Are you just selling your Coin, technology behind it ? or what are you exactly selling ?            -We are building mining datacenters, for funding this project we issued our token, which we are selling. 13. Will token holders be holding shares in the company that you will register, will they own assets as well eg: GPU's, or even land ? As an Investor what would I own if I invest in your company.        -Tokens represent shares in the company, however there is no legal binding and no legal obligations, just our intent and promise to repurchase tokens with generated revenue. However we are willing to offer legal shares in the company for large investors, though their equivalent tokens should be put on escrow.    I would love to fund projects like this only if something is already build and I (or crowdfund) can help to expand but I will give you some examples what Bitfury can offer and I quote: We do have our 7.5PH, 1.1MW Blockbox AC available.

You can read my post about electricity prices on the website: http://goldenfleece.co/index.php/2017/07/20/electricity-price-in-georgia/  But I will also review wind/solar here. More than 80% of energy is derived from Hydro Power Plants, the rest is derived in winter by Gas Powered Plants.Wind and solar are new to Georgia but have strong support from the state. There was launched first 20 MW wind power plant last year in Georgia, near city Gori. Because it was pilot project and built by state owned agency, state gave them quite high Power Purchase Agreement for 6.89 USD cents per KW/h. There is 5 MW pilot solar project which is being built in Udabno region with 6.5 USD cent PPA. However our energy partner Georg Van Der Berg (you can find him on our team page) with deep expertise in renewable energy is ready to develop solar power plant with 6 USD cent purchase agreement. We also have local small scale renewable partner company called Helios, they will be doing video review of our mining plans next week on national tv.    These are useful links about Georgian energy sector: http://forbes.ge/news/2332/In-7-months%2C-the-wind-power-plant-in-Kartli-generated-3-mln-kWh-more-energy-than-forecasted- https://investingeorgia.org/en/keysectors/energy  Legislation is liberal for cryptocurrency.
