For each ETH your network contributes to our presale contract, we will award 500 BST tokens!  ‚ÑπÔ∏è The Presale Referral Program is free to join, easy to sign-up and requires no technical knowledge. In order to receive additional BST tokens, you simply promote Blocksquare by posting promotional materials regarding the Blocksquare Presale throughout the web.  üí° How can I get my referral link? To get your referral link you just have to sign up and complete a simple registration form. You can decide to enter your Ethereum Wallet address at sign up or add it later on.  When you join the referral program, you will be supplied with your personal referral link that you can place on your website site, social profiles, forums, telegram groups and other places on the web.  üí° How does the referral program work?  When a user clicks on your link, they will be brought to our Presale contribution page at dashboard.blocksquare.io. We then track when they create a Blocksquare Contributor Account and input all required info for KYC/AML including their Ethereum contribution address. We record their Ethereum contribution address and will share it privately only with you, our affiliate, so you can check how much ETH was contributed in total from your network of referrals.  Any inquiries regarding our affiliate program should be sent to future@blocksquare.io with PRESALE REFERRAL in the subject line.  üí° How much BST will I be awarded?  You receive BST tokens with every ETH contribution received from users you‚Äôve brought to our landing page‚Ää.  1 ETH ‚Üí 500 BST  For example, if a user from your referral link contributes 0.3 ETH, you receive 500 x 0.3 = 150 BST commission.  üí° When will I receive the earned BST tokens? After the presale has successfully ended, your earned BST tokens will be recalculated to match the exact funding derived from your referral network.

You can expect any ongoing bounties to be posted here so make sure to bookmark this thread.     Twitter Bounty  We've recently announced our Telegram bounty campaign on Bounty0x and received a great response. We have now surpassed 1000 members and will soon hit 2000! We are now announcing a Twitter campaign that will be live until the end of March 2018 to support our upcoming Series A token sale.  Bounty Requirements  Bounty hunters must follow the official Blocksquare twitter account Account must have a minimum of 100 followers Account must be authentic and active. Fake, dead, inactive and bot accounts will be disqualified Participants must retweet and like at least 3 tweets per week Participants must post a minimum of 1 unique post a week including the hashtags #blocksquare #ICO and a link to https://blocksquare.io/ Participants are invited to join our Telegram Group and follow our Official Telegram Announcements Channel  Bounty Campaign Pool  A dynamic pool means the total reward pool increases depending on the total number of participants at the end of the bounty campaign. A participant is an account who earned a minimum of 5 twitter_stakes.  Up to 99 participants: 100,000 BST 100+ participants: 150,000 BST 250+ participants: 250,000 BST 250+ participants: 250,000 BST 500+ participants: 350,000 BST 1000+ participants: 500,000 BST  Stake Rewards  More than 100 followers: 5 twitter_stakes per week More than 500 followers: 10 twitter_stakes per week More than 1,000 followers: 20 twitter_stakes per week More than 3,000 followers: 40 twitter_stakes per week More than 5,000 followers: 80 twitter_stakes per week More than 10,000 followers: 160 twitter_stakes per week  How are stakes calculated into BST tokens? Bounty Campaign Pool / Total number of twitter_stakes * Number of twitter_stakes you earned = Amount of BST to receive  Example Calculation:  There are 150 participants at the end of the twitter campaign, with a total of 30,000 twitter_stakes awarded. You have 1,200 twitter followers and have qualified for the stakes reward during 5 weeks and earned a total of 5 x 20 = 100 twitter_stakes. In this example, 1 stake would be worth 150,000 BST / 30,000 twitter_stakes = 5 BST, thus your 100 twitter_stakes will award you 500 BST tokens.  NOTE: The above calculation is only an example to better understand how stakes in this Twitter bounty campaign work and should not be used as reference.  How to apply?  1) Sign-up at alpha.bounty0x.io 2) Search for ""Blocksquare"" in the twitter bounty category 3) Scroll down and click on the ""Apply"" button 4) Submit a link to your Twitter account!      Telegram Bounty  We've recently announced our Telegram bounty campaign on Bounty0x and received a great response. We have now surpassed 800 members and will soon hit 1000!  To build a strong community Blocksquare will reward your activity on our Telegram group with BST tokens.  Here is how:  1. Join us on Telegram! 2. Register for the Telegram bounty program. 3. Get involved! Check out our website, whitepaper, technical paper, pitch decks, FAQ and other materials that we will provide in the future. Ask questions, find topics you would like to better understand, let us know where we can improve our presentation or simply highlight what seems important to you. 4. Follow your Telegram activity on our tracking page 5. Check BST token distributions after a new milestone is achieved here.  A reward pool will be distributed after the community reaches each milestone. The top 20% of the most active users ranked by activity on our tracking page will split the reward pool. The split will be weighed by activity percentage, rewarding more active members with more BST tokens. The tracking page is run by combot.org.  Milestones and reward pools  >>> Milestone 5 reached <<<    Extra Community Health Reward  Additionally, we will be giving away weekly rewards to the community by monitoring the Community Health metric. Community Health measures how many users in the chat group actively generated content. The percent is based on the 80/20 Pareto rule - when 20% users in a chat generate 80% of all messages the community is regarded as healthy. And when the number of active users drops to lower values, for example, only 1% of active users generates 80% of content, the community health rating will drop too. Maintaining 100% or more is considered absolutely great.  Thus, each week the Community Health metric is above 100%, a reward will be distributed from our Community Health Pool. The reward to be distributed is calculated multiplying the Community Health % by 50,000 BST e.g. 180% x 50,000 BST = 90,000 BST. The Community Health reward is distributed to all active members (i.e. users who posted at least 1 message during the week period) for the past week until all Community Health Pool BST tokens are distributed to community members.  Total Community Health Pool: 500,000 BST    We believe the right way to build a vibrant community is to share the creation of value with participating members who see the potential impact Blocksquare can have on commercial real estate markets worldwide.

Yes, as you mentioned, we are working on a pilot project that includes actual real estate properties. The pilot will produce a platform with basic features powered by Blocksquare. The platform will become a publicly accessible product to showcase the Blocksquare system.  For now, we are bound by the NDA with the real estate developer and can't disclose much information on the property itself. We did however speak with them and agreed we can say a few things.

No, not at the moment. However, we do have 10% of the total BST token supply set aside for various future bounties.  Our strategy involves a MULTI-SERIES TOKEN SALE. This means 60% of the total BST token supply will be distributed in multiple token sale events, enabling us to gradually extend our runway as we develop Blokcsquare into a global standard. Starting with our pre-sale where we will distribute 10% of the total supply, then a Series A token sale in March 2018 distributing another 10% of the supply. Future token sales (series B, C, D...) will follow in 6-12 month intervals, depending on company funding needs.  You can read more on our motivations for such a strategy in a blog post from 2017 by our CEO, Denis Petrovcic, titled:""ICOs, don't bite off more then you can chew.""",False

Blocksquare is a plug & play system of protocols, APIs and tools for simple property tokenisation. Similar to how Stripe offers easy online payment processing for e-commerce sites (e.g. Kickstarter), Blocksquare is building a system so online real estate platforms can tap into the upcoming tokenised real estate market.  Platforms will choose to integrate Blocksquare because:  it will enable them to leverage blockchain technology at minimal cost, the system can be adapted to local regulatory rules, the PropToken standard encourages market participation, is a system that puts trust at its core.  Blocksquare targets clients that already deal with real estate online and provides them the required technical infrastructure to embark into a market of tokenised commercial real estate.
