What a camera is to a photographer, the internet is to a tech worker. They rely on the internet for industry knowledge, community, and most importantly, career opportunities. Despite the tremendous growth of the web, the tools available for Tech workers to search for said career opportunities have remained incredibly stagnant. Additionally, for Small to Medium-sized businesses, outsourced recruiting fees are not feasible, at $20,000 USD per tech position on average.  SmartRefer is a platform developed to disrupt this issue by de-centralizing and personalizing the job application process. It will allow any user to apply for jobs, receive job referrals and send job referrals within their personal network, incentivized by our REFER [REF] Memberships. SmartRefer will also reduce recruiting fees between 15-25% for employers.  REFER Memberships can be redeemed within the SmartRefer Marketplace (SmartMarket) for gift cards, coupons, skill upgrades, interview coaching, resume assistance or a FIAT currency. REFER can also be redeemed to get products & services directly from companies already using the SmartRefer platform.   SmartRefer's ERC-223 Crowdsale Factory  SmartRefer's Crowdsale Factory is a collection of smart contracts made for Ethereum-based crowdsales, using the ERC-223 standard. We decided to build the world's first comprehensive, easy to follow, ERC-223 library to help other Ethereum-based projects fast-track their development.  Currently, there are no other complete crowdsale boilerplates based on the ERC-223 standard. Our work is based on the original ERC223 standard proposed by @dexaran (GitHub). Our code was heavily inspired by Zeppelin Solutions library.  While planning our platform's impending Pre-Sale (January 18th, 2017), we did exhaustive technical research on different patterns of launching various crowdsales, different contract types and the most common issues encountered. By researching more than 30 crowdsales, we took note of the most common patterns and design choices. We have completely restructured, and implemented them in our library.  Our library and contracts are fully backward compatible with the ERC-20 standard; we decided to run a rewritten version of Zeppelin Solution test cases on our library to confirm that. Additionally, we tried to be as thorough as possible while writing comments so that this could be a valuable learning resource for programmers transition into learning solidity.  You can look through our complete ERC-223 Boilerplates here: https://github.com/SmartRefer   ERC-223 Standard  The ERC-223 Standard was chosen by our team due to the following features:  1) Allows contract developers to handle incoming token transactions same way as they would treat an Ether transaction due to a tokenFallback() function. 2) ERC223 transfer to contract consumes half as much gas as ERC20 approve and transferFrom at receiver contract. 3) Provides a possibility to avoid accidentally lost tokens inside contracts that are not designed to work with sent tokens. For instance, when users send the tokens to the token's contract by mistake, they would be held by those contracts. These tokens will not be accessible as there is no function to withdraw them from the contract, making them effectively lost:  A) 244131 GNT in Golem contract ~ $54333: https://etherscan.io/token/Golem?a=0xa74476443119a942de498590fe1f2454d7d4ac0d B) 200 REP in Augur contract ~ $3292: https://etherscan.io/token/REP?a=0x48c80f1f4d53d5951e5d5438b54cba84f29f32a5 C) 777 DGD in Digix DAO contract ~ $7500: https://etherscan.io/token/0xe0b7927c4af23765cb51314a0e0521a9645f0e2a?a=0xe0b7927c4af23765cb51314a0e0521a9645f0e2a D) 10150 1ST in FirstBlood contract ~ $3466: https://etherscan.io/token/FirstBlood?a=0xaf30d2a7e90d7dc361c8c4585e9bb7d2f6f15bc7 E) 30 MLN in Melonport contract ~ $1197: https://etherscan.io/token/Melon?a=0xBEB9eF514a379B997e0798FDcC901Ee474B6D9A1+    Next Steps  SmartRefer will holding a Pre-Sale for interested customers starting January 18th, 2017.
