What sets Red Pill coin apart from other coins is transparency and decentralization. Most other crypto's say that they are decentralized however they really aren't. Their networks are privatized, the companies hold significant amounts of the crypto, and everything ends up in a closed ecosystem. In our case we are avoiding that entirely. We are giving the power and the control to the community. In the end we will only be consumers and facilitators, and anyone can also create wallets, and services around the crypto as well. Because it's Ethereum based, any wallet that supports ERC20 coins can support Red Pills. We eliminate the banks, the middle men, and instead put the power back into the hands of the people.",False

According to your website, the official exchange for Red Pill Coin is bitsquare.io. You guys are not planning on listing the cryptocurrency in any other exchange other than bitsquare.io? Moreover, what sets apart Red Pill Coin from the other projects out there that has the same concept and idea? There are a lot of funding platforms out there so what makes this cryptocurrency and platform set apart from all others?  Thanks for the great questions. First off we simply announced the official platform that it would be trading on so people would know early on. Red Pill Coin will be listed on numerous other platforms as well. Most coins launch without giving people any idea which exchanges the coin will be available on so we made this information available early on.  The only other coin that comes close to competing with us is called ReddCoin. ReddCoin has been around for a few years now, but has failed to gain use or real recognition. A few of the reasons for this are because of limited compatibility. Red Pill Coins can be accessed from any Ethereum wallet that supports custom ERC20 tokens. Red Pill coin runs on the Ethereum blockchain which is stable and secure. Reddcoin uses their own standard, their own wallet and is in reality a closed ecosystem (this is another critism that other fund yourself platforms share as well). If you want to use, trade or access Reddcoins, you have to go through them in some way. Red Pill coin is fully decentralized. Developers can create their own wallets or apps to support it and consumers can choose from dozens of apps and extensions that can readily support it.  Red Pill has a growing community behind it. It also receives instant brand recognition as a cryptocurrency. The chrome extension for Red Pill coin is currently in development and will enter the Beta stage soon. The Android App will be out early next year however we are also working behind the scene to make Red Pill compatible with various different existing cryptocurrency app wallets on both Android and IOS.",False

Please watch this video which illustrates why there will be demand and growth for this coin - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gcaxyyk9QI  Quote Will you be the new bitcoin?  We aren't competing directly with Bitcoin, instead we are focusing on a specific segment of the market, which helps fans to fund creators on a decentralized platform. Our upcoming chrome extension is being tailored for easy use with any online or social media platform that content creators use, which includes YouTuber's, bloggers and other online entertainers/content creators. Rather than trying to be Bitcoin, we are going to be Red Pill and empower creators/fans.",False
