From the moment an Asset — a digital reflection of a unique real-life object or batch — is created on AMB-NET, Events — additional quality measurements — are linked to unique Assets. These Events are generated by mobile sensors that communicate the readings to AMB-NET to provide sensor data instantly, allowing for real-time quality assurance throughout the supply chain. Ahead of our upcoming release of the AMB Cryptoeconomic model, which is designed with sensor-to-blockchain communication in mind, we are unveiling the first generation of Ambrosus mobile sensor hubs. A sensor hub serves as the hosting block for other smaller sensors measuring different parameters, such as temperature, humidity, location, stability, etc. The sensor hubs can be manufactured using both traditional means of production, as well as using 3D Printing techniques. The first generation of 3-D printed devices that interact with AMB-NET is shown below.  https://blog.ambrosus.com/ambrosus-3d-printed-mobile-sensor-hub-and-seals-innovation-lab-update-4163386f8fbe",False

In his talk with the audience Mr. Croncota stressed his desire to make Ambrosus more well-known, and emphasized the importance of transparency and honesty.  • Throughout the talk Dr. Vlad Trifa and Mr. Versetti stressed the power of keeping Ambrosus open source. They discussed how the revolutionary changes Ambrosus will bring to the food and pharmaceutical industries are often times difficult for current companies to accept (i.e. Monsanto), however, especially in terms of demonstrating quality, Ambrosus will be essential for companies wanting to demonstrate their authenticity (the example was given of Asian companies who will have the opportunity to use Ambrosus to demonstrate a European Union level quality of their products).  • Dr. Vlad Trifa also was very keen to emphasize how the Ambrosus NET registers ‘events’. What this ultimately means is that not only food, or medicine can be tracked in the Ambrosus system: but rather, any asset that may require an ‘event’ so as to be assembled (i.e. Car Parts) will also be eligible for Ambrosus tracking.  • Mr. Versetti discussed a couple of real use cases for Ambrosus. Most importantly, he mentioned a company (currently under NDA) but valued at around 22 billion. As well as two other companies: one valued at around 2 billion and the other in-between 2 to 4 billion. His use cases were the Chocolate and Coffee industries.  • A key question asked was about possible expansion and geographical location. Mr. Versetti stressed how Ambrosus already has more than enough opportunity in Europe, however a lot of European countries assemble their products (or get their produce) in Asia. On a different point, Mr. Versetti stressed the importance of engaging with both public (i.e. government) and private actors so as to ensure that certain import-export or tariff barriers are taken into account. Finally, Mr. Versetti discussed the partnership with the UN Sustainable Food Program and put the call out for any company working with the program in developing countries to get in touch if they desire to.  • One final general point is that both Mr. Versetti and Dr. Trifa were very keen to emphasize how Ambrosus will be compatible with many other systems in the blockchain and IoT space. The Ambrosus project is ultimately planning for the long term: smart cities, more complete blockchain adoption and open source participation, etc.  Credits to mondaysblow",False

Firstly, we would like to clarify that Ambrosus as such is not offering any investments and the token is not a security.    The token is bonded to the product and works as a certficate. It records the entire history of the product on the supply chain, thus assuring its quality and origin.    The main principle behind the token economics is that the AMB token will circulate between Ambrosus and service - providers. The token will be needed by companies to track the supply chain, by developers who will wish to create apps on the eco - system etc.   You can find out more about the use of the Ambrosus token in this article: https://blog.ambrosus.com/ambrosus-in-a-nutshell-62a8bf40b60e   ",False

So if the administrator of a signature campaign is not releasing his bounty hunters ASAP from the burden to wear their signature in a period of time for which they will not be paid for, he ends up cheating his bounty hunters. In fact, bounty hunters would remain trapped in a campaign where they would not be paid any more. Since Ambrosus seems to be run by honest people, I hope they will deal with this issue ASAP.

Until recently there has been no possibility to trade such tokens (no network – deposit/withdrawl doesn’t work). But Liqui team has found a solution: when a trader/investor participates in ICO indirectly but through our platform (all transaction IDs are of course provided to developers’ wallets) – we can credited the balance of the relevant coin to them once the crowdsale is over!  Therefore, trading begins hours after ICO and there’s no need to wait until coin developers release the network (which often takes months). Or you can just keep the tokens on the balance (like it happens in any ICO) and once the network has been released – withdraw them. When the network is ready – IOU flag disappears from the relevant pair and then this pair functions as an ordinary coin.  From HitBTC: What is an IOU?

I joined their Slack channel and scammers were PM'ing phishing scams (as all ICO slack channels do).. rather than risk any of their community fall victim to it they shut it completely down and migrated to Discord. I think that killed a lot of momentum (not everyone switched over). The other one was switching the ICO start date from Sept 13 -> 22nd. It fell off some peoples radar. The last one was they put more resources into building out technical documents (all which I read, and were very high quality) rather than any flashy promotional material. I realize I'm probably the exception but I took the time to read all these things. I was impressed and become extremely informed on the project.  In the end though hype is great, but a team delivering their product and hitting their deliverables is what matters. Think about it: You hold Amber for a few years. Would you rather they be REALLY good at marketing/creating hype? Or REALLY good at building their product/growing their ecosystem and having businesses adopt their product? Marketing/hype is nice yes, but the second one is much more important and everything I've looked at so far points to them being able to do just that. So I'm going to definitely bet on them being able to do the latter",False

The various articles have mentioned that there are already partners lined up for Ambrosus, two of them I think went public (in the last blog update). I remember when we first started having labels for bio food, everyone said it was not going to last, only vegans and hippies buy this, blabla.

I'm not sure it's your intention or not but it screams FUD or someone who hasn't actually looked at their project. If Ambrosus goes to court so would every other ICO ever....including Ethereum!

They clearly aren't stupid and will likely be listed on exchanges, but they can't say that for legal reasons as well as the fact exchanges do not like it when projects get ahead of themselves and say these things. Can you point to any credible ICO that has said otherwise recently? Umm no. If an ICO is talking about exchanges or how it's an investment that is a red-flag to run for the hills. It would tell me they are the stupid ones and they either don't give a shit about compliance/regulation or don't care in which case a rational individual could only conclude they're in it for the short-term. Why do I come to this conclusion about being listed on exchanges in the future? Look at their advisors -- some of them have tie ins (equity or partnerships) with exchanges, so yeah put 2 and 2 together on your own. I can safely say these things because this is speculation on my part. Ambrosus hasn't told me this, and no I don't work for them (I did 'invest' however). I just did my own homework and realized that this is most likely the case.  PS - the tokens HAVE to be transferable.

Say, I'd put 0.000001AMB in an escrow and create a smart contract with 500ETH in another escrow..

Cannot deny that token holders have somehow ""contibuted"" financially to the TGE and surely they want to have a bigger and clear picture of what are they going to hold in future...if not a commodity. I believe is very important to give them a porpouse or a reason to partecipate to the TGE, to avoid misunderstanding and not get considered milking cows.",False

After spending more than a few hours on due diligence it becomes clear that between their ambitious roadmap if anything it's actually a bit on the light side. Here's why:  A normal ICO: -Write a bunch of code. Software is scalable. You need some blockchain developers & perhaps some marketing  Ambrosus ICO: -A hardware company that is doing R&D to overhaul current supply chain solutions and using the blockchain as an innovative way to do just that -Write a bunch of code (software once again is scalable) They'll need blockchain developers to do this too -Research & develop new technology around hardware sensors. For those who don't understand the difference between hardware/software, this is not cheap at all.. -Form, develop & run test pilots to help with integration of said new hardware sensor technology and create an ecosystem of B2B customers -Create food research lab in Switzerland and ensure testing etc..  That is just scratching the surface.  The problems I see:  Ambrosus has taken the high road when many ICO's have gone the low road. By that I mean I had to dig deep to truly uncover what I feel is a tier 1/very high potential project. Unfortunately they don't toot their own horn or self-promote like many others and try to let the project speak for itself. Because of this their social media needs improvement (they're working on it) as they understand that even if a project is amazing in quality, it stills needs to be marketed. I made my investment based on tens of hours of research, not a shallow YouTube video, anyhow I disgress. Hope this answers your question (By the way, it's a good one, I asked it myself when I started looking at the project!)",False

We have earlier posted security warnings bout leekico.com page that offered amber tokens on its website, which we speculated was either an honest mistake or an outright scam. After we had discovered that the page was accepting ETH and promised to give AMB in return, we immediately sent the message across our social media channels warning about a fake. We received communication from LeekICO team it appears that the page is legitimate. So we apologise for false labelling them as scam.  How this happened: 1) We received no prior communication from the managers for the said page that they plan to offer amber tokens. 2) We had a phishing page , a full copy of ambrosus website just 3 days ago trying to scam people of out their money. We assumed that this page is another attempt to engage in fraud. We made these assumptions because: a) we could not load the contact us page on website; b) website was very laggy and slow on our side; c) the page had minimal number of subscribers on the social media; d) ambrosus was the only live project; e) we had other phishing attempts previously and also experience attempts to hack into our infrastructure; f) the website appeared to be hosted in China and had most of its traffic from China, and yet it was in English  3) All of these combined together into multiple red flags, as a result of which we have decided to pronounce page as fake and scam in order to protect people from fraud and theft.  Clarifications: 1) We are confident to a reasonably high level of degree that the page is not fake or scam 2) We are NOT in any way affiliated with that page. We do not have any formal relationship with the owners of the page. 3) We expressly prohibit sale of Amber tokens to the US citizens and residents. Our own TGE will include a form of KYC authorisation and will also exclude US-based IP addresses from accessing our webpage. We expect LeekICO to be likewise compliant with the law and applicable regulations. 4) We do not in any way control LeekICO or its activities. Thus any breach of law on their side is a matter to be resolved by LeekICO.  Apologies for inconvenience caused to all parties.",False

It will answer literally all the questions you ask.  About accepting money from companies to falsify the data. If this were ever to be discovered, ambrosus blockchain would lose all the public trust and value and therefore it would not make any sense for us to do this.  Assurance of the correctness/truthfulness of sensor-generated data is done through coupling their readings with the private signature. Thus if the sensor is hacked or broken, the network will simply exclude its readings.  The rest of your questions are to be answered in the final publication on token.",False
