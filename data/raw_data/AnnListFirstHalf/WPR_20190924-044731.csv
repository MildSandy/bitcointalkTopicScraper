WPR is a utility token that's usage is two-fold:  It provides priority access to renewable energy auctions on our platform. Renewable energy auctions are at the core of our proposition. WPR token holders have an exclusive priority access to purchase energy at the minimum auction price.  Energy allocation in the priority auction is equal to the share of total tokens a user has, compared to other auction participants. In the priority stage of the auction you can contract renewable energy without competing on price. It also constantly grants you access to the energy donation pool filled with 0.9% of the energy contracted via the auctions on our platform",False

Will max token supply remain the same? Yes, max supply remains the same.  2. Payouts from the donation pool will be done in WPR. Where does those WPR token come from? WPR for donation pool payouts will be bought on exchanges with funds from the share of the energy pool.  3. How does the Donation pool work? In order to participate in Donation Pool, WPR token holders must sign up to the platform, provide their WPR wallet address and make a validation transaction from that wallet to confirm its ownership. This needs to be done each month if you wish to participate in the donation pool. The money gathered in the donation pool is settled on a monthly basis. The pool is then divided between WPR token holders who have registered for that particular month. WPR token holders will receive their percentage of the donation pool only if they register on the platform and provide their WPR token wallet address. The donation pool is then ‘paid’ in the equivalent tokens. Each WPR token holder's share on that monthly settlement is dependent on how many WPR tokens they hold compared to the total number of WPR tokens held by all donation pool settlement participants of that month.  4. Does this mean a token holder has to re-register every month in order to participate in the donation pool? Yes. The requirement to register for the donation pool every month is because of the legal requirements for funds transactions.  5. Why Donation pool won't be paid out in energy tokens anymore? Payouts from the donation pool are made from the value of the energy sold. This means that ""energy tokens"" or WPRs, in this case, are mediators used for a value transfer. Calculation principle never changed - value during the time of the payout will be the same. More than that - energy tokens cannot be used anywhere outside the platform, while WPR is tradable. From the legal side, owning an energy token means one has rights for settlement between spot price and PPA price for a given period. WPR owner is not a participant in PPA agreement and thus can not participate in this settlement. Energy Tokens cannot be used for the payout as they are tied to the PPA.",False

Woohoo  What does a shift to B2B mean for token holders? Only good news! The initial business model was based on 20% of green energy production to be sold through auctions on our platform. With the shift to B2B, the volume of the auction has increased from 20% to 100%.  As all token holders know — 0.9% of the green energy producers’ donation to donation pool, shared by token holders, comes from the amount of green energy producers are selling on our platform. The shift to B2B will mean a flow of energy to the donation pool five times bigger than the initial one — a significant and beneficial change for WPR holders.  We would kindly ask for token holders and supporters from our community to stay mindful regarding the pace of progress of the first auctions on WePower platform.  The shift to B2B also means that these are bigger companies we are in business with and onboarding those companies will take time. We are, however, providing them with hands-on support making sure the process goes smoothly.  For all of you who are eager for our updates, we’d like to make a note that the summer holiday season in Australia lasts from mid-December to late January. This means we will be able to share a more detailed timeline once the on-boarding of the green energy developers and energy buyers resumes after everyone is back to business.",False

With WPR token holder will be able to receive 0.9% of energy tokens produced by renewable plants. 1 energy token equals to 1 kwh  WPR token will allow its holders:  1) Priority pass to participate in an auction for energy tokens of a newly connected energy plant. It provides an opportunity to buy green energy at the most favorable conditions. This will become an asset itself because large energy buyers will want to re-purchase these tokens for their own use. The supply of WPR tokens is limited.  2) Access to the green energy donation pool, which will be constantly filled with 0.9% energy donations required from all green energy project developers that want to join and fundraise on the WePower platform. Both features of WPR token is structured to increase demand for the token and invite more energy buyers to participate in the crypto world in order to buy WePower tokens.  Producers sets the prices and then it's up for the buyer to buy it or not. The team expects producers to offer best prices at the beginning to get the traction and get closer to the market prices as the auction gets closer to being closed.  Therefore, you'll be offered good pricing when you intend to purchase any of those tokenized energy that you could either use (if WePower is an Energy Provider in your country) or sell them for a profit.  The 0.9% in kWH is a benefit by simply holding on to WPR tokens",False

With WPR token holder will be able to receive 0.9% of energy tokens produced by renewable plants. 1 energy token equals to 1 kwh  WPR token will allow its holders:  1) Priority pass to participate in an auction for energy tokens of a newly connected energy plant. It provides an opportunity to buy green energy at the most favorable conditions. This will become an asset itself because large energy buyers will want to re-purchase these tokens for their own use. The supply of WPR tokens is limited.  2) Access to the green energy donation pool, which will be constantly filled with 0.9% energy donations required from all green energy project developers that want to join and fundraise on the WePower platform. Both features of WPR token is structured to increase demand for the token and invite more energy buyers to participate in the crypto world in order to buy WePower tokens.  Producers sets the prices and then it's up for the buyer to buy it or not. The team expects producers to offer best prices at the beginning to get the traction and get closer to the market prices as the auction gets closer to being closed.  Therefore, you'll be offered good pricing when you intend to purchase any of those tokenized energy that you could either use (if WePower is an Energy Provider in your country) or sell them for a profit.  The 0.9% in kWH is a benefit by simply holding on to WPR tokens",False

With WPR token holder will be able to receive 0.9% of energy tokens produced by renewable plants. 1 energy token equals to 1 kwh  WPR token will allow its holders:  1) Priority pass to participate in an auction for energy tokens of a newly connected energy plant. It provides an opportunity to buy green energy at the most favorable conditions. This will become an asset itself because large energy buyers will want to re-purchase these tokens for their own use. The supply of WPR tokens is limited.  2) Access to the green energy donation pool, which will be constantly filled with 0.9% energy donations required from all green energy project developers that want to join and fundraise on the WePower platform. Both features of WPR token is structured to increase demand for the token and invite more energy buyers to participate in the crypto world in order to buy WePower tokens.  Producers sets the prices and then it's up for the buyer to buy it or not. The team expects producers to offer best prices at the beginning to get the traction and get closer to the market prices as the auction gets closer to being closed.  Therefore, you'll be offered good pricing when you intend to purchase any of those tokenized energy that you could either use (if WePower is an Energy Provider in your country) or sell them for a profit.  The 0.9% in kWH is a benefit by simply holding on to WPR tokens",False

But if it is, have a look at this.  WePower has a 2 token system (WPR token and energy token pegged to 1 kwh). With WPR token holder will be able to receive 0.9% of energy tokens produced by renewable plants. 1 energy token equals to 1 kwh  WPR token will allow its holders:  1) Priority pass to participate in an auction for energy tokens of a newly connected energy plant. It provides an opportunity to buy green energy at the most favorable conditions. This will become an asset itself because large energy buyers will want to re-purchase these tokens for their own use. The supply of WPR tokens is limited.  2) Access to the green energy donation pool, which will be constantly filled with 0.9% energy donations required from all green energy project developers that want to join and fundraise on the WePower platform. Both features of WPR token is structured to increase demand for the token and invite more energy buyers to participate in the crypto world in order to buy WePower tokens.  Producers sets the prices and then it's up for the buyer to buy it or not. We expect producers to offer best prices at the beginning to get the traction and get closer to the market prices as the auction gets closer to being closed.  Therefore, you'll be offered good pricing when you intend to purchase any of those tokenized energy that you could either use (if WePower is an Energy Provider in your country) or sell them for a profit.  The 0.9% in kWH is a benefit by simply holding on to WPR tokens   Staking will be available when the platform go live.",False

It’s great to be invited and be on a panel of such an amazing event that unites all the biggest players on the field — generators, transmission and distribution system operators, and regulators.  The main summit takeaway is that the business is changing due to the changing world, forcing traditional utilities to adapt as fast as they can. Energy change is further influenced by the new renewable generation coming online, that is popping up on the grid. The challenges to connect more renewables are complex and do not have straight forward solutions. Digitalisation is a great topic to discuss and new processes are being implemented by well established companies. However, this mainly addresses effectiveness of internal processes, such as: better accounting or more effective resource management, which is great incremental effect for regulated company bottom line, but has very limited effect on solving challenges that unite us. We need to do much more than that! We need more open data available to even understand what are the challenges, and creatively think how they can be addressed. And it goes to all possible challenges such as more EV’s in the grid, more renewables, prosumer growth and even security.  But we have to remember to push forward the agenda of bringing more renewables to the grid at the same time. Decarbonisation being a major topic of the last couple of years requires much more work, and the financing of renewables has slowed down. It’s not even bringing us closer to the Paris’ agreed targets. Political process is slow and We, as a community and users of energy, need to do more to make the change ourselves with the right tools.  I am proud that we are working on the solution that plays well with the current market setup and has received a lot of positive feedback working both in the broader digitalisation sense and renewable financing. Happy to have been a part of Eurelectric agenda setting event!",False

I was struggling a bit to explain WePower to my parents - such things as crypto, blockchain is out of their world, but they do care about energy price and in the most cases they choose environment friendly solutions.

WPR is a utility token and it's utility will be recognised as soon as energy auctions begin later this year. For more info on this, please refer to the roadmap on wepower.nework.  WPR token will allow its holders:  1) Priority pass to participate in an auction for energy tokens of a newly connected energy plant. It provides an opportunity to buy green energy at the most favorable conditions. This will become an asset itself because large energy buyers will want to re-purchase these tokens for their own use. The supply of WPR tokens is limited.  2) Access to the green energy donation pool, which will be constantly filled with 0.9% energy donations required from all green energy project developers that want to join and fundraise on the WePower platform. Both features of WPR token is structured to increase demand for the token and invite more energy buyers to participate in the crypto world in order to buy WePower tokens.",False

It provides an opportunity to buy green energy at the most favorable conditions. This will become an asset itself because large energy buyers will want to re-purchase these tokens for their own use. The supply of WPR tokens is limited.  2) Access to the green energy donation pool, which will be constantly filled with 0.9% energy donations required from all green energy project developers that want to join and fundraise on the WePower platform. Both features of WPR token is structured to increase demand for the token and invite more energy buyers to participate in the crypto world in order to buy WePower tokens.  Producers sets the prices and then it's up for the buyer to buy it or not. We expect producers to offer best prices at the beginning to get the traction and get closer to the market prices as the auction gets closer to being closed.  Therefore, you'll be offered good pricing when you intend to purchase any of those tokenized energy that you could either use (if WePower is an Energy Provider in your country) or sell them for a profit.  The 0.9% in kWH is a benefit by simply holding on to WPR tokens.",False

I mean this thing had huge upside as a money grab for any programmer that could automate this process as they'd be getting a guaranteed 200 WPR per account.  I'm not saying that the team was in on this though, because the team doesn't have any control over what the community does if a person chooses to do something like this.  Its unfortunate because the bounty program arguably backfired, because Zilliqa had what I would say was the worst binance bounty program of the 3 coins so there wasn't a huge incentive for people to do bots with that coin versus the bounties for WPR and ELA.

Their token, the WPR, is trading at $0.15 with a market cap $53 million. WPR is a green energy trading platform on the Ethereum Network. This means the tokens are ERC-20 which is convenient for transferring between wallets. The WPR platform helps green energy project developers to raise funds by allowing them to sell their energy directly to consumers by bypassing centralized energy companies.  By bypassing centralized energy companies, the consumer can pay a drastically reduced rate. This is beneficial for both producers of green energy and the consumers. The producer of the energy succeeds by not having to seek funding from venture capitalists or institutions at outlandish debt rates.  The consumer wins by having electricity in their home at a fraction of their previous cost. All these energy cryptocurrencies have many similarities but determining which one will have mass adoption is very important. WPR intends to allow consumers to buy energy directly from renewable producers on a one kWh basis through smart contracts. This will enable global investment opportunities when green energy projects are presented while also increasing the existing market for consuming green energy.  22,933 people contributed to help us deliver our #mission of accelerating #RenewableEnergy #development and shifting the world towards a more #sustainable living. It is our time to now work even harder and deliver. #WePower #Blockchain #Tech #Energyhttps://t.co/iX2vC3rZu7 — WePower (@WePowerN) February 2, 2018  WePower’s Structure  WePower intends to act as an energy intermediary or an energy supplier of sorts. The firm’s platform connects to the energy grid and a local energy exchange market. The energy user also connects to this market, and all links in the chain are completed. When a renewable energy producer joins, future energy is tokenized based on kWh units. Each internal energy token represents one kWh to be produced at a certain time in the future. This concept is fantastic as the consumer would not need additional equipment to pay energy bills besides being able to connect to the WePower market.  WPR tokens specifically allow for priority access to their holders for auctions of tokenized energy of future green energy plants. This allows token holders to purchase energy at the lowest initial price set by the producer. WPR is not used to pay for energy tokens. WPR tokens are also rewarded in the form of dividends donated from producers at a 0.9 percent rate of total sales. This results in the WPR tokens accruing green energy over time and allowing them to sell or use the green energy once it’s produced and provided in a dividend. The idea seems solid, but who is the team behind the project?  An Impressive List of Team Members and Advisors  Although MWAT has more market traction, partnerships, and customers, the WePower team is definitely competing to be number one on this list. Arturas Askavicius, the COO, has a legal background in crowdfunding and specializes in Fintech. Nikolaj Martyniuk, the CEO, has over ten years of experience in energy development and projects. David Allen Cohen, an award-winning energy advisor. Eyal Hertzog, an advisor, but also the co-founder of Bancor. Jon Matonis, an advisor and chairman of Globitex. Liraz Siri, founder of SIRI for Apple (I’m just kidding, just checking to see if you were paying attention). Liraz is a security expert and co-founder of Turnkey Linux. This list of advisors and team members would be pleasing to see on any ICO page, especially one linked to energy production.  More Government Support from Australia and Lithuania  It seems POWR is not the only ICO in the energy world directly or indirectly supported by the Australian government. WPR joined Australia’s Startupbootcamp Energy Australia Accelerator (SBC). By investing in WPR, SBC was the first accelerator program to invest in a company doing an ICO.  #Startupbootcamp #Accelerator (SBC) chose us as one of 10 #energy companies for a prestigious #Australian energy track program! It is both a huge honour & achievement!  WPR also has partnerships with Australian energy giant, Energy Australia.  The WPR project is sponsored by The Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Lithuania because of its likely positive impact on climate change. WPR is an innovative token that when clarified to the European regulator highlighted how it is structured as a reward based crowdfunding, where contributors are rewarded free energy to be used or sold in the future. There are currently three partnerships to connect 1,000 MW capacity projects to the WPR network from Conquista Solar, Civitas, and Novocorex.  WPR Conclusion: Good but Not Great  WPR has a lot of potential, but their hiccup with European regulators and the token being a crowdfunding device seems to be a manipulative way around whatever it is they’re trying to accomplish. A major positive for WPR is their team as it is truly outstanding. WPR’s government connections in Australia and Lithuania make it a very strong play as it is a rare find to see two governments actively interested in a single cryptocurrency. Due to significant partnerships, an exceptional team and government support WPR should have an above average 2018. The author believes MWAT will outperform WPR and the other coins on this list, but if a second-place award were to be given, WPR would get the silver.",False

We feel honored and humbled to be recognized alongside companies like Apple, GE Power, Spacex and Patagonia to mention a few.  WePower was recognized as one of the TOP 10 most innovative energy companies for democratising solar and wind energy investing via tokenized green energy trade. Other category winners include Green Mountain Power, BYD, Sonnen, Drift Marketplace, Entrade, GE Power, Ciel & Terre, Zen Ecosystems and Dandelion.  This is a very exciting development because it shows that WePower’s technology and vision is at the cutting edge of energy innovation at the Global level. It sends a powerful message to the global tech community and leaders showcasing that WePower and blockchain technology can solve some of the most pressing challenges in the energy sector and sustainable living development.  Each year Fast Company conducts extensive research to honour the best in business and innovation  More than three dozen Fast Company editors, reporters, and contributors survey thousands of companies to create the The Most Innovative Companies list. The list was curated from Fast Company’s Top 10 lists, which recognize pioneering companies across 36 categories.  Fast Company has been conducting the list for more than 10 years now, each year marking the major shifts and developments of such business giants as Google, Amazon, Apple also noticing the evolution of more recent players like Spotify and Uber and recognizing new projects with undeniable potential.  Fast Company each year searches for companies with the most innovative and transformative ideas in the field, impact being among their key criteria. Special attention is being payed to the renewable energy solutions as this is undeniably the energy of the future. Many companies currently shaping the global energy markets has been recognized by Fast Company in their early days including such names as SolarCity, Tesla and Nest.  This year WePower is sharing the energy most innovative list with: Green Mountain Power, BYD, Sonnen, Drift Marketplace, Entrade, GE Power, Ciel & Terre, Zen Ecosystems and Dandelion.  “This year’s MIC list is an inspiring and insightful window into how many companies have embraced innovation and are working to make meaningful change,” said Fast Company deputy editor David Lidsky.  Most Innovative Companies is one of the most anticipated Fast Company’s editorial efforts of the year. It provides both a snapshot and a road map for the future of innovation across the most dynamic sectors of the economy.  Leading innovation comes from our bold vision to reshape how energy is produced and managed in the era of smart grids and distributed computing technologies  Most of you are probably familiar with WePower’s near term goals around the democratization of green energy development financing and trade. However, our ultimate goal is to expand on these two services into building a full service virtual utility platform. A utility like any other: generating power, managing infrastructure and delivering energy service. The difference here is whereas classic utility connects it’s systems via physical links — a virtual utility will connect its system via information links first and use existing regulated infrastructure for the physical links.  Energy sector and especially energy infrastructure up until very recently have been relatively untouched by the digital disruption that so many other industries have gone through over the last decade. There is a vast opportunity that the blockchain based financing mechanisms combined with the digital energy systems, such as smart grids, can open. This opportunity carries a real chance of demonstrating a complex package of smart grid technology, which will drive a meaningful impact on the global energy challenge that we face. We are really at the pivotal point where finance, technology and business can come together to make the shift towards sustainable living that the world desperately needs.  This recognition is an honor and responsibility.  We are proud that from all blockchain based energy projects The Fast Company selected WePower as one of the most innovative companies in the field. Needles to say — we consider this as an honour and responsibility.  Since the day WePower was born we worked tirelessly to get the project up and running. It is off with a great traction. There is still a long way ahead but with the support we keep on receiving we are confident that WePower in a few years time will be at the core of sustainable living and green energy adoption on a daily basis.",False

A strong and focused action is needed more than ever. However, very few understand that in order to get the climate change challenge solved we need to take planed and structured steps with the technical realities of the existing energy infrastructure taken into consideration.  This is the approach we have started WePower with. Thus far, it has been an instrumental pillar helping us to establish shared work directions with our infrastructure partners Elering, 220 Energia and Eleon as well as gauge the interest from other energy companies across the Europe. Actually, just a couple weeks ago Kaspar, our CTO, has shared our learnings with a team from Statnett, a Norwegian Transmission Systems Operator.  Given this context, I want to use the opportunity here to introduce you to the broader context of the European energy market.

There are currently many ways to finance renewable power systems including traditional private equity financing, tax equity, renewable energy bonds, leases, power purchase agreements and more recently crowdsourcing, property assessed clean energy, virtual net metering and other creative methods for financing renewable energy projects. Traditional project finance is subject to geographic, government, and regulatory uncertainty based on different rules and regulations depending on where renewable energy systems are being developed. As well, a major bottleneck limitation with traditional renewable energy financing is that most projects require power offtake agreements such as Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to be in place before financing is approved creating many risks for developers. This creates a situation where many projects are not approved due to the financing methodologies requiring that the entire projects output be accounted for over the life of the project typically 15 to 20 years. What this typically means is that the entire energy output of the renewable power system must be bought with a guarantee for the life of the project limiting projects to those who can commit to 15- 20 years of green energy purchases.  WePower is a blockchain-based green energy trading platform. WePower enables renewable energy producers to raise capital by issuing their own energy tokens. These tokens represent energy they commit to produce and deliver. Energy tokenization standardizes, simplifies and opens up a globally energy investment ecosystem. As a result, energy producers can trade directly with the green energy buyers (consumers and investors) and raise capital by selling energy upfront, at below market rates. Energy tokenization ensures liquidity and extends much needed access to capital..........",False

Your energy tokens will always represent green energy certificates, that shows how much, what type (solar, wind, hydro) and where (country) you bought your green energy.

Nicola Martiniyuk is the co — founder and CEO of WePower. For the last ten years he has been working in the energy industry, building energy and solar plants and selling green energy to the final consumers. Knowing the energy business from inside out he predicts that the green energy revolution is needed more than ever. The world still runs on dirty energy. Changing this from top down is difficult and can take decades to bear fruits. The current investments structure has too many bottlenecks that has slowed down investments into renewable energy significantly.    WePower will change renewable energy market from bottom up by connecting green energy producers directly with households and investors. Their platform enables renewable energy producers to raise capital by issuing their energy own tokens. These tokens represent energy that is committed to be produced in the future. As a result energy producers can trade directly with green energy buyers and raise capital by selling energy upfront. WePower is directly integrated with the energy grid and wholesale energy markets. It enables transparent energy accounting and a new generation of digital utility services. They are currently piloting a nationwide energy data tokenization in Estonia. WePower token sale contributors will receive a native digital WPR token which will give priority pass to green energy auctions and will constantly accrue energy donated by producers connected to the WePower platform. WPR token holders can use this energy for their own usage or sell it on the WePower platform at any time. WePower has already secured necessary partnerships from the current industry players to start energy trading immediately. WePower has a pipeline of renewable energy projects waiting for energy investments. This enables them to them to be operational within 9 months in Spain and further expand to Germany, Italy, Greece and Portugal. Crowdsale funding will be used for global expansion.   Introduction  WePower will enable renewable energy producers to raise their capital by producing their own tokens. Each token will represent the amount of energy the producer promises to deliver. It is in fact similar to KWH Coin platform because 1 kWh of energy is equal to 1 token in the WePower platform too. The tokenization of energy will increase the reach of investment since this is happening on a global scale. Tokenized energy is the bridge between the energy producer and the energy buyer. The holders of WPR tokens will have instant access to the specific auctions of the token issuing companies once the power plant is connected to the network.    WePower has entered the market at the most suitable time ever with the increased demand for green energy and with the rising effects of global warming along with the high competition of the energy market. The high competition ensures that a huge amount of green energy producers will be taking part in WePower trading platform. Unlike any other energy companies, WePower did not just issue a token… It invented its own platform which is already developed. You can give a try on their demo version in their official website. A fully open, decentralized platform and tokenized energy means that will open the energy market to a huge quantity of investors. With WePower it will revolutionize how green energy producers will find capital for their projects. With the old model producers have to wait a long period of time until they find investors or money lenders but with the revolutionary new WePower energy trading platform producers just have to issue token auction of their own and a multitude of investors will be waiting in the queue to purchase your token. So it means your waiting period until the project becomes a success is greatly reduced. How the Green Energy Donation pool works? First off the owner or the project developer of the renewable energy project will announce plans to plant a token sale in the WePower trading platform and then will issue the energy tokens. Exactly 0.9% of these energy tokens are instantly put in to the investor’s pools. Only those with WPR tokens have access to these pools. Once the plant is completed construction and it starts producing energy all the holders of the WPR token can use this energy for their own purpose or cash out or reconsider investing into the pool.    WPR Tokens  The official ICO (Initial Coin Offering) is commencing on 1st of February, 2018. Exactly 155696 folks are counting fingers and waiting for the WePower token sale. The current token exchange rate is that 1 ETH is equal to 400 WPR. The company do have a minimum contribution of 200 USD. You can transfer ETH to their address. WePower token is a revolutionary token in many ways. It is shaped to grow together with the WePower business. Why? It stores tangible value and ensures liquidity. Every renewable energy producer using WePower. Every renewable energy producer using WePower donates part of the produced energy to the WPR token holders. All WPR tokens constantly accrue this energy. Tokens accumulate real value in the energy form. With the secured partnerships, WePower will start its activities and our tokens will collect energy immediately. You can use this energy for your personal needs or sell it to someone else. This way even contributors from places where WePower doesn’t operate can participate in the platform. Together with constant collection of donated energy, WPR tokens also provide priority right to invest in new renewable energy projects and in exchange receive energy at most favorable price. This will further increase the demand of the tokens from the large energy buyers. WePower token is the new player in the global energy market which is valued 242 billion USD right now.

Recently the TreeHugger, the leading media outlet dedicated to driving sustainability mainstream featured WePower. https://www.treehugger.com/green-investments/forget-bitcoins-invest-green-renewable-energy-wepower-tokens.html   In publication dedicated to introduce WePower's solution for sustainable future, journalist Lloyd Alter suggested a few questions we would like to answer:  1.Question: What happens if the producer selling the token doesn't deliver the power. Is the token then worthless? Answer: If a person holds the Contract for energy delivery, Energy will always be delivered to him, WePower will take care of that according to the legal framework guarding energy delivery.   2.Question: Who is paying the cost of running and verifying the blockchain, which still uses a lot of energy on the Etherium platform? Answer: Contracting parties are paying for the verifications today, but WePower is looking to be launched with Proof of stake Blockchain in mind where customers would not be paying for their transactions.  3.Question: Is the value of the energy needed to run the blockchain is greater than the commissions one would pay if this was just an investment fund? Answer: There a number of important added values in running WePower on blockchain. First of all, it all allows to standardise Power Purchase Agreements in a form of Smart Contracts and in this way open an opportunity for green energy project developers to raise capital globally with much less complexity than they currently have to go through. Another important value of blockchain is that as an open ledger it provides a transparent green energy production accounting, which adds an additional incentive to Green Energy buyers because they can trust that the energy they actually comes from renewable resources. The value of blockchain and platform-driven approach to green energy funding stems beyond the savings on commissions. It's really a new approach to green energy financing.  4.Question: Is the CO2 produced by the blockchain is greater than the CO2 saved by the renewable investment? Perhaps it runs on green power. Answer: This is a great observation. Blockchain by itself does not produce CO2. It requires substantial energy resources to run and just like all of our energy production in majority of cases still comes from the ""dirty"" energy sources, such as coal. Green energy production costs are dropping every year. The Sun delivers more energy to Earth in an hour than we use in a year. Blockchain technology is still in it's early stages and there are a number of ideas on how to make it more cost effective. Clearly, driving green energy adoption and running increasingly more of the computing resources required for blockchain on green energy could be a strong step forwards.

We want to enable investment and trade in renewable energy, and when volumes of energy are there than support P2P trades so no dirt energy is needed to be involved. Going directly to P2P will not work to the full potential if renewable energy volumes are low. In addition, WePower has easier access to larger energy markets than is the case for Australia’s Power Ledger, a key point relative to future growth potential.  The White Paper of PowerLedger, point 1.4 clearly states that it is: a trading platform that allows monetizing excess supply by selling it. From a European perspective, most countries allow selling energy surplus to the grid already. Our intention is to solve other problems that exist.

And thank you for sharing! I would like to address the aspects mentioned in ""Disadvantages"" section, as they sound more like questions, so let us answer them:  1.Will we be able to attract energy buyers and investors?  Green energy producers see our platform as a solution to one of the main problems in renewables market - complex and lengthy financing. This makes them highly motivated to work with us and we are already seeing interest from the large energy investors. WePower will also open an opportunity for energy developers to presell their future green energy production at below the market cost, which creates a very strong incentive for both large energy buyers and households. We have no doubts about being the most attractive utility on the block.  2. Why our fundraising hardcap is set to $ 35M?  Energy infrastructure businesses have got high upfront development costs because of the large skilled system engineering team needed for the job as well as system integration costs. This is where the majority of the funds will go. The rest will be spent on the partnership and business development, which are both crucial for high pace international expansion. Our hardcap is calculated to cover all roadmap stages within 3-4 years after which is planned to reach the needed volumes to become a self-sustaining business.

If you compare WePower and PowerLedger whitepapers, you will see a clear distinction between two companies. WePower focuses mostly on financing of renewable energy producers globally. The business model, depth of market, commercial and technical analysis provided in WePower whitepaper (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_OW_EddXO5RWWFVQjJGZXpQT3c/view), MVP and specific partnerships cannot be compared with any ICO in the energy market or copied from any other venture. The model is unique because the financing is based on sale-purchase of tokenized energy that will be produced in the future. This allows to increase ROE for the renewable energy producers, offer good return rates for the investors and make it a global platform, without falling under financial regulation. Since this is 100% transparent platform, the blockchain platform is connected to the energy infrastructure, which will allow WePower to become the next generation utility company once the renewable energy volumes will increase (in order to offer electricity 24/7). PowerLedger focuses on sale of surplus solar energy. PowerLedger just recently provided more detailed description about their asset germination events. PowerLedger claims on their webpage that it will allow to trade ownerships of the assets (solar, wind or battery farm) and receive allocated revenues based on the proportion of ownership. In simple words, solar, wind or battery farms will issue securities (due to profit distribution and tradability features), which will be tradable on the PowerLedger platform. Each security issuance will trigger financial/securities law regulations and become a costly and a local fund raising mechanism for the farms. Moreover, PowerLedger will become a trading facility, which is also regulated by financial laws. We believe that this model does not bring innovation to the energy market and does not require blockchain or token issuance. Many operating crowdfunding platforms can offer that already. However, we wish all projects in the energy market best luck since everyone is trying to be part of a decarbonized future.",False

If you compare WePower and PowerLedger whitepapers, you will see a clear distinction between two companies. WePower focuses mostly on financing of renewable energy producers globally. The business model, depth of market, commercial and technical analysis provided in WePower whitepaper (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_OW_EddXO5RWWFVQjJGZXpQT3c/view), MVP and specific partnerships cannot be compared with any ICO in the energy market or copied from any other venture. The model is unique because the financing is based on sale-purchase of tokenized energy that will be produced in the future. This allows to increase ROE for the renewable energy producers, offer good return rates for the investors and make it a global platform, without falling under financial regulation. Since this is 100% transparent platform, the blockchain platform is connected to the energy infrastructure, which will allow WePower to become the next generation utility company once the renewable energy volumes will increase (in order to offer electricity 24/7). PowerLedger focuses on sale of surplus solar energy. After WePower has announced its ICO campaign, PowerLedger provided more detailed description about their asset germination events. PowerLedger claims on their webpage that it will allow to trade ownerships of the assets (solar, wind or battery farm) and receive allocated revenues based on the proportion of ownership. In simple words, solar, wind or battery farms will issue securities (due to profit distribution and tradability features), which will be tradable on the PowerLedger platform. Each security issuance will trigger financial/securities law regulations and become a costly and a local fund raising mechanism for the farms. Moreover, PowerLedger will become a trading facility, which is also regulated by financial laws. We believe that this model does not bring innovation to the energy market and does not require blockchain or token issuance. Many operating crowdfunding platforms can offer that already. However, we wish all projects in the energy market best luck since everyone is trying to be part of a decarbonized future.  By the way we reached page 10! Wohooo!",False

This platform will connect renewable energy producers and investors/end users of electricity. With ICO token you will get part of green energy produced by the renewable energy producers (this will be a mandatory requirement for the producer in order to use WePower). With WPR token you can use this donated energy or sell it on WePower platform. You will be constantly getting this energy as we are planning a fast expansion and already have a client, which solar energy plants in Spain would cover our 2 year’s pipeline. In order to deliver this energy to you, we have to become independent energy supplier in your country. It might take us some time, since we first start in Spain. Until we reach your country, you would be automatically selling the donated energy to the market and getting proceeds from the sale of green energy. More information including calculations how much energy you get are here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_OW_EddXO5RZjhuTlgwNkQtSEU/view  WePower platform is ready and you can try the demo version on our webpage (http://platform.wepower.network/landing). Here is how it works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6coWsXjAuY&feature=youtu.be Within 9 months after ICO, WePower will be opera¬tional and start its activities in Spain. The launch in Spain is due to already concluded partnership with first WePower client, who is building in Spain 1000 MW solar energy capacity plants. With the first client, WePower has pipeline of renewable energy projects for the first 2 years.  For more detailed responses, feel free to join our Telegram chat: https://t.me/WePowerNetwork",False

Creating this list allows us to do several things.  First, in presenting a more refined selection process allows us to contribute to the developing field of industry best practices by specifically elevating those projects we feel are more serious, professional, and credible. Second, this list offers a way for observers to focus their efforts on the projects our team considers the more professional, serious, innovative, and promising. This is important because as the list of ICOs grows monthly, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the average observer to evaluate the entire sector or even the industry insider to sift signal from noise.

Fossil fuels lobbies are too powerful and will allow this shift at the time they are going to be ready to take over lead in green energy not sooner.

If you compare WePower and PowerLedger whitepapers, you will see a clear distinction between two companies. WePower focuses mostly on financing of renewable energy producers globally. The business model, depth of market, commercial and technical analysis provided in WePower whitepaper (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_OW_EddXO5RWWFVQjJGZXpQT3c/view), MVP and specific partnerships cannot be compared with any ICO in the energy market or copied from any other venture. The model is unique because the financing is based on sale-purchase of tokenized energy that will be produced in the future. This allows to increase ROE for the renewable energy producers, offer good return rates for the investors and make it a global platform, without falling under financial regulation. Since this is 100% transparent platform, the blockchain platform is connected to the energy infrastructure, which will allow WePower to become the next generation utility company.     After WePower has announced its ICO campaign, PowerLedger provided more detailed description about their asset germination events. PowerLedger claims that it will allow to trade ownerships of the assets (solar, wind or battery farm) and receive allocated revenues based on the proportion of ownership. In simple words, solar, wind or battery farms will issue securities, which will be tradable on the PowerLedger platform. Each security issuance will trigger financial/securities law regulations and become a costly and local fund raising mechanism for the farms. For this feature you do not need a blockchain technology and many operating crowdfunding platforms can offer that already.  Cheers, WePower",False

I presumed it is going to be higher voltage levels because suply of households would be very complicated task for start. I dont know if it is even possible in near future (5-10 years) to accomplish that. At least not on global scale. On some local scale maybee between local producers and consumers (on low voltage levels) but even that would be a massive range of work.

Both projects are trying to change the energy market. However, both project have different path and strategy. WePower is green energy trading platform, where everyone can finance set up cost of renewable energy plants. While PowerLedger is a platform where people can buy and sell surplus solar energy.  When comparing WePower with Power Ledger or Grid+, or any other non-blockchain based technology aiming for similar business models, it is important to keep in mind two aspects - systems complexity and non-standardized business rules. Few points to be stressed: 1.      Complexity. Although all of these startups will most likely solve the Ethereum smart contract part of the technology in a similar fashion, most likely all the other required components will be done in very different ways. We believe that extensive inside knowledge of energy grids will give us an advantage in solving these problems and thereby make our tokens more valuable in the long run. The use-cases being proposed by all of these startups require integrations and interdependencies with other systems. Also verification and validation requirements are much higher as energy is a critical infrastructure. 2.      Non-standardized business rules. Although energy follows the same physics everywhere - it varies in engineering and often varies wildly in rules and regulations - which mean that business logic on different continents will differ. This means that scaling in the energy sector is slower - barriers to entry are higher. We believe that our inside knowledge of the European energy market will give us an  advantage on scaling faster than the competition. 3.      The energy sector is huge beyond belief. The mission of accelerating decarbonization of the energy system through expansion of green energy finance options - we need more startups and more people on this problem, not fewer. This is too much for one group. We view ourselves in cooperative competition, rather than outright rivals. After all - we all share the same mission.  Cheers, WePower",False

We have Kaspar Kaarlep (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaspar-kaarlep-76268b28/) and Heikki Kolk (https://www.linkedin.com/in/heikki-kolk-580291136/), who will be leading 14 people team. This team comes from Catapult Labs and some freelancers and outsourced persons. However, we will try to hire young talents that are keen to change energy sector. This challenging but feasible project should help us to hire talented people.  We are going to start in Spain, where we have first client with 1000 MG solar energy capacity plants under development. Soon we should sign two more clients in Spain, that both would add additional 1000 MW of solar energy. We plant to expand to Portugal, Greece, Italy, Germany and other markets where energy can be produced under market price.  European Governments started cutting subsidies for the renewable energy producers, which made renewable energy producers difficult to raise funds for renewable energy plants' construction. This situation lead to creation of WePower. More about that you can read in our WePower: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_OW_EddXO5RWWFVQjJGZXpQT3c/view  Cheers, WePower",False

There are few projects in the energy industry launching ICOs (same we can see in the banking industry). All projects have same goal - make a better world. However, every project has different path and strategy. WePower is a green energy trading platform, where everyone can finance set up cost of renewable energy plants. While other projects are building technologies which enables people to sell surplus solar energy to other. Few other projects are aiming to improve energy infrastructure with blockchain technologies.  When comparing WePower with Power Ledger or Grid+, or any other non-blockchain based technology aiming for similar business models, it is important to keep in mind two aspects - systems complexity and non-standardized business rules. Few points to be stressed: 1.      Complexity. Although all of these startups will most likely solve the Ethereum smart contract part of the technology in a similar fashion, most likely all the other required components will be done in very different ways. We believe that extensive inside knowledge of energy grids will give us an advantage in solving these problems and thereby make our tokens more valuable in the long run. The use-cases being proposed by all of these startups require integrations and interdependencies with other systems. Also verification and validation requirements are much higher as energy is a critical infrastructure. 2.      Non-standardized business rules. Although energy follows the same physics everywhere - it varies in engineering and often varies wildly in rules and regulations - which mean that business logic on different continents will differ. This means that scaling in the energy sector is slower - barriers to entry are higher. We believe that our inside knowledge of the European energy market will give us an  advantage on scaling faster than the competition. 3.      The energy sector is huge beyond belief. The mission of accelerating decarbonization of the energy system through expansion of green energy finance options - we need more startups and more people on this problem, not fewer. This is too much for one group. We view ourselves in cooperative competition, rather than outright rivals. After all - we all share the same mission.  You can check our webpage, videos and whitepaper to see how this project is different from others (http://wepower.network).  Cheers, WePower",False
