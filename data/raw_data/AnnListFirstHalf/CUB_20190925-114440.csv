Recently there have been few reports on the loss of Cube tokens.  In-depth analysis revealed the followings:  1) Personal information, including password and email address, were leaked from a specific portal website. And it is believed that the Cube coin was extorted using this hacked information. 2) Highlighted that the personal computer may have been exposed to both hacking and malicious backdoor programs. As noted above, there were no internal security threats detected by Cube Intelligence.  We regret to inform you that Cube Intelligence is not able to retrieve the token(s) back if the cube lost was from the following external circumstances:  1) ID and password from a separate portal website has been compromised (or email account on a website was compromised) 2) Personal PC has been compromised 3) Personal PC has been exposed to backdoor programs or viruses 4) Accessed a phishing site for Myetherwallet 5) Mismanagement of ID and password 6) Use of public computers 7) Network connected to PC has been compromised Signed up for anunauthorised site using an email address and password (Numerous phishing techniques, that steal personal email and password by luring users with free Token when signing up, have been reported)   Please ensure that you use a different password for Cube homepage account from your personal email account(s). As always, we encourage you to transfer the Cube as soon as possible from the Dashboard to personal wallet using strict security measures.  Also, be aware of the phishing sites when you transfer to a personal wallet, and please double-check before you proceed.  Refrain from working on public computers and keep Anti-virus software up-to-date on your personal devices.  Do not use P2P program, such as Torrent, on a computer that manages cryptocurrency.  For safety precaution, from April 3rd 12:00 PM UTC onwards, Cube will block and restrict the transfer from the dashboard to the personal wallet. Make sure to transfer the Cube from dashboard to the personal wallet or to the Exchange wallet beforehand.  Starting from April 3rd, individual who wishes to transfer Cube will undergo additional procedures and require verification. Cube will be issued after a grace period (approx. 1 month), from the date of transfer requested.  Again, I would like to kindly ask you to secure your personal account.  Thank you.  Best regards,  Cube Intelligence.",False

R & D Advisory Study Group and Korea ITS Society Presentation  For the core development of CUBE, specialist professors in the field of security and blockchain join the CUBE Research Advisory to help the core development. The results of the professors' research will be announced at the Korean ITS Conference on April 20, 2018, at the International Convention Center Jeju.   2. Signed a contract with GingerMay in the UK for Public Relations  To promote the development of CUBE, we signed a contract with GingerMay, which operates globally in England.   3. Contract with PwC UK (PricewaterhouseCoopers)  We have concluded contracts with PwC, which is number one in global scale and reliability, to provide accounting, consulting and bookkeeping for CUBE. PwC made a detailed pre-review of CUBE's business model and management before the contract and concluded the contract after examination. CUBE's accounting will be transparent and fair.   4. Market forecast  Cars are the same now as computers were in the past without an internet connection. But recently, cars have become connected and are exposed to the same risks as computers connected to the internet. However, currently, connected cars are still a good opportunity for CUBE because they have less network security.   5. The Progress of OTA development  OTA terminal development is proceeding smoothly. The terminal mold development, PCB development, server development, token flow development, etc., is being performed at the same time. This CUBE BOX is used as follows:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP9nwv7C4B4&feature=youtu.be   6. Development of Security Platform  We are developing security software for the CUBE BOX, which is the OTA terminal. One area turns a clean pipe into a blockchain that prevents hackers from connecting from the server to our CUBE OTA. This is  Car contact point's security technology incorporated into our CUBE BOX, and CUBE's contact point will contain CUBE's powerful security technology. It detects both known attacks and unknown attacks. Regarding known attack, the total number of known malicious files are large. CUBE changed it into a hash, so CUBE is light and very fast in detection. The total storage capacity is less than 10M, RAM is less than 25M, and it is very light, cheap and powerful. Regarding unknown attack, CUBE has the technology to detect unusual move, and send it to cloud sandbox, and check it. CUBE cloud has 50,000 partners attack information. If it is a malicious attack, CUBE sandbox shares this information to all CUBE BOX through the network.   7. April plan  CUBE plans to announce new progress on its homepage. We will send e-mail notices of essential contents.",False

""Robert Cooke"" and Philip Lee joined afterwards again as a person with significant control of the company. Both got 100 shares.  Robert Lee Cooke has another adress, which is some company building in London, where you can rent space.. I'm confused by all the adresses..

Much has happened.  Good to see you edited your team again. Come on! The german part is gone and there are some new people now. Still, Philip Lee is not to be found. He was CEO on your website. You are moving and editing different roles on the team constantly.  Needless to say that teams change from time to time - but you are still an ICO! This is like Microsoft run an IPO and 2 hours prior to launch they decide to remove Bill Gates. People are resources, this is crucial for beeing successful! What you do is you confuse all of us and you also make yourself trustless!  Some days ago I tried to get in contact with Prof. Dr. Thomas Hofmann and Jan-Philipp Jost on XING. I sent a message to them on 13th of January. They both looked into it but did not reply. I'd say this is usual for people who get offended by nerds asking questions about a ""Cube Intelligence""thing, because they actually don't know what the heck I'm talking about. They don't waste their time on writing back.  This is how I read it and I presume that they were never a part of your team but you used their names for PR. Again, you confuse everyone! On the other hand you showed evidence for beeing part of the blockchain summit.  Thanks for that.  Still, I don't feel like telling anyone to invest 1$ into your project.  I expect to have lost 2 Ether in your ICO and I am perfectly fine with it. This happened because I am stupid, but I don't want others to do the same.  Your answer was not a clarification.

I just created my account to be a part of this conversation about CUBE. I am a tokenholder of this ICO but I am getting more and more concerned that this ICO is not what it looks like.  My first background check of this ICO started when I found it on Coinschedule. I checked everything about the names on their team and also found a company registration file based in the UK. So far I was not concerned that the type of writing about the persons on their team wasn't that clear to be honest. But suddenly one action made me suspicious. On their website they removed their CEO who's name was Philip Lee. This person who is also the creator of the YouTube account vanished. Another thing is the video of the CUBE ODT-device itself. Is someone actually able to read what the app is saying in the video? I spoke to a friend who's a mechanic and he says the parameters and visual effects look cool but they are meaningless. Another thing is that this type of device actually exists and there are some which look nearly identical to the one shown in the video.  Going on to Linkedin, the site where you can find out about the persons on the team. Here I find no information about who's actually on the team. Take ""Dr.-Ing. Thomas Hofmann"" for instance, he does not show up on the Linkedin page of Cube Intelligence but he himself has a LinkedIn account. Same applies to Dr. Andreas Roggon and Jan-Philipp Jost.  I am not sure if I have overlooked it the first time but I am pretty sure that Information was edited or removed over time. The Blockchain Summit in Dubai 5 days ago showed no pictures of Cube but the one where is says ""sponsors"". I've been to their main page and there are lot's of speakers with their speach. If Cube was one of the top picks as they mentioned, where is the video then?  The bounty program makes great publicity for the project, I am only reading positive comments everywhere. Now that I see some of the members here commenting about suspicious behaviour, I am quiet unhappy to have contributed too quickly.  Could CubeIntelligence please clearify in detail about what I just mentioned. If they are legit they can use a minute to do a proper clarification and get out pictures of their physical appearence on the Dubai Blockchain Summit.  Bitcoinviking",False

I also noticed the Phillip Lee thing, but I think he may be the same person as either Jae Sung Lee, or Bong H. Lee (I know in Asian cultures they often adopt a 'western' name), as I find in most instances both of these seem to be listed as the founder/ceo (on Cube website, Bong is listed as COO, Jae Sung as CEO). I'm not too familiar with Korean naming customs etc but I found a similar problem with one of the advisors- Gi-Yeon Hwang as listed on Cube website, but I found him as Ki-Yeon Hwang, possibly another that has been lost in translation? Jan-Phillipp Jost and Andreas Roggon are both listed at the same consultancy company on Linkedin, I assume they are working for Cube as consultants. Dr.Ing Thomas Hofmann seems to have a Xing profile that I can't see as I don't have an account, other than that I can't really find a record of him though.  As far as the Dubai Blockchain Summit, Bong H.Lee is listed as one of the speakers on the Dubai Blockchain Summit website, as CEO & Founder of CubeInt (https://dibs.ae/blockchain-summit-speakers), and Cube have recently uploaded a youtube video of stills of their attendance (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrYLZJHXhoE).  I also have an automotive background, and I do think the video of showing the OBD tech was more of a PR video- it doesn't really show their technology in effect I think, from what I understand it is the auto manufacturer that would have the technology that updates the vehicles (what you see on the app), but they would just connect to the CUBE OBD via blockchain over-the-air, however this is difficult to show in a video, I guess what we can take from it is that the app is connecting to their OBD connection wirelessly- but yes there is a lot of technology that already does this (just not through blockchain).  My main concern was with the whitepaper plagiarism allegations, reading through it however I can see that the 'plagiarised' parts were more to do with 'definitions' rather than content, such as 'centralized' e.t.c., I think due to many of them being Korean and perhaps being a little lazy in translating it across. The meat of the whitepaper seems to be legit, as far as the technology they want to bring to the table.  For me I would like to see a bit more clarification and background of some of the team (particularly the automotive/German side of the team), and more social presence- they don't even have a reddit page up and running yet.",False

The simple fact that they claim Autonomous Vehicles are more easily hackable just shows they've got no clue what they're getting into - Autonomous vehicles are actually much less vulnerable to hacks compared to today's average modern car. Not only that, but fragmenting information that your vehicle downloads won't do shit, because at the end of they day what you're hacking is the vehicle's hardware/software, not the information being downloaded.

I believe that any paper can contain some similar terminology but when I can just copy text from your paper and found another paper with the same sentences - it looks super suspicious.  I continue my research about your original paper and found something great. Most of your whitepapper it is just copy paste from ""BlockChain: A distributed solution to automotive security and privacy"" with authors: Ali Dorri, Marco Steger, Salil S. Kanhere, Raja Jurdak. Noone from the authors list is part of your team. https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00073  You just added more cool buzzwords from another fields which are not covered by mentioned paper to create more hype.  I am going to contact authors of all mentioned papers and we will coordinate our further actions.  At the same time I am not just good in using google search, I am monitoring most of new trends in ML and quantum computing and can say that some of your pictures just do not have any sense. My favorite one is picture with quantum channel.  Projects like yours eventually can just destroy the crypto currency market, will slow down potential progress from blockchain adoption and destroy people trust in ICO.  I will post more detailed review for your project on medium and use my channels to spread this knowledge.  Good luck.",False

At the time, there were only three OSs for Cell-phone worldwide. Samsung and LG made Cell-phone using wipi developed by Cube Team.       The next thing to notice is the X-Road. CUBE has long been involved in integrating IT and automobiles. X-Road is a vehicle navigation company that sold hundreds of thousands of units in 2007 at a price of $ 400. (1)(2)      COO of CUBE Team Bong H. Lee    The next CUBE team's experience is Green-Car. (3)(4) It is also a car-sharing company that combines IT and automobiles. Green-car acquired by Huge company Lotte. (5) (6) It is the TOP2 car sharing company in the Korean market even at the time of sale. We have taken the lead in realizing a shared economy through this Green-car. (7)          Our CUBE team has been working to combine a variety of IT and automotive technologies and have been successful with them. Through our many successful experiences, we can see that the combination of block-chain and security technology of autonomous vehicles will be a tremendous value.

After the user receives CUBE token in his wallet, contributors can trade the token from two of following markets:  EtherDelta Kucoin Huobi Tidex Coinexchange Gate.io Bithumb Coinone Upbeat Coinbee  ===  Our plan is to proceed our marketing two directions.  1) Autonomous Companies 2) New entry automotive area companies, such as Google and Uber  1) Automotive Companies We are working with Daimler, Porsche, Hyundai, Toyoda All of these companies want to adopt Blockchain, but they are not IT companies. Our companies are first priority.  Our company has more than 15 years experience in the automotive market, with an IT background.  2) We are communicating with Uber, which is investing autonomous vehicle.  We are planning to expand marketing when we complete this ICO round and will contact google also.  3) Our Target Our founder, Bong H. Lee has founded two automotive tech companies, and he has successfully sold to potential companies. i.e) Stockholders in GreenCar gained more than 70 times profit ( Stockholders who invested as 5M market cap changed to 350M market cap now).  He has confidence that CUBE will receive the highest value, if automotive companies or google, uber want to buy CUBE.  Any autonomous related company should have CUBE like technology, and CUBE is the only and best in the area of automotive blockchain technology.  ====  I joined your telegram group but there is nobody...

The key to Blockchain is that technology ensures trust. Cube uses block-chain technology to ensure the security of autonomous mobile networks.  These days, the car is a mass of software with over a million lines of code. Cars started to use more networks, and autonomous cars should depend on the network heavily for self-driving. It uses network navigation route, traffic information, vehicle to vehicle information, and remote ECU upgrade.  This means that autonomous vehicles have a greater risk of being hacked. Perhaps no one has ever suffered from a hacking virus once or twice. However, if a self-propelled vehicle is hacked, it can be a huge risk.  Cube creates a security system that protects these autonomous vehicles from hacking. Unlike past methods that did not prevent hacking, we use blockchain technology. Applying blockchain is not a hack at all unless you hack hundreds of thousands of computers at the same time. Cube uses blockchains, artificial intelligence, and Quantum Hash Cryptography technology.   Team  Team members can be divided into three categories. The first is the team for autonomous car communication part. Worldwide, autonomous vehicles were first created in 1995 by the computer engineering department at Carnegie Mellon University. Three members of that department and one MIT artificial intelligence student are key members of CUBE.  The second category is the blockchain development team. Two key developers are from Samsung Electronics. Choi was the project manager of the cloud development team at Samsung Electronics, and Khun Lee was the head of Samsung’s artificial intelligence development team.  The third category is the automotive team. Thomas Hofmann and Siegfried Ottmayer, and Jan-Phillip Jost had been worked at Daimler, and Porsche as developers.  Blockchain Layer  Cube uses block-chain technology to ensure the security of autonomous mobile networks. But there are various difficulties in applying traditional blockchain technology to autonomous vehicle safety. Blockchain instantiations suffer from high overhead and low scalability. CUBE solves these limitations of traditional BC technology with hybrid BC.  In the operation of autonomous vehicles, many IOTs provide information to autonomous vehicles. The attacker seeks to gain access to the network between an autonomous car and IoT or traffic center, and manipulate the software binary with the goal of injecting malware into a large number of vehicles. In such instances, the hash of the infected binary differs from the hash included in the multisig transaction which is signed by the SW provider and the OEM. Thus, the vehicles can readily detect such an attack before installing the infected SW update.  AI Deep Learning Layer  The second is AI Layer. So far, network security is a passive system that collects patches to prevent past hacking cases. Cube trains in supervisor mode in the past as a primary case, and construct a defense system against it by creating malicious attack scenarios that are likely to be made hundreds of millions of times. CUBE’s Intrusion Detection System using Deep Neural Network for Vehicle Network Security has two types, a discriminative deep architecture and a generative deep architecture, depending on how the architectures are exploited. After the pre-training, fine-tuning will be performed using the gradient descent method with the supervised learning. While Blockchain is used as a first and main security method, AI Deep Learning based security will guarantee the double defense system.  Quantum Hashing Cryptography Layer  Blockchain has improved security by using hashes appropriately. However, there is a growing concern that as the performance of computers grows rapidly, hash cryptography can become a limitation. Cube develops quantum cryptography to prevent malicious attacks against autonomous vehicles. This Quantum Cryptography will contribute not only to the autonomous drive but also to the overall upgrade of the entire Blockchain technology.           Transparency Policy  CUBE considers transparent operation important. Thus, Cube has established a policy of transparency as follows:  1)    Cube is to receive a fair audit through a vote by five globally recognised and credible accounting firms.  2)    Cube shall publish monthly operational and financial reports to share the operational status of the company with its contributors.  3)    When hiring new staff members, such as developers, Cube shall implement a validation process as well as thoroughly examining the candidates’ portfolios and setting reward policies in accordance with their abilities.  4)    The company’s budget shall be tightly managed so that it will always be possible to operate and manage the company without additional funding for more than three years.  Token Valuation Policy  To protect its contributors and provide them with better profits, Cube will be operated as follows:  1) The executive managers of Cube are bound by a lock-up system, which means they are not entitled to make token sales for one year. The lock-up policy is intended to make sure the executive managers receive suitable rewards only after the company grows enough.  2) Cube shall strictly control the use of its budget to stably increase the value of Cube tokens. At least two-thirds of the beginning budget must remain after one year of funding. Using more than one-third of the beginning budget for any single event requires the approval of at least half of both the board and the contributors participating in the ballot.  >> CUBE INTELLIGENCE ALSO HAS A BOUNTY PROGRAM.
