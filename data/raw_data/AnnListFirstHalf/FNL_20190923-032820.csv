If you're reading this, you may know that it took Bitcoin more than 9 years to be at their current price of $6500.  Nowadays, it is very common to see new altcoins to make 100% or even 200% gain within 24 hours. Some of them maintain the price and steadily increase in value, while most of these coins quickly go down in value after a while.  If you have been trading cryptocurrencies for quite some time, you've probably experienced the following situation:  You went to an exchange and noticed the top altcoin in the list is trading actively and saw a rapid increase in percentage. You decided to buy thinking the price will continue to increase, only to see the price goes down in half the next few days.  The truth is, trading cryptocurrencies is more than just about price and volume. Each altcoin in the market nowadays are usually tied to a team and a core project that they're working on. This is where Funnel tool come into picture.  SO WHAT CAN FUNNEL TOOL DO FOR YOU?  We believe that staying informed with an important project announcement is the deciding factor that seperate a profitable and losing trading.  Our goal in Funnel Project is to help fellow cryptocurrency traders to stay informed with the latest development & update with any cryptocurrencies that they're interested in from various news sources into one dashboard that they can customize.  YOU EVEN GET PAID TO READ THESE NEWS  We reward Funnel tool user with Funnel tokens for reading the announcement broadcasted by project developers. This is a win-win situation and ensure that good & genuine projects get the attention that they deserve.  We are expecting the Funnel tool to be ready by or before January 2018. Meanwhile, you can get the first 2 Million FNL tokens from EtherDelta & Mercatox for 5 cents each. The fund collected from the initial sale of these tokens will be spent on the development of Funnel tool MVP & marketing campaign for the project.  We thank you for your support and welcome any suggestion of features that you would like to see on the Funnel tool.

Since the problem we have been facing due to the non distribution of the token, we found out there are users who created multiple account just to take advantage on the token distribution, and went to exchange to sell off cheap, making the funnel token crash.  We have been working hard to bring back funnel token to a better standard, we now hire a bounty manager who will be in charge of part of the token distribution and it will reduce the cheating of the system, we are sorry for this but we are working really hard to bring funnel token to its standard, please work with the bounty manager who will be in charge and you will be receiving tokens from him!   Another great news the team came up with, you all know funnel token is 100 million market cap, we decided to reduce funnel token in distribution to 50 million market cap.  50 million will be burnt, details of the address holding the 50 million which are been burnt are provided here https://etherscan.io/address/0xdf114ab86779cb1cfbdf6d5a50f5accbc5b07251 This should be a great news and the team are working on implementing what Funnel token is all about!   So here is the new breakdown  Token Distribution: 50,000,000 FNL tokens Token Allocated For Airdrop – 7,500,000 FNL  Token Allocated For Seed Funding – 5,500,000 FNL These token will be sold on exchanges for facilities & team member expansion  Token Allocated for Monthly sale – 6,750,000 FNL 675,000 FNL token will be sold on monthly basis according to existing exchange rate. The fund collected will be used for marketing & expansion purpose.  Token Allocated to Founder & team – 17,000,000 FNL These token will be distributed to team member & founders.  Token Allocated For Company Reserves – 12,000,000 FNL These token will be kept aside for  expansion  Token Allocated For Exchanges Listing – 250,000 FNL  Token Allocated For Bounty Campaigns – 1,000,000 FNL   The breakdown for Airdrop  1st Airdrop   1,000,000 FNL token - Ended  2nd Airdrop   1,500,000 FNL token - Ended  3rd Airdrop   1,260,400 FNL token - Ended  Twitter Airdrop   650,000 FNL token - On Going  FB Airdrop   26,600 FNL - On Going  Final Airdrop   3,063,000 FNL - Begins Now  To receive the final airdrop, you need to be on our Telegram Channel http://t.me/adfunnelproject & fill the following form >> https://goo.gl/forms/7SXBwiv2v6CJloRE2  You will need to pm @AdFunnelTech your Bitcointalk ID & Ethereum address on Telegram to verify your identity.

With that uncertainty, we have come up with 2 new rules to make sure the majority of the FNL token holder will form a community on somewhere else, we have chosen telegram for now.  And with that, we have to stop FNL token airdrop for a while. The distribution will continue soon.  Rule #1  Future recipients & existing token holders must be on our telegram group - http://t.me/adfunnelproject  Rule #2 Ethereum address used must be active at least 1 month prior to the airdrop & have another altcoin listed on it.  These 2 rules can solve 2 issues. 1. Fake registration that uses newbie account created just to get free airdrops 2. The eth address will help us to know that you are real & do not simply create new account just to get extra airdrops.  These rules will take immediate effect.",True

As useful as the information is, it requires multiple windows open, to search through your favorites tab with multiple log-ins.  How can Funnel make this easier? These questions and a few others have been answered. Funnel aims to disrupt this with your page with a single page app screen with your content in pre-designed templates that give you the ability to add your crypto sources and social accounts on one page. Using templates we will allow you the ability to add your content where you want it on a page unique to you using existing api's you can see multiple exchanges at once be in your favorite slack and telegram channels at the same time on the same page. We hope to align ourselves with existing crypto companies to offer services, news, content and privacy all in one place.  Content management enables you to choose every piece of content on your page. Content could be websites, pages, posts, photos, videos, docs, and just about any other type of data. We will build in apis for you to add from different services all while providing security to you page to protect what’s important to you.    What is Funnel? A platform allows you to create beautiful single funnel for each crypto project on your mobile app. While many platforms only provide a single page service Funnel will be designed specifically for crypto-minded people by crypto-minded people. We will offer a library of pre-built templates and widgets (as well as the ability for you to create your own) using a drag & drop content builder. Funnel platform aims to create fully responsive layouts for both desktop and mobile, with drag & drop functionality, without the need for any design or programming knowledge.  Membership / Account Access Granting all visitors to your site access your content is a risky. You alone will have exclusive access to your content. By requiring you to create account to see content, Membership services would allow you expand upon your page adding additional features as well as the ability to promote content to the entire network of users launching a new coin have a specific product or site you want to advertise.  Theme Builder There will be free themes and ones that can be purchased. A theme builder gives users access to theme with the options to customize it without having any special coding skills. Everything from button colors and size, to space between and space around page elements can be changed. The right platform also allows for the creation of unique themes for specific pages.  It will also give the ability for creators to sell their themes to other users.  Get Paid To Read Ads Funnel will allow verified crypto-related project owner to broadcast a message to Funnel app user. This can help them to reach targeted audience for their campaign. Funnel app user will receive FNL token for their participation.  Integration Integrating existing crypto services into Funnel, we hope to be able to offer unique items into your page, for example: With SHIFT api we could offer decentralized uncensorable web browsing into your page.
