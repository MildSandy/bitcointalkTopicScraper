S.)  Jobeum – help recruiters find candidates and earn JobTokens  Jobeum Explained - Video with CEO  Jobeum is a Ethereum-based network for business professionals. Blockchain is used to keep records about employment, education, completed projects etc. The records within a profile will be cross-validated by the community and later we’re going to partner with universities and companies so that certificates (diplomas) and validated employment records for people will be stored in the profiles. Users will be able to specify which portions of their profiles should be public and what should be kept private.  Another goal of Jobeum is to make interactions among candidates and recruiters beneficial for both parties by incentivizing micro actions in the recruitment process via micro-payments in JobTokens. JobToken (JBT) is a utility token that fuels Jobeum transactions: responding to a recruiter’s request, opening private parts of their profile to a requestor (a recruiter), passing a test to confirm a skill, referring a good candidate etc.  The Team  The team behind Jobeum has an experience in building products for recruiters: Vitaly Obernikhin and Sergey Dmitrichenko earlier created AmazingHiring - search engine for technical recruiters; Serge Klimoff was one of the very early LinkedIn employees. Vitaly Obernikhin also holds a PhD degree in crypto.  Advisors Sergei Sergienko, CEO, Chronobank.   Jobeum and Chronobank announced a partnership: watch the video with Jobeum CEO Vitaly Obernikhin, PhD and Chronobank.io CEO Sergei Sergienko https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39kjYXnyewo  How Does Jobeum Function?  The Jobeum is a place where you’re one of the following roles: ● Candidate ● Recruiter ● Referrer ● Sales Manager ● Advertiser  Jobeum will enable transactions among the users of the system. Recruiters will use JBT tokens to pay candidates for getting their contact details and other information, for passing a test to confirm their qualification, for recommending good candidates, etc. Smart contracts will be used to implement these transactions.  Where Do the JBT Tokens Come In?  When buying tokens during the Jobeum presale or regular sale, you will have a currency that’s highly valuable within Jobeum. Companies will buy JBT tokens for their recruiters so that they can use the tokens to facilitate the recruitment process. Candidates will receive the tokens as a payment when they do certain actions for recruiters.

Download the Jobeum Whitepaper  You can read our whitepaper at jobeum.com/file/whitepaper.pdf. We continue working on the whitepaper and it is an ongoing process with ideas changing regularly. It is not a technical whitepaper but rather a place where we compile the results of our research and bring a better understanding of Jobeum to people.   Bounty Program  You can read about our bounty program in a separate talk .  Disclaimer  This is to let the community know that we will not be offering our token for sale in the United States. The U.S. regulatory environment related to token sales is still evolving, and we have made a business decision to avoid this market to keep things simpler.  This pre-sale enables the Jobeum community to pre-purchase application tokens for Jobeum software – much like pre-purchasing a software license, or a ticket to a theater, or airline miles, or a gift card.  Additionally, we will not be launching the Jobeum service in the U.S. until we are 100% sure that we can comply with all local applicable laws and regulations, so the tokens will not be usable for U.S. residents until the software is available in the U.S., meaning reasonably compliant.  ★ WEBSITE ★ DOWNLOAD WHITEPAPER ★ TWITTER ★ FACEBOOK ★ TELEGRAM ★",False

The tokens are created to develop a range of contracts among potential candidates, referrers, recruiters, sales managers, and advertisers. Through blockchain technologies the platform implements such agreements as: - Referral- when someone recommends a candidate for an open position and the candidate gets the job, the referral bonus is paid. - Skill confirmation- a recruiter asks a candidate to pass a test to confirm a specific qualification, and when the test is completed, the candidate gets paid. - Access approval- if someone wants to access a particular section of their profile (e.g. projects description, or just their contact information) - Job offer acceptance- a candidate finds a vacancy published by a recruiter, applies for it and successfully goes through the interview process, is finally hired - then gets a bonus from the recruiter. - Advertising etc.",False
