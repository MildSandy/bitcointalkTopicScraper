It doesn't end on 6th december, the 20% bonus just gets down to 10%. Great research!  Quote from: Soyen on December 05, 2017, 12:03:47 PM I ran across their linkedin employee list and noticed that they have only 3 php devs (including tech lead) and 2 front end devs among a huge army of bizz devs, marketers and account managers (students mostly). It's not normal for the project based on blockchain not to have at least one bockchain specialist. I'm sure that if I  have expressed interest to invest in any project I deserve to know details about the project team. How many of them are competent to deal with such project.   Okay so not everyone is at linkedin you know? 90 of 130 tells me that the numbers are okay. If their employees are not listed on linkedin than maybe 40 out of the 130 are simply not registered at linkedin. Would that be possible scenario? Php dev? I don't think you get it man, this is ethereum and an android app, there could be no need for a php dev? And if they have a backend in php, 3 devs could be fine! And then again maybe not everyonee is listed on linkedin? They have a blockchain ""specialists"", even 2, just look here https://indahash.com/ico. And credit for not listing Vitalik because they saw a tweet of him and replied with a cat picture and think you can list him as an advisor now.  Quote from: Soyen on December 05, 2017, 12:03:47 PM I had several questions about this ICO so I joined their Telegram chat. I asked their support team to provide some info about their tech staff. There was nothing but ignoring so on the understanding their chat wasn't overloaded by flow of messages. They have over 9k members in Telegram chat, but most of them are bounty attenders. Should notice that many similar to each other questions were asked several times by different members. It's very close to bot behaviour. Just one of opinions. So i asked several times where their people, how can I make sure in their competence. Still no any exact answer. Their support team explained that their apps are ""award winning"" and no reason to doubt in their competence. What? Can you believe that?  However they put emhasis on their ""award winning working product"". Okay. I went further. I asked them to provide me info if these two separate apps was written in native language or hybrid. If you will do some research and test their app for android and iOS you will see that their applications have low perfomance, poor ui/ux and many bugs. It can serve 365k influencers. I can't beleive that.  I'm sure these apps are not native and were built in the same programming language. It's suitable enough for mvp development but not for ""working product"". So Indahash just reduce costs on devs to be able to promote their ""working product"" making it their biggest advantage on competitors. But what will they say when their competitors will run their own products with better technical characteristics and targeted not only on Instagram but on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Twitch and so on. ? However I can't find any advantages in Indahash even in their ""working product"". Anyway they didn't give any answer on this question too but instead began to threat me blocking for spaming. Someone from their support team contact me via private messages and warned me that i will be banned if I will continue asking such questions. :/  It's a total disrespective as for me.   Not sure what your problem is? Maybe the support guy is not a programming specialist and can not answer your question. Even I have a hardtime understanding what you mean by native language or hybrid? Maybe the support guy has too. Your post seems to be mainly delusional rambling. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRKz82v5JQY",False

Our unique idea was to monetize mid-tier influencers and let them make money on their passions. You can learn more here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=AQ4MUrCBxQ4  The indaHash Coin is a universal cryptocurrency payment structure available to social media influencers, their audiences and brands. With the introduction of the indaHash Coin, indaHash will solve a wide range of issues and challenges between influencers, brands and audiences, while allowing network of global influencers to play a part in the rapidly growing cryptocurrency market.  How it works: The indaHash crypto-economic system works between three groups: brands, influencers and audiences.  Brands Brands use indaHash Coin to pay for marketing campaigns with influencers. Because of this, influencers, no matter where they are located, can receive payments immediately, eliminating the 30-60 day waiting periods for payments. As part of a completely new service, “Pay-With-Fame”, influencers will have the possibility of exchanging their earned indaHash Coins for a variety of different offers from brands. For example, influencers will receive early access to limited edition products, as well as events and exclusive workshops. The new feature will change the way brands work with influencers by allowing influencers to receive exclusive discounts on products and services they wouldn’t normally receive. Brands will also benefit from this feature by receiving authentic reviews from desirable trendsetters.  Influencers Influencers, based on indaHash Coin, can create their own tokens and use them to increase their audience engagement by rewards and gamification. They are also able to exchange their indaHash tokens for payout, or hold onto them in hopes their value will grow with time based on the cryptocurrency marketplace. Most importantly, payout with indaHash Coin will allow them to be an integral part of the growing and evolving cryptocurrency industry.  Audience (followers) Influencer audiences can use collected tokens and exchange them for exclusive actions set by the influencer for their community. For example, customized prizes personalized by the influencer, one on one meetings and other social activities.  Growing value of the influencer marketing industry and buy-back: * Having indaHash Coins contributes directly to being a part of the influencer marketing industry. The growing number of influencers and the increasing market value, which should reach between $5-10 billion dollars by 2020, will also boost the value. The value of the indaHash Coin should reflect its growth. * indaHash Coins will be regularly bought by indaHash from crypto exchanges. We will provide the liquidity of our currency and the purchases regardless of its current market value. indaHash will issue 80% of all tokens to the crypto-community. In order to be able to settle the payments in indaHash Coin, the company will regularly purchase its own indaHash Coins for the fiat currencies received from brands we collaborate with. * Purchase price IDH through indaHash will always be based on market value and, also according to the market value, will be transferred to the influencers for the campaigns completed. Therefore, regardless of the exchange rate, indaHash Coin will be constantly purchased. Users of indaHash Coins will not only be influencers, but also brands and followers, which in turn should allow the demand for indaHash Coin to continue to grow over time.",False

One of the goals of our ICO is to obtain liquidity of indaHash Coin on the cryptocurrency exchanges. Taking into account the scale of our business and the entire influencer marketing industry, obtaining liquidity for indaHash Coin is a crucial part of tokenizing the ecosystem of cooperation between brands, influencers and their fans. It is noteworthy that we do not reserve IDH Coins for the team. Every month indaHash will buy their own tokens back from the market, using the money received from the brands to settle payments with influencers. In this way, we will be able to ensure a stable and constant growth of the indaHash Coin value. Our cryptocurrency will reflect the value and the growth of the real business. We invite you to familiarize yourself with our whitepaper: https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/idh-files/ico-landing/indahash_whitepaper_ico.pdf Have a nice day! indaHash team",False

Taking into account the scale of our business and the entire influencer marketing industry, obtaining liquidity for indaHash Coin is a crucial part of tokenizing the ecosystem of cooperation between brands, influencers and their fans. It is noteworthy that we do not reserve IDH Coins for the team. Every month indaHash will buy their own tokens back from the market, using the money received from the brands to settle payments with influencers. In this way, we will be able to ensure a stable and constant growth of the indaHash Coin value. Our cryptocurrency will reflect the value and the growth of the real business. We invite you to familiarize yourself with our whitepaper: https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/idh-files/ico-landing/indahash_whitepaper_ico.pdf Have a nice day! indaHash team",False
