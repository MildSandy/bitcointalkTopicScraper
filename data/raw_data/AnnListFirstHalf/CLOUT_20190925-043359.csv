They had an ICO, but they didn't hit their cap and maybe made a couple million which is only like a years budget in a very modest business then tried to launch it anyway. They paid like 200k for a HitBTC listing and however much they spent going to summits and buying booths with all of the convention shit and probably paid their own salaries after it ended as well. They also had quite a bit of internal drama with how the funds were managed recklessly like this (there are way more reputable and cheaper exchanges with more humans to list on than HitBTC) and rightfully so, so the CEO (Sean Kirtz) left but that's basically what this is now.  Tokens are very cheap now. They're struggling a bit with development and community. This would be a perfect project for a backend dev with ipfs knowledge to get a hold of because of the extra ICO tokens and cheap price.

They only raised 200 BTC-ish at the maximum. HitBTC alone cost 20 of that when they could've listed like 6-7 exchanges with eth pair at 1/10 the cost (yobit is only 1 btc) plus HitBTC demanded 1m tokens on top of that. Your standard convention booth space rental can run $10000 just for the booth. The team is there and active, but they heard all of this a million times. The ICO price was insane. It should've been 5c-10c like a lot of the others. Dimcoin is like the lowest on HitBTC and they raised 14 million.

The reasons for lack of success lie in many factors, but most often, the reliance on a single user who actively maintains and supports these sites is the common point of failure. At one point, the person who maintains the website of the listings loses interest, has no time or has other reasons to stop holding the updates and things start to tumble us.  Coinmarketcal has successfully produced a comprehensive website encompassing all of the above. There is a calendar of cryptocurrency events run by the community.  The success behind this new calendar of cryptocurrency events is due to the fact that it’s maintained by the community instead of one single person. Visitors are people who can not only explore the available events, but also add events (give evidence) and their submissions are validated using a voting system (users also validate events discarding false news). Coinmarketcal has been in many screens since its launch, from telegram groups to crypto specific shared calendars.  The partnership between Coinmarketcal and CLOUT ables our users to see all the events of Coinmarketcal on the CLOUT platform. This special addition into the CLOUT platform will increase awareness for all our users by adding another powerful tool of research into one’s arsenal.

PRL entered the markets at half cent and their ICO was 6 cents, it reached 4 dollars already, currently sitting in 90 cents. There's good tech behind PRL and if CLOUT, delivers what the project is all about, the tech will support the price in the short and long term. but for now, no product + low price = High speculation + high risk + high rewards.  The alpha looks nice btw.  I understand investors in the presale and ICO might be screwed right now but that's if and only if they sell at this prices. They really shouldn't sell at this prices.  PRL airdroppers got their PRL at half a cent too and they probably all sold when it reached the ICO price at 6 cents. We will definitely experience the same with CLOUT, and that will only make the price get higher than the ICO max price which was what $2.50? Because they are a strong resistance now for everyone that is just waiting to recover their investment. If you are only waiting to get in an ICO to sell it as fast as possible and as profitable as possible, go for ICOs that are vaporwave then. As long as the team is working harder in developing a functional product rather than being more worried about how to pump the price without a reason, then this all is good and healthy.

The first big revolution of the media was the radio, as it made instant communication possible. With the emergence of TV, information became visible. Following the media, the way we perceive and produce information changed dramatically. As H.M. McLuhan said, “the media is the message” — and he couldn’t have put it better.  Once the TV won all people’s hearts, it opened Pandora’s box of all kinds of media manipulation. From direct — like advertising and propaganda — to indirect — like fake news, manipulations with images and videos. These phenomena became one of the key features of the cold war period, and they keep going until now. No wonder that Barry Levinson’s “Wag the Dog” got two “Oscars” and three “Golden Globes”.  However, time is relentless, and now the TV is already outdated. The internet, which was, by the way, predicted by H.M. McLuhan in the 1960s, is the new media world dominator. In the early 2000s, everybody became a newsmaker thanks to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, so that user generated content (UGC) evolved. You could have expected that this would lead to more transparency and honesty in the media. In some sense, this is true. But there are two sides of this coin.  Nobody moderates UGC. Nobody checks the facts. As against traditional media, the piece of news generated by a regular person doesn’t have to pass an editor before reaching general public. Anyone can publish anything, in the worst sense of these words. Fraudulent and dishonest information have become an integral part of our media consumption.  The problem of deceptive information becomes utterly urgent when it comes to money. Here comes the innovation of the decade: the blockchain. With the invention of the decentralized technology, a completely new market emerged. The ICO — initial coin offering — allows any person to raise funds for his/her project. On the other side, any person can now become an investor and receive the project’s “digital assets” (tokens) by taking part in the crowdsale.  One of the key features of this new market is its poor regulation. Since anyone can invest in anything, no one is responsible for the security of this investment. No wonder that a lot of scam projects emerged very soon. As a natural consequence, the blockchain community invented self-regulation mechanisms: escrow agents, trust criteria, etc. Nevertheless, the number of scams continues to rise with the growth of the market. The information about people and projects is dispersed and often cannot be verified. Dishonest articles, fake news and other manipulative media activities have become part of the blockchain world’s everyday life.  The blockchain community has a fascinating ability of self-regulation. When there is a problem, someone finds a solution and launches a corresponding project. This is exactly the case of CLOUT.  CLOUT is a project that aims to solve the problem of dishonest information in the blockchain world. The blockchain based platform allows users to share and evaluate content. When someone posts a piece of news, other users can approve or disapprove it, in case that the information is inaccurate or misleading. This feedback is reflected in the user’s rating. Consequently, authors that post fraudulent information, will be penalized by the community and the platform. On the contrary, people that post useful stuff will be rewarded. Besides, CLOUT users will be able to chat with each other, comment on posts and enjoy other typical social media activities. This makes CLOUT a one-stop-shop for all information related to the blockchain and cryptocurrency market and, most important, a community self-regulation tool.  The blockchain technology makes the process transparent and advantageous for honest content creators. All users will be rewarded in CLC, CLOUT’s daughter token, based on quality of platform interaction. Posting, commenting, upvoting and being a part of the “crowd wisdom voting polls” all earn users CLC. This system ensures that only high quality posts, comments, and ICO’s rise to the forefront of the platform. CLC is the fuel that runs the Network, CLOUT tokens are what generate CLC.  Behind CLOUT is a star-pledged team of founders and advisors. Sean Kirtz, Founder and President, is a renowned entrepreneur and fintech solution architect. He has solid experience in assessing and managing blockchain based projects and ICOs. One of the key founders, Henry Wang, is a prominent person in the blockchain business. He is Founder of International Blockchain Application Federation. The recent venture of Henry Wang, Smart Mesh, has recently sold out 99% of the tokens offered for ICO. Another dominant name is that of CLOUT’s Advisor, David Cohen, one of the pioneers of the decentralized technology. David was a member during the IOTA Token Cryptocurrency launch, which broke all previous records reaching a $1.7. Asian markets seem to be a priority for CLOUT: Jay Kim, CEO and Founder of ICO Schedule, is an Advisor as well.  CLOUT’s team is remarkable for being truly international, since it is formed by professionals from different states and even continents. The team and advisory board features members from the U.S., Europe, Australia, Russia, South Korea, Japan and China.  The project was started from scratch just a few months ago but rocketed up thanks to the team’s efforts. CLOUT has launched its ICO on the 17th of November and is now progressing with platform development. The project is to be listed on one of the world’s major exchanges in February 2018.  The initiative of CLOUT shows a great example of the market’s community self-regulation. It does not only stand for a media for all crypto enthusiasts regardless their experience, but provides for highly important mechanisms, such as information verification and ratings. With the help of blockchain technology, the CLOUT team is building a new type of media, combining three major trends: decentralization, social media and user generated content. This might be the first project of the absolutely new type of media, that might some day — in fact, very soon — lead to another leap in the media technology. Just like TV and the internet in the early days.  https://medium.com/@CLOUT_Official/decentralization-a-new-step-of-media-evolution-7b4bc64bc22b",False
