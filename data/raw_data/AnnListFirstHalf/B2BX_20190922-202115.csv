First of all, I would like to emphasize that there is no secret that we may buy tokens instead of a client. Some of them, especially big ones do want to go to the exchange and purchase tokens.

I ask, because you say, ""why would we need to buy back from contributors"". You see, to raise a value of a token, there needs to be a demand for it.

Either way,  to answer your question about blaiming:  Your token is utility token. Meaning, there needs to be a usage of said token for the price to rise. Main reasons for demand of a token are:  1. sharing 20% of your net profit with token holders. You removed this entirely! So no more active participants, no more 20% sharing.  2.

B2BX‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääas well as the large majority of other tokens is a utility token. While negotiating with the exchanges regarding listing we were told that the existence of APC can carry a risk of our token being considered a security since participants can earn additional token income.

In March, there will be a series of announcements including exchanges and products where everyone can start using a token in the eco system!  At the moment B2Broker is preparing to launch a new crypto-broker client. In partnership with us, this client decided not only to accept B2B coins as a means of payment to make a deposit, but also to nominate a deposit on the platform in B2BX coins, where it will be possible to trade 27 currency pairs with a 1: 3 leverage. This means that it will be possible to deposit the B2BX coins to the platform and buy, for example, BTC / USD or B2B / USD and, as the coin grows, earn twice ‚Äî both on the growth of the trading instrument, and on the rise in the price of the coin where the deposit is nominated . The crypto-broker will be launched on the MT5 platform. You can choose from 6 cryptocurrencies to deposit, 27 trading pairs and replenish, withdraw and exchange using multiple cryptocurrencies. The launch of the crypto broker is scheduled for March 19. Stay tuned!  We also plan to include our B2BX coin into three pairs in the liquidity pool for brokers on 20th March and announce the names of all the brokers who included our coin in their list of trading instruments. So, even if someone doesn‚Äôt agree to accept it as a means of payment (although in the future we will get everyone to accept it), at least it can already be bought / sold through the brokers platform, and will appear on the list of trading instruments with the Broker, who has thousands of customers on their platform.

Registration procedure: KYC, minimum commission per month, minimum deposit 100K.  The second part of the exchange will be available to all (first of all for tokenholders). The pairs for trading will be available only to Crypto-Crypto (including USDt). There are no restrictions. The second part will commence implementation of the strategy for providing liquidity to the B2BX token in the pool of margin liquidity of our aggregator. Trade products can be found here: https://www.b2bx.exchange/fee.html The launch Launch ‚Äî will take place on March 20. We shall send our another reminder;)  Comments about wash-trading are unnecessary. As we do not do this!  As for B2Broker products: B2BinPay ‚Äî gateway for receiving payments in cryptocurrency. The site is working, and we are accepting applications for connection. B2BX.exchange ‚Äî exchange-aggregator, provider of cryptocurrency liquidity. The site has reached the final stage of development. And we will soon announce the opening of the registration.

The deadline for all of these products is the ‚ÄúConsensus‚Äù exhibition, which will be held on 10th May in New York. This is the largest exhibition in the crypto industry.

It doesnt work that way. My post above was to warn people of your project as it is clearly setup to benefit B2B company only and not investors, but since you want to cherry pick what you answer, I will consider that as an invitation to elaborate without giving you an option to skip issue so I will make them into points with quotes from ""whitepaper"" and ""tokenomy"" https://www.b2bx.pro/ :  - ""Starting from January 2018 the payment of commissions by all participants - members of the B2BX ecosystem will be accepted exclusively in B2BX Tokens."" Care to explain how is it, that you have 3 million in trade volume of token (daily), but not 1 bit of price increase? Each time, large amounts of tokens are sold / bought in an instant, always around 100 sats below lowest offering price? I will tell you what is clear from above, you are actually accepting FIAT money as commission payment and then you buy tokens on exchanges from your self to pump up the volume while being very careful not to buy a single token from any other investor. I would be more than happy you prove me wrong, but what I stated are cold hard FACTS that anyone can check by visiting any exchange this token is listed on OOOOOOOR check out this snapshot from today, taken on TIDEX:  https://imgur.com/HxQt7Sg  This is so sad...its ALMOST funny. You lowered your buy / sell bot to go 44 sats under that guy who is selling 1000+ tokens so you dont have to buy his? Truly petty on your part.  - Nowhere in tokenomy did you say that 20% of commission to be paid to ""active participants"" will be voluntary on your side. Nowhere did you mention that even if you did register a person as active participant it is purely voluntary on your side to actually give them any tasks, therefor they are omitted from any payments. Let me elaborate on this big issue. This had a purpose of disabling the B2B to continue doing what I stated in first point, meaning, B2B would be holding less and less tokens over time, hence forcing increase of the price. What they did is strike this 20% as voluntary in order to continue purchasing same tokens from them selves over and over again resulting in extremely low volume other than you buying from your self!  - Tokenomy was supposed to start in December (""Admission of applications for membership in the Active Participants Club will begin in December 2017"" https://www.b2bx.pro/docs/b2bx_tokenomy-en.pdf ) it didnt . People held on to tokens because of it. Now, in March, we learn that only 126 investors (feel free to check on explorer) who hold over 20 000 tokens (instead of over 1000 token holders) will be eligible for Tokenomy.  Should you decide to answer, do answer point by point and not only what suits you, while taking it out of context.  Now you have a choice... either be quiet and assume most people are that naive to purchase more of your tokens or answer all points like I did... with proof.  One last thing:  Meaning of a word SCAM is: ""fraudulent scheme"".In your whitepaper you have stated 6 points why the value of the tokens will rise. You have not fulfilled ANY of them to this date. This constitutes a clear definition of SCAM.  Waiting for your reply.",False

You invest money in ICO or support them by buying tokens on exchange and holding them. In doing so, you are guided by what was officially promised to you in their business plan / whitepaper / yellowpaper or whatever.  In this case, company used the received funds to develop a product / software solution but refuses to follow through on their obligation to investors. Their promise is to add to the value of token, make it more and more desirable.  So when you say they have a working product, I agree but that working product is for their own benefit not investors. If investors dont benefit the fruits of said ""working product"" that makes it a scam because it is opposite of what they promised in their whitepaper.  Hope I clarified this matter.

However, today we can clearly say that in March B2BX will be listed on one of the top exchanges!  In March, there will be a series of announcements including exchanges and products where everyone can start using a token in the eco system!  At the moment B2Broker is preparing to launch a new crypto-broker client. In partnership with us, this client decided not only to accept B2B coins as a means of payment to make a deposit, but also to nominate a deposit on the platform in B2BX coins, where it will be possible to trade 27 currency pairs with a 1: 3 leverage. This means that it will be possible to deposit the B2BX coins to the platform and buy, for example, BTC / USD or B2B / USD and, as the coin grows, earn twice - both on the growth of the trading instrument, and on the rise in the price of the coin where the deposit is nominated . The crypto-broker will be launched on the MT5 platform. You can choose from 6 cryptocurrencies to deposit, 27 trading pairs and replenish, withdraw and exchange using multiple cryptocurrencies. The launch of the crypto broker is scheduled for March 19.   Comments about wash-trading are unnecessary. As we do not do this!  As for B2Broker products: B2BinPay - gateway for receiving payments in cryptocurrency. The site is working, and we are accepting applications for connection. B2BX.exchange - exchange-aggregator, provider of cryptocurrency liquidity. The site has reached the final stage of development. And we will soon announce the opening of the registration. The B2Bcoin site, will consolidate information about all companies that accept B2BX coins for payment, brokers and all exchanges where you can buy / sell a coin.  The deadline for all of these products is the ""Consensus"" exhibition, which will be held on 10th May in New York. This is the largest exhibition in the crypto industry. And we are looking forward to presenting our products to the market. We are confident of receiving great interest!  And finally. Since 2014 B2Broker has offered real products that are of interest to the market and which thousands of people use. We have acted as a provider of liquidity since 2015 (technically - since 2014). This year we plan to obtain licenses for maximum reliability to serve large brokers who will be attracted to crypto-currency trading in the future.  Please, stop calling the project a scam. WP is a our plan, we've updated our roadmap. Corrections with time are inevitable. We're sorry, that announced Active Members club later.

Whoever thinks this is just coincidence (when in past 2-3 months price didnt move at all) is just ignorant. If you look at historic chart, you wont get the whole picture.

You gathered a nice sum of money in ICO, developed your self a product and when it came to give something back to people who invested in your project, you decided that you should keep more to yourself.

Wanting to grasp the opportunity, many brokers and technology providers have quickly launched solutions to enable retail clients to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Likewise, more and more brokerages have started integrating cryptocurrency instruments into their platforms.  One such company is B2Broker, a company that has quickly positioned itself as one of the leading service providers in the B2B sphere. B2Broker caters to a wide range of clients including individual investors, large licensed brokers, banks, hedge funds and professional managers.  A solid company backed by a team of recognised experts in the industry, B2Broker started operations in 2014 and has quickly risen to prominence thanks to its comprehensive range of offerings and its eminent figureheads who strive to promote the company‚Äôs services.  Just 3 years into operations, the company has a relatively short but successful history, culminating in an advanced base of ready to use technical solutions that enable brokers to save time and money.  To date, the company offers a range of products and services including Turnkey Solutions, White Label Solutions for MT4 and MT5, Trader‚Äôs Room modules for brokerage websites, CRM systems for brokerage sales and retention departments, DMA Liquidity, PAMM/MAM Services, Web API MT4/5, Cloud B2Bridge and Legal and Financial Services.  The First 3 Years Backtrack to 2014, B2Broker entered the market with two products: White Label MT4/MT5 and Traders Room for brokers and had one office in St. Petersburg, with 10 employees and 2 clients.  The following year, 2015 saw the development of the first fully-fledged CRM-system for brokers together with Microsoft Ukraine‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäB2Broker Cloud CRM. The company expanded its product line, added aggregated liquidity from 3 different liquidity providers (including LMAX) and legal and financial services. B2Broker opened a second office in Kiev and saw its employee numbers expand to 15, with 5 clients (CIS, Europe).  In 2016, B2Broker added PAMM/MAM/Social Trading into the product line, upgraded DMA Liquidity by implementing a professional solution based on Integral with the liquidity provider, Swissquote Bank. the company also added liquidity on shares and launched a package offer called ¬´Forex broker turn-key¬ª. With a new website and the opening of a head office in Moscow, B2Broker entered the world arena boasting 21 clients from Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Malaysia, Czech Republic with 27 employees in its team.  Moving on in 2017, B2Broker created a cryptocurrency aggregator B2BX and added the functionality of crypto-exchangers to its Traders Room product becoming the first company in the world to launch cryptocurrency solutions. At this point the company decided to turn its cryptocurrency aggregator, B2BX, into a full-fledged crypto-exchange for institutional clients, a marketplace for accredited and regulated brokerage companies and financial institutes, enabling them to trade in cryptocurrencies.  With a meticulously planned schedule to build on its early successes the company conducted an ICO to drive the development of B2BX.  Post ICO Plans The project received strong interest from around the industry and raised over ‚Ç¨8 million which will be used to obtain licences, to open local offices which are required for optimal work with liquidity and to connect cryptocurrency exchanges.  Undoubtedly, launching cryptocurrency offerings is a way of aligning with the future of trading. Many retail brokers and providers have already seen positive effects on their businesses with an immediate effect in terms of profit growth, trade turnover and commissions, as well as increasing the recognition of their brands.  As the demand for cryptocurrency trading continues to grow with more and more brokerages looking to join and profit from the trend, B2Broker has established a 2-year plan to build on its recent ICO success and expand its global reach.",False

All network services have an independent/distributed connection to each other (personal area, API, databases, etc.). 3.2. A cold wallet with a transaction confirmation from several participants (multisig) is used for token distribution. 3.3. A smart contract has the function of suspending transactions in the event of unpredictable situations so we can protect the participants' funds and transfer them to a more secure smart contract. 3.4. We do not store private keys from the participants' wallets, which increases the security and keeps the personal accounts of the participants. 3.5. The security of the collected funds during the ICO will be provided by a multi-signature on the wallets. The withdrawal of funds from these wallets will be possible if there are 2 or more signatures of team members. It will be publicly available to view data balances of these wallets. 3.6. Cold storage of a part of the collected funds to finance the project will be organized on the basis of hardware wallets (KeepKey/Ledger). It will be created a backup copy on physical media (flash drives) for each hardware wallet and their backup copies. Hardware wallets and their backup copies will be stored separately: one part in the safe of one bank, the other part in the banking cell of another bank in another country.",False

The protocol integration will enable the Bancor Network Token (BNT) to convert to B2BX tokens, and vice versa, instantly and continuously, according to a mathematical formula and directly through the smart contracts. Bancor‚Äôs smart contracts utilize a connector token method which will allow B2BX tokens to automatically convert to BNT, ETH and any integrated token in this decentralized liquidity network, according to an open-source algorithmic price. These conversions take place directly between smart contracts, outside of exchanges. This integration will bring built in convertibility to B2BX tokens. B2Broker CEO Artur Azizov commented: ‚ÄúThe successful progress of our token sale leads us to the next phase of the project and ensuring the B2BX token benefits from the greatest blockchain technology advantages. We admire Bancor‚Äôs automated approach, and will implement the protocol as soon as the token sale is concluded.‚Äù About Bancor:  Bancor Protocol‚Ñ¢ is a standard for the creation of Smart Tokens‚Ñ¢, cryptocurrencies with built-in convertibility directly through their smart contracts. Bancor utilizes an innovative token ‚ÄúConnector‚Äù method to enable formulaic price calculation and continuous liquidity for all compliant tokens, without needing to match two parties in an exchange. Smart Tokens‚Ñ¢ interconnect to form token liquidity networks, allowing user-generated cryptocurrencies to thrive. For more information, visit the website and read the Bancor Protocol‚Ñ¢ Whitepaper.

They hope to address some prevalent issues within the market, almost all centred around barriers to entry.  The current state of the cryptocurrency investment market is almost entirely retail; there have been some ventures from big money into the sphere, but a number of factors prevent institutional investors from making big plays:  Firstly, a lack of regulation has left banks and licensed brokers of regular currencies, stocks, and other securities out in the cold, struggling with the same issues which plague institutional investors' compliance  Secondly, a lack of liquidity poses itself as more of a soft limitation, by preventing huge transactions from being able to be processed quickly and with an adequate reserve. In retail markets, smaller transactions require less liquidity, being at a smaller transaction size with higher frequency. When the transaction amount rises, money must come from somewhere, especially so with cryptocurrency.  https://coinidol.com/b2bx-to-fix-corporate-crypto-investment-problems/",False

Will B2BX tokens be necessary to use your services, or is it possible to use your exchange without them? -Of course, you can use the exchange without them. - You can trade them on the exchange and the aggregated exchanges. - and You can buy our real brokerage products with tokens. 2.Multi-sig wallets have a tendency to be hacked. How will you ensure this does not happen? - most importantly, we have hot and cold wallets separated. - Hot wallets always kept a very minimal amount of money - Tokens are stored in a cold wallet and transferred to a hot one, in which they are distributed among ICO participants. - We have a certain limit of tokens which can be stored in hot wallets, so, when it is reached, we physically send Tokens from cold wallet to hot. -  Second question - How do we ensure the security of our wallets? - we have 6 blockchain nodes (bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ethereum, dash, monero) - we receive money to hot wallets and send them immediately to cold wallets, which generally located on the different computer and fully protected 3. How will you ensure the security of the web wallet given that you have a copy of my private key? How will you store it, and who will have access to it? Do I need this specific private key to use your exchange, or can I create a new one? - we have a very important feature of our wallet is that we went along the way as the ""blocking info""-  when the ico participant register in our ICO webwallet, he/she receives the application to create own web wallet. In short words, the participant creates SID phrase (from 8 to 18 words). After that, the participant receives an encrypted key for this wallet, which He/She HAS TO save on the computer (we do not store this information, only you have access to the own wallet ). This wallet appears in etherium blockchain, practically it is real etherium wallet. - we achieve max security due to the fact that no one except the web wallet creator does not have access to it as private keys are stored locally on his/her computer. -Do I need this specific private key to use your exchange, or can I create a new one?  - this question is not entirely clear for me, can you explain? 4. Will there be any additional security measures in place on the exchange, like 2FA for example? - yes, we will have it, I will specify on this question later on.",False
