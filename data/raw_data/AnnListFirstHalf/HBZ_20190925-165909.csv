Presale Live!,"A)Product:  The team is currently working on testing the Helbiz hardware to be installed in all cars on the platform. Significant amounts of testing are required to ensure functionality in all situations, it is not one single test but a series of tests. We are testing the device and lock mechanism in all circumstances, situations, weather, locations, models, cars, and will be carefully tested for reliability, durability, security, safety, synchronization and connection to servers, apps, cars and fleet management. We are dealing with the private property of our users and need to ensure everything has been carefully tested and optimized in worst case scenarios as well before allowing other users to unlock and drive the cars. Currently the initial testing is going according to plan and we expect the V1.0 to be released in the app store at the end of July. Simultaneously we are growing our partner network in Los Angeles currently on-boarding in-house and partner mechanics for the hardware installation to ensure a scaleable operation that can withstand high demand.  B)Buyback:  The Helbiz team is looking to purchase more than $1m (USD) of HBZ off the open market, to strengthen the company’s position both internally and to new investors . The Helbiz carsharing platform is set to be released to the public next month bringing incentivized organic demand to HBZ. The buy back of HBZ will be equivalent to more than $1m (ETH) and will be executed stage by stage. The team has executed the first stage of the buyback, buying HBZ equivalent to 400 ETH from its various exchanges between $0.01 and $0.04. The team will continue to acquire HBZ until after the launch with the intention of bringing the currency back to ICO price. The team will continue to buy back tokens for more than 1600 ETH over the next couple of weeks.  C)Token delivery:  ALL tokens from presale and ICO have now been delivered, no more investor deliveries will take place from the main Wallet and the circulating supply on CoinMarketCap does now match the actual circulating supply mentioned weeks ago.

They expect someone from the company would fill it whereas all the data is visible in CMC, CC, Etherscan and in many other places. But they expect someone from the team would contact them and make it happen to add all the details of the company so that it won't look like a scam! Now judge, where all the data is already available, why they are waiting to update those? The answer is because they need money! They don't need whether it's a legit company, or what the people care about! They just need fresh money! That's their income, right? Why depends on them?  2. trustpilot: As the same! Not enough information! They need the team to contact with them and give them money to update information. They just don't care anything else! And there two 1 star reviews regarding Helbiz. One is clearly visible that it's a review by a hater, probably banned from any social media or Telegram channel due to spamming or violation of rules and he/she is up to destroying the positivity. Another review indicates that spam email! Well, regarding this I would like to say, if you are already with Helbiz, you might have seen two phishing site were online by the name Helbiz and the team had taken immediate action against them by their law firm. Before reviewing, just make sure it's really from Helbiz or someone else pretending Helbiz to scam you! Isn't it that clear to understand?  3. Hackingteam: Entering their website, ah! It's creepy and full of advertisement! I rather never visit or follow these types of stupid websites! They have written an article without any kind of base or proofs! Just a pure gossip! It's just an opinion from the writer!  4. Reddit posts: Just some haters posts! Rather believing those posts, research yourself! Every ICO has thousands of haters, there is no doubt! Helbiz has just a few because they couldn't afford Helbiz.  5. Medium article by a community member: As far as I remember, she wasn't eligible for airdrop! Now, lough yourself. We were talking about it in Telegram channel! The info regarding amazix by her is also wrong.  If you don't trust in a project that doesn't mean that you need to spread your views! However, you are wrong and all these are not any proof of Helbiz being scam! Open your eyes! And to all well-wishers of Helbiz, defend Helbiz from the Fudsters cause it's our project!",False

Originally we had agreements with 2 separate top 5 exchanges. Our team decided to turn one of them down due to their activity behind the scenes since they are facing a large investigation in the near future which can impact their survival and the other top 5 exchange we had an agreement with is currently on standby as the exchange in question generally do not list coins trading below ICO price, especially if the project does not have a real world use case that has launched already. When HBZ is back at 0.15$ or the product has launched we will of course list here asap.  The team is of course talking to other exchanges, but currently the focus is on launching the two platforms and thereby bringing real world usage to HBZ allowing us to list on the top exchanges even if trading below ICO price.   The team has not forgotten any of its promises, and if you look back it has kept all of its promises but some with slight delays.

Presale Live!,"    First of all you have your right to post if you truly believe what you are writing, but the company nor the CEO have nothing to hide, but it is sad that you have made it your mission to try to work against an ambitious project that will help millions of people especially as we had answered your questions multiple times several days before.  Despite your intentions I will explain:  As mentioned in the Medium Article posted April 30th the actual circulating supply is 547m tokens, with the difference between actual circulating supply and CoinMarketCaps circulating supply being undelivered investor tokens (230m at 30April) that are blocked for various periods due to their individual contracts. CoinMarketCap is tracking the main wallet and is aware of this and updates it automatically every time an investor’s token is unlocked, we will be making multiple payments and investors are free to store their tokens where they want, on an exchange or MEW.  In regards to splitting up payments: All transfers from main wallet, including bounty and airdrop payments, have always been through one large payment that then has then been split up into multiple smaller transfers to the different individuals to minimize the amount of transactions directly from the main wallet, this is nothing new.  It was my mistake not to clarify that not the entire 30m was for an exchange listing in telegram, only a few million were for liquidity for a few different exchanges but the rest were deliveries to ICO & PreSale investors.  Of course all of this was already communicated through our news channels.",False
