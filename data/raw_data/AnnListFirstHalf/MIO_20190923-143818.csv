FIAT) investors, that would just mean, that the late investors get ""less"" for their investment, than they actually would get right now.  I think that would be a fair solution for a community like this.

This is what I am talking about all the time. Why in the world the company would decide to fundraise in crypto when buying the equipment, paying salaries, lease etc. in fiat.  Dear Miner One Token Holders,  You have seen what is happening in the markets. When we started our Crowdsale, ETH was at US $920. As per the terms of our smart contract, your contributions were locked and inaccessible to us until the Small Cap (4.7 million MIO) was reached. It was right around at that time that ETH began its slide. As you know, it is currently down to below US $400. We made a commitment to you in our roadmap to put in the first order for mining equipment at this time. However, given the market situation and the widespread view that ETH will rebound from these lows, our feeling is that it may make sense to wait a bit and give that rebound some time to occur. I want to stress that we do not think waiting a few weeks to order the equipment will throw Miner One off schedule. We are currently preparing the facility in Luleå, with construction starting by next week.  I am also still confident that Miner One, being the World’s Most Efficient Mining Operation, will deliver profits, given the underlying value that cryptocurrency and blockchain technology creates. That isn’t going away and there will continue to be a need for data centers that support cryptocurrency networks.  But I do not want to take the decision without consulting you first. So please give me your opinion by filling out the short survey below.  Thank you for your trust and for being with us. We will continue to do our best to be good stewards of the funds you have entrusted to Miner One.  Sincerely Yours,  Pranas Slusnys CEO  Btw the questionnaire was about the purchase of equipment, whether to buy all the equipment at this price of ETH, buy small amount or wait untill the price rebound.",False

This is exactly why Envion is in trouble.   They raised an incredible amount of ETH at peak ETH prices.  $1400 ETH happened during their ICO...but they didn't sell all that ETH they raised.   Thus, EVN lost 70% of their purchase power now that ETH is at $380.  Their token value has been very hurt.  I understand why MinerOne.IO is pegging investments to ETH which is because they are *NOT* hedging themselves against ETH at all.  MinerOne hasn't bought any miner equipment yet which means they're holding all raised ICO funds mostly in ETH.  Which means when ETH tanks...their purchase power has tanked.   Which means that early investor loses a lot.  Either MinerOne should be selling all their ETH constantly as they receive it..and put it in a bank account in $USD which will protect the purchase power OR they should be putting on a SHORT ETH futures position which again removes the ETH exposure for all the collected ICO funds.  This wouldn't be an issue if mining equipment was being purchased immediately when an investor buys the token...but that is absolutely not what is happening.  Thus, investors will absolutely have ETH market risk when they buy the MIO token...as MinerOne is not hedging ETH risk...and hasn't bought ANY ASICs yet.   When they purchase the ASICs then the ETH to USD to ASIC purchase transaction will be happening.  Which is to say that if ETH crashes further to say $100 from current $380, then obviously everyone who invested so far will lose another 74% of where the MIO token is now..because MinerOne will have lost 74% of their purchase power of already collected funds.  Hopefully ETH doesn't go down any more in this challenging market.  My group offers a SmartETH service to hedge funds, ICOs, and family offices which helps institutions dynamically hedge their crypto exposure.  This is to help retain their purchase power while holding crypto building up to their launch in the case of ICOs.  Being able to have flatter or net zero exposure to crypto when it's crashing is important and having a professional portfolio manager running their ""book"" is important in keeping all their funds.  If MinerOne wants to discuss more how they can manage crypto market risk please let me know who best to reach out to.  Feel free to message me directly on this platform.  Cheers,  Poprocks  ps.   I'm also very interested in investing in this project as well.  My group manages family office, hedge fund & ICO capital..and I'd welcome further discussion with MinerOne on doing larger deals and possible partnership as we offer services that could improve your ongoing market risk exposure.",False

I thought you might be interested in a Google docs sheet I put together.  It has some very conservative projections which may help you decide whether to invest.  I've tried to do some due diligence before making my decision, I've read the whitepaper a few times, read all of the FAQs on the website, watched 4 livestreams on Facebook, researched the principals on the team, and participated in the Telegram group.  By the way, side note: all of the support personnel I've dealt with on Telegram have been very helpful.  It's not my favorite medium for information, but they've all been pretty good.  I've also corresponded briefly with one of the principals regarding getting accredited in the US.  I suggest everyone else does their own investigation and possible projections of outcomes.  Read the whitepaper and realize that the initial projections were when BTC was at $14,000USD and difficulty was lower than it is now.  Realize that all numbers on the website and whitepaper are good faith estimates and that things change over time.  I am making my decision not on whether I'll get 471% return, or 13% in a month, I believe these are less likely to happen, and we know certainly not guaranteed.  If they do happen, that's just a happy bonus.  My decision is based on whether it will diversify my investments into a productive venture, is the project likely to succeed in the stated plan.  Secondarily, i look to see whether it's better or worse than some other investments I could make, while realizing this is difficult to project.  The spreadsheet I'm linking looks at the cost of BTC today and potential prices in 3 years.  It also makes various assumptions, because assumptions are all I can go on.  I know how many MIO have been bought, but I don't know the amount of fiat this equates to (or will equate to when they need to purchase hardware), I'm guessing on a number I think the ICO might raise by the end (May 14).  You're welcome to change any of the assumptions I made in the spreadsheet in your own downloaded copy.    Assumptions: $6M USD raised in ICO 35% of whatever money is available for build-out goes to infrastructure (source: Whitepaper, livestream question) Electricity cost is not part of the 4 - 5% maintenance cost (source: common sense, this bitcointalk thread) The 23% reinvestment is able to only keep pace with difficulty.  Note: This is a conservative estimate compared to the whitepaper, which sees an increasing BTC production over time.  I'm hopeful that this happens, but I didn't want to require it to base my decision on.  I think the 23% reinvestment rate is a great idea and should be the key to long term success, but again, very conservative approach assuming Miner One can't gain against difficulty. Not accounting for any change in ETH because it makes projections too difficult.  Even though payments are in ETH, I'm imagining the payout in BTC. Not accounting for: Changes in electricity cost or block reward halving (est. 31May2020)  As you can see, if BTC stays at $6750, it's better for me to buy BTC at this point than invest in MinerOne given my conservative assumptions.  However, if you think BTC will be at $6750 in three years, I guess you wouldn't invest in it anyway.  If BTC rises modestly to $11,000 - where we were 24 days ago - I will have more BTC at the end of three years than I could purchase today.  If BTC rises to $50,000 in three years, I'd have 30% more BTC then than I could buy now.    Because of these very conservative estimates (pessimistic in fact), I have made the decision to invest myself.  My expectation is that the team will be able to beat my numbers, at least modestly and perhaps substantially.  Context: I've bought and currently run mining at home (not BTC), more equipment will be going to co-location in a few months, I've purchased a BTC mining contract at Genesis Mining which is still active.  I like the idea of diversifying into a more transparent project where the founders and the supporters interests are aligned.  I believe the team is able to execute creating and running a data center, which is largely what a mining farm is.  I think the distribution of tokens is fairly equitable (82% to the public purchasers).  As stated above, I also think the 23% reinvestment fund is key to success, and keeping a company reserve makes sense also, though hopefully we never have to use it.  I do wish they had immediately converted their ETH to fiat, as other projects I've been involved with did.  If you have near-term expenses in fiat denominated prices, it doesn't make sense to hold crypto for a long time.  They said they didn't want to time the market, so they didn't sell, but now they're considering delaying purchase of the equipment.  How is that not also timing the market?  The best thing would have been to get out of the market once you got the payment.  Of course I agree that getting out now would also be a terrible idea - yes I realize I'm advocating market timing haha.  Spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VD-G1n5PZj1_d3SQfsyvqyw4BbDTHLn2_gmGzVgYQJY/edit?usp=sharing  If anyone sees any glaring mistakes in my calculations, please let me know.  We can debate the assumptions, but everyone is likely to have their own assumptions.  If you have a strong argument for why any of my assumptions are poorly made, feel free to discuss.

This format is not conducive to extensive conversations like the one CryptoSuperPanda appears to be seeking. Of course, you can also check our FAQs for answers to many of these questions.  https://minerone.io/faq/  Here are answers, in brief:  1) Tokens give share in profits. So I need to know in details all info on the costs.  1.1) What is your estimation of other costs per KW/h apart from electricity (like salary, Internet, repairs, rent)? Economies of scale mean the answer to this question depends on the final size of the facility, which, in turn, depends on outcome of the Crowdsale. As we have said in the White Paper, we anticipate not more than 4-5% of output.  1.2) What taxes (e.g. income tax) and at what rates will be paid? We have Grant Thornton advising us on this question to ensure full compliance with Swedish and UAE tax laws. For an overview of Swedish taxes, please refer to this document: https://www.business-sweden.se/contentassets/ed79d90e6aa84f0cbd4ac281ac5aa460/7.-corporate-taxes-in-sweden.pdf .   Profit and income tax in Ras al-Khaimah is 0%.  1.3) How can we be sure that you will not knowingly increase costs (salary for example) to make profits zero and legally not pay anything to token holders? We have made a commitment to MIO Token Holders to do our best to operate profitably. We are interested, above all, in the success of this project and in fulfilling our commitments.  2) You plan to build data center in Lulea, Sweden  2.1) What is legal status of cryptocurrency mining in Sweden? Is it allowed? What taxes are applicable? Yes, it is allowed. A mining centre is one form of a data centre. Data centre income is taxed just like the income of any other company.  2.2) Which company produces electricity in Lulea? Do you have an agreement with electricity producer for electricity supply? What power is reserved for you? Can you please provide contract or an agreement of intent? We have arranged with Luleå Energi for 15MW, for starters. Please see this article for all of the details: https://medium.com/@minerone.io/miner-one-moves-forward-in-sweden-d94b0c9bf2ba  2.3) You state that the price of electricity is EUR 0.065 per KW/h. Please provide support for this price. Is it stated in the contract? This is public information.  2.4) Where exactly in Lulea do you plan to build the data center? Do you have permission from the municipality to build data center in the selected area? The lease for the building has already been signed. The municipality and regional development agency ""Node Pole"" are the ones who invited us, so they are supporting us fully. Please refer to the above article for additional info.  2.5) What happens if you raise all $200 mln on ICO? Will there be sufficient electricity power and area to build such huge data center? Yes, if not at the current location, then there are other locations on our shortlist.   3) You plan to buy Ebang Ebit Miner E10 We have not made that decision yet.  3.1) Do you have contract or an agreement of intent with Ebang? In case of success you will have to buy great amount of ASICs. How can you be sure that you will be able to buy ASICs in large amount? We visited Ebang as well as Canaan and Bitmain. All three assured us the miners are available that we need in the amounts we need.  3.2) You state that you will buy Ebang Ebit Miner E10 at lower than retail price and with no shipping and customs costs. Can you please provide support for this statements? Offers are already on the table. Once we place the first order, we will be able to provide documentation.  4) You plan to list tokens on exchange mid April  4.1) Do you have an agreement with any exchange? MIO Tokens are ERC20-compatible, which means they can be traded peer-to-peer. We do not currently have an agreement with any exchanges. The MIO Token is not intended for speculation.  4.2) Your token is defenetly a security token. How are you going to overcome this fact in order to be listed on exchange? Envion is a very similar project and its tokens have been listed by hitBTC",False

Say, today’s rate of ETH is just half of what it was two months ago. This reduces the number of miners we can actually buy at the end of ICO if the price remains the same. The entire project may even fail for usual business or regulatory reasons.  If it will be unprofitable to mine bitcoin we will use 23% of output assigned for upgrades to switch to another cryptocurrency. And according to our plans, we are not going to interrupt mining process and as a result payouts. So, you can see, in that case, that we are following the idea of the profitable mining and would try to find the solution in any case.  There are certainly risks and they should not be underestimated. Future prices and exchange rates of cryptocurrencies are impossible to predict, as is mining difficulty, the evolution of legal regulations, future price of electricity, hardware, and other factors. We will do everything we can to mitigate these risks, but there is no way anyone can eliminate them. That is why our general advice is not to risk more than you can afford to lose. On the other hand, if we succeed, the gains could be double- or even triple-digit, it is may be announced due to our calculations.",False

If you simply buy bitcoin, your profit or loss depends on whether bitcoin goes up or down. If you mine bitcoin, whether it’s worth 12,000 or 20,000, you still have more than what you started with. So, let’s say you put 14,000 into bitcoin and over the next year it drops to 12,000, then rises to 17,000, then drops back to 13,000. In the end you’ve lost 1,000. If, on the other hand, you put the same 14,000 into Miner One, this amount after one year can generate bitcoin worth up to 4,000 (depending on exchange rate, difficulty, etc.), which means you have a gain and not a loss. This is the Miner One Cushion Effect.",False

We have secured access to the lowest electricity rates in Europe at our location in Luleå, Sweden. What’s more, Miner One buys hardware at wholesale prices, whereas mining pool participants usually pay standard retail prices. Finally, there’s downtime when equipment or connections fail. This adds to the inefficiency of mining pools, whereas Miner One will have expert technicians on the job 24/7, making sure your investment yields maximum returns. And all you need to start mining with Miner One is 0.1 ETH (less than USD 100). Whereas to be in a pool you need equipment that costs at least USD 1,500. To join and benefit from the Miner One Community, you don’t need any technical knowledge of mining at all and you don’t need to buy any equipment.

Sorry for our recent silence. It’s been an incredibly eventful month at Miner One as we gear up for our February 15 ICO.  Our pre-ICO was a resounding success. All 330,000 MIO Tokens assigned. In fact, the pre-ICO was oversubscribed, with requests for nearly 600,000 MIO Tokens at the special rate we were offering. We couldn’t fully meet the demand, so we have just announced a pricing schedule for MIO Tokens for the ICO with “Early Bird” deals of up to 35% off.  In other news: we finalised a multi-million-dollar partnership with TokenDesk, inked a deal to set up the first Miner One Mining Centre in a 4000m2+ facility in Luleå, Sweden (where we will have the best electricity rates in Europe and a climate that keeps equipment cool at low cost). Given the enthusiasm and new investments we’ve attracted, we decided to raise our hard cap from USD 50m to USD 200m (in ETH equivalent). If we hit that upper target, Miner One will become the World’s Biggest Crowdfunded Crypto Mining Operation and we will have incredible leverage to negotiate great deals on behalf of the Miner One Community to maximize the output we distribute.  As we ramp up our communications campaign in advance of the February 15 ICO, we promise to be more active here with updates and answers to any questions you may have. Information about the Bounty Program is coming shortly - frankly, we were overwhelmed by the response to our pre-ICO. But we have now engaged the help of a reliable partner to help us develop and implement the Bounty Program, as well as additional team members who will help answer questions. Information on that Bounty Program is coming very soon!  Meanwhile, please check out our updated White Paper and official website at minerone.io.  We think you’ll like what you see!
