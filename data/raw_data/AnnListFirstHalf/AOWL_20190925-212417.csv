The altowl project is not meant to be another exchange. As crypto coin holders we create a lot of accounts in different exchanges, our purpose is to handle most of the major exchanges through the desktop app. This can be done through the usage of the api keys created by each individual through their account in exchanges. The API keys usage is entirely different from other similar online services because in our platform is strictly client side. We do not have access to your api keys. In the future we will add major wallets and exchange services through sapeshift or changely. In order to use the desktop app no AOWL coins are needed just add your api keys in manage account section.  A major upgrade will be the Social Trading section. Investors will be able to publish their exchange's data and followers will use the AOWL tokens to follow.  Thank you all for your great comments and your support. Please invest in the token sale in order this project to continue the on going development with the purpose of being established in the crypto market.  More sections will be added as our main advisor is trying to design econometrics models to predict the future of altcoins.  Greetings and wishes for a happy new year The altOWL team.  ",False

Watch all your investments on different major exchanges through a single trading view page and exchange btc and alts using the trading mode. Watch analytical information regarding your investments. Use our forum to publish your opinion and discuss with other altOWL project users. Our intention for the future is to enhance the power of the altOWL Project with even more features, like: - Adding more exchanges such as Cryptopia to our project. - Adding social trading with the meaning of publishing and following investing data such as the ROI and the composition of the portfolio of users. - Creating fully functional IOS and android apps of The altOWL Project. - Creating a kind of exchange for altcoin,btc,and eth tokens.  Currently our team has developed an Alpha version of The altOWL Project with functional versions  for OSX, windows, Linux and android.  We want to keep our project in stealth mode for a while but our advisors pushed us to speed up the expansion of our users database, so  we decided to go public with two goals at the same time. The first one is to create a strong users database and the second one is to make a two months token sale of the AOWL token. We have created 100,000,000 AOWL tokens. The 20,000,000 are reserved for the future development of The altOWL Project. The 80,000,000 will be available for distribution through the token sale period of two months. After the end of the AOWL token sale period the unsold part of the 80,000,000 (available for distribution) will be destroyed and the biggest part of our Project code will be open source. The altOWL token will be immediately exchangeable through etherDelta exchange and in the near future will be exchangeable through the altOWL desktop application. If 30,000,000 AOWL tokens are sold, the first mile stone will be reached and we will proceed in adding AOWL in the Cryptopia exchange. The token sale period will be divided in 4 phases. During the 1st phase which will last 2 weeks each altOWL token will cost 0.00007 ETH. During the 2nd phase which will last 2 weeks each altOWL token will cost 0.0001 ETH.

Our project is not a wallet neither a decentralized exchange..  We intend to be for the crypto world what bloomberg platform is for the forex world..  For the future implementation of the exchange as our team has decided will there are independent companies to make the crypto exchange through your wallets.. This could be made through several ways but will know in the future..  Thank you for your feedback,False
