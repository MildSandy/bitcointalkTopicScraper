At the moment construction and other works are completed, approvals received, equipment and all required materials are purchased.     Administration. Authorities at all levels support the project. The project was approved by the Chelyabinsk region administration and Magnitogorsk city hall. ZrCoin project was adopted into strategic projects of Chelyabinsk region development and patronized by the Ministry of economic development.     Product. We are going to produce products from all kinds of bacor scrap. Our technology is environmentally friendly and waste-free, the waste is the distilled water which shall  be re-used in the production cycle. As a result, the facility will produce a concentrate of zirconium oxide or bacor concentrate and SFM (slag-forming mixture). Zirconium oxide concentrate is used in refractory, metallurgical, paint and varnish industries. Bacor concentrate can also be used to produce zirconium. SFM is used in the metallurgical industry.     Raw products. During the construction period our scientists managed to improve the technology that led to a change in technology without the increase in the cost of equipment. The technology has become universal. Now in addition to glass-making bacor concentrate we can use as raw material any bacor scrap. This allows us to diversify the raw materials market.     Land. Tender for the land was held and we had won it. All the documents on the title to the use of land are collected.     Project. Design of the project is ready. The project documentation in the stages of engineering and working construction documents is completed. The general lay-out is approved. The address of the site is registered. The  building permit has been obtained.     Equipment for machine workshop. Equipment was manufactured according to our technical drawings with modifications by our technical experts. The innovative equipment is manufactured by the Russian manufacturer and has no analogues in the world which eliminates the risks associated with sanctions in the process of equipment maintenance. We store this equipment is in our warehouse.     Equipment for chemical workshop. Equipment was manufactured according to our technical drawings with modifications that allow to reduce the quantity of chemical reagents and make the process environmentally safe. We store this equipment is in our warehouse.     Crane beams. Made, are in the warehouse, ready for installation.     Consumers and suppliers. Preliminary negotiations with key clients of products were held.  The samples of the products were presented for analysis and examination and assessment to the clients, representing various industries (refractory materials, glass, paint). Respectively, the volume of pre-orders exceeds the production capacity by more than 2 times.     Construction work:     Fence. The fence is fabricated and installed, the main and backup drive-is units with gates are set up. The fence consists of two parts. At the  back side of the road the fence is solid, and on the facade  a 3-d fence for aesthetic appearance was installed.     Boiler plant. The modular gas boiler plant equipped with two Buderus gas boilers of 700 KW power is developed and manufactured.     Earthwork. Development and excavation of soil is made. The site is backfilled with incompressible soil (rock). Roads on the territory of the site are designed, filled out and rammed. All fire - protection measures on the perimeter of the territory of the plant are carried out.     Electricity. All projected works related to connection and transfer of power lines are completed. The factory had been granted approval for 2 MW by power supplier. two transformer substations, main and reserve, are installed.     Gas. The gas supply project was developed. The works on gas connection have been approved and completed.   Water and Sewerage. Technical specifications and points of connection to water supply and sewerage are approved. Backup water supply for fire extinguishing system is approved.     Foundation. The FM supporting foundations have been installed for all workshops (some foundations weighing more than 15 tons and a height of more than 2.5 meters) as well as FBS mounting foundations  and FBS beams (basement level).     Metal works. The metal structures are designed and manufactured in accordance with our project. Installation is in progress.     Sandwich panel. Sandwich panels consist of two main parts (classic) and  polycarbonate (innovative). All sandwich panels are made, delivered and in store on the territory of factory and in the warehouse. We decided to use polycarbonate sandwich panel to fill the light openings. This is an innovative solution for industrial facilities. The panel passes light into the workshop in the daytime and at night will produce the effect of ""Northern lights"" with the application of special lighting.     Roof. Roofing panels are made and delivered to the site, ready for installation.     Buildings. Three large workshops are being built. These will be located in a cascade, the maximum height is 18 meters, the area of workshops is more than 2000 sq.m.     Office and Amenity Building. During the design process our chief architect made a proposal to merge the checkpoint with the ABC (administrative complex). In accordance with his idea there will be built a single 2-storey building with a total area of more than 900m2. The ground floor will accomodate facilities for household needs, a recreation room and security room, the first floor will be used for  administrative office. The building will be erected in a modern style with the use of advanced architectural technologies.  To date the ZrCoin project is 80% complete. Small delays are due primarily to the fact that we had to make amendments to the project with regard to increase in production line output, difficulties with construction companies and the specifics of the region where we are building the plant. In addition, in the course of the project implementation we have improved the processing technology and made changes to our own developed mechanical and chemical equipment. Initially, the project was supposed to process only refractory scrap from glass furnaces. Now the technology enables to process any bacor scrap both of glassmaking and metallurgy, as well as natural raw. The technology has become universal and the products we get have become more versatile. For example, now in addition to synthetic zirconium oxide concentrate we can also produce bacoric concentrate which diversifies the sources of raw materials and reduces the risks.  The planned yield is 5.5% per month and the terms of redemption remain unchanged.",False

It ""bets"" or hedges against the future value of eth and btc (and allows us the buyer to do the same) at the time of the ico by saying it will buyback at $X over a period of time, effectively keeping the price down/steady while the eth and btc they collect (and supposing some are saved for future use) they would've made more than enough to buy back at the most expensive buyback price.  Second, all the talk of crypto having no intrinsic value has reminded me of zrcoin which is effectively backed by zirconium oxide which is unique and has the potential to be replicated, in a sense.

What you are doing by buying this , is investing in a long term 2-5 years project. Equity investments proposed by bankers are often long term project. We cannot expect to see return next year (although the communication bit can be helpful, what if the team is behind and had nothing to share), nor expect to see guaranties that this will work (no one knows) Even Lehman Brothers collapsed ? Basically this project exposes you to loose your funds as we are away from the first revenues we have no idea how it will work, neither the owner can confirm it. You risk to loose and don't risk on it all your savings for sure, just what you can afford to loose and then forget about it for a couple of years. * I believe in Russia things can be very slow at the beginning (tenders, gov approvals...) but then can turn very successful - see the current Russian billionaires . They bought the big industries backs in 90s for pennies . Back then no one from EU/US or China thought to invest in Russia but in 10 years time the shares of those initially collapsed companies, jumped to the sky.",False

I wasn't expecting much but I did get a very satisfactory response about a week and a half later. Someone is on the other end, but maybe they are busy.  I suspect that building a factory or two is a pretty big deal and it takes a lot of manpower to get up an running. From reading the whitepaper I got the impression that the factory(s) were the primary importance here, not promotion of the coin. We bought into this with the understanding that we were being promised a $2.80 return at the end of the term. I'm going to start worrying if they don't start paying out then.  In the meantime, you'll also have read in the whitepaper that redemption of coins is also the only way to obtain stock in the company. I ended up buying a bunch of coins at less than the ICO price on the market, so now I have that option. It's actually in the ZrCoin team's best interest to keep prices low and buy them back at the face value, because then fewer people will collect the minimum 358 coins it takes to buy stock (and they won't have to give up equity). Remember, these are not only options to buy synthetic zirconium, but options to buy company shares. I suspect that we're going to see a large rise in coin value once the music stops and equity investors attempt to pick up enough coins to grab shares in the company.  Anyways, this isn't your traditional ICO investment, they aren't trying to promote a platform or encourage adoption, they wanted to fund a factory and they did it by selling options on the end product of their manufacture. It would be nice to hear about the progress they are making to that goal, but honestly I don't think that was ever part of the deal.",False

What will be done with the additional money? - It was mentionned several times that early contributers would be (partially) compensated or would get an additional bonus. Any update on this? - Any updates on the start of the project (land purchase, ordering of equipment, start of the construction, ...)? - Looking at the current troubles of Encryptotel with the Blockswap technology.

I think this is the future of exchange trade: options contracts for raw materials and other products on the blockchain. Each investor is provided with an option. The investment is made in the form of funds loaned to the Russian company by a foreign fund, and the investor becomes a shareholder in the Russian company. The loan is used to get the invested funds back and to gain investment income. That is why all assets are encumbered, meaning the equipment, etc. Therefore, every owner of the digital token is safe.

We’re over halfway now, and are keen to keep up momentum to reach our target. If you’ve wondered about investing but haven’t yet taken the final step, please do get in touch via our Slack and we’ll be happy to answer any questions you have.  It’s also worth noting that, with BTC and many alts at historic highs, there’s the opportunity to get into a project that will not only preserve value by design, but that also offers a solid ROI. Your funds are accounted at dollar-equivalent prices at the time of deposit, so investing in ZrCoin is a good way to book some crypto profits and hedge your portfolio.  Company shares One of the questions we’ve been asked a number of times is how the future swap of ZrCoin tokens for company shares will operate. We’d like to say a little more about this now. There is, of course, no onus on investors to swap their ZrCoin for shares. As a blockchain token, ZrCoin can be held, transferred and traded freely on Waves. We imagine that many investors from the crypto world will do just that, opting to sell their tokens during one of the coming buybacks that will ensure they see ROI. At this point, having sold their tokens, they will have exited their investment (at profit) and can use the funds for whatever they want.  However, we wanted to offer our investors more than this. We appreciate the opportunity you are giving us to launch a totally new and environmentally-friendly manufacturing process. So, for those crowdsale investors who are interested and who are willing to go through the necessary identity verification processes, we are making available shares in our company. 49% of the company will be available to swap for ZrCoins, via the Cyprus Foundation that is dealing with our finances. The percentage of our company that is ultimately owned by our crowdsale investors will depend on how many decide to redeem their ZrCoin for shares, rather than sell them in the buybacks.  In due course, when we know more about our funding, we’ll publish exact figures. But we hope you will see that this offers an attractive opportunity to ‘roll over’ your investment in ZrCoin, giving you the chance to own a piece of a unique revenue-generating company that will, we believe, be at the forefront of a green manufacturing revolution.  Thank you once again for your support! For more information or to register for the crowdsale, please visit www.ZrCoin.io.",False

People around the world are investing in various start-ups, handicrafts using 3D printing or developing potentially interesting, but most often useless products. In the wake of the popularity of collective financing, for example, a company like Pebble was created, which was able to organize and start its own industrial production of smart watches. But Pebble - an exception to the general practice: in the minds of the masses crowdfunding has long been a semi-entertaining instrument through which it is possible to pre-order some trinket invented by another inventor. So people collected hundreds of thousands of dollars for hand flamethrowers, beer dispensers, quadrocopters and other toys for adults. Only a few successful projects were able to go into mass production: most often people who got involved in the next initiative either received a raw, somehow created product, or watched their money dissolve into the night together with the authors of the project.  On the other hand, in parallel with crowdfunding on head lifted technology blockade, the excitement around bitcoin in 2012-2013 can be compared to the next Gold Rush, when sellers of ""kicks"" -video cards earned more than ""prospectors"" themselves.  Back in 2011, 1 BTC was worth about $ 30, but already in 2013, the Cryptocurrency became rapidly rising. By November 2013, its value has increased more than 20 times and reached $ 700 per coin, and on November 17 it set a record of $ 1242 per 1 BTC. After that, the bitcoin course began to fever, he fell several times, but in 2016 bitcoin resumed its growth and again broke the mark first $ 1000, and then - $ 2000. Experts believe that, after an agiotage four years ago, a reassessment of bitcoins occurred. Out of the exclusively speculative and shadowed tool of darknet, investors saw a promising means of payment in the main cryptocurrency, and the development of the blocking technology itself, on which crypto currencies are based, and attention to it from such giants as Microsoft, only strengthened the view that it has a future.  Both of these phenomena - crypto-currencies and block-banking - existed in the world parallel to the real sector of the economy: on the territory of gadgets and in cyber space. To argue about providing bitcoin and other crypto-currencies solely at the cost of their extraction and demand for themselves and at all can be for hours, but I'm not here for this. I want to ask a question: did you ever wonder why industrial production is the lot of giants or the state? After all, it is to this sphere, on whose shoulders the rest of the world stands, for an ordinary man the doors are open only as a wage worker.  How was the idea of placing on the ICO born?  The very idea of raising money through the ICO was born by chance. With Andrei Nikonorov, my friend and project partner, we have known each other for a long time. Often crossed in one of the Moscow cigar clubs. Just at one of these meetings at the club, we discussed who is working on what, and realized that we can be useful to each other. Andrey specializes in consulting in the field of the use of blocking technology. And I was just looking for the possibility of starting the production of zirconia by the technology I have. I did not want to attract venture investors because of the prospect of losing control over the business. The option of raising money through crowdfunding or ICO, which Said Andrew, seemed to me very promising.  Zirconium dioxide is a raw material popular in modern industry, which is used in the production of refractory materials, in metallurgy, glass, ceramics and nuclear industry. For example, due to its refractory properties (melting point 2715 ° C), ZrO2 is used in the construction of nuclear reactors. Pure zirconium melts at a temperature of 1855 ° C, that is, the polymer has almost twice the best refractory properties than pure metal. For comparison, the melting temperature of tungsten is 3422 ° C, molybdenum - 2623 ° C, niobium - 2477 ° C. But in order to meet the needs of modern industry in refractory materials, synthetic polymers are needed - refractory metals do not trite at all. They also do not have the necessary mechanical and chemical properties.  This raw material has been used successfully in industry for a long time. However, for its production, the sand extracted from the bowels with the content of metals is used. Then it is subjected to multiple expensive processing, which yields the finished product at the output. Our technology offers to abandon the extraction of sand and independently synthesize the product with the content of zircon (ZrSiO4) and simple zirconium oxide - ZrO2. The purity of the final product ranges from 66% to 75%. At the same time, the material obtained is not subject to phase transitions, which increases its chemical resistance by a factor of 2.5-3 compared with the currently available zirconia.  In order to open a conditional candle factory worth $ 1 million, you need exactly this amount. No other way. In industry in general, everything is simple: in the evening money - in the morning chairs. Nobody will build a shop for you or ship expensive equipment in debt, even if you turn sand into gold. In the modern world, there are several standard ways to raise funds, except for investing your own: take a loan from a bank or find an investor. And each of them has its pros and cons.  Banks do not claim your business, but give large loans only on the security of assets, and in Russian realities, the market value of these assets should double the amount of the loan without taking into account interest. On the other hand, there are investors, business angels - they are called differently. But in order to ""repulse"" their investments, including in previously failed projects, they demand from 50 to, as in our case, 80% of the share in business, in fact, hiring you as a manager.  There is another, less obvious option: to go for money to those who are interested in your products. However, other participants in the production chain will buy your technology or offer their own sites rather than give money to create an indirect, and in the future, direct competitor.  We went through all the above steps, with the amendment that we want to open a non-candle factory, but a plant for the production of a synthetic concentrate of zirconia (ZrO2). In our case, we are talking about the required amount of at least $ 3.5 million, which we could not get in the bank, since we do not have a decent collateral. Investors also demanded at least 80% of the share after the launch of the project, that is, they wanted to take away our business. We also received proposals from other sector players to move to, for example, Germany and start production of ZrO2 there, at their capacities. True, this option also meant the transfer of our technology, which is the main value.  The standard ways of seeking funding were either unavailable to us, or meant a loss of control over our own child. For this reason, we turned our attention to the ICO as a new trend in the area of collective financing.  ICO is a tool for attracting collective investment through the crowdscape model by issuing and selling their own cryptographic tokens (coins). If, in the case of crypto-currencies, they are provided with production costs, demand for themselves, or are tied to the exchange rate of any currency or gold, then for our ZrCoin tokens, the end product is the collateral: one coin is equal to one kilogram of our zirconia .  What exactly do we do?  The first stage is placement on the ICO on the basis of the Waves block-platform. During fundraising, we will offer potential investors to purchase ZrCoin coins at a price ranging from $ 1.40 to $ 1.55 per token. Each coin will be provided with one kilogram of zirconium dioxide ready for sale on the market.  During the ICO, we were able to collect the minimum required amount: now we already have $ 3.7 million at the disposal with a plan of $ 3.5 million. With this money we will build a processing plant in the Chelyabinsk region and purchase equipment for the production line. Since the end of the ICO before the start of production and sales, according to our estimates, it will take 6-8 months. One line will bring in 70 million Russian rubles of real income every month. After the start of sales of zirconia, we will begin to buy the token The risks, of course, are  Like any project, ours is not deprived of risks for potential investors. However, it should be noted that they are all quite standard: a change in the exchange rate, delays in the construction of the shop, overlays with the supply of equipment for the line. Conventionally, it is possible to strike out fluctuations in the exchange rate: they are dangerous for us only if the Russian ruble is strengthened, which is not expected in the coming years.  We are not pioneers in placing tokens on the ICO - before us, this mechanism has been successfully used by many other companies. The most striking example is the placement of Chronobank, which was able to raise $ 5.4 million. Of the projects of the real sector, it is worth mentioning the farm ""Kolionovo"" (more about the news - in the Forbes material), which through the ICO raised about $ 500,000 for development, and another farm A cooperative company called ""Family Capital"". As can be seen from the amount of funds collected, ZrCoin is now the largest ICO, connected with the real sector of the economy.  For the average person, the mechanism of placement through the ICO may not be fully transparent and understandable. First of all, it is necessary to understand that this method is chosen because of near-zero investments for launching, the main expenses are related to the promotion of placement in the information space in order to attract the maximum number of investors.  The latter also carry risks with the lack of regulation of this area: if crowdfunding is subject to at least some control by the state and supervisory authorities, the blockage is the sphere to which the regulators have not yet reached. The safety of investors is guaranteed by the very site at which ICO passes, and the relationship between the investor and the authors outside the site is regulated by the offer contract that is posted on the project site and accepted by the investor at the time of the purchase of the tokens.  In addition to the novelty of the placement mechanism on the ICO, which can alert the investor, the ZrCoin project is the first of its kind. It is about raising funds for the needs of creating real production. Similar experience is only among investors in Kolionovo - but there the owner of the farm needed money to develop his business, which before ICO had successfully existed before, and not to start it from scratch. If we could not collect the necessary $ 3.5 million, then all the money would be returned to investors in full, but we have already managed to reach the target and we are ready to launch production.  Of course, going to the ICO, in case of failure, we risked not only a breakdown in the timing of the launch of the plant. Considerable personal funds of the project's founders were invested in the development of technology (it is about the amount of about $ 1 million), significant sums were spent for the promotion of the project at various sites in search of investors. Agreements with suppliers of equipment and raw materials for production would also be frustrated, since we preferred to conduct full training on all fronts. The failure of the ICO would entail a significant loss of time and money, but still not comparable to the loss of control over technology, if we immediately attracted classical investments.  It works  With all the advantages, disadvantages and risks, ICO has proved to be a real tool for raising funds for serious projects. ICO's big brother, crowdfunding, is perceived by society as something entertaining, for enthusiasts. The community of the world of detachment has shown that it is ready to treat with full seriousness both the technology itself and projects that are ready to develop with its help. Undoubtedly, this attitude of the public and the trust that was given to us is encouraging. Previously, no project that was located on the ICO, had no relation to the real sector of the economy, and even more so to the processing and chemical industries.",False

Look at Zrcoin Cofounder, suspicious old guy with connections to goverment who really dont have any experience in coding, no cryptography experience or any developer experience, never had involvements in any crypto/blockchain tech/company or researching projects or any industrial companies. Other thing that is strange that Russian news never writed about bitcoins but now they were igniting this that Russians are involved in crypto projects and have launched in short time huge wave of Cryptocurrency projects like leading projects in financial, business and banking industry etc. So i could quess with current state in the world many of those icos that been launched from Russia are launched and controlled by Russian Goverment.

Quote We have unique technology and want blockchain going to real field and production. Quote http://bitcoinchaser.com/zrcoin Why Set ZrCoin up as an ICO? BC: An ICO takes a considerable amount of time to set up. Why do you think you would be better off launching ZrCoin than investing the time you invested in preparing the ICO in getting a bank to finance the project? ZC: Our project is a venture fund. No, you are a venture fund and your main goal - to fund the money, buyback your color tokens by converted price and achieve your profit from price rising of cryptocurrencies.    All your shitty optimism about running a plant in half of year is a fiction. Not in Russia. Every government control division have a ""control time"" to check your documents and to react, to check your plant, to check your personnel and your company. This control time starts from 2 weeks for very simple procedures and can continuous in month and years for big projects. It called ""russian bureaucracy"". Your company have a status of Limited Liability Company with the capital 78800 RUR (about 1400 dollars in current prices). Not serious.  My main claim about your project: you promise unrealistic time for project implementation of zirconium manufacturing. But your motivation is very clear for me: you are the venture fund and now you want the money in general, zirconium dioxide is your protection screen. You will say again and again: read our docs and give us the money. But your docs are full of water and there is no ecological assessment in public. This is undertalking of serious details.

How ZrCoin team will buy the facilities and equipment for factory? It will be sold in fiat, not in crypto. Show me equipment manufacturers that will sell you their valuable products in crypto. There is two ways: a. You already have a bank credit for 3.5m dollars and you need an ICO to put crypto on cold wallets and use it when price rises; b. You need to exchange cryptocurrencies to fiat and buy equipment for real dollars/euros/rubles. In case of rubles, this is a crime in Russia: exchange crypto to fiat. UPD:   Yes, you will implement money-laundering plan: your company will have a loan with offshore company and have to return the money out of the border. I think Elvira Saphidzadovna needs to know about your team. Why do you need an ICO if you have an agreement with ""Cyprus-based holding company"" (CBHC) about a loan? Or may it be you want to take a gift for CBHC giving them all profits of future price rising of cryptocurrencies? This is brilliant-price loan, why you haven't tried to take a bank loan in Sberbank or VTB Group with average interest?  2.  As there is a lack of domestic zirconium-containing raw materials (zircon and zirconium dioxide), brazilite-corundum refractories for glass manufacturing enterprises are chiefly imported from abroad. Russia’s domestic manufacture covers only 8-10% of the demand in zirconiumcontaining raw materials. Kovdorskiy GOK (Ore Mining and Processing Plant) is the only enterprise in Russia to produce zirconium raw materials (brazilite powder), with production output of 5-6 tons per year. The majority of this amount is exported to Norway, Japan and other countries. Zirconium concentrate, which is one of the scarcest mineral raw materials, is not produced in Russia, but is imported from Ukraine and Australia. You told about high-valuable technology for Russia's independency and technological security and hadn't taken a loan in Russia?  3. You told about the high-valuable markets for your product. Do you have any contracts on paper with your future customers? 4. From your roadmap: Hiring and official employment of staff (1 month) - whoaaaa you all are funny guys, serious. You want to build a facility in a half of year and hire staff for a month   . I think your team doesn't have any knowledge about how real factories functioning. Execution of necessary authorizations - 1 months. In Russia. Authorize a facility in Russia for one month - yes, this is real if you are hand-on with mr.Putin. Average time of Rostekhnadzor authorizations is about a half of a year. There is only way: BRIBE. May the bribe be in crypto?   Do not tell russian corrupt officials. And another question about facility development: whether there were any public hearings about this facility? Did the citizens of Magnitogorsk agreed this project? 5. Your site uses very sexy web-development technologies and the terrible photoshop of the photos of your team. 5th grader schoolguy from Magnitogorsk can do it better. You told about million dollars but you can't do the job for 100 dollars. 6. The price from your papers: 46 000 RUR per ton of powder (it's about 810 dollars). https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/zirconium-dioxide-price-zirconium-dioxide-powder_60416510429.html These guys trades for $5000-8500 per ton.   My opinion about the project: 1. In case of real technology: it will started in YEARS, not the months. 2. ICO needed to ""take money to the bank"" and you will just wait for price rising. 3. In next 1.5 years there will be next scenario: we are very sorry, guys, the government had broken our business. There are your color tokens by market price.  P.S. when one ""breakthrough"" tech (artificial zirconium dioxide) meets another ""breakthrough"" tech (cryptocurrencies & blockchains) the risks multiply. There are no regulations of cryptocurrencies in Russia and the ICO investments look like gifts.",False

From some point you are right, but from another you make horrible mistakes.  Let's have a look step by step. I ll tryto explain. And please let me ignore all your ""your photoshop is not good enough"" and ""your website is not nice""... This is just not serious and our designer is desired by lots of campaigns after this website and we had so many positive words, so your notes are just not visible. What is concerned more serious questions.  1. This scheme is absolutely legal. Why do you need an ICO if you have an agreement with ""Cyprus-based holding company"" (CBHC) about a loan? This is not a loan. This is a way of legal using of cryptocurrencies.  2. You again talk about loan. Please, read FAQ from our website why we decided to use ICO way.  3. We have agreements for sure, but as we don't have the real plant now we can not have real papers with agreements.  4. This question is especially awsome. Did the citizens of Magnitogorsk agreed this project? It's green technology. No wastes. No any harm. It's not required any special agreements with citizens or with somebody else. And yes, it's possible to make a plant during 6-7 months. It'll be typical project, nothing spectacular.  5. I ve told at the beginning.  6. It's another material with another quality. There lots of modification. Please, don't think, you are the smartest person on Earth and others don't understand anything or scammers. Please, read more detailed our White paper and documents.  Look at our team and escrows.  We have unique technology and want blockchain going to real field and production. There is no regulation in Russia and it has more advantages than disadvantages.

ZrCoin is based on a new manufacturing process for zirconium dioxide (ZrO2), a material used in various industrial applications due to its resilience to high temperatures and pressures. Most of the zirconium employed in ceramics plants and the nuclear industry, amongst other uses, is mined from the ground. This has a significant environmental impact. ZrCoin’s team of scientists has developed a way to recover ZrO2 from waste materials from these industries. The result costs less, is of higher quality, and is more environmentally friendly.  Zirconium is a highly in-demand material used as a refractory — it is very durable at high temperatures and pressures, which makes it ideal for use in glass-making and other such applications. Usually, the zirconium used for firebricks in kilns is extracted from the earth, at a high financial and environmental cost. These bricks are periodically replaced because they degrade under the extreme conditions to which they are subjected. Our process recovers ZrO2 from these industrial wastes, and the end result is a product that has superior properties and greater cost benefits than the natural alternative.  The main products of the future plant are as follows: zirconium concentrate (powder) with ZrO2 contents of with at least 65% (base product) plus Hf 2.5–3% with the maximum content of alkaline earth metals of 1.5%, and synthetic mold powder (MP). The manufacturing process uses dry concentration and separation of materials, including selective grinding techniques, dry magnetic and gravity separation.’ The resulting product is superior to the current market standard.  Our researchers have been searching for ways to extract widely-used synthetic zirconium dioxide for more than three years. After extensive research they have developed a technology that allows the synthesis of zirconium dioxide concentrate, in which zircon and brazilite are entirely stable and are not susceptible to phase transitions (increasing the chemical stability of the generated products by 2.5-3 times), and with corundum Al2O3 present, which increases the concentrate’s stability. ZrCoin is built on new green technologies, developed by industrial experts, that will enable us to recover zirconium dioxide from the wastes produced by ceramics manufacturers. The result will be more energy efficient, cleaner and of higher quality than the alternative — extracting it from natural resources.  If you had facts to your scam alert we could have seen this as a challenge, but unfortunately for you these are baseless accusations.  All the information on ZrCoin is out there for any body to verify. Even Russian Television NTV was at Waves Platform headquarters on 5th May, ZrCoin team told about our business-case and helped to prepare a story about cryptocurrencies and opportunities for attracting investments through ICO. We will share the link when the program ""Business Morning"" which will tell the first examples of using the platform by companies of the real economical sector. is aired.

This would basically answer my questions like that:  1. ZrCoin is crowdfunding investment for the construction of a facility that will manufacture synthetic zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) 2. If you invest now, you can buy the tokens for around 1.40$. After going to production, you are able to sell it for around 2.80¼ 3. It is an in-deman refractory material, especially in the manufacture of ceramics (prothesis) and nuclear reactors. 4. Because if banks give out loans, they would need a majority of stakes. Besides that, the creators want to leverage technological and industrial innovations. 5. After 8 months, the tokes can be traded on exchange sites. 6. If more money is raised, more plants will be build. I assume this also happens with profit after the funding phase.  Question: I read in the article that token's price is tied to the market rate of ZrO2. That would mean, if the market rate increases until 5$, so would the tokens. Please correct me if I understood anything wrong.  -nytro",False

The specified specialist Vladimir Alekseevich Perepelitsyn (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0 % B8% D1% 86% D1% 8B% D0% BD,% D0% 92% D0% BB% D0% B0% D0% B4% D0% B8% D0% BC% D0% B8% D1% 80_% D0 % 90% D0% BB% D0% B5% D0% BA% D1% 81% D0% B5% D0% B5% D0% B2% D0% B8% D1% 87) has not the slightest relation to the project and does not even know That he is represented as a participant in the project. 6. The purchase of these technologies and / or equipment in the west is impossible due to the dual purpose of this technology, and in connection with sanctions against Russia.  On all the questions I asked the authors of ICO, I did not get a single clear, accurate and truthful answer! Therefore, I think it necessary to warn all users about the high risk of fraud!   Dear potential investors! If you want to invest your money in ZrCoin, I will offer you an option that will reduce your losses by 2 times: the amount you would like to spend (irretrievably) to buy ZrCoin tokens, divide by half, you leave the first half of the money and do not buy ZrCoin. The second half, as gratitude for the advice, you send me to the address specified in my profile! Results: you minimize your losses, I'm happy!",False

The building which ll be built is typical and easy constructed, so there is no special architectural design. It's built in typical ""sandwich"" - panels.  3. It's definetely long term project. And we are going to sell shares for tokens, so price of tokens at that moment can be much higher than *2. More than this we are going to create other projects like this. Our team is group of scientists and people are involved to industrial production for years, and they have some high technology ideas. All these ideas are based on green technologies. Thus, this project it's only the first project of a seria of ""green"" technological projects. This project is not so complicated and amount which we need to raise is not too high.  So we hope, community will support our project!  And we ll bring green technologies to the world and income to our investors.",False

We had a candid conversation with them about the challenges of doing due diligence about Russian teams. Many social media sites that we would normally use to verify information about teams (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Github etc.) are either blocked in Russia or not widely used. In general there is a less open internet in Russia and a less open culture about putting personal information on the internet, compared with the States.  Regardless, we think that more transparency is better when it comes to teams. We’ve strongly encouraged them to provide more information. If any new information comes out, we’ll update this profile accordingly.  Thanks for reading. If you have any other questions or concerns we’d be glad to hear them.

Yes, company is registered in Russia.  1. Benefit for token holders is opportunity to earn. Token ll give profit 5.5% per month. Also token holders ll have opportunity to change them to shares in future. 2. Our token is option. You can read here https://medium.com/zrcoin/the-uses-of-zrcoin-878c7cf5864f  There are three main ways in which ZrCoin might be used in the future: 1) As an option on ZrO2. Because ZrCoin is backed by a real commodity, it is possible to take physical possession of the ZrO2. We expect a number of businesses to do just this. Manufacturers who need zirconium for their factories will buy ZrCoin ahead of time, at a discount — allowing them to acquire zirconium at below market prices. This will prove an attractive choice for forward-thinking businesses who have the money to invest in their future. 2) As an investment in its own right. As a blockchain-based option, ZrCoin will be treated as an investment or speculative instrument by traders. Those who invest at ICO can expect a healthy ROI. Because ZrCoin will trade on secondary markets after the crowdsale, other investors will have access to it and may be able to pick some up at an attractive price. Due to the discount offered and the market price of ZrO2, it is likely that ZrCoin will trade between $1.40 and $2.80. However, the cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile, and how the coin is priced in each currency will depend on its trading pairs and the performance of those currencies against fiat (most notably BTC). 3) As a store of value. Lastly, ZrCoin is backed by a real commodity, and has a theoretical real-world value of $2.80 (depending on market conditions). It should therefore have a relatively stable price, particularly over the longer term. ZrCoin will be a way to hedge against inflation and for traders to use to park value when trading more volatile coins, such as BTC and alts.  3. No dividends for tokens. Buy-back process with 5.5% profit per month. Tokens are not shares. Shares will be available later.  4. -  5. Buy-back process is suppposed to be with 5.5% profit per month. We will start buy-back process in 8 months after ICO. It will be processed in dashboard of our website.  6. Yes, information will be opened and when everything will work in proper way, we ll make audit of the plant and everything will be estimated, checked and we ll be able to sell shares.  We are opened for any questions. Don't hesitate to ask.",False

Our idea is about decentralization and not monopolized world. We would like to give opportunity for usual people to participate in such serious industrial projects.  The decentralisation of the global economy starts here.  By creating an option on the blockchain, backed by production of ZrO2, ZrCoin will make it possible to trade a real commodity in a fully decentralised way. Anyone, anywhere in the world can buy it, so long as they have an internet connection and the ability to deposit funds into the Waves client (using bitcoin via exchanges, or even with a credit card). Moreover, the barriers of scale that exist in the traditional financial system aren’t a problem with the blockchain. There is no minimum purchase, and no flat fee for brokerage. It would be possible to buy a single ZrCoin, or even less, without the associated costs being prohibitive. In the near future, we expect many such financial instruments to arise on the blockchain. People will be able to trade them directly, with complete freedom — any amount of any commodity, trading directly against any other, on Waves’ DEX. Sell 5kg of zirconium for gold. Trade USD for silver-backed tokens. Suddenly it will become possible to create diverse portfolios efficiently, even using ZrCoin and other tokens as forms of commodity money. The future is starting to look very interesting, and we’re glad to be blazing a trail there.

If it would be a scam, it would be too complicated scam. All people from team can be googled and checked.  Also they hope, if this project will be succesfull, they can crowdfund for their other projects. Bigger and more serious.  Actually 3.5 millions $ is not so big amount to make risks to lose reputation. I mean, there is opportunity to earn much more and we hope, people support our idea and ll join us.

Please read it  https://medium.com/zrcoin/the-decentralisation-of-the-global-economy-starts-here-1d77f234d468  ZrCoin is built on new green technologies, developed by industrial experts, that will enable us to recover zirconium dioxide from the wastes produced by ceramics manufacturers. The result will be more energy efficient, cleaner and of higher quality than the alternative — extracting it from natural resources.  This in itself sets the project apart from anything else on the market. We’ve spent several years and over a million dollars researching and testing the technology, and now we’re ready to deploy it to produce high-quality ZrO2.

And we suppose such project as a new step in economic's development.  Decentralization as is.  By creating an option on the blockchain, backed by production of ZrO2, ZrCoin will make it possible to trade a real commodity in a fully decentralised way. Anyone, anywhere in the world can buy it, so long as they have an internet connection and the ability to deposit funds into the Waves client (using bitcoin via exchanges, or even with a credit card). Moreover, the barriers of scale that exist in the traditional financial system aren’t a problem with the blockchain. There is no minimum purchase, and no flat fee for brokerage. It would be possible to buy a single ZrCoin, or even less, without the associated costs being prohibitive.  In the near future, we expect many such financial instruments to arise on the blockchain. People will be able to trade them directly, with complete freedom — any amount of any commodity, trading directly against any other, on Waves’ DEX. Sell 5kg of zirconium for gold. Trade USD for silver-backed tokens. Suddenly it will become possible to create diverse portfolios efficiently, even using ZrCoin and other tokens as forms of commodity money.  The future is starting to look very interesting, and we’re glad to be blazing a trail there.

Options are widely used in industry, and in essence are quite straightforward. They offer the opportunity to buy or sell a particular commodity or security at a given price, at some point in the future. For example, a farmer might purchase an option to sell next summer’s wheat at the current market price, as a form of insurance against the price falling in the meantime. (If the price rises, he does not have to exercise his option.) Options exist for all kinds of commodities, from wheat to gold, and for stocks and shares. Whilst they are used by industry to ensure the acquisition of raw materials at a known price, there is also an active secondary market for them. Traders use them as speculative vehicles.  ZrCoin is doing something similar. We are selling tokens that represent the option to take possession of 1kg synthetic ZrO2 — the product we will manufacture for industrial use. Once we are up and running, this product will sell for $2,800 per tonne, so each ZrCoin has a theoretical value of $2.80. We will sell the options at a discount to this at ICO, starting at $1.40.

Zirconium oxide or zirconia is used in high-end, high-value, low-volume applications.

Synthetic concentrate of zirconium dioxide produced using our technology is a unique product, which does not require the addition of any further chemical components and allows for it to be used in refractory materials right away.  More than 10 of the largest enterprises using refractory materials in their manufacturing processes have already appreciated the uniqueness and quality of this synthetic concentrate of zirconium dioxide""  I believe such project is worth investing in",False

This is yoyoamigo from the WAVES Community. I am not from WAVES, not a member of their Team or Company.  this is a simple recap of all activities and news for the past week.  i am doing this out of contribution for WavesPlatform and to all ICO tokens using it. As well as for the communities involved.   Reason? Ever since the WAVES WEEKLY came to an end temporarily, i had thought it would be something good to have while waiting for it to come back. In addition, i feel that those that are on WavesPlatform shouldn't be left out of this. i would like to see WavesPlatform and all those who are part of it rise up together in full force. Not one without the others.  No payment is required. Also, all images used below are CC0 (Creative Commons) a.k.a. free for public use. Mostly from Pixabay.com and Dreamstime.com. And a few of my own. So rest assured  I only asked that you allow me to leave a logo of WAVES in the image you see below and a link to WavesPlatform website and to its recap as well. As you can see, you will not find any other cryptocurrencies here except yours and WAVES. This is done so as to respect your space and the community's attention. for the other cryptocurrencies as well.  if you feel the recap is good enough, you are free to share & tweet the 'Recap"" image below. Remember to add the link above this message to the tweet. whoever clicks on it will be directed to this recap. the link is just above this message, just above where the date is. that link. a small request, add 3 hashtags to your tweets ""#wavesplatform #ico #crowdfund"" if you can. Thank you. For the community, please liked it or retweet it as well.  If you want to ensure that all news and activities are to be included into this recap, be sure to tweet it or blog it. If, however, there are no news for the entire week, i will not post any recap. So be sure to have at least one. news and activities are only inclusive of new information. old, duplicated or repeated ones will be excluded from the recap. However, do not trouble yourself about re-posting an old news. I will be able to find out if its new or not. So leave the work to me. =)  If you only a few news now, it's alright. this recap is not meant to put to shame. But in the future, you can rest assured that i will be covering those many news. If it takes months to build a house, then it will take months. If it takes hours to bake a cake, then so shall it be. Hope everyone understands this.  Thank you and enjoy the recap.

FIRST QUESTION: Will you be marketing this investment opportunity to non crypto people? 100% sounds enticing to regular people who don't know about cryptocurrency, but a number of crypto coins have gone up 1000% since the beginning of this year. Wavesplatform will also likely go up more than 200% by the end of the year, possibly a lot more, especially if this ICO is successful and gets a lot of publicity. So there isn't much of an incentive for people within the existing cryptocurrency ecosystem to invest for 100% gains compared to regular fiat investors.  So lack of funding is a big concern for me. This brings me to my SECOND QUESTION: What will you do if you don't raise the minimum amount, which I assume is 3.5 mil USD? Will you refund to investors or what?  And THIRD QUESTION: why accept Waves for this ICO? It may seem like a good idea at 1st glance, especially since you're using the Wavesplatform for this ICO, but at the moment Waves is largely illiquid token with low volume. The last thing you'd want is 1-2 million dollars worth of a token you can't sell without crashing the price. A lot of Waves investors are concerned about this as they don't want the price of their token to crash. But to be honest, you guys are the ones that should be the most concerned. Surely just US dollars & bitcoin is the preferred payment method.",False

Thus, for sure it's good opportunity for investment for non crypto people.  The second - In general, if we would not raise 3,5 millions, we would refund investors, yes.

If I look at your timeline you are planning to build the production line between May 2017 and November 2017. Then the buy-back process starts in January 2018. This means that earliest in January 2018 you will be able to buy the tokens back (not counting with possible delays)  There is no logical reason to do an Initial Coin Offering and allocate funds for marketing the ICO. The project does not seem to be interesting for the crypto community and you will find it hard getting the required 3 mil USD.

Please read the below dialogue that I've just had with one of my colleagues in the Waves slack channel, and tell me what you think. This is not FUD! As Waves investors we REALLY want this project to succeed!!!   Me:  I'd be interested to know how you've interpreted the whitepaper. From my understanding. You are simply buying the Zr02 option at a 50% discount during the ICO. Then getting paid retail price for it 8 months later. So after 8 months they make monthly purchases of the tokens at twice the price you initially paid (there's your 100% returns). If it takes them 12 months to buy back all the tokens/options, then that is where the 5.5% monthly returns come from - Cause 5.5% compounded over 12 months is approx 100%. The chances are that I'm wrong. Would like to know what others think. I don't see how the returns are going to be greater than 100%, since the token is backed by Synth ZrO2, so it's only ever going to be worth what the price of synthetic ZrO2 is (which admittedly could increase in value, but I'm assuming it'll remain the same).  Technsave:  am more interested in exchanging ZrCoin for a few kilogram of the concentrate, never know when you need some of this around the house. :laughing: I can't see the amount of funds they are hopping to raise?  Me:  On twitter it said ""3,5 million"" - I'm assuming that means 3.5 mil USD. Sorry that wasn't twitter, that was the bitcointalk thread. Part of me wants to invest just so I can say that I've invested in a ""synthetic zirconium dioxide manufacturing plant in Russia"" - it sounds pretty cool.  Technsave:  Yep - I have a similar take on the whitepaper. Still a few unknown factors surrounding the buyback length of time etc. One would assume that there would be limited use of the token. It is essentially a loan with a rate of return.  Me:  Pretty much, you're not really going to take delivery of the concrete.  Technsave:  So cant see it being listed on exchanges - would be suited to WavesDex for transfer of the tokens if you want to sell out early. But I would consider this a real world use case for CATS so bravo to that :clap:  Me:  Absolutely. If this thing can be a real world use case for Waves, then it's massive. Ethereum has yet to provide such a thing. Waves will have bragging rights  Technsave:  So the chance of making more than 100% gain is slim. The only exception being if the retail value of zirconium dioxide increase's over this time. Or if there is a favourable swap of ZrCoin to company stock (if an IPO was approved). This is why a gateways are vital for this type of project because it is a real world project suited for fiat investors - the benefit is the use of the block-chain. Very pleased we all had this chat - gave me clarification on my thought of this project, who it is for and who it is not for.  Me:  I hope they are marketing this ICO to non crypto people, cause as @technsave  says ""It is essentially a loan with a rate of return."" And 100% return is nothing to be sneezed at. But that is nothing in crypto. Most Waves holders would be hoping for a minimum 300% return by the end of the year (on the price of our waves) (edited)  Technsave:  Yep - spot on. This project needs gateways and a sales team securing funds from business associates who are not in the cryptosphere. Waves is purely the tech not the currency",False

ZrCoin company are going to want cold hard cash or ruble at the end of the ICO because it is a real world project. Posted in #generalToday at 2:05 PM  Me:  This point has been brought up before regarding Incent etc. Obviously Waves token holders don't want the price of their Waves to crash. But I've been pondering this and it's even more silly from the perspective of the ZrCoin company. Why the fuck would they want 3 million dollars worth of low liquidity Waves tokens that they cannot sell without crashing the price?

How did you come to this number? 5) Are there enough companies to purchase all of the zirconium concentrate you produce? 6) To produce such an amount, you will also need to have sufficient raw materials. Since I expect that the amount of Zirconium in your raw material will be low, the raw material flow will be large. Is infrastructure and supply secured? 7) You describe 2 different installations. Are both installations required to succeed this project? will you only produce zirconium concentrate or will you possibly also produce other rare earth metals? 9) You have a site identified to construct your installations. Are all permits arranged? 10) Construction time seems very short. Typically some parts will have order times of few monts to half a year.

Well, lets start.  1. Amount of coins will be determined by the amount of investments. 1.4$ for 1 token. 2. As you can get from punkt 1, we ll not have unsold tokens. 3. Minimum is 3,5 millions $ in sum of all investments. 7 millions will be also good, it ll allow to build the second production line and all process ll be much faster.  4. 400 tons of zirconium concentrate per month - it's estimated power of the plant. If we count our planned supply and work of equipment and people and this everything ll happen in time, so we can estimate that we ll have 400 tons of concetrate. 5. Yes, there are a lot. Zirconium concetrate is a highly demand product for some kind of factories which connected with high temperature production. We ll publish surely some research about it to proof this information. Surely to trust to this project this information should be clear and evident. But for now you can google and read some scientific research about this market. 6. This is especially good question. But surely the answer is yes. There are enough raw material around and we have enough experience in such kind of logistic. 7. Yes, it's required to have both of them. It's not real installions, I would say it's 2 steps of production. 8. For now our unique methodic is available and fit only to Zirconium concetrate. 9. Yes, something still is in process, but the main things are ready. And we'll publish all documents about it step by step, so I would advise to subscribe to our news here and get news from us https://zrcoin.io/register 10. These types of constructions can be built rather fast. It's not real monumental building, it's some special production building, so it's possible to build in this short period.  I hope, I have answered to your questions. Please don't hesitate to ask more.  And please join our • FACEBOOK • TELEGRAM • TWITTER •",False
