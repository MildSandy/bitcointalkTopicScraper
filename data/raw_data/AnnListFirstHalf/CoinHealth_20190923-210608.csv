Since the beginning of the sale, the tokens have been offered with increasing prices in various trade pairs on the Waves DEX. Sales have been stagnating since the end of February. The token is now offered by Coinhealth in only one trade pair. The team seems to have been inactive since March.  In the telegram group I asked where the 875k tokens came from, why they were dumped, was the team responsible for this and whether the number of 2k offered by Albegro each time came from them? Through Wavesdesk I have seen the transactions from the Coinhealth address to Abrego and also the 875k tokens.  For this I was banned from the group. Via DM I contacted the ""Ghost Admin"" of the group. Here it seemed that I had to prove the justice of my questions just as I am in possession of CoinHealth tokens. That admin said also you have no economic knowledge and therefore you do not understand and in another messages was said that the team has bought up tokens.  I own nearly 30k Coinhealth tokens and have over 250Waves in it. So it seems to me that I can look very critically curious about the project. Not that someone who is upset, because the progress of the crowdsale does not go as expected, the project stops and goes on vacation of my money .....  Now I try to contact by this topic and twitter channels to get in touch with them. My confidence in this project is decreasing considerably last weeks.......

My critical posts also have nothing to do with the current disappointing market (which has a price fall of> 50% compared to December 2017), which hinders the current value of a CoinHealth token and that makes me an angry consumer as by Ghost Admin of the telegram group in DM continues to occur.  The ico's I've participated in I see all as (mid-) long-term investments and I place CoinHealth under it. The ico's are: Bankera, Astronaut, Credits, Change Bank, Coffeecoin, Oceanlab and a few other ones that I forget.  No I am critical because of the inactivity of the team on social media, the lack of marketing by, for example, an airdrop to attract potential new investors and communicating the technical project developments and / or entering into contractual business relations to the project in the directer future.   However, I have noticed that the previous ico price on the Waves DEX has been lowered by Coinhealth from 0.083Waves to 0.039Waves per CoinHealth token.  Why is nothing communicated about this on social media? What is the reason for the price reduction? Why has the team still not reacted in this topic?  Ghost Admin is aware of this topic. He / she has received the link. Ignoring my questions or that the team keeps hiding and being accused of not understanding makes me only more pissed!  It is up to CoinHealth to remedy this. Because of our money, your (our) project becomes possible and here we all hope to become wiser in the longer term.  I hope that my posts encourage the team to continue, communicate transparently with the supporters, follow the road map and deliver what has been reflected in the white papers.

Im a little over your accusations. And answering any of your questions.  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 01:11] see me as first time costumer and convince me to buy tokens  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 01:12] Very simply put , what backs CH? BTC,LTC,ETH, Waves where are they? over 75% down . Its a massive flow pool.  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 01:13] if everything is 75% less than it is in fiat seen the best to step in. many coins for little  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 01:13] that is no reason for me that the ico remains behind  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 01:19] Ill tell you what since this is a long conversation lets schedule a time to speak. Ill call you through here. When would be good for you?  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 01:20] Because you dont understand economics that why.  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 01:22] it is a shame that it is all up to me or the market that is down .... I use google translate because I am not English speaking so calling does not make sense.  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 01:23] my conclusion is that the 875k units have completely annihilated the ico! if they are earned with something why are they not released until the end of the ico?  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 01:27] this conversation did not lead to anything except that we both now think what a jerk is that guest is too bad about the way in which cryptoland reacts to each other. If someone is not at the same level, then economic knowledge is lacking. If there is something different, it is up to the market. if critical questions are asked, you first have to defend yourself as questioner or prove that you have tokens in your possession.  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 01:28] What language do you speak? I speak a few.  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 01:28] Dutch  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 01:29] Okay thats not one I speak.

Ghost Admin, [14.04.18 17:59] Place your tokens for sale, you are in full control of your tokens. We are not at your beckoned call as we have answered your questions. That is why our model is the way it is. At no point in time were you ever locked in and had no way out. You dont want the tokens anymore, sell them.  Casper SMS303, [14.04.18 18:00] I gave you my adrress to prove i have almost 30k ... but i am still waiting for the full scenario as you promised  Ghost Admin, [14.04.18 20:37] Let me ask you , you said you used 250 waves. Waves is sub 4 dollars usd. So should we as an ICO say we lost faith in the Waves token because when people invested in it was worth 12-15 dollars a token. No we cant, we have to accept that the tokens that were used to pay for CH were worth far more when invested. Just like CH is down all tokenage used to buy CH is dowb meaning the ICO is at the same loss as the purchaser reciprocally.

Ghost Admin, [16.04.18 22:13] our twitter is @coinhealth1  Casper SMS303, [16.04.18 22:14] More and more I get the impression that funds have been raised, the enthusiasm for the crowdsal disappointment and since then the project has stopped. The elaboration of reactions on twitter and on bitcointalk feeds this feeling more and more. Do you understand why I have received antipathy against the whole project? All that nonsense that I am not an economist and therefore do not understand it can put you in your place where the sun will never shine. You do not treat investors like that.

Casper SMS303, [16.04.18 22:16] make it transaprant  Ghost Admin, [16.04.18 22:17] You make constant accusations that arent true. We as a team do not have to take that type of abuse. What you do not understand and which we have tried to explain. Is that you dont spend funds when they are at 1/4 value at the same rate you would when at full value. You may call the economics of how a project can be ran and afforded crap but its the truth.  Ghost Admin, [16.04.18 22:28] The value of any crypto participants used to buy CH is at a 75% loss in current markets. Its very simple $1000 in waves 2 months ago is $250 in waves now. The project then makes cut backs and postpones things until markets are more favorable to continue at budget.  Ghost Admin, [16.04.18 22:29] Without doing this the project runs the risk of insolvency because of the market downturn. Does that make sense?  Casper SMS303, [20.04.18 18:25] answer here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=post;topic=2629209.0;num_replies=17  Casper SMS303, [20.04.18 18:32] be honest...

Ghost Admin, [20.04.18 18:55] I have tried to explain this repeatedly.When you purchased with waves , what was the value of each wave?  Waves is down from 15 dollars to 5. So the crypto you paid with is at a loss.  Ghost Admin, [20.04.18 18:59] We didnt mess anything up , we slowed things down and are still ahead of schedule. Stop making accusation about the project that you dont have any factual information about. Currently today Dr. Johny Nobles is at the IBM blockchain conference speaking with reps about our project. We were in silicon valley 3 months ago doing the same. Were looking to hire 2 more developers as we speak to bring all dev together in the beta. I have been very nice about trying to explain all that is going on. I have also tried to help you understand that market economics play a huge part in a project. I wont continue to try to explain due to constant accusations.  Ghost Admin, [20.04.18 19:00] The waves you used to purchase are value at 1/3 of when you purchased. Thats a loss.  Ghost Admin, [20.04.18 19:00] For us.  Ghost Admin, [20.04.18 19:03] This is a 5 year project and you are complaining in the first couple months. It took BTC 8 years to have substantial value.  Ghost Admin, [20.04.18 19:03] Im sorry if you thought this was a get rich quick ICO, It was never advertised as that.  Ghost Admin, [20.04.18 19:04] And its healthcare which takes ample time.  Casper SMS303, [24.04.18 18:48] The crowdsale is ended and the big sell order of 10mln tokens are still there at the DEX.
