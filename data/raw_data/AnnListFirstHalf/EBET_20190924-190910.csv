That's great.  Strange it is taking so long.  There is a newer coin, XBL https://billionairetoken.com/  that is working on a dice game of its own.  Has only 3 million coins, a deflationary mechanism, and is constantly being developed.  Updates are frequent.  First game is about to go live and is being thoroughly vetted on the kovan testnet.  I am an investor in EBET, but when I see another token that took in less, came later, and is working way faster, it begs the question . . . . why?  Here is the XBL ANN: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2065888  We can look at the amount of money that EBET took in on the ICO here: https://medium.com/@ethbet/ethbet-crowdsale-statistics-d7bec8961160  They took in much more than XBL did.  I am going to laugh if this Billionaire Token makes the dice game before EBET.  AND, the website looks much better.  Don't let me down guys.  I invested in XBL too, so either way I'm going to win.",False

Later on we can add support for any Ethereum-based (ERC20) token. The dividends model likely cannot be re-added directly as it would make the token considered a security very easily, which would lead exchanges to not want to list it and potentially cause some other problems down the line. There's a lot of tokens that have succeeded using a model similar to what Ethbet's now is, so we're still optimistic.

Our smart contract for the crowdsale is almost finished and it will be audited and it will be open-source. The minimum cap will be coded into the smart contract, although we don't anticipate it will get that little funding. Everything about the crowdsale should be open-source, public, transparent, etc, as it will actually be on the Ethereum blockchain.  As far as Twitter goes, we are enrolled in many different types of ICO marketing packages, some of which include rather strong social media promotion. Twitter has a lot of bots on it (I think you'll notice this on just about any larger Twitter account), and the actions they perform are out of our control, but I appreciate this question and will see if I can provide more information.  I can't predict who will list EBET. Now that it's not a security, I'm hoping that Bittrex is not outside of the question later on, but no guarantees can be made. We would love for EBET to eventually be on many medium-sized exchanges, but at this point all I can guarantee is it will be tradeable and you will be able to buy/sell it on decentralized exchanges. There's a high probability of it being added to some of the smaller ones as well.   In other news we hope that our Bounty thread is posted some time today, very sorry for the delays.",False

It's not offensive and we understand the concern.  One of the reasons we're not confident that a team page will add significant value to the project is because the reputation of members on it can only be at risk if there's a reputation to begin with. The members of our team are not publicly-known figures, so there isn't any guarantee that anything legitimate is actually being offered.  For the sake of the argument, imagine that our team page had members listed, with full names and images, maybe even links to Twitter or other profiles. Does this really provide anyone a better guarantee, or is just an attempt to appear more legitimate, without actually risking any reputation? The information could be incorrect, the images could be copied from others or faked (which many ICOs have done, stolen images, names, biographies of individuals and used them for their team page without the affected person knowing their reputation was being staked without their consent). Even if the figures are publicly known, it can have very little effect. Those interested in legal discourse can easily be disappointed when all team members reside in countries where action cannot easily (or at all) be taken against them.  It's my personal opinion that some of the ICOs with the most 'impressive team' pages right now are some of the worst to invest in. I'm not talking about ones with technically competent members, but ones that try to include famous names or 'cool' figures at any cost, becuase they prioritize on convincing people to invest in them due to their implied association, instead of trying to actually provide an innovative idea or concept. Due dilligience is important as an investor in any project, so if you don't like the feel of one project, it might be best to find others that you believe in instead. Thanks for the question.",False

As a result, they expect the house to profit from this game Although Edgeless is partially decentralized (exists on the blockchain), it is not peer-to-peer Edgeless does not support ETH, only their own token, EDG, thus you must purchase EDG first to use their platform Games such as Blackjack involve large amounts of data stored on the blockchain, and thus the fees paid to execute the involved smart contracts can be high Edgeless generates random numbers using their own server off of the blockchain No publicly readable changes to their smart contracts appear to have been made for at least several months  Regardless of these drawbacks, Edgeless may be an appealing option for those wishing to play provably-fair games of blackjack on the blockchain in the near future, however we do not consider them a direct competitor for our target audience.   To respond to your question about gas, the primary two mechanisms of improving in this area are 1) moving more things off-chain. We already do this with match-making, and are looking into the potential to do more computation off-chain, such as by implementing state (or 'fate' as Funfair calls their version) channels and 2) allow improvements in the Ethereum ecosystem to help out in this area as various upgrades are made to the platform (PoS, raiden, etc)",False

Quote from: maldini on August 29, 2017, 07:06:06 PM A huge bonus to invest in the beginning, but is there a pre-ICO for this project? We don't have a pre-ICO period. Although it would be useful to gauge serious investor interest, it may be a more fair option for us to just have a longer crowdsale.  Quote from: rijaljun on August 29, 2017, 07:15:21 PM Quote from: Palakka on August 29, 2017, 06:52:23 PM How much total supply this ICO. I dont see in OP about that And how much maximal And minimum target in crowdsale? Based on the website, the total supply will be 50.000.000 EBET with rate 1000 EBET = 1 ETH. 50,000,000 is set to be the maximum possible supply. The actual supply will likely be much less than this, depending on how many are purchased during the crowdsale.  Quote from: rijaljun on August 29, 2017, 07:23:14 PM Where is the team? There is no team information on your website. And, could you please explain in short about Inverstor-Diven, how is the voting work? Voting is a feature that will not be introduced for awhile as it will take a lot of development, testing, and an already-existing healthy community. The theory behind it is that those who have a stake in the platform (token holders) are the ones that will be deciding the direction of the platform, as it should be. So for example, if the team thinks it's a good idea to add another game after dicing, the token holders can vote on if they think that should be done or not, given that they will recieve the rewards or losses as a result of the idea. Your question about the team is partially-addressed in the FAQ section on the website, we will address it further in the future.  Quote from: ifyousmell on August 29, 2017, 07:25:24 PM only dicing? kind of strange if the coin's usage is only limited in that way. Yes. There is no reason more games cannot be added later on, but the current goal of this project is to provide the best return possible for those looking to gamble, not to provide a large amount of fun and pretty games.",False

In most dicing games, players play against the house, and the house takes some profit out of every roll. In Ethbet, players play against each other instead, and thus are able to get a higher return on average.  Quote from: Bitum on August 29, 2017, 09:42:18 PM Who is behind the platform? I have not found anything about the team, who are they? We have a very small technical team of 2-3 members and many temporary members such as freelancers who are not officially affiliated with the project.. This question is also present in the FAQ section of the website.",False

We're planning on running a signature bounty campaign. Are there other types of bounties you would be interested in?   In other news, we have updated the amount of total tokens available, decreasing it by a factor of 5. This will make sure we do not get significantly overfunded and that the final token distribution is much more fair. It is now set to 10,000,000.",False
