We released the new Suretly app in August 2018. The old app has been available there since 2016 (!) But only recently it appears to be inappropriate. Really?!  But please, do not panic, everything is under control. At least we know the next steps we need to undertake to finally observe the Suretly app in the AppStore again.  We hope this story will have a happy ending, and in the meantime, we ask the Suretly community to support our crew.  There is another piece of news for you, guys, the good one. Actually, the great.  The SurCoin company has finished the implementation of SUR tokens and very soon, in March, token holders will get an opportunity to use them as a pledge for Suretly.

They will have all legally allowed sources for that, including the access to the credit bureau data. That is not possible to arrange when the borrower is in another jurisdiction. And that is the main problem of all p2p lending platforms which want to issue cross-boarding loans.

For the last couple of months, the Suretly team has faced a number of difficulties.  The difficulties arose in part because of changes in the Russian legal system. As Russia is the first country to experience the Suretly business model, these changes influenced the development process.  To be more concrete, in spring 2018 Russia tightened measures to help prevent obtaining money from criminal sources (according to the Federal Law №115). Due to the new rules, we had to make a number of changes in the app, as we collect and store some personal data and data regarding money transfers. We are still in the process of figuring out all the details.  At the same time, we have started to integrate with one of the biggest microfinance companies in Russia. During this process, we received several requests from our partner to make needed changes to the Suretly model. These changes included the extension of the loan term, for instance.  This was indeed a challenge for our team, but we were able to handle it!  Because of these difficulties, we had to increase the time of development and extend the deadline for the Suretly app release.   The release date was initially scheduled for the first half of 2018. Unfortunately, we cannot finish all work needed by the original due date.  We are working hard to meet the new projected release date for the app in August 2018. This is a year after the ICO.  Because of all the delays, we made the decision to freeze the token rewards that were promised to the Suretly crew for three months longer than originally planned.  We want to thank you for all your continuing support for Suretly. We ask you to please be patient and to give us your support for a little while longer.",False

Comparing crowdvouching and other alternatives in Russia https://blog.suretly.com/where-to-invest-100-to-get-profit-comparing-crowdvouching-and-other-alternatives-in-russia-1cc25038d244  At the core of crowdvouching is a very simple idea: you are getting value.  For the borrower (usually subprime), the value comes from getting both a lower interest rate and the opportunity finally to get fair loan conditions. They can make life better without finding themselves in a tight corner due to extortionate interest rates.  For the lender, the value comes from the possibility to issue many more loans and to eliminate default risks — therefore making business even more profitable.  And what about the voucher? That person takes a risk when covering the back of some stranger who lives, perhaps, a world away. Vouchers earn a profit, and the more risk you take, the more the profit may be.  Here in Suretly, we are endlessly inspired by the idea that there is no need for compromise. In this model, all sides win!  Today we will talk about vouchers, the crucial participants in the crowdvouching process. They put in their values (like fiat money or tokens) and take risks. However, is such an alternative really profitable?  Let’s compare how much a voucher can earn on crowdvouching with some other alternatives.

We dont need an hourly updated github or something like that but i would recommend to start with marketing and trying to get listed on decent exchanges. HitBTC is a joke and everyone in cryptoland know that. The price increases you have mentioned is not because that someone bought SUR-tokens, its just the normal increase of the ETH rise.  When for e. g. suretly is backed by eth and its about 0,008 ETH per SUR and the USD/ETH value is increasing the USD price of every SUR token increases too.  The App progress is quite good so far but there is a huge lack of information.  When will we see the Telegram channel? Telegram is good for quick answeres. This community (bitcointalk) is dead. Mostly all get rid of their SUR or just keep holding because noone wants to sell in a loss. So i politely ask you to start marketing or share your thought for the next months. All Coins updated their WP and gave out a roadmap for 2018. Sure that you guys focus on reallife marketing and we wont see a lot of it in europe but we deserve to get a bit more infos. You werent quiet when you asked for money in ICO so please stop being quite to us investors till now.  Tell us dates when you start with marketing, listing on decent exchanges, the launch at the app, the funds you already still have to keep your work done and what progress you expect in the next weeks.

I see your point.  We are concentrated on the app development for the moment to release the app as soon as possible. That is our plan for SUR tokens:  1.   After the SUR app is launched we will spread the information among crypto resources to attract interest to project.  2.   Approximately in 2 or 3 months after the product is released we plan to make tokens use available in the app.  3.

From what I can see there hasn't really been any thought for the use of the token and to plan to integrate it within the app. I think the fact that they plan to buy back all tokens from exchanges and burn them kind of proves this. People who use the app will just crowdvouch in fiat. Why would anyone go through all the hassle to buy the tokens on an exchange and then send to the app, it would be pointless. My opinion the ICO was just an easy way to raise funds for the business as people who do not know much about ICO will invest because the business model looks good from the website but they don't understand there will be no demand for the token. And I think that is why they used an outside company to set up there ICO as they don't have any crypto knowledge. I think this is why they didn't raise nowhere near the funds they wanted during ICO because the ones who are more clued up could see the token had no future. I think the team should come up with a solid solution to involve the tokens more within the app so we can see a demand for the token and hopefully see some returns for investors. I mean without us investors they would not of had that large sum of money to help develop there business so it's only fair they find a solution so we also get rewarded.  My opinion is to be able to crowdvouch you should have to purchase tokens first and use only tokens to crowdvouch and fees paid by the borrower should be in tokens. Fiat should not be an option. The only fiat part of the business should be the loan that is issued from the lending companies. You should be able to purchase tokens from within the app to make it easy for consumers. Any business model that raised funds using ICO all make you buy there tokens to use there platform it's just how it works.  I have set up a telegram channel if anyone wants to join so we can maybe discuss some ideas because I think without some changes Suretly token will be dead. Hopefully we can discuss ideas with the team and find a solution. I do really like the Suretly platform and the idea we just need the tokens to be more involved.

This is a misunderstanding, and I hope we will clarify this issue.  In the White paper it was said: “There will be a possibility to use all issued SUR-tokens as a method of ensuring guarantee on a granted surety in the Suretly app.” The usage of fiat money was actually planned from the very beginning of the project, in the first version of Suretly app, which was tested with real people and real borrowers, fiat money was used.  We believe that users will prefer to use tokens. When we say about the USA, Russia and Kazakhstan, we mean that our partners will lend on that markets. But people from all over the world will have an opportunity to become a guarantor (if it is legally allowed in a specific country).  What we mean that there will be 200+ countries where people won’t be allowed to use fiat for vouching.  Regarding the USA – unfortunately it is not allowed to use tokens in that country yet.

I was reading through the Suretly whitepaper and in the ICO section they have stated they are selling 15% of the company shares to SURcoin to raise between $1.5-10,000,0000 and they will issue tokens accordingly. And they also wrote all funds raised will be in exchange for 15% of Suretly Inc's shares. Does that mean all the token holders in total own a 15% share in the company? It is also stated during the first 3 years all profits will be re-invested in to the company's developments and after that Suretly is to pay dividends to SURcoin. So to those who are still holding tokens at that time will receive their portion of dividends? From the picture I could see on the whitepaper that was the impression I got. There was an arrow pointing from Suretly to SURcoin saying ""divdends"" then an arrow to investors with a ""$"" symbol. But then after that they say all dividends will be used by SURcoin to buy tokens from exchanges for burning. But if token holders do not want to sell on exchanges then surely they should receive dividends or am I incorrect? But I also seen a post on the Facebook page saying SUR tokens are what is needed to use on the app. So if tokens are being burned then what would be used? Sorry if I am being stupid I am just a very confused of the main purpose of the SUR token and where it will get it's value. My original understanding was token holders held a 15% share and as the company grew so would the value of the tokens. If anyone can help that would be great. Thanks",False

Also, as by agreement between Suretly, Inc and SURcoin pte.ltd, Suretly, Inc. will be transferring 0.2% of each loan secured by Suretly's investors to SURcoin pte.ltd as a license fee for using token in the App. It will begin doing this on a quarterly basis, after the 3rd quarter following the ICO is completed (in July 2018). This money will be used by SURcoin pte.ltd to buy tokens from exchanges. All purchased tokens will be burned. In case Suretly pays dividends to SURcoin pte.ltd they will also be used for “buy and burn” scheme. According to the economic theory, when the total supply is being reduced, the price should rise. But again, SUR is not a security, and we cannot promise you that.",False

Have you been thinking of that for the last 2 weeks? We have an answer!  We took some R&D time a month ago after ICO to make sure you, the people we work hard for, get the best Suretly has to offer.  It’s time for an update so you know we’re still on track. Here’s what’s been going on.  The dream becomes reality  You know Suretly released an alpha-version of the app for some countries. We wanted to get what we call ‘a minimum value product’ on the street quick for actionable feedback. This slightly less than prime time, but still great, version of Suretly app gave us great intelligence. We learned what works well, what’s really good, and what should be in the trash bin. The path has been filled with challenge, but the victories sweet. While we don’t want to share every tidbit of info in public, rest assured every lesson learned translates to huge wins for mobile developers regardless of skills and abilities.  Suretly App beta-version will be released in 1.5 month.  Solid design on a solid foundation  We called up some big-guns on UX/UI design and had a serious discussion about the struggles of making a truly user-friendly mobile-dev app. When the smoke cleared, we had in hand plans for several weeks of development and design. We are totally satisfied with the results of the meeting, and you will be too when you see how Suretly helps its users get profit from vouching, and smartly deploys for different countries and different languages.  Working our development team harder  We rode our development team hard this past month and they cranked out some great stuff. We pushed them for more core features including integration of iOs with backend, orders module for Android app, and lender API. There’s work to be done still, but the finish line is close. We’re on track for a superior beta-version release. We also made our team stronger by hiring a new member. Nikolay Dolgopolov is a skilled iOS developer with a background in creating a new social media for Europe.  Events of note  We were happy to be part of MFO Russia Summit 2017. This let us participate in the biggest microfinance event in the CIS Region. The event gave us the chance to find new partners we can rely on. We’ll be posting the results soon in our news feed so be sure to follow. We’re looking forward to the Benzinga Fin Tech Summit being held in San-Francisco on September 28th.

ICO is over.  The last month was extremely difficult for us, but at the same time it was very interesting.  As you know, our ICO began with a massive DDOS attack, continued with the collapse of the crypto-currency market and ended 11 days after Bitcoin hardfork.  Despite everything, Suretly has raised a bit more than $2.8 million at the current rate (+ Bitcoin cash as addition to the raised amount).  It is almost 2 times more than a minimum target, and I'm sure it will be enough not only for a full  launch of the service in the three current countries, but will also for entering the Asian market in the third quarter of the next year.  At the moment, the Russian part of the Team is busy with updating the software and attracting new partners in Russia and Kazakhstan. An extensive marketing plan is also being prepared to attract more customers of the Suretly app.  The American part of the Team is working out legal issues related to the regulation of the microloans market, and is also preparing for a deal on the entry of SURCOIN PTE LTD into the shareholders of the main company. By the way, I want to emphasize once again that according to the ICO terms , SUR-tokens are not intended for any kind of use by US citizens / residents  So, we have a lot of work ahead and, of course, intend to become the next unicorn.   Many thanks to all who supported us all this time, thanks to all 1130 SUR-tokens holders and separately to those 275 people who believed in us at the preICO stage. I am sure that in the long run you will necessarily multiply your contribution.   Special thanks to those who took part in Bounty campaigns - without your support, probably, nothing would have happened at all.  And, of course, thanks to all Suretly Team and all those who somehow participated in the preparation for this ICO - and these are dozens of programmers, lawyers, journalists, PR specialists, copywriters, marketers.  The tokens withdrawal will be available soon. Here you can see the smart contract for ERC20-based tokens: https://github.com/SURETLY/token/blob/master/SuretlyContract.sol. Information about WAVES-based tokens will be available later.  The instructions for the withdrawal will be available as soon as tokens will be released. Please do not use exchange addresses for a withdrawal- use only the addresses which you have the private key from.  The list of exchanges where you can trade SUR tokens  will be announced later. Please keep in mind we need not only to negotiate with the exchanges, but also make sure for tokens not to be available for citizens of the US  and Singapore. It may take some time, but I hope the main issues will be resolved by the end of next week.",False

In Suretly case it depends on a project itself. Yes, it is a real life project and team members will have to adopt to the openness of the crypto community.

The last 2 weeks were very difficult for us and,  unfortunately, our plans didn’t go as we wished and are not completely fullfilled. As you know, since the June, 10th we were in Hong Kong, where we negotiated about a possible launch of Suretly in China. Also, we presented the crowdvouching technology at the Rise-2017 conference - we received some positive feedback from the  market and we were invited to several business-accelerators in China. After the first day of the exhibition, we launched the ICO, and as you already know, we faced a powerful DDoS attack which led to inaccessibility of the service for more than 2.5 hours. We can’t blame the tech guys, even more than 10 servers couldn’t cope with the attack - it was VERY powerful. In addition to that, we  started our ICO in a bad-market-time, which caused refusals in investments from large players, who previously planned to invest a fairly large amount. Of course, both of these facts negatively affected to the dynamic, which in turn lowered the expectations of speculative investors, as a result of which we raised  only a minimum target in the first few days. Anyway, I would like to emphasise that even a minimum of 1.5M will allow us to fully develop our business in Russia and Kazakhstan. We will launch our application in the pilot-mode in the US this year. Let me remind you that the US is a huge market for us, its size is about 40 billion dollars. So, we are ready to work in ""agile"" mode with the minimum funding. We are the ""lean startup"" and we know how to use money more effective If we collect a large amount (or the ETH/USD will continue to grow) - we will be able to scale our business more faster and we will  open Europe and Asia branches next year.  Thank you for such a report! Not every project has such a feedback!  The regular released news from Decs really help the community! Well done.  Just to prevent any critic, can you reference with names, websites or other sources the players willing or already participating in the project?  The team is already in the White Paper.",False

The last 2 weeks were very difficult for us and,  unfortunately, our plans didn’t go as we wished and are not completely fullfilled.  As you know, since the June, 10th we were in Hong Kong, where we negotiated about a possible launch of Suretly in China.  Also, we presented the crowdvouching technology at the Rise-2017 conference - we received some positive feedback from the  market and we were invited to several business-accelerators in China.  After the first day of the exhibition, we launched the ICO, and as you already know, we faced a powerful DDoS attack which led to inaccessibility of the service for more than 2.5 hours. We can’t blame the tech guys, even more than 10 servers couldn’t cope with the attack - it was VERY powerful.  In addition to that, we  started our ICO in a bad-market-time, which caused refusals in investments from large players, who previously planned to invest a fairly large amount.  Of course, both of these facts negatively affected to the dynamic, which in turn lowered the expectations of speculative investors, as a result of which we raised  only a minimum target in the first few days.  Anyway, I would like to emphasise that even a minimum of 1.5M will allow us to fully develop our business in Russia and Kazakhstan. We will launch our application in the pilot-mode in the US this year. Let me remind you that the US is a huge market for us, its size is about 40 billion dollars.  So, we are ready to work in ""agile"" mode with the minimum funding. We are the ""lean startup"" and we know how to use money more effective  If we collect a large amount (or the ETH/USD will continue to grow) - we will be able to scale our business more faster and we will  open Europe and Asia branches next year.",False

General lenders lend money after a borrower is checked and had a loan scoring process. There are credit reporting agencies almost in all countries, financial institutions  usually check with a credit reference bureau a credit history of this or that person who asks for a loan or credit. Every and each borrower will be checked and a loan scoring procedure will be undertaken under him. Of course, there will be a lot of people from a higher risk group and that will be indicated in his/her profile in Suretly's application. It’s up to you whom to choose - low income with low risk or high income with high risk. You can always choose profiles with the minimum risk rate. It will depend on every voucher strategy.   2.  First of all, guarantors don’t share an interest rate with lender. The borrower should pay to guarantors separately and the cost of voucher’s service will be between 5% (for low-risk borrowers) to 20% (for-very-high risk borrowers) from a loan amount. Also, vouchers get their profit in the moment of a loan issuing, not at the end of a loan-period term. Every voucher can be responsible only for $10 dollars per each loan.   3. Of course, there are lot of such organizations which lend money for such short-term period. Microcredits is a huge market.  In the USA, for example, a half of an adult population is ""underserved"", that means  they are not able to have a loan from classic lenders (such as banks).

However, there are few points that I am worried or somewhat skeptical in this scheme,  1. If general lenders are all guaranteed with what they lend without risking their own money, would they just lend as much as they want so that they can maximize their returns because there is no fear in loosing their own money?  2.  Guarantors only get a few percent of what they put in collateral for borrowers.  So, if even a few of the borrowers they guaranteed get default, their net profits are easily gone because the net profit from other is larger than what they put in collateral for one person?  Does that means there is less incentive to join for guarantors?  3.  You have stated there is only a micro-loan around 1000USD for max. with short term to be provided as a loan.  Why there is such a small limit?  If there is one who cannot even borrow such a small amount from legit institutions in real life, I wonder he or she might be the one who is the least credit and likely get into default.

There was a demo day at 17, May. The photo are here (TonTon, thanks for sharing) :      It was a very unusual demoday because all visitors were wearing earphones to hear our pitches (Like at ""silent disco""'s). I hope we will have a more professional photos and videos, I post them here.   2. Starta Accelerator have announced  their own ICO date. Please, check out it: https://startaico.com They have a very strong team and very good portfolio of projects. I really love this guys and will miss all of them.  3. We've participated at Mobile Venture Summit  at 17, May in Mountain View . There will be a lot of venture investors who’s liked our idea and who wants to talk about venture investments, but we will allow only cryptoinvestments I hope I will take photo from this event, too.  4. We participated in today's Consensus 2017 Hackathon and have created a cool small webservice called EtherSend (It allows you to send ETH to friends using their phone numbers).  I will not develop it later, because I'm all into the Suretly, but guys from iCoinSoft probably will. Anyway, I had a lot of fun, met new people and did some PR activities    Btw, here is Julia's pitch from this hackathon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBFhP-DgIzE  5. Here's my plan for next few weeks:   - SG company incorporation & legal consultations   - Recruit more people   - Prepare for a massive PR activity   - Meet with private investors   - Visit several conferences: May, 22-23   Consensus   New York, US May, 24-25   SVOD   Mountain View, US June, 1-3SPIEF   Saint Petersburg, RU June, 7-8           Startup Village   Moscow, RU June, 22           Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference   Saint Petersburg, RU June, 26-28   Money20/20 Europe   Copenhagen July, 11-13   RISE   Hong Kong      If you know more conferences in June related to FinTech or/and Blockchain - please share that information with me!  6. We need to decide about ICO date. I’ve had a lot of consultations with different people and all of them adviced me to move ICO start date to middle of July, because we need more time to prepare. What do you thinks guys? I know, in the first post I told about late June, but it looks like mid July is much better.  7.

Our previous investment round in February was based on $1.85M valuation (we raised money from professional VC). We have tested a lot of hypotheses and made sure that our business is working.  Now we are looking money for scaling. Basically, the more money we'll raise, the more countries we will be operating next 12-18 months. For example, we need $1.5M for establishing business in 4 countries (including current). If we'll raise $5M - we'll start a business in 15 countries approximately. Our preliminary financial plan is included to whitepaper and we will create a more accurate financial plan after pre-ICO. Also, we will include in whitepaper more information about current legal entities , team, etc, but we should make more legal researching before it. Please keep in mind that ICO is not legal in some countries and some information can be very 'sensitive', so we can't share it with public until we will have a good legal base. So, to prepare for a full ICO we should allocate a good budget for it, that's why we decide to make pre-ICO first. Of course, we already have some offers from professional VCs, but they do not allow us to spent their money to ICO-campaign.  I hope I answered your questions well, but if not - feel free to ask me more.   Next 2-3 weeks I'll be in New York and I'm available for short in-person meetings. Also, anyone can RSVP to our demo day and ask me 'sensitive' (and non-sensitive) questions , here is the link:  https://www.eventbrite.com/e/redefining-demo-day-silent-demo-day-at-noisy-techcrunch-afterparty-in-nyc-tickets-32897165307  Disclaimer: U.S. citizens are not legally allowed to participate in our ICO.",False

But I want to assure you that the Suretly project is a real.  First of all, you can read a lot of articles about us in Russian media:  For example, this is the link to one of the biggest Russia's business media: http://money.rbc.ru/news/57bdbc3f9a7947539d803d2a (sorry, it's in russian, but you can use translator)  This is the link to one of the biggest Russia's startup-media: http://www.rb.ru/suretly/ (In Russian)  And this is the link to an international multimedia project about Russia: http://rbth.com/science_and_tech/2017/04/19/tinder-for-microloans-how-to-share-lending-risk-with-strangers_746448 (in English).  Second, we have venture investors from ""real market"":  One of them is Moscow High School of Economics (Russia's largest economic research institute) (proof link ). Our second investor is Starta Capital fund (proof link ).  Also, as I mention in Whitepaper, we are going to incorporate an entity in Singapore (because this country are pretty friendly to blockchain). This company will have an option to buy shares of our head company in U.S. So, every SUR token will be baked by Singapore company shares.  So, does it enough for you to see, that our project is real?

Our partners are fiat lenders only. 2. We have no direct communication with borrowers while they pay loans in full on time. The loan applications are fills by the borrowers on the lender's websites. 3. The borrowers are not anonymous - they are identified by the lender. 3. The credit risk group is based on credit history and/or other data not related to our platform. 4. The lender always reports borrower's non-payments to credit history bureau 5. We are focused only for short-term micro-lending, so the maximun loan amount is $1000 (the medium loan amount is $350)  Of course, scammers are very inventive and we will do all the best to avoid the fraud.",False

BOUNTY   What is SUR?  SUR is a utility token which can be used as a pledge in a Suretly crowdvouching platform. It means that there is a possibility to use SUR-tokens as a method of ensuring guarantee on a granted surety in the Suretly app. There are two types of tokens available based on Ethereum and Waves. Tokens are equivalent.  What is crowdvouching?  Crowdvouching is the practice of financially securing a loan repayment by vouching monetary contributions from a large number of people. Unlike P2P lending, vouchers do not lend money directly to the borrowers but guarantee to repay the loan to the lender in case of borrower's default.   Vouchers act as a collective mind in order to determine whether to approve loans or not. Liability for each loan is divided among all vouchers. Each voucher approval serves like an insurance of the loan capped at $10 USD. Since the vouching range is between $2 and $10, each Borrower needs to find dozens of vouchers provided by Suretly platform. In order for the loan to be approved, the entire loan amount should be guaranteed by the vouchers.  Role of SUR-tokens  There is a possibility to use SUR-tokens as a pledge.    In Suretly app customers can observe a list of borrowers who applied for short term loans. Profiles contain photo, city, age, gender and the statistical data on the timely loan repayment among borrowers of a similar category. Each customer can vouch for a borrower he likes and instantly get profit for each issued loan. SUR-tokens can be used as a guarantee and must be enrolled to the account in the app. After the loan is approved, the tokens get frozen in the amount according to the exchange rate. If the borrower won't pay off his loan later the voucher loses tokens in the guaranteed amount.  Initial Token Sale  On July-August, 2017 SURcoin Pte. Ltd held initial token sale and raised 168 BTC, 6460 ETH, 1329 LTC and 12922 WAVE (which was equal to $2.8 million USD on the closing date).       All raised funds was exchanged for 15% of Suretly, Inc.’s shares. Starting spring 2018 SUR-tokens are intended to be used as a pledge on a granted surety in the Suretly app. Totally 237614 SUR-tokens and 28728 wSUR-tokens were issued, including additional 10% issued to the option pool for rewarding current and future employees. These team tokens cannot be sold till August,11, 2018. Now they are stored there: SUR and wSUR. Creation of new tokens  is not considered.  Buy&Burn  Starting the 3rd quarter of 2018 Suretly will start transferring 0.2% of each loan secured by its participants to SURcoin This money will be used by SURcoin pte.ltd to buy tokens from exchanges. All purchased tokens will be burned.   Media coverage  Blockchain News: Crowdvouching Loan Service Suretly raises $2.8 million NewsBTC: What’s Coming Up in July? Suretly’s ICO is On its Way!
