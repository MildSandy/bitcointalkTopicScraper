Influential personalities and teams are approaching us now willing to unite efforts to build software together and this has been our goal - to unite community around the problem that exists in trucking.  The way how we came to blockchain was natural - we kept digging looking for technology that we thought would be the right fit for us. It was evolution from SPA + RESTFul backend to Microservices with Kafka, then we turned down entity-oriented frameworks and equipped ourselves with event sourcing and CQRS, and eventually blockchain being in a way the distributed event-sourcing system.  Our key vision is that it is impossible to build solution for trucking industry alone, therefore we are working on the platform that will be available for everyone to build on top.
