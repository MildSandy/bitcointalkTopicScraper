""Darcrus is both the name of the total project as well as the first token of the project. The token can be seen as a representation of the value of Sigwo Technologies. 10% of net profits of Sigwo Technologies will be used to buy back and burn Darcrus from the market.  Darcrus started as an asset on the Nxt blockchain but has recently been swapped to the Waves blockchain. A choice, widely supported by current Darcrus holders.  There are several reasons for the swap. Waves is more user friendly than Nxt. Mercury and Darcrus availability in the same wallet will unify our project and extend our reach. Furthermore, in this case a DAR-MER trading pair will exist. Sasha Ivanov is a no-holds-barred CEO with great plans to bring Waves to the mainstream. He is very supporting of projects on Waves which turns into validation and confirmation to his contacts.

Mer on the other hand is the native token of the ecosystem and is not any token, so it has been listed now  Overall this is a great development Its also wise to accumulate DAR at these low prices, it is already a very low circulating coin and with coin burn you can expect it to give you a decent bit of dividend in the future  The team is active on the discord if anyone wants to join in =) the joining links is on the official twitter.",False

I would like to point out to one of the main papers that brought much attention to these type of attacks. The author has a link  to the paper (in pdf format) if you may search for the title on google.  http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2813651   Title: Inference Attacks on Property-Preserving Encrypted Databases. Authors:   Muhammad Naveed   University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA Seny Kamara   Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA Charles V. Wright   Portland State University, Portland, OR, USA  Abstract: Many encrypted database (EDB) systems have been proposed in the last few years as cloud computing has grown in popularity and data breaches have increased. The state-of-the-art EDB systems for relational databases can handle SQL queries over encrypted data and are competitive with commercial database systems. These systems, most of which are based on the design of CryptDB (SOSP 2011), achieve these properties by making use of property-preserving encryption schemes such as deterministic (DTE) and order- preserving encryption (OPE). In this paper, we study the concrete security provided by such systems. We present a series of attacks that recover the plaintext from DTE- and OPE-encrypted database columns using only the encrypted column and publicly-available auxiliary information. We consider well-known attacks, including frequency analysis and sorting, as well as new attacks based on combinatorial optimization.  We evaluate these attacks empirically in an electronic medical records (EMR) scenario using real patient data from 200 U.S. hospitals. When the encrypted database is operating in a steady-state where enough encryption layers have been peeled to permit the application to run its queries, our experimental results show that an alarming amount of sensitive information can be recovered. In particular, our attacks correctly recovered certain OPE-encrypted attributes (e.g., age and disease severity) for more than 80% of the patient records from 95% of the hospitals; and certain DTE- encrypted attributes (e.g., sex, race, and mortality risk) for more than 60% of the patient records from more than 60% of the hospitals.  Does your work protect against inference attacks and can you explain why or whynot?  P.s The idea is cool but needs to be safe before investing.",False

Furthermore, NXT will be undergoing a huge transformation into Ardor network which NXT will be (Most likely) less progressive on development compare to Ardor. Waves has full stack developer and IMO, i like waves platform more as the lite client use less memory and it is real user friendly",False

On September 15th, the exchange will facilitate a snapshot of users’ balances. Any account containing DAR (nDAR) will be automatically credited with the new token (wDAR) at a 1:1 swap ratio. Deposits must be confirmed by September 15th at 6:00pm PDT (September 16th at 1:00am UTC) and any transactions not confirmed (including ‘pending’) will not be eligible for the swap on Bittrex. Please ensure you get all your Darcrus to Bittrex prior to the swap deadline. The article can be found here and is also quoted below: Darcrus (DAR, Nxt asset ID 13239408659357180542) will be swapping from the Nxt blockchain to the Waves blockchain with asset ID K5JcgN8UdwNdh5sbdAuPMm5XEd5aFvoXaC3iHsHVz1d. Users’ Darcrus exchange balance totals will reflect the same total that they had prior to the swap in a 1:1 manner. The old Darcrus tokens will no longer be supported or be traded on Bittrex. Bittrex will enable the new Waves asset DAR market when we and the Darcrus team agree the migration is satisfactory. Note: Bittrex will be closing our DAR wallet and stop trading the token to take accurate snapshots of balances. If any DAR deposits you had sent to Bittrex are not settled (e.g. marked as pending) by 6:00 pm PDT on 9/15/2017 (1:00 am UTC on 9/16/2017), you may not be credited with DAR. We would like to thank the Darcrus team for working closely with us. Further information: Community voting results for swap approval Besides the Bittrex swap our team will provide an additional swapping option, which gives you the possibility to swap your Darcrus until December 31st, 2017. Any Darcrus not claimed before that date will be donated to the Darcrus development and marketing fund.

Most people have no idea the impact these buy back programs can have. It will take time to play out but I'm stocking up on projects that offer these.

My opinion that Mercury is potential sleeping giant.  Quote from: BonzoCorleone on May 31, 2017, 12:05:24 PM   ""There have been some questions about Mercury in Slack and on Bitcointalk, so I wanted to lay out some points of emphasis on the subject. Mercury enables Sigwo Technologies to transact on Waves’ public blockchain without ever using a Waves coin. The first use case for Mercury is copying Jupiter’s block ID to Waves. With this test case and subsequent acceptance of Mercury by the Waves’ ecosystem, we now have a fully functional token that can be used to issue tokens, have our own Lite Wallet, and possibly have a Mercury-denominated DEX. The possibilities are limited to your imagination. I am very excited to see Mercury and the ideas that can come to fruition on this platform.""  https://blog.darcr.us/ http://www.sigwo.com/",False

They pay in fiat for the use of Jupiter, the actual software platform.  -Will holders of the token get a percentage of the TX fees when people use the public blockchain (Like PoS coins)? If not where do these fees go? No, there are no fees paid in Darcrus.  -Also could you please elaborate on how the buy back and burn system works, what happens when these coins get to a low supply over the years? If businesses need these tokens to pay for transactions fees on the public blockchain, won't it eventually get to the point when the tokens become too expensive for them to buy to make it worthwhile? Invalid question due to no Darcrus tokens being used as fees.  -Finally, what is the link between Mercury & Darcrus? One of the products of Sigwo Technologies is to provide a private blockchain for its clients, called Jupiter. There are various fully customizable software packages available for different needs to protect, encrypt and store data on the Jupiter blockchain. However, because it is a private blockchain people could accuse insiders to have modified the data. This is where Mercury shows up. This Waves asset is used to connect the private chain with the public Waves blockchain. Every blockhash of the private blockchain is automatically timestamped to the public one, with Mercury used as transaction fee. This timestamp is used as the public prove nobody modified the data.  So to recap, the power of the Mercury token is its cross-chain capability and the dual-chain provenance for the products being sold. This all results in a continuous circle, because the company needs to buy MER for the dual-chain provenance, miners accept this as fee and may sell it on the market again. Please read the blog (https://blog.darcr.us) (https://faq.darcr.us/content/1/14/en/what-is-the-darcrus-ecosystem-in-a-nutshell.html)  I hope this clears things up a bit.",False

This is yoyoamigo from the WAVES Community. I am not from WAVES, not a member of their Team or Company.  this is a simple recap of all activities and news for the past week.  i am doing this out of contribution for WavesPlatform and to all ICO tokens using it. As well as for the communities involved.   Reason? Ever since the WAVES WEEKLY came to an end temporarily, i had thought it would be something good to have while waiting for it to come back. In addition, i feel that those that are on WavesPlatform shouldn't be left out of this. i would like to see WavesPlatform and all those who are part of it rise up together in full force. Not one without the others.  No payment is required. Also, all images used below are CC0 (Creative Commons) a.k.a. free for public use. Mostly from Pixabay.com and Dreamstime.com. And a few of my own. So rest assured  I only asked that you allow me to leave a logo of WAVES in the image you see below and a link to WavesPlatform website and to its recap as well. As you can see, you will not find any other cryptocurrencies here except yours and WAVES. This is done so as to respect your space and the community's attention. for the other cryptocurrencies as well.  if you feel the recap is good enough, you are free to share & tweet the 'Recap"" image below. Remember to add the link above this message to the tweet. whoever clicks on it will be directed to this recap. the link is just above this message, just above where the date is. that link. a small request, add 3 hashtags to your tweets ""#wavesplatform #ico #crowdfund"" if you can. Thank you. For the community, please liked it or retweet it as well.  If you want to ensure that all news and activities are to be included into this recap, be sure to tweet it or blog it. If, however, there are no news for the entire week, i will not post any recap. So be sure to have at least one. news and activities are only inclusive of new information. old, duplicated or repeated ones will be excluded from the recap. However, do not trouble yourself about re-posting an old news. I will be able to find out if its new or not. So leave the work to me. =)  If you only a few news now, it's alright. this recap is not meant to put to shame. But in the future, you can rest assured that i will be covering those many news. If it takes months to build a house, then it will take months. If it takes hours to bake a cake, then so shall it be. Hope everyone understands this.  Thank you and enjoy the recap.

As I stated in Slack, I had to attend a training exercise in Texas for about 3 weeks. While I was not able to use the commercial internet for most of the time, I still made headway with Darcrus, Jupiter, and Sigwo Technologies. I’ve been testing on NXT’s testnet for 2 months, validating my design of decentrally storing and encrypting syslog/authorization messages from my Linux servers. In my testing, I found increased fees were needed to be paid due to the complex nature and size of my messages.  After consulting with the NXT Core Devs, Sigwo Technologies will be securing it’s own blockchain for building the future platform. Jupiter is the name of the base platform, and Jupiter will have plugins built for anyone or business that needs to store data for any reason. Governments, housing data, customer data, schools, medical, and almost anything can be linked and stored for provenance, accountability, and recoverability with each save.  http://imgur.com/23gxn8a.png New logo for Jupiter  The reason behind creating Jupiter is simple…Using any other blockchain would not be economically feasible. One example of my encrypted syslog application would create 29 million messages daily. In NXT terms and today’s prices, that would cost this particular business $1,238,300.00 per day to store messages, not to mention needing to use 174,000,000 NXT each day. This demand would spike the NXT price, increasing the ~$1.2M per day to even more extraordinary costs. This is just one example application.  Jupiter’s base is open source, and will be stored on Github upon completion. Jelurida is the company building Jupiter and have a proposed delivery date of March 10th, 2017. In this time I will be starting plugins (dappsheets) to showcase the flexibility of Jupiter while I wait. I still test on the NXT testnet for now. Jupiter will have non-tradable tokens that are included in software packages to create transactions and store the data on the blockchain. After a time period, tokens are recycled to the businesses to continue their use of Jupiter and it’s plugins. Data is always theirs, as simply having the passphrase will unlock all the data stored. The recycling period is akin to a subscription and support package.  As for C3 Technologies, Stan and I are in contact for a proof of concept. He is on a business trip and upon return we will be meeting up to finalize the testing software and procedure. PoC will be coming soon, as I am working on the concept from previous discussions of what Stan would like to see. The roadmap is still on course, albeit a bit later in the months listed due to the Jupiter code delivery.  Sigwo Technologies will be getting a website redesign in the coming weeks. I wanted to wait until our new logo was completed. Sigwo Technologies has also subscribed to Cision, a well known marketing, PR, and media introduction tool. Stay tuned.  http://i.imgur.com/UOSexc3.png Sigwo Technologies  Source: https://blog.darcr.us/february-update-c32bb0946c48",False

It would be technically possible to have a decentralized, distributed database which didn't reproduce all of its data on every computer.  For instance, if 10000 computers have a blockchain, it isn't really necessary to reproduce 100% of it on each and every computer, especially for some types of data for which malicious attempts to modify are less likely.  A more moderate number of copies of each portion would suffice.  Maybe that is what Jelurida is doing.  Or maybe it is doing something else, if there is something I am overlooking.",False

That is why I decided to make the transactions essentially free for customers. They are paying for software, engineering, and support from Sigwo Technologies.  It's not where the data is stored, but that it is stored/transacted at all. It is the cost of the 'transaction' or the save, not the replication. You can stop the transaction from some nodes by blacklisting them. Essentially, you can have Company A messages decentrally stored on all nodes except Company B nodes, which are blacklisted.

Banks are required to provide a money back guarantee (although in the case is not entirely the money could be returned because the guarantee institution would have set the limits, the governmental institutions of my country to do so) 2. in saving Customers do not bear the risk. Because the banks that bear the risk, the general rule is the banks have to accept a huge advantage. That means that the customers should receive a small profit. Then the savings is not known as an ideal place to invest.  While investment is an ideal place to put the money in order to profit. Investment would provide greater benefits than savings due to two things: 1. The investment company did not provide money back guarantee. 2. Investors bear the risk Because investors bear the risk then the general rule is the investor should receive a large profit.  And it is a fact that prevailing in the economic society of any country.  As for concerns about the scam or losses in investments, was reasonable.

I ask questions so I can make sound financial decisions. I treat the money I put into digital currencies the same as the money I put into my traditional portfolio. This is exactly why I asked questions on this thread to begin with and precisely why I became more antagonistic when I was not answered. EBST was an experiment to demonstrate in small numbers how much loss is appreciated when one invests in an ICO. .15 BTC is not an investment. It is an experiment.   I posted reasonable questions as a potential buyer. I have not only not had any of my questions about the project answered but I have been vehemently attacked as a result of asking questions. Each ""I'm ignoring you"" or other snide reply gets me going even more, so keep it coming folks paid advertisers.    I would never put money into something the creator cannot justify or produce a sound, high-quality whitepaper for. For this project, the developer responded to my question on page 25 by avoiding giving an answer of any sort. He simply replied with a screenshot of a transaction and asked if I understood what he presented.  Steven: how would you respond to a potential business interested in your software. The same way you did to me as a potential investor?   This is not only typical tech-boi attitude, but it clearly shows he is hoping uninformed people will jump on his bandwagon. After all these insane comebacks at me for asking questions, I still do not know what makes this project superior to the project I mentioned a few pages back. I'll refrain from naming that again in fear that someone will claim I'm a troll for that project. :-| Love you guys. xoxo.",False

I apologize, I never ask non-English speakers to clarify based on language as I think it's rather presumptuous to think everyone must speak English, but what are you saying?    Regarding the question regarding what the cost of the coin was before market ...  Any 'coin' in an ""ICO"" is sold for too much regardless of what the beginning price is. It does not matter what the price is per coin.There are FAR TOO MANY variables to consider for the common person (e.g., volume, fungibility, utility, distribution, total # of coins to exist, etc., etc., etc.). No lay person has the time or resources to take enough of these factors into account before an ICO launches in order to make a wise investment. The lay investor (i.e., those who actually have to dig into their wallets to get some XBT to invest) always loses in the immediate. They will appreciate, without fail, loss of value unless they sell when the coin is pumped or finds real world value. For these Bittrex ICOs, no lay person will make money since you are relying on a single market to open for trading.  Were any investors into this ... thing ... informed as to exactly when the market would open? Did Bittrex email you and say ""Hello, we are pleased to inform you that we have a working wallet for XXXX and trading will being in XX hours?"".  No. Because that is the design.    In the meantime, stay tuned for a dedicated website and community focused on preventing cryptofraud and ICO scams!   We urge anyone reading upon opening of trading hours on Monday morning, 1/1/17, or the next non-Holiday trading day to carefully examine recent 'ICOs' prior to buying up this commodity (even at the ""low prices after ICO launch""). Recent examples of simliar ICO schemes include: SingularDTV (SNGLS), EBoost (EBST), and TRIG Token (TRIG). The current crowdsale for Mega Flash is part of the same family of coin schemes meant to rip off unassuming people (https://bittrex.com/crowdfund/Mega). The latter will be receiving a two-part blog post to break down the project description as posted on Bittrex as the scheme is purposely meant to be unintelligible (to a disgusting extreme) by fledgling investors. Chronobank is currently being examined and needs additional time to determine level of fraud risk. While I have long enjoyed trading on the exchange, I will highlight the important consideration that all have been hosted by Bittrex.",False

GUI is a very important piece, as we can map the GUI to storage (transaction space) in any blockchain. Blockchain is important as long as we have the TX speed and space for the data that the business wants to store and protect. GUI makes the end user comfortable with the product, therefore a viable solution for many businesses and makes it an easier integration for the local IT shop when deploying. The GUI to an end user can look the same, be upgraded, changed, etc as the business sees fit. As you know, blockchains automatically replicate to like-minded nodes (IE same blockchain) wherever they have connections. We can limit (or not limit) these connections in the configuration files. You would have to lose all of your nodes to lose all of your data.  I stress so much about the GUI because regular businesses have no idea about blockchain tech. I can sell/talk/engineer solutions for businesses without having to try and explain bitcoin and all the other things that go along with it. Most of them don't know how SQL works either....",False

Token distribution will be on/about December 28th, 2016 right into your Bittrex exchange acccount.  Old v1 thread (BTC was refunded due to not meeting 1000 BTC goal) https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1676111.0  DISTRIBUTION ━ A TOTAL 50,000,000 DAR WILL BE DISTRIBUTED AS FOLLOWS:  Below are the full terms for the Darcrus Crowdfunding campaign. These conditions will not change during the crowdfunding period. No prior asset payment schedule is brought forward from SIGFARM or SIGWONET. Of the 50,000,000 TOTAL Darcrus tokens, Bittrex will host 42,000,000 tokens for the ICO at a different pricing levels. Below is the pricing schedule:  Early Bird:    2500 satoshi each, 10,000,000 available (40,000 DAR per BTC) Phase 1:        4000 satoshi each, 13,125,000 available (25,000 DAR per BTC) Phase 2:       5000 satoshi each, 10,500,000 available (20,000 DAR per BTC) Phase 3:       6000 satoshi each, 8,375,000 available (16,666.67 DAR per BTC)  42,000,000 Darcrus Tokens Available for ICO.  The crowdfund will run for 7 days beginning December 21st, 2016 at 11:00:00 PM PST (22 December 0700 GMT) and ending on December 28th, 2016 at 10:59:59 PM PST (29 December 0659 GMT). The crowdfund must raise a minimum of 250 BTC to be considered a success. Each phase unlocks a new development milestone Darcrus will fund and achieve with this ICO. Additional development will take place as Darcrus grows.  Early Bird: dAppsheet in JavaScript + buyback of 10% net profits on Bittrex Phase 1: Early Bird + additional 15% net profits (25% total) buyback on Bittrex Phase 2: Early Bird + Phase 1 + dAppsheet in Python Phase 3: All prior + Mining Farm with 50% net profits buy back on Bittrex  Tokens bought via buyback will be burned.  If success conditions are NOT met, all BTC will be refunded through a buy wall. Trading fees are not refunded under any circumstance.  Any coins not sold by the end of the 7-day crowdsale will be verifiably “burned” or destroyed by using the NXT built-in token deletion command or by Bittrex themselves.  42,000,000  FOR ICO PARTICIPANTS  5,000,000*  FOR CURRENT SIGFARM AND SIGWO ASSET HOLDERS  2,000,000*  FOR TECHNOLOGY, MARKETING, MAINTENANCE AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT     500,000  FOR ICOv1 BOUNTIES (read more on our blog).     500,000*  FOR ICOv2 BOUNTIES (read more on our blog).  Any tokens not sold in the ICO will be BURNED. Rates for payments above will be adjusted to the amount burned. For example, if 42% of total Darcrus are burned, the payments above will be reduced by 42% to ensure no party is receiving an unfair/undeserved amount.  *There are 5,371,282 outstanding SIGWONET and SIGFARM tokens. Current token holders start out at a 1:1 swap rate when swapping in either token. In the event the ICO is not fully funded and some of the Darcrus tokens are burned, the percentage of the amount burned will be subtracted from the swap. If the ICO is fully funded, the extra 371,282 above 5,000,000 will be burnt from the Founder's personal purchases of SIGFARM to ensure there is a fair and even 5,000,000 swap. NXT messaging will be used to reach out to the Founders. The same burn rule will apply to the 2,000,000 for the development fund and the 500,000 for the ICOv2 bounties.      ▮ Translations - Being updated from first ICO attempt.

1880,msg17237728,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1722137.0,,128779,Announcements (Altcoins),2016-12-20 02:44:37,sigwo,Hero Member,657,500,,[ANN] Darcrus (DAR) Blockchain Database Startup - Swap from Nxt to Waves Sep 15,"What is Darcrus? What is dAppsheet? Darcrus is a token that is tradable on NXT, Waves or any exchange that lists Darcrus. dAppsheet is the team’s first project utilizing Darcrus.  dAppsheet will decentralize a business’ application using blockchain technology and automatically replicate their underlying database to tailor any tracking, billing accounting , authentication or service desk application to their specific needs. This will ensure trust and security. We will offer consulting services to businesses who need assistance building their custom GUI for accessing their dAppsheet. Software developed by the team will be open source with the exception of NDA-signed software developed for clients.  Will there be rewards to investors for profits earned from purchases from by businesses/clients? Yes, a percentage of profits generated by mining and direct client purchases will be used to purchase Darcrus from the sell book of the major participating exchanges. These tokens will then be burned.  Where did the name Darcrus come from? Any particular meaning? Darcrus came from my head, and checking around to see if there were anything named this.  So Darcrus is going to be structured like a business seeking services and solutions to customers right? Darcrus is the tokenized software that powers (some) dAppsheet apps. Sigwo Technologies will use Darcrus projects (see roadmap) for its' consultancy business. Closely related to the structure of any service-providing entity; IE Microsoft, Arcsight, Snort, McAfee, etc.  Where did the idea for the logo come from? My daughter likes the wolf, so she picked a photo she liked and I had a designer wireframe it.  Are you creating your own blockchain or you'll be layering on to of other blockchains? Kinda both, but only fully private chains will be 'created'. The public chains will work from the platform in which they reside.  How many people are on the team? Right now, somewhere between 1 and 3. I'll add an operations manager and a JS developer in Jan/Feb.  Who would you say is Darcrus' biggest competitor? Factom is probably pretty close with their offerings, although I have not dug deep into anything they are doing. Possibly BigChainDB, although they seem to be missing any type of user interface.  Sounds like the Buyback process would keep the DAR market liquid, Is this something completely new? There is at least one coin that I know of that uses this model, but their profits come from trading (Gambit). Multipools for a certain type of coin (that I built many of) do the same thing, but only if the pool mines profitable coins _AND_ the community mines at that pool. Far too often, multipools are paid for and built, just to have the 'community' abandon the project the following week. This structure is an acceptable way to reward those who hold their coins for the long haul.  In the future is there anything the Darcrus project could be utilised for in the coming IoT boom? There could definitely be a market for Darcrus and IoT, but that is not our core focus right now. It could be added to the core focus, depending on funds raised. As with any enduring business, strategic plans are built 36-72 months out at a very high level. That strategy will be built in the first few months. Thank you for your suggestion, please keep the great ideas flowing.  Sig, will you be the lead developer of the project? Or will you be the CEO who is handling all things etc? Or both? Depends on if you are asking about January 2017 or January 2018. I will be on the search for an operations manager and lead developer fairly quickly. I will direct a good portion of my time towards spreading the word and solutions of Darcrus.  Would these tokens be used for licenses or something akin to that as described within the various use cases? Or would they simply be held as reward or value vehicles? Just wondering. I can see many use cases in IT infrastructures. The trick is to provide a product and service that a CIO or equivalent could get their head around.  Yes to both. Some companies will decide they need a nonpublic implementation, for example medical records. These companies can have our engineers design a totally private chain. To begin, this type of implementation does not require any 'check-in' with a public Blockchain. Some companies, like one that recently contacted me need their database public to verifiably prove the records exist and in what manner they exist. I will be hiring teams of sales and engineers, pairing them together in regions. From my regular current day job, I have many  industry contacts that are always looking for new tech and improved ways of giving the customer increased capability Tokens can be held, sold, or whatever you do with any other coin/token. There are many use cases and there is no trick. Simply show the value of the product to solve a business use case and support their business processes. A CIO doesn't need to know a thing about blockchain to see a value in automatic and  decentralized replication of data services with a double-click. They already accept a lot less with a lot more headache. If we go into a meeting trying to lead with 'this is  a blockchain....' we will get laughed out of the room most likely.  Any future plans to have a few companies pilot these projects? Yes. Sigwo Technologies will be the first to have a pilot dAppsheet. I have several businesses already reach out for a discussion and a security/consulting business want to discuss Universal Second Factor (U2F) in the near future.  The U2F is just a added layer of security to the applications on your platform right? It's like using Google Authenticator but instead of a phone you use a Trezor or YubiKey. The real work to be done is how to decentrally authorize users to certain aspects of a file store, database, web GUI, or bank account. I want to incorporate this into the core dApplication.  Why are you using an asset system for Darcrus ? What are the benefits? Asset have a inflation-less supply, thanks to token you can receive rewards in the future which come from sales, consultancy, providing support, data migration, making businesses life easier and safer and through providing them new features, deploying standard/custom versions of dAppshets, public versions can use Darcrus tokens as fuel (on Waves platform, as example) if they don't need to run on private chain, if company chooses private chain, it still needs to pay for the services we provide.  What are the differences between Darcrus and bigchaindb? I see that scalable database blockchain based already exists. They do not seem to be building complete solutions for businesses, rather just the backend database portion. Also, one size does not always fit all.  Will developers be able to build apps onto of the darcrus platform? I just want to be clear on this. I'm referring to Developers who are not part of the Darcrus team, open source if you will, adding value to your platform, much like how Darcrus will be adding value to the NXT platform, among others. Darcrus is not a platform, it is a middleware. For example, Waves is the platform, dAppsheet is the middleware that provides session connections via the Waves data transport layer. According to OSI, dAppheet is Layer 5 and up. Waves would take care of Layers 1-4. Darcrus will bring value to the entire blockchain ecosystem, not one particular 'currency'.  You said that you'll be pairing up sales and devs in different regions so these devs will need to be fluent in languages on all blockchains I would assume? As for regions, that is a future plan. For now we have these things called 'airplanes' that are made for us to travel in. We also have great technology to have virtual meeting rooms and remote presentations. This happens a lot in the business world, where the sales manager travels to the potential or current customer's site and the pre-sales engineer dials in remotely and conducts a demo.  Why should businesses or anybody with a database utilize dAppsheet ? and in summary how does it work ? Darcrus is an excellent solution if you have SLA requirements for ongoing uptime and data availability. dAppsheet will allow you to have robust copies of your database wherever you have a dAppsheet Node. It will ensure that you always have a verifiable database in multiple locations. In the case of an event your business will not see service disruption or data loss, except to see the DNS or load balancers failover to the available backend dAppsheet nodes. Changes to the dAppsheet database can only be done if you have access to relevant keys. Later in 2017, Trezor U2F authentication can also utilized for cryptographically verified logins.  How does dAppsheet utilise the blockchain? dAppsheets can use private chain AND private nodes or use public nodes as a private chain. There is 100% flexibility. dAppsheets will use Darcrus if they are on a public node. On a private node, there is no requirement for Darcrus as of now. In the future, private nodes could be required to publish 'checkpoints' in a public node. Darcrus gains value from the buyback program as discussed in the OP.  Can Darcrus and dAppsheet benefit and expand on another platform besides NXT? Companies that have signed up to use dAppsheets can choose to use Ethereum as their base platform, if that is their in-house developer’s specialty. The company may choose to select a Java implementation (NXT/Ardor) as well. The flexibility will be incredible and they will still retain the same underlying value of the blockchain decentralization.  dAppsheet is a generic term and businesses can choose their own name for their personalize system. Each dAppsheet can be the side/child chain of any compatible platform.  What kind of encryption/decryption and query response time are you looking at? The farther away data is from my geographical location, the more time consuming it will be to retrieve it. Are you going to have any hot spots for enterprises to avoid this issue? Encryption is done at tx (or data submission) time. decryption happens when data is pulled and a valid private key is presented. Query response time will vary, depending on the application it is providing services for. Retrieval of information for human viewing will be via web GUI, so the blockchain will not be the bottleneck here. Input latency will/can be as fast as a bitcoin transaction into the mempool, which is milliseconds. Blocks can be increased to store more data per TX, and the confirmation times can be lowered to verify blocks quicker. So instead of the '5-7 tx per second' bitcoin does now, you can increase blocks to 10mb and do 100 per second if needed. Also, if you need to grow, the dAppsheet can hardfork to increase with the business without expensive migrations. With technology such as Waves, they are projecting 1000's of transactions per second. As to the worldwide database, it is replicated across many places, but the data is whole at each location. For example, if I set my Sigwo Technologies database up, I would have my 'main' node in Stafford, VA with other nodes close to or on premise of the other locations. My data retrieval does not go across multiple nodes. Much like bitcoin, the entire database is on each node, replicated to all nodes.  If the company uses darcrus, for the public blockchain , do they need to hold an amount of coins or actually have to spend coins per action. The company does not need to hold any certain amount, but they will need some to pay for the tx fees to the publicly available chain (a private chain from Ethereum or Waves or NXT or Ardor) in Darcrus if that is how the base platform is built. For example, a public Waves dAppsheet, the company would need to have Darcrus to pay the Waves nodes the transaction fee.  What are your plans for a consultancy arm of the project? Given you said each GUI can be customised to a customer's needs, is that something that you envisaged paid professional services delivering. Or will it be so simple customers will expect to do this themselves, or is it just part of the base service? Answer by MX Steven is working daily in real life with similar businesses, data centers, databases, he is engineer, he is professional, he will be targeting the same and new businesses just by presenting own solution based on blockchain, there is a chance you will see some GUI during the ICO, we would like to present ready solution with nice GUI which can be accepted by customers at once and provide consultancy next additionally, yes GUI can be also customized for customer`s needs, a percentage of net profit from sales and consultancy will be added also to the buy back reward system.  There will be differing levels of 'ease' for a dAppsheet. But even if/when we build a 'GUI dAppsheet Customizer' businesses will still need the deployment and security expertise for integration --> migration of their data. Things in businesses are never 'light switch ready'  Can you elaborate on what you mean by powering 'some' of the dAppsheet apps? How will other dAppsheets run if not using DAR? And will you be hiring a sales team to go out and sell your services when your platform is ready? First part of your question: some companies will decide they need a nonpublic implementation....IE medical records. These companies can have our engineers design a totally private chain. To begin, this type of implementation does not require any 'check-in' with a public Blockchain. Some companies needs the database public to verifiably prove the records exist and HOW they exist. Yes I will be hiring teams of sales and engineers, pairing them together in regions. From my regular current day job, I have many industry contacts that are always looking for new tech and improved ways of giving the customer increased capability.  Are you creating your own blockchain or you'll be layering on to of other blockchains? Kinda both, but only fully private chains will be 'created'. The public chains will work from the platform in which they reside.  Am I right in saying that Darcrus and dAppsheet is looking to disrupt the Data Center industry. I mean it sounds like the problems Darcrus and dAppsheet is trying to solve are generally specific to Data Center services. At least where disaster recovery is concerned...How much data will allocated to each DAR? And how many entry credits to the network will each DAR represent?  No, not trying to disrupt the datacenter. There is no 'data per DAR’ unless you mean 'how big are the blocks' and the upper limit has not been set. I'm trying disrupt 'how' things are stored, replicated, accessed, and verified. The data is not stored like SIA or STORJ on private person's storage. The company's data is stored on their own hardware (or cloud solution if they choose) but the data is automatically replicated in full across the company's node system.  If you create a big blockchain database.  how will you cope with data bloat? how much data can be stored in a block and what is the Blocktime? Blockchain bloat is not a concern unless the company decides it wants to/requires to keep their database pruned. Block data storage and times are 100% customizable per implementation.  How can it be customizable? if they use your chain they need to comply with your transaction and confirmation times right? For example, I can fork NXT to a private chain and customize it. Each business can have its own Blockchain, meaning they can give the requirements.  So a company can delete data which is in your blockchain? No, a company (or anyone without proper authorization) can't delete anything from someone else's chain.  Why should they switch to using the blockchain ? if it does not cost anything more they will just leave it there. If all companies think the same it will bloat as hell. or are there some kind of side chains? Most companies do not have a storage size problem, they have a verification and recovery problem. The current organization I am working for has petabytes of info...that data isn't going to get magically smaller. But Darcrus will solve replication to our hot site, restoration of services, and verification of the data as it is written to the dAppsheet's blockchain. No more fumbling with data archive tapes, outdated or non-licensed software, and broken restoration polices because they are too long or incur downtime that is not 'worth the risk to the company'....until you need that data recovered.  I was reading about an example about medical records of a hospital being stored on a private chain, and as we know when we want to obtain a copy of these records we have to pay them as the system stands currently with fiat. so would we be able to pay for access to our medical records on the chain using dar tokens, but the payment would be thru the public ledger? When you go to the hospital's site, you pay in fiat and it would be up to the hospital's prerogative if they converted to DAR on the backend. The DAR payment would be on a public chain. I honestly do not see this part happening, as DAR is not a currency 'replacement' token.  Can dAppsheet help in anyway to get medical records online and still be in a secure manner without having to go to the hospital or having them mail it but actually getting it through the chain Yes, 100% , a hospital can provide outside connection to the records. But I honestly do not see it happening due to current HIPPA regulations and the risk the hospital would have to be comfortable with. This could happen in 5-7 years though.  When in future hospitals can legally use a decentralized database, would the Darcrus team need to be involved to make this hasten or would the hospital IT administrators be able to handle this from their end? It will depend on how competent their team is. I want to provide a complete solution, but implementing something that has 1 2 3 instructions  is still too much for some. There are opportunities for us to have administrators assigned to deploy a dAppsheet as an onsite admin, basically in this scenario we become a contracting company for services and personnel.  With customers' data being in the blockchain, I assume that customers will be able to access their data from anywhere in the world with a internet connection? This, again, is up to the business policy for that particular company.  Is dAppsheet hacker proof? It is not hacker proof, it protects any info that's hacked with encryption. Thus making the hacked information essentially useless. Hacked information can be properly secured as for example was BTC-E database, which is stolen from few years but properly secured and not cracked as of now.  As most businesses use Microsoft for their data requirements, what will the platform be built on? It 100% depends on the business. I know that one implementation will be built from our alpha NXT w/ Nodejs and React GUI version. NXT will run on Windows, Linux, and MacOS.",False
