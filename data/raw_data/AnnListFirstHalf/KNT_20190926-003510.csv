Keen is the modern solution to the greed and bullying of large ride sharing corporations like Uber, Lyft and Didi Chuxing. It is the next evolution of ride sharing and advances in a true libertarian spirit of decentralized blockchains. Governance is run by its community of riders and drivers with reputation algorithms helping it to exist and adapt autonomously.  Several issues are tackled with this solution which seeks to find its niche among the ever growing demand for urban ride hailing that will become a $230 billion industry by 2030. Given the recent stories in media, there is no doubt that a platform like this is a necessity to bring an end to this dinosaur era of ride sharing and usher in a new era where the power is in the hands of the community.     The Problem  Ride-hailing services that are controlled by corporations require special permits to offer such services to the customers. If the operation is not permitted then these services mobilize public support backed by lobbyist to pressurize the regulators in order to change such regulations. This process is not sustainable and centralized ride-hailing services have greatly failed to expand as a result of their inability to penetrate into countries and cities that would otherwise have a great demand for the services. For locations where this has been achieved, often it includes reaching compromises with local municipalities on new regulations and company policies.   There have been known cases where concerns regarding safety standards of centralized ride-hailing services have been raised as despite of receiving multiple complaints related to their drivers, these services choose to keep the drivers without any restrictions or penalties to maintain their competitiveness against other ride-hailing services. There have been cases where these services have admitted their employees accessing private data of its users for questionable purposes.   Ride hailing corporations want to keep a significant commission from the trip fare for themselves. This commission is taken from the normal fares and in case of surge fares the commission recovered is even higher. Ideally, surge fares should be applied in case of a higher demand for rides, but off-course the corporations do not provide any means to determine the authenticity of such surcharges.    The Solution  A purely decentralized ride-hailing service that nobody controls can penetrate into markets that ride-hailing platforms under ownership of corporations cannot. Drivers and riders can interact directly through a purely peer-to-peer mechanism that has no centralized parties involved.   A service that can be self-governed through the community of riders and drivers where everyone that is part of community inherently runs the operations of the platform, Keen uses a decentralized governance mechanism based on Proof-of-Loyalty (PoL) algorithm. The authenticity of the drivers, riders and their rides taken will be determined by the system based on behavioral aspects to detect any attempts to defraud the system.   No one will be taking any cut from the ride fare and the entire fare paid by the rider goes to the driver. Drivers will get to set their own rates and this will create a competitive landscape for everyone as drivers with the lowest rates and highest ratings will be given priority in getting rides. Drivers will be able to see rates being offered by other drivers in their geographical region so they can adjust their own rates. Also, riders will have the option to set their preferred rates for a ride for drivers within the vicinity to accept.   Keen Tokens  Keen Tokens (KNT) will be used for payments and tipping to drivers through the Keen platform. Also, the tokens will be transferable between users within the Keen platform through the built-in app wallet. Transfer fees will only be charged in case Keen Tokens are transferred through the app wallet or using any other third-party wallet to transfer the tokens i.e. no fees will be charged if the tokens are being transferred as ride fare.  As the number of riders and drivers increases so will the transactions volume and this will increase number of tokens that are staked in the platform. Accordingly, circulating supply of Keen tokens that are not staked in the platform goes down with user adoption as users will keep tokens in platform to pay for the rides, get rides faster / cheaper, get more weightage in terms of ratings and to get free on-boarding rides . Also, validators will be required to stake their tokens in the platform as part of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus system.  Hence, price of each token will rise in value as number of users and validators on the platform keeps on increasing.

No information regarding any of the clients can be released, this is in line with the privacy policy and from a technical standpoint it will be of limited importance as well. Everything regarding the project itself will be accessible as it becomes available. Keen will be running on a trimmed down version of Ethereum (codenamed: KeenNet) that will be optimized for the platform so Keen Tokens (KNT) will be ERC-20 standard tokens but won't be accessible over Ethereum's mainnet. Total of 10% of the maximum supply of 70,000,000 KNT is available during the pre-sale phase and we'll like to allow our investors to transfer / distribute the tokens as they like. Pre-sale participants will receive Keen Future Tokens that will be ERC-20 standard tokens on Ethereum's mainnet but we do not intend to list these tokens on any of the exchanges and any transfers have to be outside the exchanges. Keen Future Tokens will be swapped at a 1:1 ratio with KNT when the mainnet goes online in Q2, 2018.",False

Knowing about the team behind it will give investors confidence, bring accountability and trust on your technical proficiency to deliver the product.  Edit: Not asking for disclosing specific information about clients and projects, but at least make public the main team, names, linkedin profiles, experience, etc. As is right now we'd be sending money to an anonymous guy with a website and an idea.

Honestly, we did not want to bloat the whitepaper with unnecessary details that would add no value for the contributors or community members and make the whole document bulky. With that being said, off-course we completely understand that there will be few investors who would have specific queries regarding the project before they invest and they might not find it anywhere so we do respond to any and all queries here and at hail@keenplatform.com usually within 24 hours.  Agree to your query regarding the team, there are a few technicalities that are being sorted out and the team will be announced soon. As you must be aware that there are numerous blockchain projects that identify big names as their team members none of whom are in any way related to the project itself, in case of Keen everything needs to be transparent and unclouded, this is the first and foremost priority. Till then, any potential investor who needs to talk over email, Skype, WhatsApp or phone with the core team simply needs to ask.  Also, we will be announcing the bounty campaign soon.",False
