Here our IT team will post weekly updates about developing the product so everyone can follow our progress. But first, let us remind you what World Wi-Fi is all about.  There are three types of users in the system, according to the project business model. Owners of private routers can distribute free internet and receive rewards for advertising impressions by connecting to World Wi-Fi. Advertisers get their target audience and thus optimize their advertising costs. Regular users get access to free internet by viewing a short ad.  The system is developed with the help of Big Data technology, which is used to collect and analyze non-personified user activity data. Thanks to this technology, advertisers can show their advertising to those who can actually find it interesting. The use of a blockchain technology makes transactions between process participants fast and cheap, while smart contracts guarantee security for all the parties involved.  In this blog, developers headed by Ilya Yashin (CEO of World Wi-Fi), will talk about how the project is progressing and what has already been done. The work on the World Wi-Fi system has been underway since mid-2017 and now the network is being tested. We will be updating the program code on Github, use this link to familiarize yourself with it.  The entire architecture of the project is written with the object-oriented JavaScript language. The server-side portion is written with Node JS. This is a programming platform based on V8 engine (it translates JavaScript into the machine language code), which transforms a narrow focus specialized JavaScript into the universal programming language.  The visual part is written with the language React JS, which is a library for the interface development created by Facebook.  First part of the code presented on Github is dedicated to authentication and authorization of users of World Wi-Fi system. For user’s maximum convenience, a possibility of registration and login through accounts of social networks Google, Facebook and VK has been provided.  Blockchain-platform World Wi-Fi will unite advertisers, owners of routers and internet users in a single network. Three types of accounts with different functionality will be created to organize the work of the whole system:  1. Advertiser: a user can create advertising campaigns and set their parameters. View statistics, manage employee accounts, pay bills, and change the profile.  2. Advertisement distributor (Wi-Fi router owner): a user has access only to the list of his Wi-Fi points and to all operations for their management. Three interfaces that interact with the system are available as well: Router interface, WiFi-identification interface and personal account.  3. Internet User: Internet users have to login on Hotspot. Only the Wi-Fi identification interface and Internet access are available here.  Next week the program code for the customizer of advertising campaigns will be presented, and beta testing carried out.  https://medium.com/@WorldWifi_ICO/developers-blog-1-9e59dbebc5d3",True

It can help people that do not have access to wi-fi connect in the internet, and also provide an incentive to those helpful people who are willing to provide free wi-fi.  Many people around the world do not have access to wi-fi as for many problems they face, whether it is in terms of financial issues, or availability of wi-fi in their place.

Market overview     According to UN Report on Global Broadband Progress dated September 18, 2017, the number of Internet users in the world is 3.58 billion people (the total population of the planet is 7.6 billion). Most users are now in developing countries—there are 2.5 billion users there, while developed countries have 1 billion.     Development of Wi-Fi networks  At the same time, there is a rapid spreading of Wi-Fi networks. They have virtually covered the whole world: according to ipass.com, at the beginning of 2017 the number of Wi-Fi points across the world amounted to 177,418,979.   Now, there are 262,262,359 Wi-Fi access points across the globe: · 82% are household Wi-Fi points. · 18% are public controlled Wi-Fi points.  From the beginning of the year, compared to 2016 indices, the number of points has increased by 48%. Over the last four years, the number of points increased nine-fold.  Advertisers  The demand for Wi-Fi advertising is growing: due to high accuracy and strong possibility that a real user will see it. But Wi-Fi advertising market was occupied by local monopolists based on geographical position. Restaurant and shopping mall networks broadcast advertisements in case of connection to open Wi-Fi in their premises, different operators have different targeting and conversion methods. At present there is no unified Wi-Fi advertising market, and pricing is often chaotic.    New advertising network  Modern advertising networks, e.g. AdSense, charge high fees. Advertising salesmen have to share 30-50% of profits with the platform, while most of it is spent on compensation of financial and bureaucratic costs of an advertising network.  In current conditions only several companies and popular bloggers whose platforms have large amount of traffic may count on significant advertising profit.  World Wi-Fi provides access to wide audience to the advertisers by means of connection to small private routers and sites. Internet access points owners are able to earn money by means of broadcast of advertisements. This is the way the promising advertising market inside the global Wi-Fi network is formed.  World Wi-Fi Business Model  The World Wi-Fi charges advertisers a fee of 5% of the cost of the advertising shown in the network of connected routers. The above fee applies when generating a budget before allocation of tokens to router owners.  Road map   Join World WI-FI Community                            ",True
