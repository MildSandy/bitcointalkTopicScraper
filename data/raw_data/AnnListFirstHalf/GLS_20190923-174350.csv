We have made a huge effort to get to know the cryptocurrency community and to find out what issues are most important to them. Over the last couple of weeks, in light of some recent, major, news stories, we have been getting one question over and over again: How is Gelios different from Bitconnect?

We have special bonuses for investors. Now - 30%. We see big interest to our project all over the world. Gelios is a cryptocurrency lending marketplace. The mission of the Gelios platform is to provide a whole new level of flexibility to the lending industry. Gelios utilizes a decentralized credit bureau built using the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain infrastructure to allow people from all over the world to receive capital. This capital may be used for various purposes. These may include personal finance, SME financing, or long-term loans. Gelios aims to provide a “pure platform” approach, that enables different parties to interact, communicate. This approach will lead to synergy in work and a better credit process. The main operative function of the Gelios platform is to bring potential creditors and borrowers together by way of a matching mechanism. This mechanism helps both parties reach a consensus on the period of the loan, the interest rate, and the identification and validation procedure. This will make the borrowing process fast, easy, and available online to anyone, anywhere. GLS token is based on ERC-20 that is why the payment is preffered in ETH.

In effect, trust serves as the driver of the system. On typical platforms, companies prefer to use standard databases, which don’t actually do anything to save you from hack-fraud (see Equifax incident, September 201714) or from the risk of fraud from the system itself, such as when a higher rating is given to someone in exchange for money. The Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain is used by Gelios to implement statistics about participants, and is perfect to ensure trust between participants in the system itself, and between the system and the customer.",False

The Gelios platform allows people from all over the world to raise capital, and aims to increase prosperity and reduce poverty worldwide. The basic function of the platform is to provide a matching mechanism, facilitating creditors’ and borrowers’ coming together. What’s more, the mechanism helps the two parties to find consensus on the period of the loan, the interest rate, and the identification and validation procedure, making the process of borrowing fast, easy, and available online to anyone, anywhere. The basic function of the token in the Gelios ecosystem is to provide value with no dependency on the country of residence of any participant of the platform. Location, language and race are non-issues on the Gelios platform. Smart-contracts are considered by many in the financial sector to be an excellent tool for the facilitation, by way of the blockchain, of money-transfers. Their implementation is the result of the agreement between two parties to make a microtransaction on the blockchain. The smart contract ensures rewards for webmasters, who provide leads to creditors, and for collectors, who help creditors to be paid back for loans. Verifiers are an irreplaceable part of the system, and are rewarded for helping creditors to verify the identity of the person applying for credit despite long geographic distances. http://post-gelios.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/distribution.png?v=2 http://post-gelios.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/h2/h2-05-team.png http://post-gelios.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/team.png http://post-gelios.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/h2/h2-07-media.png KYC Providers for Gelios Marketplace Users (cryptocoinsnews.com) Although blockchain technology was initially conceived as a decentralized means for money transfer, lately it has become so much more.

As you may know yesterday in Belarus in was legitimized. At THIS time also there are cases when borrowers were forced to return cryptocurrency loan - https://bitnovosti.com/2015/07/04/judge-rules-in-peer-to-peer-bitcoin-lending-lawsuit/ (you can translate by Google translator) Scoring is the way for risk-analysts to score most suitable / solvent borrowers for lenders to make higher annual rate for lender; also providing the amounts of money for borrowers, that can help him in current situation but also that can be comparable to his incomes. Risk-analysts use mobile app metrics (more than 100), KYC marketplace for identification, and blockchain-based credit bureau to score customers. Collectors are the essential part of the platforms to return the loan using soft collection tools (calls, sms, messengers) in case of loan delay. The work of collectors and their restrictions will be completely described in platform’s users agreement. If the person goes default on the loan, his/her credit score on the platform marked as “bad” and it is way harder to get the next loan. While there are KYC providers on the platfroms, the person will not be able to register on the platfrom one more time / fraud.",False

Gelios is specializing on non-collateral loans. It’s not said straight in WP (but there will be big release very soon), but all the expertise of Brainysoft, functionality of using Hyperledger-Fabric-based blockchain as decentralized credit bureau and developing platform for collectors also say about it. If you use collateral in crypto, the smart-contract just gets it, you don’t need collectors    If not: lenders will not be incentivized to lend to anyone.  Lenders are encouraged to lend by economical principles, as annual return for lender may vary from 15 to 100% annualy, if to speak (for example) about risk-algorithms that will be focused on India or Africa. Check collateral loans rates - they are much lower.   If yes: that's like going margin long on a coin while using another as a collateral, why whould i use this platform if i can do that more easily on almost any exchange?  Nothing relates Gelios with margin lending on exchanges, the purpose of the exchanges and lending platforms are different in its basics. In case of exchanges trader forced to close position due to margin call or take-profit, the purpose of the loan is trading only. On Gelios borrower is not a trader (mainly), the purpose of the loan is different from trading in 99% and the term (timing) of the loan is gathered during the process of requesting of the loan.  Seems strange to me that a project that presents itself as ""P2P crypto lending"" does not answer those questions straight away.  As you may saw, the documents of the platform are just forming to its ideal state, never heard Facebook or Amazon being perfect from the very start, just to mention. All the way thank you for your feedback.",False
