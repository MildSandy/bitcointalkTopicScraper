Why not US citizens?  How about dual US/Filipino or other dual citizenship individuals? Interested article regarding this in... https://themerkle.com/why-cant-us-citizens-participate-in-cryptocurrency-icos/  To put this into perspective, the United States is quite strict when it comes to investment regulations. Only accredited investors can partake in private placements of securities. While some people would urge all cryptocurrency ICOs are tokens and not securities, regulators will have a very different opinion regarding this matter. A  lot of the ICOs we have seen can be labeled as traditional sales of equity.  As is to be expected, the team organizing a cryptocurrency ICO cannot guarantee only accredited US investors will partake. They can take the necessary steps to prevent most US citizens from investing, although these measures can be bypassed. Right now, the ICOs tend to ask if you are a US citizen, but there is no verification of whether or not one speaks the truth. Some projects use geolocation to block US citizens, but those can be bypassed with a proxy or VPN. It is impossible to prevent US citizens from participating, but these measures have to be taken regardless.  Some of the bigger cryptocurrency ICOs will ensure they hire lawyers who can create a more “workable” environment for interested parties. If they would not take these steps, their entire token sale would be liable to criminal charges in the US. That is, assuming the SEC would ever decide to investigate a particular crowdsale for those specific reasons. It is highly unlikely that will happen, even though the SEC is looking to regulate ICOs moving forward.  Once the SEC will effectively intervene in cryptocurrency ICOs – which is only a matter of time – things will get very interesting, to say the least. A lot of previous ICOs didn’t take the necessary steps to “deny” US citizens from investing. All of those projects and their teams are at the mercy of the SEC for the time being. Violating US securities laws is not something anyone wants to deal with. Additionally, these laws can also be enforced upon non-US companies, which makes it even more important to take countermeasures.  It is evident this unregulated space will be of keen interest to financial watchdogs all over the world in the coming years. The bigger question is how many companies will get burnt for not doing their due diligence. It is bad enough to know most of these projects may ultimately fail. Worrying about future criminal charges will certainly have a big impact on all of these crowdsales moving forward.  ........  I have seen ICOs that restricted sales to many  different countries.... US China SIngapore... so you must ask directly to the team always to be 100% sure! In this case.. as far as i know the restriction applies to all USA.... but you know there is a lot of people that find a way to invest hahaha this is cryptoworld! where dreams come true!",False

Thank you for your support for LoyalCoin's vision!   As for your comment about supply, we pegged it as such (10 billion for all LoyalCoins, including 4.75 billion for the launch) based on how much we intend to raise (up to $19 million, or $0.004 per LoyalCoin) and so that LoyalCoin is more accessible to the general public and let more people use our platform as early as possible.  After all, we're talking about rewards points here, and there's a lot of wastage going on in that front. Colloquy estimated that in the US alone, $50 billion worth of rewards points and air miles go unredeemed, and that's just as of 2011. In Canada, it's C$16 billion as of 2017. So our pricing and supply peg is actually more reasonable that at first glance, because of those humongous rewards points wastage that we're aiming to end via the blockchain  We do hope that LoyalCoin becomes one of the stable coins around the cryptocurrency world, because after all, we're linked to real-world applications such as rewards redemptions, which have set values and are market-oriented.",False

Token Generation Event (TGE) starts December 11, 2017 Pre-TGE starts November 11, 2017 REGISTER ON OUR WEBSITE! JOUN OUR TELEGRAM GROUP!  We are building an omnichannel loyalty ecosystem that will be the next generation of customer loyalty, or The Loyalty Economy. This ecosystem, which will include a new virtual currency, a digital wallet, a series of white label apps and other supporting software, and a coalition of supporting merchants, is set to change the current uninspired and value-deficient rewards points system to a value-focused, digital-based rewards system that will stand head and shoulders above traditional rewards programs. This virtual currency spearheading this new system is LoyalCoin.  Read our whitepaper here for more details  Plan and Vision  Imagine if the arbitrary, expiring, and limited points you earn from dozens of customer loyalty programs you don’t really keep track of are converted into permanent, wide-reaching, and tradable digital tokens that multiple merchants issue and accept under one unified system that easily trumps the traditional rewards arrangements we have now. As a virtual asset backed by blockchain technology, LoyalCoin makes that possible. And LoyalCoin’s use of this blockchain technology will enable a revolution in the customer loyalty space. The full extent of LoyalCoin’s capabilities will be exhibited through the LoyalWallet digital wallet, which enables one-tap earning of rewards, switching of rewards into more assets than ever before, and more. And LoyalCoin will be issued through the LoyalCoalition, a group of merchants that believe in our customer loyalty vision, as well as through merchants that make arrangements with LoyalCoin for the acceptance of our digital customer loyalty token.  With these revolutionary components of the loyalty ecosystem we are building, we aspire to be the company that changes the whole customer loyalty landscape into an ever-encompassing, omnichannel solution for customer retention and satisfaction.  Track Record and Opportunity  Appsolutely Inc., the company behind LoyalCoin, is a Southeast Asian startup that has delivered and patented the first mobile-based digital customer loyalty system in the Philippines in 2014. Since then, the company has launched digital customer loyalty solutions for dozens of merchants and companies, some involving global and market-leading brands, for more than 2,000 merchant locations, reaching more than 2 million active loyalty program participants in the process.  This is a key advantage LoyalCoin has in the cryptocurrency world. Most virtual currency launches are funded on the strength of the business plan they have set out. For LoyalCoin’s case, we have built the general infrastructure enabling the omnichannel, universal loyalty system, and we are showing a demonstration of such technology even before LoyalCoin’s TGE. For us, this TGE serves as a vehicle for us to widely and rapidly launch this technology we have developed, as well as to link with international companies for the mission of achieving the global loyalty system we have envisioned.  LoyalCoin Features  * Universal Rewards Redemption on Participating Merchants * Live Tracking and Consolidation of Rewards Points Across Participating Merchants * Payment Gateways and Digital Payments Facilities * Digital Asset Exchange and Conversion, Including Points to Other Currencies * Peer-to-Peer Transfer of Rewards and Exchangable Assets * Hybrid On-chain/Off-chain Design for Faster Transactions  Roadmap  November 2017: Proof of Concept for LoyalCoin, LoyalWallet, and White Label Apps December 2017: Security Audit First Quarter 2018: Public Launch of LoyalWallet, LoyalCoalition, and White Label Apps, and LoyalCoin Expansion Into US and Thailand Second Quarter 2018: Launch of Credit Card Integration and External Conversion Capabilities Third Quarter 2018: Launch of Payment Gateways for Digital Channels, Digital Payments Facility for Merchants, and Artificial Intelligence Features for Loyalty Programs, LoyalCoin Expansion Into The Rest of Southeast Asia and Europe  * We note that some of the milestones planned here may be moved to later or even earlier dates depending on circumstances, as we are actively in talks for partnerships with international companies that have expressed interest in LoyalCoin this early.

The Philippines has released a set of guidelines for bitcoin exchanges in the country last February. Long story short, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the country's central bank, only set security requirements and will only step in when the crypto is used in money laundering and terrorism financing activities. In August, the BSP granted licenses to two cryptocurrency exchanges, and this is the exact type of license that we are in the process of getting. As for the general sentiment regarding crypto, the BSP is striking a positive tone, in contrast to the heavy-handed approach of some of our neighbors.  To be honest, we are quite bullish about our prospects. Our current legal head, Richard Funk II, is a lawyer who headed the central bank's anti-money laundering compliance division.
