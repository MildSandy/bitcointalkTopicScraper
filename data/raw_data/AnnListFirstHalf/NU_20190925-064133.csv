We have been experimenting with a lot of ideas recently and the primary reason that this design stands out to us is that it truly captures the essence of our robust Multiplayer Infrastructure.  For a moment lets consider that each line is a communication channel and each intersecting point of the of the lines is a Service Provider/Masternode. In the event that any one of them unexpectedly goes offline the connectivity can then be routed through other channels and intersections (Service Providers/Masternodes) So with the presale now underway come join the future of multiplayer gaming.  https://medium.com/@networkunits/a-nu-design-729595b3f7f,False

Why should I put my Ether in this ICO and not in an other, what makes this ICO work? While I agree that there are many great projects out there to choose from, Network Units has some unique key points of interest: Network Units has two unique mining processes, firstly gamers can connect their wallets and participate in our verification process while they play games and earn tokens for doing so. Secondly, Computer and Server owners can rent out their unused bandwidth and processing power to developers and also earn tokens for doing so. Network Units will develop an easy to integrate Unity3D asset for developers to integrate into their own games. This asset will simplify network code development as well as simplifying their infrastructure needs So to conclude Network Units is a cryptocurrency that does not just target one group of people. But Gamers, Game Developers and Resource Owners. Additionally, our asset will be multiplatform and will be easy to integrate into Mobile, PC, Holographic, AR, VR devices and more.   If this project is working how many gamers can work with this blockchain, and do you have an indication how huge this will be in the near future? We all know the gaming industry is massive however our platform is built for multiplayer gaming. Even though multiplayer gaming is a portion of this industry it has been proven that gamers spend more money and time on multiplayer games than single player and in many cases, are actually willing to pay for micro transactions or subscription fees to play. With the power of the Blockchain we have a mechanism to provide the opposite. Rather than charge gamers we can reward those that want to participate in our verification process. This feature is going to drive more gamers to games developed with the NU framework. Developers that realize this will naturally want to utilize our platform with the added advantage of cheaper infrastructure costs due to NU making use of unused Processing Power and bandwidth. This automatically makes the NU platform more appealing than traditional and centralized alternatives. To answer your question more clearly, the more developers that integrate the NU framework into their games then the larger our platform will grow!   Is it easy to mine or rent out your computer space / internet bandwidth even if you are a normal gamer without to many experience with crypto/blockchain? Eventually this will be very easy to do. For experienced users they will be able to link their own wallets, for those that are less experienced we will handle the wallets for them. This allows anyone regardless of Blockchain experience to start earning tokens straight away.   Why is the pre-ICO quite long? There are multiple reasons for this decision. The volatility of the Cryptocurrency Market To allow us as much time as possible to grow the NU community To gain more interest in our project To improve the quality of our project.   Who picked the team and why did NU choose that team Initially the NU team is made up of the Evil Badger Game Studio based in Australia and New Zealand. As game developers we realized that the next stage of evolution for us would be multiplayer gaming. Rather than build an internal framework we wanted the ability to share it with other developers and their players. The Blockchain allows us to do it in a very unique manner that was previously unimaginable. Although as a company we have never done a Token Crowdsale before, we have a panel of extremely talented and knowledgeable Advisors with successful Crowdsale experience that have been indispensable in providing the guidance and resources that we need.
