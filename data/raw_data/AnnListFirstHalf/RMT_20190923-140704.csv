I never doubted in them since ama, but the way how they technically executed this (they did it even better than I suggested and tons of testing invested, they don’t allow mistakes) perfectly just shows how projects on Blockchain should actually be done. As a blockchain dev myself I am very strict and allergic at bad code and sloppy execution. I myself am developer in very successful and well known blockchain project(gambling) and vouch for this project and team. There is no question why all big venture capital is behind this. Their full app with credit card token purchase implemented (buying orders directly from exchange with fiat), company suregifts running business 4 years now (they have user base, merchant base), talking with top10 exchanges, marketing full run in 2 weeks, running on stellar network(ibm, stripe,...) is going to explode. They don’t hype, they just work behind and provide results, that’s the main reason token price is still low(500mio token circulation) at 3c. I made mistake not buying stellar at 2c last year(or even ripple for sake of profit), not wasting lifetime opportunity again.  (Sorry for grammar, phone, 1:30am and on vacation)",False
