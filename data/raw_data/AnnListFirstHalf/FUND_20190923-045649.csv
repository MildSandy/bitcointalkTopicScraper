Crypto markets are passing through the ‘ideal storm’. Is it a correction — will we see the recovery soon? On the other hand, is it ‘an epic failure’ of the basic cornerstones of crypto-economy?  Was it wise for Fund Platform to launch its ICO in the midst of the market turmoil?  Hope we know the answer. We have developed our concept of ‘mirror’ business models quite some time ago. The ‘mirror’ business model addresses the basics. It takes the real market need that has existed for decades and implements it in the most cost-efficient way that blockchain technology can bring. Fund Platform ’mirrors’ the proven retail marketplace concept first developed by E-bay in 1995.   Many of our team members are younger than E-bay. To complement it, we have a team from a reputable top-tier international strategy consultancy of MBB caliber that provides ongoing strategic and operational support to the management. There were the seed and VC investors who provided the initial funding for our pre-ICO in 2017 and deployed this team.    “I remember vividly that day in April 2000 when the dotcom bubble went burst,” recalls a managing partner who is in charge of the consulting team, adding that he had just received his bonus for 1999 and was thinking about where to invest.   The second half of the 1990s was a time of dotcom bonanza. Between 1995 and 2000, the Nasdaq Composite stock market index rose 400%.    In 1999, shares of many tech companies skyrocketed. For instance, the stock of the semiconductor and telecom company Qualcomm rose 2,619%, and a dozen other dotcoms saw growth exceeding 1,000%.   The dotcom craze brought in billions of dollars in venture capital and private investment to companies that turned out to have little to offer in terms of a viable business model or long-term strategy. Nobody thought at that time about the ‘mirroring’ concept. Everyone was keen to be ‘disruptive’.    E-bay’s business model, just like the one of another marketplace, Amazon, turned out to be viable, allowing it to survive the dotcom collapse. E-bay’s strength was that it created a platform on which companies and individuals could sell various items on a global scale. They just ‘mirrored’ the flea market concept that existed for centuries world-wide.  E-bay offered a workable interface between everyday life and the internet, which turned out to be an unfailingly profitable business model. Fund Platform’s strategic consultants often look at E-bay’s experience to chart the Fund Platform strategic path. Interestingly, Huobi, a major global diversified crypto-asset management group with 1 trln USD under management, supports the notion that crypto-marketplaces perform fairly well in the current turbulent times.    According to Mr. Lan Jianzhong, vice-president of Huobi ‘crypto-platforms’ is the only class of ICOs that grew in value in the beginning of 2018. In his recent speech at the blockchain conference in Eastern Europe Mr. Lan made a forecast that ‘platforms’ will perform well going forward.\  The losers according to Mr. Lan of Huobi shall be crypto-currencies and applications. The picture of the future of the ICO world drawn by Huobi is so much similar to what our strategic consultants have charted in the beginning of 2018. We have the new tools for protecting the value of investments that will be made into Fund Platform in the course of the ICO (launched April 3, 2018).",False

At the same time, the major problem for each investor is choosing the right fund or a company to back up. It requires a lot of time, efforts and professional knowledge to study the project, evaluate the potential risks and make objective predictions on the future profits.  Today, with the booming of cryptocurrency & ICO market, many investors turn their eye towards this field. However, sometimes they don’t fully understand how cryptocurrency and initial coin offerings work, and have huge concerns about risks, profits and legal aspects of investments. What’s more, an investor has to search for each project separately using multiple sources, which is time-consuming and inefficient.  The perfect way to make the process of investing in digital funds and ICOs smooth and easy is to create an ecosystem that builds up a bridge between investors and companies.  Such infrastructure has already being implemented by Fund Platform — the digital funds’ solution. Designed to connect ideas and opportunities, it addresses the problem of aggregating cryptocurrencies’ funds and ICO projects at one place. Fund Platform introduces a marketplace, listing a wide range of companies, and providing accurate data and analytics on them for potential investors.  The funds’ marketplace will make it possible for everyone to take advantage of endless investments opportunities.  As a convenient network, it provides fast and mutually beneficial communication between investors, sponsors and the projects. All the parties will be able to communicate via chat rooms on the platform.  Moreover, to ensure compliance and safety of the users and their assets, each fund or an ICO listed on the Platform will grant access to their analytics and reports. Thus, before making a decision to invest, a user will be able to study the statistics data, including rating, capitalization, managed funds and risk/return indicators. Such in-depth analysis will help identify high-performing and low-performing projects and evaluate the investments risks.  Fund Platform is based on the principles of transparency and trust. That’s why companies that provide their performance data will be positively rated on the Platform, while those that don’t — will be granted with “risky” status, or even will be considered as “scam” if they’ve been proven to be so. As a result, tracking of general investment indicators, as well as a comprehensive audit of the company and its activities, will enable users to form the most optimal portfolio to achieve the best results.  “Now the market for cryptocurrency investments is developing very rapidly. However, with hundreds of startups offering to purchase their coins, it’s extremely complicated for investors to find worthy projects and focus on them. That’s why Fund Platform will make a huge difference. Choosing a company to invest will be as simple as choosing accommodation on Booking.com or Airbnb. On entering the Platform, a user will find everything he needs: funds’ and ICOs description, statistics and reports. Also, on the marketplace, there is going to be the rating system: people who have already contributed will be able to score funds and give their reviews. The whole process of investing has never been so fast, easy and convenient for both newcomers and experienced players”, — comments Nikita Shevchenko, founder and CEO Fund Platform.  In December 2017 the project successfully finished the pre-ICO, and now Fund Platform moves towards the ICO round that will run from April 3rd to May 3rd. Those who want to contribute before the official start of the tokensale can join the Pre-sale offering the bonuses up to 50%.  About Fund Platform Fund Platform is #1 solution for digital funds and investors.

Well, if you decide to dive into the world of ICO, then for sure you will feel the similar way. Confusion, inconvenience, disorientation.  For beginners, and what to hide, even for experienced investors finding a really worthy project that will bring him millions is like finding water on Mars. Everyone knows that it exists somewhere, but where? And just as the spacecraft “Mars Odyssey” found evidence of water on the red planet, Fund Platform helps investors to find the most profitable crypto funds and projects, and also create such themselves. The perfect solution for digital funds and investors.  “Isn’t it too optimistic?” — you will ask. No, because we have secret component (actually, not so secret, if we are sharing it). It’s NEM Blockchain.  If you have heard about this technology, then you certainly understand, why Fund Platform has chosen NEM rather than the “mainstream” Ethereum.  Speed If we are talking about speed on this blockchain, it is out of the competition. The technology used by NEM allows to perform about 4 thousand operations per second. To compare with: Ethereum performs about 14 transactions. Do you feel the difference?  Low fees Saying low, we mean really low fees. For example, if you transfer 10 000 XEM, it will be only 1 XEM.  Unique algorithm While other cryptocurrencies use POW (proof-of-work) and POS (proof-of-stake) algorithms, NEM Blockchain implements the innovative system of POI (proof-of-importance). The main feature of this algorithm is that it prefers nodes that actively participate in the life of network and, thus are more useful for it. Unlike POS and POW, where rich becomes richer, POI is paying for developing of NEM Blockchain.  Safety The terms “blockchain” and “safety” deserve an award for the best team. But on NEM the security of data and money reach the brand new level thanks to multi signatures.  Anyway the biggest advantage of NEM is the open code and public API, which allow to issue the unlimited number of own tokens and subtokens. Without additional smart contracts and time loss. It’s just like with a palette of colors: if you have basic ones, you can easily make millions of various shades. NEM works the same way.  The unique functionality of NEM blockchain is definitely what investors and funds need, meaning that Fund Platform also needs it.  Successfully implementing this technology, the project builds the perfect ecosystem for users to develop their own crypto funds or invest in third-party companies: easily, quickly, with maximal convenience and minimal risks. With Fund Platform, any user can create a digital fund, issue tokens in a couple of minutes or invest in a project they like. Moreover, the team is developing Telegram and WeChat versions of its platform, so that users can work in their accounts without leaving their favorite instant messengers.  Have you decided to dive into the world of cryptocurrency and investments? Fund Platform knows exactly how to make this journey pleasant and profitable — with Fund Platform your eyes will always stay open.

Fund Platform, creating a game-changing solution for digital and cryptocurrency funds, plans to hit $ 30 million during the public sale.

The company has chosen a completely different path — NEM blockchain with its winning features unknown, for instance, to Ethereum-based tokens.  Fund Platform offers an easy, accessible and fast way to create digitals funds for various purposes by issuing sub-tokens within each fund.  The project has already got its wide recognition among investors and the community during the first Pre-sale that ran in late 2017. As a result, the team managed to exceed the soft-cap and collected funds for the next development stage.  Fund Platform has set the hard-cap of $30 million to raise: money necessary for accomplishing the company’s roadmap and reaching all the milestones. The team plans are audacious indeed: to develop the platform alpha (MVP is already done), hit the major exchanges for ensuring the tokens liquidity and expand the platform functionality by adding new cutting-edge features.  Seeing the great potential and the huge backing from the expert community, the hard cap doesn’t seem to be out of the grasp. It’s quite the opposite.

FUNDPLATFORM: MAKING IT EASY TO CREATE FUNDS Today Coinist was fortunate enough to chat with the folks at FundPLatform. A project designed to help people easily create funds for a variety of purposes ranging from investment funds, crowdfunding campaigns, funds which digitize real world assets and much more. Let’s jump into the interview.  Hello and thank you for joining us today. After reading through your website and whitepaper I see you have quite an ambitious project on your hands here. On your website you mention that you seek to solve many of the problems you see in the funding or fund creation space. Some of these problems include 1. the creation 2. Promotion 3. Incorporation and 4. Investing in these funds. Please outline in more detail how FundPLatform will solve these problems by stating 1. How things currently work and 2. How FundPlatform will solve the problems found in the current system:  – Creation The old way: To create a fund, people have to spend a lot of money and time. It takes months and even years to come up with an idea, form the team and raise necessary resources for that.  FundPlatform way: You can create a fund and issue tokens (fund’s digital assets) just in few minutes, paying minimum money for the blockchain network.  – Promotion The old way: Huge expenditures for marketing and investors’ search Fundplatform way: a ready-made marketplace, where a fund can attract investments without spending much money on that.  – Incorporation The old way: Searching for lawyers, expenses on incorporation process and solutions to legalize the digital assets. FundPlatform way: Ready packaged solutions for crypto projects and cryptofunds.  – Investment The old way: Investors are afraid to lose their money as they don’t trust in the fund. Moreover, there is a probability of money thefts. FundPlatform way: gradual repayments to the fund, escrow, the secureinvestment process  One advantage you talk about on your website is that FundPlatform users can create an unlimited amount of sub-tokens. Can you tell us more about what the real-world use cases are for this feature using examples?  The closest analogues are Open-end funds and shares in hedge funds that allow to invest in a certain strategy. Here is the same: each token is a new strategy.  One use case is for users who want to create their own cryptofunds. The creation of a cryptofund would allow investors to invest in the fund as well. Can you walk us through the steps involved in 1. Creating the fund 2. Managing the fund and 3. Payouts? Is this managed through smart contracts? How are investors funds protected?  You come up with an idea that requires money for realization. You come to our platform and describe your idea in a simple and understandable language. Then, you create a fund or launch the ICO, name it and describe what your project is doing. After that, you release the tokens.  Managing the fund is easy – you have your own fund manager’s dashboard, where you can manage investments, issue tokens and set up strategies for your fund.  Money withdrawal proceeds gradually, through due diligence and tracking of the fund for a certain time. That’s why the investors don’t have to worry about their own funds.  You’re planning on designing a fund builder. This fund builder will allow users to select their fund type, define a strategy, configure their structure, develop a marketing strategy and provide legal support. Can you explain in more detail what you mean by “configuration of the structure”?  If you have ever created a website via a builder, here everything works the same. You generate a private dashboard of your fund and adjust it to your needs.  Can you explain in more detail how the fund builder will handle the “development of the marketing strategy”?  Our experts will conduct a comprehensive analysis for your fund and offer you the best strategy for marketing campaign on specific markets.  Can you explain in more detail how the fund builder will handle “legal support”?  Thanks to packaged software solutions that we have developed, a fund can incorporate his company and get a bank account if necessary.  FundPlatform is aiming to offer funds which represent many different things. For example a fund could represent a investment, a crowdfunding campaign or a tokenization of an asset. However, the backend infrastructure for each of those assets is very different. For example, if a user launches a fund to represent an asset how is the assets existence proven? Can you tell us more about how you plan on dealing with the variation of technical needs for each fund type?  When the fund manager signs in the platform, he can access the list of actions he can perform. If the purpose of his fund is trading on the exchange, he chooses * a trade fund * and then receives a simple and convenient interface for accessing exchanges through the API. If the purpose is the ICO, then the Fund Platform team will put all the efforts to help the project get a convenient personal dashboard where the project can issue their tokens in a matter of minutes and begin the crowdfunding.  On your website you mention that projects are backed with “trustworthy information and statistics”. This of course, helps protect investors. Can you explain in more detail how the project vetting and statistics process will look?  Each fund is able to communicate with investors on chats or blogs, where the fund can upload documents and financial statements to their investors.  You’re using NEM to launch project. Why did you decide on using NEM vs other options available to you? Specifically, why did you select NEM over Ethereum?  Nem is faster by several times than Ethereum, transactions are cheaper. Moreover, NEM allows to issue tokens and sub-tokens in a few minutes.  After launching a project on NEM, what do you see as NEM’s biggest strengths?  Made on NEM, we are able to introduce regular improvements to our platform and develop in parallel with NEM platform.  What’s do you see as NEM’s biggest weaknesses?  Its low price, but for technically difficult projects that’s a big plus. Fund Platform is exactly such a project.  Thanks for joining us today and letting us know about your project.

Fund Platform cooperates with developers of the project NEM (New Economy Movement). The token emission will be realized on the NEM platform.     Thanks to our platform funds’ administrators and investors will be able to reach effective communication with the least of wasted time and with the maximum of convenience.     Those users investing money won’t hesitate for their disappearance because the liability of funds’ security is lied on Fund Platform service.       Nowadays there are over 90 cryptomonetary (tokenized) investing funds in the whole world. But for the open of a fund there should be much of expense. Investors need to spend a lot of strength and, moreover, money in order to choose an appropriate fund.  Fund Platform solves these problems by means of creating investing platform, allowing to control over funds through easy and fast tools and to create and provide funds without huge financial expenses.  Here traders can produce tokens for their own funds and subsidiary tokens (subtokens) in the frameworks of each separated fund and investors can create, diversify, organize and manage their own investing portfolio.   The structure of Fund Platform service  We offer two main products intended for two types of users:  ● Investor’ cabinet ● Fund administrator’ cabinet   Principal advantages of Fund Platform  For investors  ● higher indexes comparably to traditional hedgefunds; ● low barrier of entry; ● multicurrency wallet; ● existence of its own reserve fund at Fund Platform; ● totally fair accounts, given by funds.  For funds  ● Open of a personal fund and tokens’ emission aren’t required special skills; ● function of internal tokens’ emission with different strategies and products; ● existence of a personal independent risk manager; ● opportunity to transform a fund to an independent resource;    The process of trading on an exchange is constructed through special WEB terminal without an open access to funds.  Verified funds have an access to juridical supervision and extended a set of options: input/withdrawal currencies to an exchange without API, lower commissions etc.   About tokens  Fund Platform communicates with developers of NEM project (New Economy Movement) and an emission of token FUND will be realized on exactly NEW platform because it meets the requirements of security and corresponds with main objectives of Fund Platform in compare to Ethereum (for example), where it is needed to create several smart-contracts for an every fund.  Funds can produce tokens on the NEM base as well as on platform’s token FUND that can notably reduce the value of fund’s foundation.      Pre-ICO and ICO  Number and cost of tokens FUND     167 000 000 Tokens FUND will be produced.  At the stage of pre-ICO there will be 10 000 000 tokens.  At the stage of ICO there will be 90 000 000 tokens. 1FUND = $0,1  On pre-ICO you will receive a 50% bonus on purchased number of FUND tokens.    Distribution of tokens FUND  A pool of 25% tokens will keep in the company, providing planning development of Fund Platform and will be its reserve. Designated tokens won’t be sold during 24 months by their freeze through NEM Platform.  10% of tokens will be at the disposal of developers of platform and the main team. These tokens also won’t be sold during 24 months by their freeze. So, designated tokens will provide motivation for founders of platform and for the main team after ICO.  5% of tokens will be distributed after ICO among participants of bounty-program     Those tokens remained after ICO will withdraw automatically. An additional emission is not provided.   Purchasing and accounting of tokens FUND  Due to special registration form on the website fundplatform.io You can purchase tokens on the exchange of cryptocurrencies BTC, ETH, XEM and others updated by the moment of the deal.  After ICO you will receive tokens FUND in your profile which you can withdraw for an every of available wallets of NEM project and activate delegate mining in order to selling in long-term outlook or keeping or you can sell tokens on cryptoexchanges.
