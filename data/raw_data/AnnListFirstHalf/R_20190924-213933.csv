Maybe nobody informed you but somebody within your project hired a service to bump your thread. This kind of behavior not only encourages spam on the forum but is indicative of a less-than-honest project that has to resort to creating artificial buzz to boost its visibility.  To be honest with you, its a tactic primarily used by scammers. Which is why I warn people from investing in projects that hire them. It's a telltale sign that something is wrong with a project.

Today we are going to tell you about one of them - The main page.  The main page is a first thing you see on https://revain.org/.  At the center of the main page, there‚Äôs a conveniently-situated search-bar that allows you quickly search for the crypto projects or exchanges that you are interested in and skip straight to the reviews. Just under it, there are scroll buttons that give you access to the most important features. Note that you can also grab and drag it, instead of using right-left buttons, which makes this design much friendlier to touch screens and mobile devices. By using them you get access to the most important actions and features. For now, we‚Äôve put a quick register there, but additional features will be added in the future.  On the second screen, there‚Äôs a widget with a selection of most recent and most valuable reviews. When the most valuable option is chosen, the 5 reviews which users found most helpful at the moment are shown instead of the latest ones. As the reviews on our platform tend to be rich with facts and quite lengthy, most of them won‚Äôt fit in the preview. There is a ‚Äòshow more‚Äô to unfold the review. The third screen contains only the most relevant information which best explains the concept of the innovative review platform we are creating.  Haven‚Äôt been on Revain.org for awhile?

Welcome to another addition of Revain's ""Feature of the Week"". We are continuing to tell you about new features coming for Revain platform in the near future.  You may have already heard of our Proof-of-Reviewing feature. If not, basically, it provides you with a solid proof of the integrity of your review, and, in case it has been tampered, you have evidence to support your claim. There is one big catch to this, though. It's not exactly public as the review hash is sent to the author's email. Introducing Proof-of-Existence Here's how it works: the hash is being derived from review. All reviews that are left during a certain period of time are being collected into a block. Then another hash is being derived from a block. (This period can vary from 10 minutes to 24 hours but will most likely be about an hour or two). Thus, we are achieving the consistency of data volume regardless of the number of reviews left. The resulting hash is being written into a public blockchain with a low probability of being compromised. We are going to start with Bitcoin's blockchain first, but we might add others along the way. In case one is compromised, which is highly unlikely, the others will bear true results. Thus, we let anyone willing to check a proof that a particular review has not been changed. The Proof-of-Existence will be included in the upcoming v1.0 of the Revain platform.",True

Today we are thrilled to announce our partnership with Whalesburg, the first all-in-one software solution and mining pool for cryptocurrency miners.  This partnership will create much-needed transparencyin the crypto mining space and enhance community involvement in the industry.  ‚ÄùIt is exciting to enter into this partnership: Whalesburg‚Äôs community is filled with knowledgeable miners working on the fine-tuning of their mining output. We are excited to apply Revain‚Äôs solution within. In the long run, we hope that this will produce highly demanded transparency in the entire post-ICO landscape‚Äù said Revain advisor Dmitry Fedotov who has also been working as an advisor for Whalesburg since March.  What is Whalesburg?  Whalesburg‚Äôs all-in-one package provides miners with an overclocking tool, profit-switching algorithm and solution, hardware monitoring solution, mining pool, and a user-friendly operating system that enables miners to remotely monitor and fine-tune their equipment.‚ñ´Ô∏èThe Whalesburg pool has so far attracted approximately 200GH of has power and it just reached a milestone of 500 ETH mined.  Why Partner With Whalesburg?  Users could create a profile that mines a single coin,withdrawing coins immediatelyas they are mined. Alternatively, a user could set their profile to wait until a portion of mined coins has increased in value to a set percentage before withdrawing them. If a user wishes, they can share with the communitythe profiles they have developed. Top performing profiles that have been shared are ranked and listed on the platform. Other miners have the ability to write feedback on the profiles and leave tips.  Revain will be collaborating with Whalesburg developers to integrate Revain‚Äôs review functionality with the system of feedback, reviews, and tips on Whalesburg‚Äôs platform. By working together on this, Revain and Whalesburg aim to further enhance the ability of pool members to find the most profitable mining pool.

Users with high karma receive leadership badges and, consequently, are put on higher positions when users filter reviews by ‚Äòmost valuable‚Äô.   That is why the karma system is a great motivation for authors determined to write high-quality reviews. In addition to differentiation, authors with high karma potentially can receive higher income when Revain incentive system will be implemented.  It also shows if the user has been writing low-quality reviews as karma could be a negative number if a user has more dislikes than likes. To see the whole activity history of a particular user, that is all his/her reviews, all you need to do is to click on the username.  This all makes the possibility of companies paying authors to write the specific reviews about them even less likely as they will be risking their hard-earned reputation as well as the review rewards. It's the only rationale for the companies to pay authors with a high karma, as their reviews are being displayed first in the ‚Äòmost valuable‚Äô (and if someone posts promo stuff, s/he will be downvoted in an instant, thus no longer displayed high). We have a hard time imagining that any of the high-ranking authors will risk all the effort put into writing reviews, own reputation and rewards just for the one-time money incentive.",True

The platform is bringing to life the service that will finally allow businesses to receive detailed and genuine feedback about their projects, while users will get access to other people‚Äôs experience with ICOs and share their own insights as well. The platform will be aggregating information on token dynamics and major milestones in startup‚Äôs development. Impartiality of opinions available on the platform is achieved by the fact that only well-reasoned reviews will be stored. This is achieved by deploying blockchain and IBM Watson AI. Upon completion of testing period and launching the platform at its full capacity, a review hash will be getting stored in blockchain, which stands for its inalterability and no chance of making changes or deletion. The platform is appealing for both startups that already did ICO, ITO or crowdsale and different user segments. These include crypto-analysts, token holders and potential token buyers. New businesses that went through the ICO will be getting valuable feedback gathered in one place. This resolves the issue of biased coverage as normally the project‚Äôs website or its social media channels are basically the only source of information for public, while valuable feedback from real users is scattered around on numerous websites, which makes accumulating data and analyzing it pretty challenging. Crypto-analysts will benefit from being featured on the platform by making analysis of the project, thus getting exposure in crypto-world. Professional analytical ratings will provide users with opportunity to choose the most relevant information. Token holders and platform users will be able to assess a startup project by many criteria, such as: the team, the progress, communication with community, correlation between declared goals and factual achievements. The users will also have the ‚Äúlike‚Äù and ‚Äúdislike‚Äù buttons to rate the review either as valuable and informative or useless. Test version of the platform is available now at: http://dashboard.revain.org Revain team will be gathering user feedback and comments at: feedback@revain.org",True

This is kind of a weird word that is often used to describe one of the main benefits of cryptocurrencies. What it means is that the system is built so that trust is simply not a factor. You don‚Äôt have to trust it since there is no way to game it. There is no central bank, not governmental institution, no regulator, or anyone else who can step in a tweak the system for their or anyone else‚Äôs benefit. The system simply works, you can know it works, and you can know exactly how it works.  Trustless is also the wave of the future. So much of what we do is dependent on our needing to trust a third party ‚Äì and often enough we have no way to know if that person is trustworthy. With the advent of cryptocurrencies and blockchains, it is now becoming possible to simply remove that element. And the extreme frontier for trustless systems would seem something we all rely on, and something we all know can be manipulated, hacked, or just downright unstrustable: online reviews.  Revain is a new blockchain-based review system that is seeking to solve some of the problems with firsthand reviews. Their system combines an internal token built on Ethereum that will be used to incentivize quality to reviews and penalize bad actors (on both the consumer and provider sides), an IBM AI system utilizing a neural network to vet all reviews for quality and veracity, and an immutable blockchain to record all reviews so that they can never be promoted, demoted, manipulated, removed or edited. Once a review has been authenticated, it will become part of the permanent record.  https://coinidol.com/revain-trustless-consumer-review-system-on-blockchain/",True

I have some questions about your project. First of all, you are making absolutely the same as YELP or TripAdviser - users leave reviews and gain your inner currency. Thats great, but i dont see how blockchain works here. 1. Where is data stored? Is it dissolved among all the bitcoin wallets or do you keep it on your own servers? If you store all the data on world's users computers then do you imagine how much space needed for that? What if all blockchain startups do the same? Users wallets will be full of unneccesary crap. 2. You said that your advantage before YELP or TripAdviser is that noone can delete or edit others' reviews. If like you say users wallets carry not whole reviews but just hashes, then where the rest of the data is stored? If the data is at least partially stored on your servers you still have the power to delete them. How is that fair? 3. How do you insert your data into ETH chain? Is there somekind of open API? If there is, where can i find its documentation and example of your code that proves that integration works?",True
