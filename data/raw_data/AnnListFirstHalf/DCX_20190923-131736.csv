Don't know if your an IT guy otherwise next info will tell you probably not much or nothing  at all... Our infrastructure is based on IaC (infra as code) on container platforms as wel as Openstack, fully automated using a CI/CD principal. We have a standard defined middleware stack. Our global setup which we initially intend to rollout will consist of multiple datacenters US, NL, India, AUS and  where ever our a customer wants to use our solution.  We are going to use a PaaS solution from Equinix, they have  180+ DATA CENTERS 44 METROS   240,000+ CROSS CONNECTS >99.99999% RELIABILITY  source: https://www.equinix.com/  where we can rollout our entire infra stack whit just one click on a button. Basically we can expand to any country an go-live within an hour.  We have a whitelabel wallet form a technology partner which is in the final fases, we will showcase this very soon.  We have customers which are very interested which combined generate multiple billions revenue on a year basis, so if we can pursuiade  the coins will start rolling from day 1 hopefully.  We also have a banking license or actually allmost that is, we are finalizing partnership agreement, so that will give more certainties and also opens a lot of new possibilities we are eager to explore once our core business (DCX payment blockchain) is generating steady income and keeps expanding at a desiareble pase.   What still needs to be done:  DCX B.V. needs to be registered, paperwork, legal stuff all is done we only need to file it at chamber of commerce. This is done by choice, because if the crowdsale would not make it, there is no need for a DCX B.V. and launching a business costs quit al lot of money, so we are not looking to waste any unessecary. If ICO is a great succes, DCX B.V. will be alive and kicking within approxemately  5 days. We need to do penn testing on global infrastructure, which only can be done when its build and for that we rely on funding of ICO. We need to wrap up SLA, but in order to do so we need to do stress/performance testing on global network to get the number regarding transactionspeed etc to put in the SLA. We need to recruit sales teammembers on a global scale, for which preperations are allready done. ( see whitepaper, its also stated in there. ) If ICO is a  huge success i intend to establish a Global Implementation team"" which has the main task of implementing the DCX solution across the world at our enterprise level clients for free, just to get the coins rolling so to say and generate a steady cashflow back to tokenholders.   FYI, i have a consultancy business and have worked  at practically all major banks in NL (ING <-- largest bank of europe and ABN, Rabobank ) but also at Ingenico, and some huge retailers like Wehkamp and Fonq.nl  Satisfied which this explanation? Or do you have more questions? I'm more then willing to awnser them",False
