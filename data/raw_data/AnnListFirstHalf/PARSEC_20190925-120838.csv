The team of 15+ people has 5-25 years of game development experience and extensive experience with MMOs and virtual worlds. The project has six advisers, including three listed below. Christian Lassem: Creator of Planetarion, later followed by AD2460. They are both reference games that online space games have been inspired by, and they still have an active community. John Kavanagh: An accomplished industry executive with a video game career of nearly 35 years. He has also been involved in designing, developing and licensing games and technology to Sega, Nintendo, Apple, Atari, Commodore and Broderbund. He’s since worked at Eidos, Crystal Dynamics and Paramount Pictures. Shaban Shaame: Founded EverdreamSoft, a Swiss-based game company, in 2010. He pioneered in-game blockchain integration with Spells of Genesis and BitCrystals economy, giving players true ownership of their digital game assets. When it comes to the dev team, many are from Artplant.  Verdict On the surface level, this seems like an easy pass. But after digging into it, it seems more like a good gamble. It’s definitely been overlooked by investors. The team is legit and are trying to produce quality. Blockchain-based MMOs will have a giant place in the future gaming industry. Putting digital assets on the chain so that they can be securely traded like tokens is game-changing. Parsec is partnered with BitSpace, an up and coming block producer candidate and new project incubator for EOS blockchain. BitSpace was campaigning hard to bring Parsec Fronteir to EOS. However, they decided to go with NEO. According to Telegram, NEO hasn’t announced Parsec to their community yet. NEO is a  huge and passionate community. This game could get many new players once they start marketing.  Risks     More often than not, ambitious MMORPG projects such as Parsec underestimate and over-scope what it will take to produce, and the game never gets released. -1.5     The original token sale was only supposed to last 2 weeks in May. However, they were nowhere near hitting the cap, so they extended it until the end of June. As of May 25, they have raised  850 ETH. Their soft cap is 2,500 ETH and the hard cap is over 10,000 ETH. -3     Scalability is always an issue. They will build on the NEO blockchain, which is extremely risky at this point. Here’s the quote given in their whitepaper about how they will handle this issue:     “The modular approach also has the benefit of scaling well with the money raised to fund the project. We see many projects requiring a huge amount of money just for an initial release, not to mention the cost it takes to run and expand an MMORPG. Parsec however is a manageable project to get out the door, but scales infinitely upwards as time passes and funding is secured. Over time, we believe Parsec will be one of the richest MMO experiences on the market, and a true next generation of blockchain gaming.” -2     Marketing seems lacking. If they can’t sell out their soft cap, what makes them think they will be able to introduce this game to the masses? -2  Growth Potential    A large supply coins, if popular, have typically done extremely well in terms of ROI for ICO contributors. +1     Partnerships. As mentioned above, Parsec is partnered with BitSpace. Axie is a fantasy creature collecting game. Shufti Pro is a screen identity verification tool. And EverdreamSoft is a Swiss-based mobile game and app developer, created Spells of Genesis. +2     Space-based MMO Eve Online does not publish subscription numbers, but reportedly has about 500,000 monthly subscribers. Star Citizen is on track to raise close to $200 million from over 2 million prospective players. The team at Parsec wrote a blog breaking down what could happen to the token value if this game gets adopted. +3       The team has had success in the past with games such as Battlestar Gallactica Online, which has seen over 20 million users.+4     The rare in-game assets will be sold on exchanges such as WAX. If this game goes mainstream, some of these ships that can be bid on today for 1 or 2 ETH, could be worth thousands of dollars in the future. Players are bidding on ships as we speak here .+2     Here’s a 5 minute demo showing what they have so far:+2  Disposition This is a possible sleeper that could either pay off huge or crash and burn. Blockchain-based MMOs will have a giant place in the future gaming industry. Putting in-game digital assets on the chain so that they can be securely traded like tokens is game-changing. 5.5/10 Proof: https://hacked.com/ico-analysis-parsec-frontiers/",False

Unlike other games with cryptocurrencies, all assets will be accounted for on the distributed ledger - which brings confidence in the economy. So, you don't have to trust that the developer will not create inflation by changing drop rates or how objects are appearing.  Combining asset transparency with the fact that money can easily enter and exit the virtual economy, and you are starting to see the outline of a completely new type of real-money skill-based game where you can actually earn a profit by playing the game if you're better than others that are playing.  Or, you can view the economy as a perfect target for trading/investing/speculation: If you're carefully watching the prices of, say, iron ore on the exchanges, you can decide that you want to make a sizeable bet on iron ore to rise - you can purchase Parsec Credits and buy iron ore on exchanges - much like you would buy (or short) a stock. So: assets inside virtual economies becomes a new asset class on its own. Much like cryptocurrency now has become a completely new asset class for fund managers.  This is all part of our vision for making a game with a deep, complex, player-controlled virtual economy - using blockchain to establish transparency and trust in the economy itself instead of trust in the game developer alone.",False

Artplant's server technology for Battlestar Galactica Online initiated in development in 2010, and when BGO launched the server worked flawlessly for 6 months before a planned maintenance break. That is pretty stellar in the MMO world.  The project concept was finished in June 2017, and since then we have been working on detailing the project, assembling the team, building partnerships and starting with the blockchain technology architecture. It is still early stage, this Pre-Sale is the absolutely first round of funding for the project.  Advantages of this project vs other ICOs: Great question. First of all, most game related projects are trying to be a platform in one way or another. This is an appeal to the traditional VC/fund way of thinking - a business that scales. However, the fact that blockchain games/worlds are in nature decentralised and ""owned"" by the token holders instead of companies trying to profit, means that such a project has every incentive to develop its own technology and not make someone else rich unless the project absolutely need the solution. So, instead of platforms it is better to invest in Decentraland, Parsec Frontiers and others that form the front lines of blockchain gaming.  As in the real world - money is backed by an economy. Cross-world tokens makes no sense, as you could just as well use a mainstream cryptocurrency instead. Instead, each game or virtual world will have its own token. And joining a project means that you will have to evaluate the project on its own merits.  Parsec Frontiers is a project with grand ambitions. We are building a copy of the Milky Way, gamified with exploration, resource extraction, combat and empire building. All assets are on a blockchain, fully verifiable - which means the economy will have the confidence of all players. This transparency makes it easier to form an opinion on what resources are over- or undervalued. And connecting the token with exchanges makes it easy to move money in and out of the virtual world.  Blockchain-based virtual worlds and gaming worlds will become a HUGE part of the blockchain future. When everyone is FUDing about cryptocurrencies not having any real value or function - that is where a blockchain-based game is completely different. Inside of the world both assets and tokens have a real value and provides advantages and ownership in a way that all participants of that world will place a value on. The value will of course be up to the players/participants to decide - in a free, open and transparent market.",False

You will be able to work within the game, by doing missions/contracts where other players pay you to do tasks they don't have time or capacity to do themselves.

Starting from Earth, the actions of all players will shape the future of our galaxy. With a persistent game universe and a continually evolving timeline the race is on to explore, expand and exploit the riches to be found in other star systems. A fully player-driven economy blockchain will allow players to mine and refine rare metals, build advanced starships and defense systems, and buy and trade resources for profit on the planetary exchanges. Everything is tradeable, anything is possible!  The in-game currency will be Parsec Credits [PRSC], a utility token for access to the MMO ecosystem. Since it's an ERC20 token, cryptocurrency exchanges may also choose to list the token for trading vs fiat or ETH, BTC etc. The link between ""real money"" and PRSC lowers the threshold for investing in the Parsec Frontiers virtual economy, knowing that all players can cash out their in-game assets for BTC/ETH or fiat at any time.  All transactions involving items, resources and player spaceships in the game will be stored on a decentralized ledger. This enables advanced analysis of the economy to gain an information advantage – creating opportunities for machine learning and data mining techniques. It also serves to verify resources and player items in the total economy, enhancing gameplay and the intrinsic value of the virtual assets. The in-game economy becomes “real” and your in-game actions will have real-world financial consequences.  https://i.imgur.com/nOM4dsV.png  The project is developed by Artplant – an established Norwegian/Russian game developer focused on creating advanced online games. Artplant has seen more than 25 million people play its games, and has previously created big hits such as Block N Load and Battlestar Galactica Online. It was founded in 2001 by developers with their roots in 90s console development, and shifted its focus to massive multiplayer online games in 2010.  Parsec Frontiers' developers have a genuine passion for games, and a track record of game development going back to the early days of the demo scene.  Parsec Frontiers is currently under development at Artplant's studios in Oslo, Norway and Tver, Russia. The backend uses Artplant’s advanced Erlang MMO server technology, expanded to support the Parsec Frontier blockchain. The server tech has been used in multiple games supporting tens of millions of players over seven years - when first used it worked with millions of players flawlessly for six months before going down for planned maintenance.  Complete team bios are found in the whitepaper.  https://i.imgur.com/Mzlte3X.png  The game client is made with Unity for HTML5, allowing the game to be played across all major operating systems and devices. This means you'll also be able to play on your mobile, or with browsers on Linux.  Unity has become the de facto development platform for tens of thousands of game developers across the world. Artplant has worked closely with Unity Technologies since its early days, creating some of the first GDC tech demos showcasing its powerful development environment.  https://i.imgur.com/jsEkfAb.png  To successfully store all assets and ownership information on a blockchain for an MMO is a highly demanding use case with several challenging requirements:  Enabling the project to issue own in-game digital assets Support for smart contract programming and execution The technology must scale to support millions of transactions per day Most of the game’s blockchain transactions should be processed without incurring fees paid in a 3rd party token Fast (seconds) transaction validation/confirmation The technology should support pruning/checkpointing Ease of organizing and executing crowd sale process Simple token trading integration for exchanges  An MMO with high throughput transaction requirements for thousands of individual digital assets based on separate smart contracts will for cost, speed, capacity and storage reasons not be kept on the mainnet of current public blockchain platforms.  Parsec Frontiers plans to use a dual token structure with an open, public custom blockchain with permissioned elements inside of the game bridging to an Ethereum ERC20-token controlled by smart contracts on both blockchains. This enables easier access to trading exchanges and enhances liquidity for all stakeholders of the virtual economy, as well as allowing the project to process transactions without incurring mainnet transaction costs.  PRSC tokens represents the main means of payment in Parsec Frontiers. With seamless transfer between in-game and the Ethereum blockchain, the player has total control and ability to trade PRSC against other cryptocurrency pairs on real-life exchanges.  The game client will contribute a front-end interface to facilitate the dual token swap transactions. The Ethereum fee for transfers out of the smart contract will be payable in PRSC custom chain tokens and can be player-adjusted per desired transaction priority.  All in-game tradeable assets and resources, such as raw materials, alloys, crafted objects etc., will exist on the blockchain to enable total transparency in circulation and transactions taking place. Trading between all in-game assets will be facilitated on decentralized exchanges, keeping all trade fully transparent and trustless.  https://i.imgur.com/7hCMX2x.png  We are asking everyone in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community to help us fund an extremely advanced use case for blockchain technology. Our goal is to enable distributed storage of in-game assets for hundreds of thousands of simultaneous players, with millions of transactions per day. By doing this we will prove that open and public blockchains can be used for extremely demanding use cases such as an MMO.  Crowd sale and pre-sale details will be announced on December 11th in this thread. The pre-sale will take place from Jan 24th with a crowd-sale planned for April 2018. These will be the only opportunities to acquire Parsec Credits directly. Afterwards, the tokens may be acquired from exchanges.  A parsec (from parallax second) is a unit of astronomical distance. It is commonly used by astronomers, even though the general population mostly talk of light years to measure distance in space. One parsec is 3,08567758 x 10^16 meters, and the number of Parsec Credits created in our TGE will be 30.856.775.800 followed by six decimals.  https://i.imgur.com/LYq8eJa.png  The Parsec Credits purchased during the crowd sale will initially enable you to purchase spaceships and other early assets which provides profit opportunities within the game as it launches.  The meta-game will start with a new spaceship manufactured every day, which will be put up for auction to holders of PRSC. Every player will need a spaceship to play the game, and initially there will only be a limited number of pre-manufactured spaceships. Additional spaceships must then be manufactured by the players in the game after launch, using resources extracted from around the galaxy.  Parsec Credits can also be used to acquire development project colony sites on the initial 17 inhabitable planets in the galaxy.  https://i.imgur.com/TyXVYo2.png  The Parsec Frontiers Foundation will manage the proceeds from the pre-sale and crowd sale. It is to be established for the sole purpose of overseeing the continuous development and successful operations of the game. The foundation will be incorporated in Switzerland.  https://i.imgur.com/Y1VV3Ha.png  https://i.imgur.com/QGq3JhG.png?1 https://i.imgur.com/1IjgJK8.png?1  https://i.imgur.com/AKgkN40.png  1,542,838,790 PRSC (5% of the total pre-burn supply) is allocated for bounty programs. This includes affiliate bounty, marketing bounty as well as a community bounty.  We have created a generous bounty campaign for the community, with 400 million (1.296%) of the total Parsec Credits allocated to reward community contributions leading up to the pre-sale. Note that all reserved tokens will be shared among the bounty campaign participants without exceptions.  Link to the official Parsec Frontiers pre-sale bounty campaign thread.  The pre-sale bounty campaign ends on January 31st 2018.  There will be a separate bounty campaign leading up to the crowd sale, and if you participate in this pre-sale bounty campaign you can also participate in the crowd sale bounty campaign currently planned for March 1st until April 30th to earn additional Parsec Credits.  Please note that both pre-sale and bounty tokens will be distributed simultaneously with the tokens sold in the crowd sale. This will ensure fair trading on an equal footing amongst all participants in the sales.  https://i.imgur.com/lA52P5d.png  We ask the community to help us shape, market and fund the game, and participate in its creation during development. We ask interested parties to read our whitepaper, offer feedback and suggestions for how to improve and iterate forward. We ask those of you interested in backing the project financially to participate in our forthcoming pre-sale by first registering on our whitelist. If you do not have the financial means to contribute funding, please consider joining our bounty campaign and help raise the project's awareness - we are grateful for all assistance you can offer. The future of our galaxy and the fate of the human race may depend upon it.
