While our mission remains unchanged, the potential benefits of blockchain technology have allowed our vision to expand beyond U.S. borders. We have already secured partnerships with two of largest global news media brands in the UK and Canada and are poised to make freelancing more trusted and inclusive for a global gig economy.  As a U.S. based company, we are committed to providing our token to not only an international audience, but to our loyal user base and the many interested participants in the United States.  While there remains much regulatory uncertainty in this market, there have been a number of developments over the last few weeks that may allow us to hold our token sale in a way that is fully compliant with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations.  As a result, we have been conducting interviews with partners who will help us to conduct a fully compliant offering and have narrowed the list to a select few who can meet our high standards and requirements. While we have not yet set a date for the sale, we can tell you the initial offering will be for accredited investors only. We will continue to work closely with our partners to expand the offering to non-accredited participants once the SEC provides further clarity on how we can make that happen.  Our goal from the onset has been to involve a broader community in our business and we appreciate your continued support as we navigate the waters to do just that. We will keep you posted as new developments and dates for the pre-sale as they are solidified.  In the meantime, we are happy to answer any questions you might have on Moonlighting and our pre-sale on a one-on-one basis. You can schedule a meeting time with us by replying to this email or choose a meeting time here. And, if you are an accredited investor interested in our security token pre-sale and have not yet pre-registered, please do so here.",False
