Quote from: Immer on November 27, 2017, 09:46:33 AM Quote from: arakx on November 27, 2017, 09:45:24 AM Quote from: Immer on November 27, 2017, 09:41:58 AM Hello! Most marketplaces set a clear time for sending the goods by the seller today. What are the time frames of your platform? As far as I know the seller has precisely 3 days to confirm the shipment of the goods. Are these 3 calendar days or 72 hours? This aspect is not elaborated in the White paper.  We will work this through, thanks for remark!  Quote from: arakx on November 27, 2017, 09:48:32 AM Letâ€™s suppose that the seller has confirmed the shipment of the goods, but I believe that the confirmation must be provided by representative of the delivery service.  Confirmation is provided only by delivery service. Like anyone can track the package delivery status on official website of delivery service (like DHL or FedEx), blockchain technology called Oracle calls the delivery service website to check if the package is delivered and accepted.  Quote from: Mops on November 27, 2017, 11:45:22 AM Do you happen to know, should he only provide the seller with this address or has he to indicate it in his account on the platform?  There is no need to keep private data on public blockchain. Personal address is transferred to seller directly.  Quote from: ionbefore on November 27, 2017, 01:31:10 PM If the product is damaged during the delivery process, who is responsible for this?  Delivery service, for sure. It makes Delivery Deposit with Qilin Tokens on smart contract to assure secure delivery.  Quote from: dort on November 27, 2017, 04:56:12 PM As far as I understand, both the seller and the buyer will have to provide feedback. I still can imagine the content of the buyer's response, but what should the seller write?  Seller can give feedback for delivery service, for example. Generally that is not obligatory to send any feedback at all, may be useful in case something wrong happened.  Quote from: rdizza on November 27, 2017, 06:55:05 PM Donâ€™t you plan to oblige delivery services to check condition of the goods at the time of shipment and immediately when the buyer receives it?  That is intended in regular procedure of passing the product to delivery service, as usual service. May be even some paperwork included to maintain legal relations between parties, that's a normal process that Buyer is not involved in.  Quote from: californybit on November 28, 2017, 07:51:27 AM I canâ€™t understand one thing. Do you offer your own marketplace, or is it just a tool that allows any store to accept crypto currency from its customers?   We offer anyone to open their own marketplace in fact. We are just a team to develop the open source software and give it a rocketstart. That is a powerful tool to accept crypto currency using smart deal escrow on distributed ledger.  Quote from: coldday on November 28, 2017, 08:21:23 AM It seems to me that you describe everything in a too complicated way. As for me, adding a crypto currency shouldnâ€™t be more difficult than adding another currency to my online store. There is a plug-in for this purpose which can be downloaded for free.  Qilin.Market involves all e-commerce market participants to work on platform, that is not too complicated though.  Please check project website and whitepaper for more detailed info.",False

Given the value of bitcoin, it would be a great solution.  May be will be added in concept for future development, not on the current stage.  Quote from: spacegt on November 29, 2017, 07:30:50 AM Hi. I've encountered a similar solution that was worked out in off-chain, but youâ€™re the first who makes a project in the field of crypto-currency, and that's great. Iâ€™d like to know what promotional tools are available to sellers in order to promote their products?   All Seller offer from distributed ledger of Qilin.Market are published on stores grabbing data from that distributed database. So one can be sure he gets instant access to extremely powerful tool for boosting sales with crypto.  Quote from: Mops on November 29, 2017, 01:07:10 PM Do you divide your ICO into several parts, or is there only one stage?  We are on token preorder stage, anyone can reserve a token to work on platform.

Quote from: Veecker on November 29, 2017, 10:59:22 PM Is there any commission within the platform? If so, can it be paid in any currency or only in Qt?  No. There is no commission at all.

As in any other distributed platform, every participant is responsible for his own actions. We just provide the software to connect parties and maintain settlements.  Quote from: slavonicpl on November 21, 2017, 09:14:45 AM Hello. How is controlling the quality of the products occurred on your platform?  First, it's up to reputation management system built on blockhain that allows to rate sellers, buyers and delivery services. What is more important, Shops can select products to be promoted on their websites, so they can handle it as well, being solely interested to offer really quality products for their audience and earn more profit. Think of it as self-regulated system.  Quote from: coin63 on November 21, 2017, 09:10:16 AM With what mobile OS will your app be compatible?

On the first stages it's mainly Ether (ETH) and platform's own Token (Qt./QMT). As soon as we will find a good solution for smart contracts on Bitcoin blockchain, BTC will be added. On the DAO Stage we presume there would be a wide selection of currencies to work with including (if regulations and market demand will allow us) some fiat currencies.",False
