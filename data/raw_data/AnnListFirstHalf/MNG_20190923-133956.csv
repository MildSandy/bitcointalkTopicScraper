Not reaching a soft cap does not make a project a scam. The ICO was running during a down market period and there was hardly any marketing. For the latter the team could be held responsible but not for the first, which could not be forseen. If things go as the CEO communicated to me the investors will be paid back and the bounty participants will still be paid their MNG (though MNG is not of value at this moment). And if these actions are conducted MangoStartups will not be a scam but simply a failure. Even a 'temporary failure' because the project will not be terminated but put on hold, which keeps the possibility theoretically open that in the future it will be given a re-start.",False

SCALABLE INTERNATIONAL STARTUPS Mango Startups has its headquarters in Costa Rica, San Francisco and London. This allows us to support and expand the startup portfolio and their products globally.  CLEAR EXIT STRATEGY According to CB, the average time for VCs and Angels to exit via M&A is five years. Mango Tokens offer a clear exit strategy through a bonus distribution or a buyback mechanism. Moreover, through multiple cryptocurrency exchanges Mango Tokens can provide liquidity in the short term.  PROVEN TRACK RECORD All startups currently in the portfolio have been through a rigorous incubation and acceleration process. These startups belong to the 16/17 graduate batch from our accelerators network. All companies in the portfolio have a proven business model, and are currently generating revenue with monthly positive cash flows.  TRANSPARENCY AND COMPLIANCE InvertUP is the 1st seed capital fund enlisted at a national stock exchange in LATAM, providing transparency and compliance with corporate governance international best practices.  MINIMIZE RISK EXPOSURE Investing in startups is inherently risky. Through the multiple VC funds, such as InvertUP, you are minimizing your risk by investing in a diversified Portfolio which includes companies in the following industries: ○ Blockchain technology ○ Smart Contracts ○ VR/AR Advergames ○ Solar energy ○ Biomedical Equipment ○ Fantasy sports Industry ○ Banking Services ○ Video Content ○ Services Marketplace  ACCESSIBILITY TO MULTIPLE INVESTORS We expect many groups of investors to be interested in the ICO, traders (because of high volatility), venture investors (even with small funds), crypto asset holders (to diversify the assets with fiat investments), regular investors (because of liquidity) and fiat investors.  https://www.mangostartups.com/",False

The MNG (Mango) tokens will be listed at exchanges. Net profits are used to buy back the tokens from the exchanges. Bought back tokens will be burned. So with the volume of MNG tokens decreasing their value and price will increase. Thus investors will be able to sell their MNG tokens with profit.  The process is explained in the whitepaper under chapter 12. There also an example of the process is given. It's all summarized in the infographic below.,False

In those countries where we can find a profound capital market, the dynamism of the startup ecosystem is very strong , unicorns , scalable startups , exit strategies etc  In emerging markets were capital markets are very weak we will also see a weak startup ecosystem mainly in regards to risk investment , exit strategies, unicorns, scalabale startups , follow ons etc  ICOs and blockchain technology will change once and forever the Traditional Venture Industry  As a practical example i would suggest to check www.Mangostartups.com , first ICO that is backed by a Seed Capital Fund that invests in Latin American Startups  Through this ICO , investors gain access to a diversified portfolio of actively developed and promising startups in the venture market with a clear exit strategy through wallets and exchanges on blockchain platforms  As I mentioned , Blockchain technology gives a great oportunity to reshape the traditional venture capital industry .
