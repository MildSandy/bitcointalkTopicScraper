We closed the website immediately to prevent users from purchasing tokens. Unfortunately, some of the transactions have already been sent directly to the smart contract.  As of now, The Abyss engineering team has fixed all the technical issues, that led to this situation. Fixed bugs uploaded on Github for your consideration. The new smart contract will be re-deployed and new address will be available in your dashboard.  We really do apologize that we failed to timely prevent funds from being sent to the smart contract. We are unable to process the sent transactions properly. However, you will be provided an opportunity to participate in the Token Sale (DAICO) either with funds you already sent or with a new pledge. Besides, all participants that have sent transactions on April 16, 2018, can get the entire refund (commission for transaction not included). Check this instruction to get more info on how to get refund.  The day before the planned Token Sale (April, 16), we published the smart contract address so that you could research its code. Not for sending funds. All contributions should pass through the users dashboard only. For this reason, if you send transaction directly to smart contract address without using dashboard instructions you will not have an opportunity to receive a 3% bonus for your first contribution.  We regret this situation, and will never let it recur.  We’ll be waiting for you at the Token Sale (DAICO), that starts on April 18, 2018, at 14:00 UTC and ends on May 16, 2018, same time.

One of the key factors of this growth is a digital distribution of games without the use of physical media like CDs. This way of distribution has led to appearing such publishers and retailers as Steam, PlayStation Store, Amazon.com, Origin, UPlay, and others. The Abyss aiming to become the gaming distribution platform offering the following unique benefits for gamers and developers: – Multilevel referral: The Abyss offers individual referral programs to players and pays for friends engaged to the platform and users engaged by the friends. And if you are the first to bring in users to the platform, you earn the maximum income. This works for both players and developers. – Earnings for gamers: Gamers can also earn from different activities on the platform, such as achievements, content generation (reviews, streams, guides, commentary, fan art), internal CPA Network, etc. – Internal CPA (Cost Per Action) Network for developers: Developers get access to an internal system of advertising offers for engaging targeted traffic. Add here some promotion features, such as offering one’s traffic to other games for tokens, getting external traffic, viewing traffic statistics, link referral etc. The Abyss also offers customer support service, simple UI, ability to launch the alpha or beta versions for collecting gamers’ feedback, and others. The release of the first version of the platform is planned on Q4 2018, and the development will continue in 2019 and 2020. Their ERC-20 token called ABYSS is the primary way of exchange on the platform. Fiat will also be accepted for game purchases for faster adoption, but if you buy with ABYSS tokens, you get a discount. Some features will be accessible by using the ABYSS tokens only.  Team The Abyss is a project of Destiny.Games, well-known Russia-based video game developer and publisher with extensive expertise in developing game projects. Founder Konstantin Boyko-Romanovsky, also the Founder and CEO of Destiny.Games, has over 17 years of experience in the gaming industry. The core team consists of 12 members (the entire team of Destiny.Games consists of 40+ specialists), plus 5 advisors. The team is really strong and looks more than capable of developing the projects of that kind.  Summary In addition to most of the features of existing competitors like Steam or Origin, the Abyss platform offers their own unique ones, that makes the project quite attractive, but they’ve got the significant hype due to a decision to test the DAICO concept developed by Vitalik Butrin. This concept allows token holders to control the fund withdrawal limit, and vote for the refund of the remaining contributed money in case the team fails to implement the project. Among possible challenges we’d call the platform implementation which is planned only for Q4 2018 and more than serious competitors like Steam. At the same time, their five-level referral program is working right now and will definitely drive adoption in the beginning of the project life.  The Abyss is an ambitious project which is being developed by an excellent, fully-packed, experienced team aiming to bring a new generation gaming distribution platform with unique benefits for both gamers and developers. And they are trying to be better than Steam. Well, let’s see.",False

The KYC contractor’s solution has been unable to process all submitted requests correctly and timely, which has resulted in receiving numerous problem reports. For this reason, we stopped cooperation with our current KYC provider, and are in process of signing up with a new partner who’s utilizing another technology.  A proper KYC/AML procedure is critical to ensuring transparent and legally compliant token sale. The Abyss DAICO will comply with the Reg D under U.S. legislation, and we are obliged by law to conduct KYC/AML for all contributors (not just for those who pay over some amount). It must be launched before the crowdsale to secure (apart from other issues) that all identified contributors’ wallets are added to the smart contract and to avoid transactions sent from unauthorized wallets. Besides, according to our DAICO model, KYC/AML can not be completed after the end of crowdsale.  Till the end of the week we will provide detailed step by step instructions on how to pass the procedure, which is even more simple and requires no additional apps to be installed. The start-end date of The Abyss DAICO is also to be announced soon. We regret it is taking more time than we have expected, but all processes should be running properly and with maximum comfort.  We do everything to provide a better and safer user experience, and are grateful to all our supporters for understanding our concerns!  https://medium.com/theabyss/overcoming-new-challenges-acc2f86f87a1",False

Earlier this year, Vitalik Buterin (co-founder of Ethereum) opined that ICO be upgraded by merging part of the benefits of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). This new idea, DAICO, is an innovative fundraising model geared towards ensuring that ICOs are more secure with the introduction of poll system and the involvement of project’s token holders into the voting process.  In the line with this development, The Abyss is declaring to the general public the intention to launch DAICO which is a reinforced version of ICO merged with aspects of DAO.

We appreciate the trust of those who are ready to support the project and will do our best to ensure that as many of them as possible will participate in the Token Sale (DAICO). This is exactly what distinguishes us from other projects that cancelled Token Sales at the last moment and used to conduct pre-sales or/and closed sales for selected participants. In order to achieve the said goal, we are being kept really busy improving our system’s performance, so that it is able to process all the requests.  Upon the recommendations from Mikko Ohtamaa, our technical advisor, we postpone the KYC / AML procedure for several days in order to test its safety. Our partners from Netki (our KYC / AML provider) are integrating the mobile app MyVerify, that will help to submit all necessary documents in less than 5 minutes.  Also we plan to make additional security tests and improvements as recommended by Mikko.  Security never hurts. Since it is DAICO, the smart contract security is specially welcomed.

I’m Konstantin, the founder of Destiny.Games video game company and, above all, a gamer since late 1980s.  Today we are witnessing the rise of the video game industry. In 2017, its revenue has already exceeded $100 billion and is expected to reach almost $170 billion mark by 2020. But most notably, the market is shifting from offline to online business model providing a potential for digital innovation.  I proudly present you The Abyss - an innovative digital distribution platform, which, I truly believe, will become a next-generation Steam and revolutionize the video game industry.    What’s it all about? Three words. Games. Profit. Blockchain.  It is the first game platform in human history where both gamers and developers can profit from being a part of a brilliant referral and motivational system as well as being creative. Gamers will enjoy the best F2P browser and client MMO games (our priority at the early stage) and the developers will become partners instead of competitors. This is a brand-new approach that will change the whole video game industry.  As for blockchain. The platform will utilize ABYSS tokens (ERC20 standard on Ethereum blockchain) for payments, rewards, referral programs, etc. Fiat money will also be acceptable, but only with ABYSS tokens users will get access to all services The Abyss will offer.  I participated in numerous and various ICOs, gaining plenty of experience, and understand how to avoid all the crucial mistakes their founders have committed.  At the moment, we are working towards Token Sale and signing up partners willing to join our platform. Please find our project profile and Whitepaper above. Share our passion and get ready to embrace the future of video game industry with us!",False

How it works. A gamer brought in by a developer provides the developer an income from all payments in any other game on the platform. The gamer becomes the game's (= developer's) lifetime referral if it was this game that he played first after the registration on the platform. He is the first-level referral for this game (= its developer). If he brings in his friend, the latter will be the second-level referral and so on.      As for the gamers. If a gamer invites his friend to join the game on the platform, the friend becomes the gamer's first-level referral. The gamer receives income from ALL the friend's payments. Then a friend invites his friend, who is the second-level referral for the founder of the referral chain. And so on.  Also gamers receive income from various activities on the platform (achievements, content creation, internal CPA offers, etc.)  Economics. The developer gets 70% from all payments in his game and a share of payments made by his referrals in other games on the platform. The platform thus gets 30% from all payments, 1/3 of which is distributed to referral programs. The first-level referrals are rewarded with 40% of 1/3. The second- and third-level referrals receive 20% each, the forth- and the fifth-level referrals get 10% each.",False
