Origami Network solves several existing problems related to online marketplace development and maintenance, escrow payments, and trusted  reviews.The Origami Network is based on three self-sufficient platforms: o Origami Marketplace o Origami Payment, and o Origami Review. These complementary platforms can be used in a modularized fashion or together   Origami Marketplace  Origami Payment Secure escrow payments    Origami Review Blockchain-powered reviews system      We are three French entrepreneurs from the city of Lille. We know each other since kindergarten and our friendship and development skills are our 2 best assets for the Origami Network project. We (the three of us) have studied software engineering in France and Ireland; we have already worked in the banking and trading area via our first jobs inside the Worldline Company. We know and follow the blockchain area since many years.  When did it start?  We launched our first project together in January 2012 and it already was an online marketplace: http://commenseruiner.com (more than 400K visitors/month) We then launched our software development company: Comptoir du Code (http://comptoirducode.com) in January 2015 in the online commerce area followed by our first e-commerce website Cute Land (https://cute.land, more than 100K visitors/month)  Why Origami Network?  We decided in the summer of 2016 that we could use, package and sell to other companies the marketplace technology we self-developed for our own marketplace CommentSeRuiner.com. We started to work on Origami Marketplace at the end of 2016 and launched it in April 2017. But escrow payment is an expensive area (around 2% to 4% fees + flat fees per transaction), we want to add to our Origami Marketplace technology the possibility to have a blockchain escrow payment with smart contract technology with low fees (around 0.7% to 1% per transaction): This is Origami Payment. Origami Network is a marketplace with escrow payments on the blockchain with smart contracts technology.
