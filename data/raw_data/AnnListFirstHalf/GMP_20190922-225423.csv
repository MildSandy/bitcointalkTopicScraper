Metrology is all about measurements, testing, certification and standards definition. It affects almost every industry. Think about it: go to a shop where a scale is used and it must be periodically calibrated. Scientific and medical instruments must be calibrated. Even service on your automobile is done on calibrated machines and instruments.  GMP is not new at this as they have been providing metrology services in Russia since 2014. The successful results of the pilot phase of the project allows the team at GMP to state confidently that the project can be scaled to reach its global potential. More than 200 GMP centers will be opened in 70 countries of the world. These innovative centers will open their doors in the countries of Asia and Europe.

We received lots of useful recommendations. We'll contact them again soon and consolidate the partnership in the future.  3. October 2, the GMP Center passed one more examination by RosAccreditation.

THE GROWTH OT TOKEN COST         The growth is conditioned by the following factors:    ✔  The GMP project has a strong foundation, expressed primarily by the volume of the market at $ 1.5 trillion with annual and constant growth.    ✔  The GMP project is a scientific platform for generation and implementation of 1000 projects.    ✔  The GMP project is a really existing Project having great potential for global scaling up.Using GMP tokens in mutual settlements between GMP Centers and a very large number of counterparties (more than 200,000 organizations).    ✔  Regular news releases in the media in relation to the GMP Project (with reference to establishing new centers, purchasing the unique equipment, signing significant contracts, meetings with scientists and then some).    ✔  And the most important is releasing innovative products and receiving new patents.   2. ONE PROJECT EQUALS A THOUSAND OF PROJECTS         The GMP project will regularly generate ever new projects, conduct ITOs and distribute new tokens among the holders of GMP tokens. The tokens will be charged and distributed at a rate of 1 to 1 after confirming the availability of GMP tokens from holders by temporarily blocking them with the help of the main Project’s platform.      This strategy will be very beneficial for the holders of GMP tokens, and the ITO of a new IT project will be a good example of its benefits (February 2018). After the ITO part of the tokens will be distributed among the holders of GMP tokens as a reward.      Our best projects will be selected for ITO after passing various tests and achieving a working prototype.      There will be a lot of new projects and ITO, so you can safely say that ""ONE PROJECT IS LIKE A THOUSAND OF DIVERSE PROJECTS"".   3. ONE PROJECT MEANS PERMANENT PROFIT         The GMP project will become the owner of intellectual property products, copyrights and patents.  60% of the financial revenues from copyrights and research patents will be distributed pro rata among the holders of GMP tokens annually.",False

The answer is simple. The basic advantage of our project is a beginning in a good start-up location which is the territory of Russia.   The most of the perspective and interesting ideas born in severe and competitive conditions spend their energy and enthusiasm not on projct implementation but on competition. Energy, money and time are wasted in vain and survival of the project turns into a lucky chance. Such projects often happen to be taken over by stronger market participants and lose the chance for development.   WE ARE TO BE PREPARED AND WE WILL BE WELL-PREPARED.   WE ARE REALLY LUCKY TO HAVE A CHANCE TO START A STARTUP IN RUSSIA!!!   From our experience and analysis results of the competitive environment on the Russian metrology market we can definitely say that the Russian market is a market with underdeveloped competition.   Practically 50% of GMP centers will be opened in Russia.   Stages of preparation: 1 .Without any obstacles we are going to open 86 GMP centers in a short time. We know the precise way to do it.   2. In a short period of time we will obtain an extra experience and an essential element – a financial support too.   3. The next stage is our cooperation with big corporations (for the purpose of attracting money and gaining extra experience)   4. Our next step is to open 18 centers in the Commonwealth of Independent States and to start creating our first science research cluster.   5.

Based on the results of the analysis of the pilot project and the opinion of experts, it can be safely stated that investments in the opening of the network of metrological centers GMP will pay off in a short time   Here is an example of the opening of one metrological GMP center on the territory of the Russian Federation (maximum values and in simple words).   1. The cost of creating one metrological Center = 130,5 million roubles. Note: the requirements for the location of the center are not very high (mainly industrial zones).       2. The number of staff of one Center = 59 pers. 3. Salary fund (per month, before-tax) = 4,16 million rubles. 4. Center's cost for administrative and economic activity, amortization, advertising and other (per month) = 600 000 rubles. 5. Average number of services provided (1 month, 40 types) = 3000 rubles. 6. Average cost of services (40 types) = 3000 rubles. 7. Monthly Center turnover = 27 million rubles. 8. The profits of Center per month (net of deductions, including tax) = 14,5 million rubles. 9. The profits of Center per year = 174 million rubles. 10. Total maximum opening costs = 130,5 million rubles.      Thus, the costs of opening one metrological center GMP will pay off within 10 months, which is VERY high!      USING THE GMP TOKENS IN MUTUAL SETTLEMENTS             The GMP centers are going to be a reliable strategic partner in the sphere of measurements, tests and standardization for the needs of:   ✔  industry;    ✔  agriculture;    ✔  construction;    ✔  transport;    ✔  trading;    ✔  medicine.      According to approximate calculations the GMP metrology centers will be able to work with more than 200 000 organizations on a regular basis. The average annual turnover of the network will reach up 500 – 600 million dollars at the first stage. Besides a higher profit margin we will provide a good opportunity to switch a large number of mutual settlements between the counterparties to operations with GMP tokens and stimulate the counterparties with more profitable and favorable terms for their settlements.      Thus, the GMP project will become a stock controller, regulating volatility of tokens by creating supply and demand.          Control over high volatility gives a number of advantages to counterparties and investors:   ✔  Lowering the risks (if the token value falls).    ✔  Value growth control of the token (a significant growth of the token value is unfavorable for our contractors).    ✔  Possibility of planning and forecasting.     We will create wonderful products and increase investments with minimal risks!    WHAT ARE THE INVESTORS TO GET?              1. THE GROWTH OT TOKEN COST         The growth is conditioned by the following factors:    ✔  The GMP project has a strong foundation, expressed primarily by the volume of the market at $ 1.5 trillion with annual and constant growth.    ✔  The GMP project is a scientific platform for generation and implementation of 1000 projects.    ✔  The GMP project is a really existing Project having great potential for global scaling up.Using GMP tokens in mutual settlements between GMP Centers and a very large number of counterparties (more than 200,000 organizations).    ✔  Regular news releases in the media in relation to the GMP Project (with reference to establishing new centers, purchasing the unique equipment, signing significant contracts, meetings with scientists and then some).    ✔  And the most important is releasing innovative products and receiving new patents.            2. ONE PROJECT EQUALS A THOUSAND OF PROJECTS         The GMP project will regularly generate ever new projects, conduct ITOs and distribute new tokens among the holders of GMP tokens. The tokens will be charged and distributed at a rate of 1 to 1 after confirming the availability of GMP tokens from holders by temporarily blocking them with the help of the main Project’s platform.      This strategy will be very beneficial for the holders of GMP tokens, and the ITO of a new IT project will be a good example of its benefits (February 2018). After the ITO part of the tokens will be distributed among the holders of GMP tokens as a reward.      Our best projects will be selected for ITO after passing various tests and achieving a working prototype.      There will be a lot of new projects and ITO, so you can safely say that ""ONE PROJECT IS LIKE A THOUSAND OF DIVERSE PROJECTS"".            3. ONE PROJECT MEANS PERMANENT PROFIT         The GMP project will become the owner of intellectual property products, copyrights and patents.      60% of the financial revenues from copyrights and research patents will be distributed pro rata among the holders of GMP tokens annually.
