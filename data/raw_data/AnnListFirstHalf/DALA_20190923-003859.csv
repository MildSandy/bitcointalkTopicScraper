The smart contract makes use of the OpenZeppelin and TokenMarket frameworks and the audited smart contract can be viewed on Github. Dala is a token of fixed supply. It is fractionally divisible and long-term deflationary. As described below, only a portion of the Dala token supply will be immediately available, with a large portion of the Dala supply reserved for the Dala Corporation to incentivise the ecosystem in the future.  Wala will initially use a centralized Know Your Customer (KYC) model with captured documentation that is stored within the Wala data centers in the cloud. KYC attestations made against claims and documents will be fulfilled by Wala partners. In our first steps towards identity decentralization, Wala will integrate with Civic in the near-term, enabling users to take ownership of their own identity. Existing documentation, claims, and attestations will be made against the Civic identity, moving the control of their identity back to the users.",False
