The company, which is developing a Blockchain platform that offers cryptocurrency payments for fractional ownership of collectible car brands like Ferrari, launched an initial coin offering last year with plans to raise $25 million at the start of the year.  Punters could buy BITCAR tokens, with the business aiming to be the main cryptocurrency used in the auto sector.  The Bitcar platform would let investors pay by cryptocurrency for a slice of luxury vehicles, which the business planned to buy on their behalf and then hold for around 15 years, until they appreciate enough to sell.  The Australian business set up in Singapore for regulatory purposes and raised $S6.5 million in its token pre-sale  Its public sale netted just under $S3 million – bringing the total raise to $9.5 million earlier this year – less than half of the goal.  One token was worth US10c. According to Coin Gecko, it was trading for AU1.2c on Friday.  Bitcar management told Stockhead the smaller raise amount saw the company re-assess.  “Due to the smaller raise, BitCar have decided to burn unsold tokens from the ICO –– thus reducing the circulating and total supply,” the company said.  This means they’re essentially getting rid of the excess and improving the scarcity of the tokens they did sell.  The founders also said they planned to burn 50 per cent of their allocated tokens.  Despite the company not hitting the raise target, they’ve still got more than $9 million in cash and cryptocurrencies in the piggy bank to be used on developing their luxury car fractional-ownership platform.  Where are they up to?  “The BitCar Platform is currently undergoing development to be updated to a decentralised platform, users will be onboarded when the platform is live so we will be receiving metrics on user data then,” the company told Stockhead.

Today we present you with some of the technical challenges that we and many other blockchain projects currently face. We are looking for your innovative and clever ideas!  With this new series of blog posts, we hope not only to engage in the process of becoming more transparent about what we are doing but also to get some positive feedback from the community. Hopefully, we can then learn about, and share some clever ideas on how to solve some of these common Blockchain / Ethereum decentralized technical challenges.  Problem:  As some of you may be aware, the Car Token (tokens representing a particular Platform Car) will have a fixed supply and will be pegged to a fiat currency on a 1:1 ratio, i.e. say a Ferrari worth USD 1 million comes onto the BitCar platform, then it will get 1,000,000 of its own Car Tokens, unique to that car. This means that when these Car Tokens are bought, using some of the post 31 July 2018 token burn’s 111,485,497 circulating supply of BitCar tokens (these are different from the Car Tokens), a conversion needs to happen in order to calculate the right number of BitCar tokens per Car Token. The problem is how to cheaply and quickly get external BitCar token price data onto the Ethereum blockchain. Ideally, a solution would be available that is not only cost effective but also truly decentralized. Currently, we don’t see a strong one, do you?

The planned Token Burn represents approximately 60 per cent of the initial public sale amount of 250M tokens, significantly reducing the number of coins in circulation.  Similar to some other cryptocurrencies, BitCar uses a dual token system design, meaning BitCar tokens would be used on the Platform (when it becomes operational) to acquire CAR tokens representing individual exotic cars available on the BitCar platform.  The platform is designed to allow CAR token holders to peer-to-peer trade their tokens with others at any time, which BitCar hopes will grow into a large live marketplace over time.  The ‘trade your way to a whole exotic’ model development is also expected to be introduced due to strong user feedback – where numerous users said they would love the ability to eventually wholly own an exotic car.  ""When a new platform car is on-boarded, its CAR tokens will each be pegged to one dollar, fractionalising the car into the CAR Blockchain currency. Each vehicle will have its own unique ‘CAR’ tokens assigned to it, for peer to peer trading” said BitCar.  CAR token holders can view third-party indexes, spot prices and future value estimates, along with data such as a ‘leaderboard’ of token holders and so make their own future trading decisions based on their view of this data.   But fundamentally, in a world first, BitCar still seeks to allow those that want to own CAR tokens to gain exposure to exotics in a tokenized format.  CAR token holders who own all or a majority of the tokens of a vehicle could seek to take possession of the vehicle over time or seek to put their CAR tokens back onto the platform.

He demonstrates, with many similarities to BitCar’s vision, the appreciation of cars and the factors he holds to account, whilst searching for the perfect car. He calls them his ‘six golden rules’ and they are ones you shouldn’t ignore. He put them together with friend and publisher of the Hagerty Price Guide, Dave Kinney.  The Six Golden Rules  Rule 1: Buy the best example of what you can afford.  Kinney points out that “there is a huge difference in value between ‘kinda nice’ and a ‘standout’ car”. You can buy a kind of nice 1973 Porsche 911 Targa for USD $91,000 or a serious low-mileage investment grade one will cost you $292,000.  In 1973, Roy Eller brought his Kelly Green Targa and decided it would be a great investment, so he naturally put it into storage with 3400 miles on it. 30 years later it was sold by Dave Gooding for $426,000.  In 1980 Peter Briggs, our BitCar advisor, brought the 1963 Jaguar E-Type Lightweight for $76,000 and sold it in 1999 for $800,000. In January last year Bonhams sold it for $9.7M.  Rule 2: The more original the better, most of the time.  In 1967, driver Ugo Pillon found a 1925 Bugatti at the bottom of Lake Como. In 2009, he brought it to the surface for Bonhams to auction for charity. Pete Mullion, who made billions selling financial services and owns his own art deco car museum, paid $500,000 for it.  Rule 3: Documentation reigns supreme.  A golden rule we at BitCar follow very strictly is clear provenance and documentation. Roy Eller’s car, the Targa, had all the original documentation and parts ranging from original sales invoice, owner’s manual, maintenance record, warranty book, Porsche certificate of authenticity, even down to the tool kit, leather key fob, registration cards and sales documentation dating back to 1973. As Connolly states “no documents, no buy”.  Rule 4: Buy rare cars with a history.  The history of the car speaks a lot about its value. Cars that have that rarity factor, the more famous the owner or driver, the more important the serial number, the better the investment.  For example what would be the valuation of a car that was one of 10 ever built; a podium at Le Mans, Monte Carlo, the Tour de France; driven by Mossie, Fangio, Shelby or all three of them? Now that is one story worth telling.  Briggs’ 1963 Jaguar E-Type Lightweight was owned from new by Australian motor racing legend Bob Jane, before being auctioned by Bonhams for the $9.7M. A good story always makes for a good sale.  Rule 5: Look at the demographics.  Cars are an emotional buy for most, so why wouldn’t an investment piece be? If you look to Baby-boomer classic car buyers, they generally want the cars like E-types, that they couldn’t afford when they were teenagers. If you’re 60 go down a generation and buy a car from the 70s, which will see 20 year’s more of growth.  Rule 6: You have to love it and you have to love driving it.  As we mentioned, cars are an emotional buy for the thrill of the ride, for the memories, or the lust factor. Don’t just buy it as an investment. Buy it to become an advocate for it. Show it, have articles written about it, a museum to showcase it, like Briggs.  Here at BitCar we share the vision in pursuing the best cars for the benefit of our community. Originality creates more hype and documentation shows authenticity and cars with history have a sense of uniqueness to them, that has matured over time. We are going through extraordinary lengths to ensure that our cars are in impeccable condition.  Now remember, this is not about buying a classic car, but actually investing in the hope that it will be worth more than you paid for at some time in the future. Individual brands of cars like Ferraris from 1958 to 1973 have left every other asset for dead, but so have some more recent Porsches and other supercars. Old cars used to be 25 years old. Now they can be collectables at 25 months. — John Connolly  Read original article here: https://medium.com/bitcar-mag/how-to-make-a-fortune-buying-the-car-you-love-53d1db516e6",False

This BitCar project will somehow find a way for your desire. The project aim is to give the crowd access to a range of exotic models of cars. This includes sports car and vintage classics. Project Bitcar functions by the means of a blockchain-based fractional ownership investment business.  John Bulich, Co-founder and the brain behind the BitCar project have announced that they will burn any unsold tokens after the close of its public sale. It was announced a week before the end of its Initial Coin Offering (ICO).  Classic cars have seen the most demand and price during auctions, according to the latest Knight Frank Luxury Investment Index. If a car’s owner is a celebrity or sports person, then the auction price will be huge.  The model will hopefully generate profits by investment organizing using its native token into the kinds of cars which have historically performed well as investment instruments when compared to more traditional asset divisions.  The BitCar platform uses a dual token system. After the sale is complete, tokens which are available in the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) will be used for trading on outside exchanges. For paying internal costs such as vehicle maintenance and storage charges these tokens can be used. Also, in BitCar ‘second level’ car tokens are required. These tokens are used in the platform that will be used as the digital asset token for every individual exotic car.  Cars tokens are initially valued at US$1. In this case, if a BitCar manages to win the bid of any auction that happened years before, then any buyer of this car tokens would then be linked to a part of the car’s title on the blockchain.  Interested middle east investors can chat with the team at the Dubai's World Blockchain Forum. Visit their website for more information.

Token: BITCAR  White Paper: https://bitcar.io/data/Bitcar%20Whitepaper.pdf  Team: https://bitcar.io/#team  Token Sale: https://mainsale.bitcar.io/  Medium post: https://medium.com/bitcar-mag/tokenising-exotics-disrupting-the-global-hypercar-supercar-and-rare-classic-car-ownership-market-c363b51578e  Bitcar are selling 250 million of 500 million tokens in 4 tranches, after having raised US$5 million in their pre-sale.  The basic idea of BitCar is tokenizing ownership of Exotic Cars. As well as their BITCAR token, specific CAR tokens will be issued to provide fractional ownership of each investment asset.  Other than cryptocurrency, exotic cars have been one of the best performing asset classes. This type of super-rare, highly valuable, coveted asset increases in demand as world population grows, and tends to be recession-proof.  In this sense Bitcar is a hedge, by putting crypto into a non-crypto asset. We think that Bitcar has the potential to do very well as a token. You might not be able to afford a Bugatti Veyron or Mclaren P1, but you can afford some tokens in the ownership of one (no, you don’t get to drive the cars; cars at this level are an investment, one which depreciates with mileage).  Investment in this high-performing asset class was previously open only to the very wealthy. Tokenization makes it available to anyone.  The demographic of who is active in cryptocurrency in the world today is mostly men, and mostly young. Young men are into exotic cars, but usually lack the resources to acquire them outright. Tokenization makes it possible to become a part owner of an exotic car.  Bitcar seem highly aware of their market niche, and have already partnered with  one crypto-supercar dealer Moonlambos who will accept BITCAR as payment. We like the underlying business of Bitcar, but we believe the “cool factor” of hypercar appeal could drive appreciation in token value even more than  revenues and profits in the business.

The concept for BitCar is to peg cryptocurrency to scarce hard assets, such as rare and exotic cars - which have historically outperformed gold, stocks and property over the last ten years.  This chart shows that exotic cars have experienced the highest appreciation of luxury items over a ten year period.    Singapore headquartered BitCar is developing its Blockchain platform that will facilitate cryptocurrency payments for fractional ownership of highly collectible hyper and classic cars.  Rare exotic cars such as Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Bugatti’s will be acquired for BitCar and stored or displayed for up to 15 years.  “BitCar is targeting high-end cars as they’ve historically had much lower price fluctuations than cryptocurrencies. The BitCar platform could be a place of stability in times of crypto market volatility,” said BitCar founder Dr Gov Vank Ek.  This chart shows the price volatility of collectable cars compared to Bitcoin and global stocks. The lower the volatility, the more predictable the price of the asset.

BITCAR tokens are designed to be used in its upcoming platform to allow fractional ownership of rare exotic vehicles. These vehicles have historically outperformed many other asset classes and have not been affordable, except for the uber rich. BitCar aims to open up this market to all, in a world first.  Half of all BITCAR tokens were allocated to its public and private token sale, raising over SGD 9 million to date – but any that aren’t sold (by the end date of the ICO) will be ‘burned’, a cryptocurrency term meaning the tokens are permanently destroyed.  “The positive effect from burning the remaining tokens means the BitCar economy will become even more exclusive as the supply of tokens is radically reduced,” the company said Wednesday.  BitCar was designed with a dual token economy that allows people to buy and sell their tokens outside of the BitCar platform and also use the cryptocurrency to peg its value into CAR tokens.  BITCAR tokens are also designed to be used to purchase the CAR tokens, pay trading fees, maintenance, storage and insurance.  One CAR token will initially be valued at US$1, meaning that if, for example, a McLaren F1 worth $15 million was on-boarded onto the BitCar platform, there would be 15 million McLarenF1#001 tokens (CAR tokens) created.  By purchasing the related CAR tokens, users would be linking to a piece of the car’s title on the Blockchain network.  Recent innovations to the design of the BitCar platform means BitCar token holders may also be able to acquire full ownership of rare exotic cars over time, an idea backed by its multi thousand Telegram community (https://t.me/bitcar_io).  The BitCar token sale is currently in the final round of its ICO, which will close on 20 April.  To get the latest sale statistics for the BITCAR tokens, visit https://mainsale.bitcar.io .

ICO Alert: What is BitCar?  BitCar is a blockchain technology company that seeks to disrupt ownership in the automotive industry globally, and initially in the sector of Exotics — rare and collectible hypercars, supercars, and top end classic cars. Historically these cars have appreciated in value at a greater rate than any other asset class over the last decade; however, they have only been accessible to the extremely wealthy. These Exotics have actually outperformed gold, silver, property, the S&P 500, and others over this time, making it a very important, large, and relatively untapped asset class.  By processing vehicle titles on the blockchain, BitCar seeks to facilitate fractional ownership in these vehicles, which would give the mass market exposure to this asset class for the first time.  The BitCar Platform uses a dual-token economy, where BITCAR utility tokens can be exchanged for on-platform CAR asset tokens, which represent a user’s fractional ownership in an Exotic or set of Exotics. The intention is that these CAR tokens can then be traded between users on BitCar’s unique peer-to-peer (P2P) trading platform.  On top of the offerings mentioned above, BitCar also intends to offer crypto holders the opportunity to “park” their cryptocurrency in a token backed by a physical asset — i.e the Exotic itself. By ‘pegging’ the value of CAR tokens to the USD value of the Exotic (at the time it’s onboarded), users have a method of relative protection against the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. The BitCar platform will present exhaustive analytics for each vehicle, including multiple indices, spot pricing, and future value estimates from 3rd party sources. At any time, a CAR token has its own market price (the price at which it is being traded). P2P traders can see the current price relative to that at which the Exotic was onboarded and thus decide whether it presents good value in comparison to the underlying price.  For example, if a prospective buyer is looking at a CAR token currently trading above the original onboarded price, they will be able to evaluate the offered price against estimated current market value to determine whether the price represents an opportunity — especially during times of crypto volatility. After all, on some days, altcoins are down 40%! We believe there is large demand for this protection based on this excellent asset class.    ICO Alert: How do the BitCar tokens (BITCAR and CAR) function within the platform, and why are they needed?  BITCAR tokens are the utility token for the BitCar Platform and are currently available for purchase during our Token Generation Event. They serve several (strictly utility) functions, e.g. the ability to purchase CAR tokens, pay trading fees, and pay for MSI (Maintenance, Storage, and Insurance), as well as other functions outlined in more detail in our whitepaper. Additional uses of the BITCAR token include payment with our partners. Our latest partnership is with Moonlambos, which accepts BITCAR as a cryptocurrency to purchase supercars in the UK and USA.  The CAR token is an asset token that represents a unique physical exotic car. Every time a car is onboarded onto the BitCar Platform, there will be 1 CAR token for every USD value of that car at the time of onboarding. This CAR token will also be renamed depending on the car it represents ownership in. The CAR token represents a digital fraction of the car’s title on the blockchain, and therefore fractional ownership.  For example, if a McLaren F1 was valued at $15,000,000 at the time at which it was onboarded onto the BitCar Platform, there will be 15,000,000 “McLarenF1#001” tokens (CAR tokens) created.  Platform users will be able to go through the BitCar Platform to see which cars are available for purchase and select them individually, or have the BitCar Platform auto-select according to user-defined criteria. They will then exchange their BITCAR tokens for any number of CAR tokens in a single Exotic or a range of their choice.  Every five years, the ownership of the car will be examined. CAR token holders who own all or a majority of the tokens of a vehicle can take possession of the vehicle (drag-along provisions will apply), which burns the specific CAR tokens. Alternatively, they can chose to put their CAR tokens back onto the platform.    Read the full token report and interview here: https://blog.icoalert.com/ico-alert-report-bitcar-53740b5ce2c",False

Similar to some other cryptocurrencies, BitCar uses a dual token system, meaning people can buy BITCAR tokens and then use this to acquire CAR tokens representing individual exotic cars on the BitCar platform.  The BitCar platform is designed to allow CAR token holders to peer-to-peer trade their tokens with others at any time, which BitCar hopes will grow into a large live marketplace over time.  The ‘trade your way to a whole exotic’ model development has been introduced due to strong user feedback – where numerous users said they would love the ability to eventually wholly own an exotic car.  “When a new platform car is on-boarded, its CAR tokens will each be pegged to one US dollar, fractionalizing the title of the car into the CAR Blockchain currency. Each vehicle will have its own unique ‘CAR’ tokens assigned to it, which can be traded,” said BitCar Executive Charles Kilborn.  CAR token holders will have access to several third-party indexes, spot prices and future value estimates, along with other valuable data such as a ‘leaderboard’ of token holders and so can make their trading decisions based on their view of this data.  “Buyers in the BitCar marketplace, who over time want to own one of these exotics outright – can seek to acquire more tokens in it, by making offers to existing CAR token holders,” said Mr. Kilborn.  CAR token prices are designed to be much less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, and so holders should benefit during times of crypto volatility to benefit from their greater stability compared to other cryptocurrencies.  They can also trade tokens with peers. But fundamentally, in a world first, BitCar will allow those that want to own CAR tokens to gain exposure to exotics that appreciate over time.  “The platform is designed so that users can automate trading criteria, shift between different CAR tokens, auto bid, or opt to accept transactions per their set criteria,” said Mr. Kilborn.  Every five years, the ownership of the car will be examined. CAR token holders who own all or a majority of the tokens of a vehicle can take possession of the vehicle (drag-along provisions will apply), which burns the CAR specific tokens. Alternatively, they could choose to put their CAR tokens back onto the platform.

The Cointelegraph team had a chance to chat with Gov Van Ek, the co-founder and Sheree Ip, legal & Blockchain development head at BitCar, about Singapore, reading and how the things were different back in 2013.  However, all the chats with company representatives came after the main part of the conference - in which BitCar were directly and so actively involved.  Hong Kong, Singapore and yellow Lamborghini The recent conference wasn’t the first collaboration experience for BlockShow and BitCar. A couple of months earlier, Sheree Ip also joined the BlockShow meetup in Hong Kong, where she took part in Regulatory Panel Session and also gave a brief interview afterwards. The location of the BlockShow Asia main conference - Singapore - seemed good for the BitCar team: not only because of the city’s status of one of the biggest global business hubs but also because of the location of the BitCar itself. Gov Van Ek, co-founder of Bitcar, said:  “We chose Singapore specifically for BitCar. The talent pull here is very high, the education system is fantastic, and also everything from the monetary authority of Singapore through to other regulates and the community itself is becoming increasingly supported with high-quality fintech and ICO companies, so that’s why we feel confident in basing ourselves in Singapore and setting up our company here. We think it’s a great environment here.”  BitCar managed to draw everyone’s attention the day before the conference - all because of the yellow Lamborghini car which was clearly supposed to become the main attraction of the company’s exhibition space. It already became clear back then that the company really got prepared for the event.  And it turned out to be true. Apart from being one of the biggest BlockShow exhibitors, it’s hard not to mention the contribution BitCar brought to the conference programme. Thus, in the first day of BlockShow Gov Van Ek shed some light on BitCar activities and provided his rich insight on Fractional Ownership of Exotic Cars - an innovative concept developed by the company. In his speech, performed from the main stage of the event, Gov Van Ek explained the company’s vision of exotic cars as not just a piece of art, but a high-class asset. He explained his point of view with several examples, also expressing his regret for this asset not being properly explored in some parts of the world:  “Right now in China there is still a ban on importing this kind of cars, and it’s only matter of time before it opens up and there are thousands of millionaires who are going to want to get involved in that asset class, so this asset class is really exciting - that’s what we think.”  Read the full article here: https://cointelegraph.com/news/wanna-have-a-crypto-lamborghini",False

Exotic cars such as Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Bugattis will be acquired by BitCar and stored or displayed for up to 15 years while they appreciate in value.  The cars will be tokenised and investors will be able to park their crypto in BitCar tokens, which can be traded on the decentralised Blockchain platform.  “Exotic cars have been one of the world’s best performing asset classes over the past decade, outperforming property and gold. BitCar is giving ordinary people an opportunity to gain exposure to these high performing assets,” said BitCar co-founder Gov Van Ek.  BitCar has been established by Perth-based Ledger Assets.  “We have a proven track record in the development of disruptive technology that challenges traditional business models. With BitCar we wanted to make luxury car ownership accessible to everyone, not just the uber wealthy,” said Mr Van Ek.  Verified agents will source, acquire and store the exotic cars for a period of between 5 and 15 years, at which point they’ll be sold and the asset appreciation distributed amongst token owners.  “It’s a bit like collecting art, only the picture of your car is on your screensaver, not in a gallery. It’s the only collectible asset class that can’t be faked, which is why we saw it as the lowest risk,” said Mr Van Ek.  BitCar is working with ASX-listed DigitalX - the corporate advisor for the ICO. DigitalX will connect BitCar to its global network of cryptocurrency investors.  BitCar will be issuing up to 250 million in the token sale, which will open on December 16.

In a world first, the decentralized and revolutionary BitCar.io platform allows crypto space holders and traditional car enthusiasts to own and trade in exotic super cars in small fractions, with new BitCar tokens.  The cars include the likes of Lamborghini's, Ferrari's and Bugatti's.  The vehicles will be stored or displayed for up to 15 years to optimise their value.  Co-founded by Gov van Ek, Nuno Martins and John Bulich, BitCar believes that exotic cars serve the public well when exhibited in collections where the public can continuously enjoy them.  Perth's Peter Briggs, who at one point had 300 classic cars, is an advisor.  Briggs, the colourful West Australian property developer and mining entrepreneur, owned the first Holden prototype to be made in Australia, which was listed in 2013 for $1 million. It cost around $15,000 in 1980.  BitCar aims to disrupts exotic car ownership from just the privileged few and opens the asset class up to include the general enthusiast.  Automobiles are no longer considered as a mere mode of transportation, noted that according to AXA Art for the first eight months of 2017, 7,443 cars were sold at auction.  The annual sales for the past 12 months was 890m Euros with classic cars over the $1 million accounting for 40 per cent, of the market value.  Estimates for the total number of Ferrari’s made to date are 130,000, suggesting at an average price of $100,000 to $200,000, then the total Ferrari market stands at $13-26 billion.  ""This is only one brand of targeted Exotics,"" Bitcoin notes.  The Sultan of Brunei, estimated to be worth $20 billion is said to have 6,800 Exotic cars, by far the largest collection in the world - including 452 Ferraris and 11 McLaren F1s.

Hosted by Paul Seils, Cryptomasterminds and sponsored by PSA.  In this live session, Ip discusses how BitCar evolved and how it tokenizes the Asset Class of Classic and Rare Cars. How Classic Cars retain their value better than property and gold over the last 10 years. Ip introduces the team behind BitCar, including Peter Briggs one of the top advisors.  Extract from Live Presentation:  Exploring Art Classes Tied to the Blockchain IP — BitCar evolved by looking at certain asset classes like Art, Wine and rare cars and how to tokenize them as an Asset on the blockchain with cryptocurrency.  BitCar tokenizes Exotic Cars allowing fractional ownership of a car. For example, you could potentially own a Bugatti Veyron. BitCar is a peer-to-peer decentralized trading platform. Each car is represented by its own car token, once its tokenized on the platform.  BITCAR is a ‘Utility’ token, we’ve got that ruling in various jurisdictions already.  Ongoing Bounty Campaign — The Gamification Aspect As part of marketing, there is an ongoing Bounty system providing rewards in tokens. A special reward of a Lamborghini Huracan will be awarded to the Top Person on the Leaderboard, who markets and builds the community within the platform.  So we have a full gamification aspect to the platform.  Trading in Exotic Cars In this live interview, IP covers how to trade in Exotics on the platform and the expected timelines according to the Whitepaper Roadmap.

When you purchase a new automobile, the value of that vehicle begins to decline as soon as you drive it off the dealer's lot. Apparently, that's not the case with exotic vehicles, such as Ferrari, Lamborghini, etc., and the BitCar ICO wants to give the cryptocurrency community a way to profit. They've created a way for buyers of its coin to own a fraction of an exotic vehicle, without all of the usual responsibilities such as titling, insurance, etc., and benefit from the rise in the value of the asset. BitCar has decentralized luxury car ownership so that it's no longer just accessible for the very wealthy, and the upcoming ICO will launch sometime in 2018.  The development of the Bitcar platform and underwriting expenses will cost somewhere in the neighborhood of USD 10 million. The starutp intends to direct the proceeds from its upcoming ICO primarily across underwriting exotic vehicles and software engineering with the balance going toward legal expenses, marketing, etc.   Fractionalizing Super Cars The way that it works is Bitcar ""fractionalizes"" the exotic cars on its platform into Ethereum smart contract-driven asset tokens dubbed car tokens whose name reflects the car make and model, such as the Ferrari F40 token, according to the company's blog. These fractionalized tokens can then be purchased with the Bitcar token. The blockchain, the company says, gives token holders the ability to hold or trade their fractionalized tokens.

Trade your way to an exotic. BitCar opens up a whole new asset class for the first time on the blockchain. The BitCar Ecosystem allows for real usage of the token within the platform, so demand for the cryptocurrency is expected to grow over time.  BITCAR tokens will be used over the course of the acquisition of the Exotic for maintenance, storage, insurance and licensing (MSI) as part of joint ownership.     The BitCar Platform will have a network of Agents who will manage the onboarding of Exotics including tokenization on the platform and MSI.  Assets Managers on the Platform are responsible for transfer and update of the assets.  The Platform Manager is a messaging system for modules within the platform.  And the BITCAR Token is the main ERC20 Token that handles all transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.  A secondary ERC20 car token represents individual Exotic assets on the platform that facilitate tokenized ownership of Exotics.    Types of Exotics to Be Acquired on the Platform   The line-up of Exotics to be acquired for the Platform include collector cars like Ferrari F40 and F50, Bugatti Veyron, Lamborghini Aventador, McLaren P1, Koenigsegg One and more.     Funds from ICO token sales will be used to bring on initial Exotics and then accelerate and underwrite new Exotics onto the Platform. The objective is to aggregate $500+ million of Exotics within the first 3 years of operation and build out to exceed $1 billion thereafter. These targets will drive the need for BITCAR as the ecosystem of users grows.   The Voting System   A voting system within the BitCar Platform allows fractional owners to vote on the liquidation date of Exotics, the asset is normally held between 5 to 15 years on the platform. A minimum sale vote needs to be reached among token holders to initiate the sale of an Exotic.   CAR token holders who own all or a mojority of the tokens of a vehicle can take posession of the vehicle (drag-along provisions will apply), which burns the specific car tokens. Alternatively, they can choose to put their CAR tokens back onto the platform.    Gamification   An Incentive System within the BitCar Platform rewards Users in BITCAR Tokens for marketing the ecosystem and other activities like trading performance, with the Ultimate Reward for users to own their own Exotic car. Users will be awarded different levels according to their trading performance and earn BITCAR reward tokens and other prizes over time.     Competition Prize   Competition Prize could be a Lamborghini Subject to the BitCar ICO selling tokens to raise a minimum amount (to be announced at the time of the ICO) in Cryptocurrency (and subject to any other applicable terms and conditions which will be defined) a one off first prize in the competition will be a Lamborghini, Huracán. This incentive will reward a user who has consistently and over a period of time contributed to the growth of the Platform and the Ecosystem.     Achievements to Date   BitCar was conceived by Ledger Assets in 2015, a leading Blockchain Technology Company in Australia. BitCar’s prototype software platform (BitCar.io) has been designed and built in-house and has been under development for over 2 years.

Car owners will not be selling their Exotic Cars on the platform, Exotic hyper cars will be acquired and then tokenized on the BitCar platform for fractionalized ownership.  Users will need BitCar tokens to access the platform and for MSI (maintenance, storage and insurance of exotics), secondary tokens are linked to individual assets (exotic cars) and will enable peer-to-peer trading of exotics on the decentralised platform. Owners receive an immutable digital asset blockchain ledger record confirming their title, independently verifying their interests on a public Blockchain that will be used.
