A few questions that are going around in my head after researching a lot:  Why can't I find any information about Ron Ramsey that are not related to Denaro? Especially regarding his director position at the London Computer Systems. Why isn't Denaro mentioned at Jeremy Bokers linkedin profile? Regarding to his profile he's still working for another company since 2015. There are even less information about the other team.  Also they're not writing much about technical details or a rough concept of the technics used. For me it's a very ambitious objective to finish the programming in two months with only two programmers (April 2018 to May 2018, according to their roadmap) by only showing a rough concept in the whitepaper so far.  This isn't looking consistent for me and maybe I'm prejudging too much. But I'm not convinced at the moment.  What are you thinking about this?",True

It is only the first 10 people to use the code that receive the bonus. We are sending out these emails every day. You have to try to be as fast as possible to cash in on the bonus. It changes each day- sometimes it is higher than 50%!  Quote from: nickbelski on February 23, 2018, 11:14:14 AM Your project and website looks very attractive in front, but when someone dig deeper, he can find some strange unsolved problems.  The most important thing is transparency. If your team members are real professionals and exist, they should have linkedin profiles. More than 20 days passed from the first enquiry about this problem, and it is not yet solved. Still No linkedin profiles on your site. Hi there, we appreciate your concern and apologize for the delay. We have been very busy recently but as this is a growing concern among our community, we will bring it nearer the top of our list of tasks and get it done as soon as possible. We do indeed have Linked In profiles and they will be added. If you want to find us in the meantime, you can search our names on Linked In followed by “Denaro”",True

Thank you for your question. Denaro is a multi-crypto wallet system - it isn’t just a debit card. The payment terminals we offer are unique and a first mover in cryptocurrency. As for the card itself, its main advantage over BitPay is simply the fact it is compatible with BTC, LTC, ETH and DNO, whereas BitPay is only for Bitcoin. This adds unprecedented levels of liquidity to LTC and ETH, which is one of many reasons our debit card will have appeal from the get-go.  Other reasons include the fact that our wallet’s intuitive design provides unrivaled ease of use and that it is a one-stop shop for numerous cryptocurrencies. Instead of having to store, receive and spend different cryptocurrencies from different wallets, you can save yourself the hassle and store them all in one, user-friendly wallet that offers unparalleled liquidity both online and offline.",True

In regards to exchanges, the DNO token will be listed on as many major exchanges as we can get it listed on. DNO’s primary purpose is to be used as a utility token - to drive all settlement on the network. It does indeed offer additional benefits/advantages, such as discounts when paying for merchant services, discounts on debit-card topups and a share of the transaction fees (distributed upon certain milestones being reached). You can learn more about the benefits of being a DNO token holder by reading our whitepaper (https://denaro.io/docs/Denaro_Whitepaper.pdf).  Quote from: KlifDonats on February 08, 2018, 11:51:53 AM How is the Denaro Wallet protected?  The Denaro wallet offers numerous layers of protection, which can all be activated from the security tab. These include IP-address protection, two-factor SMS authentication and two-factor email authentication. IP-address protection. When Denaro’s IP-address protection is enabled, your account is only accessible from the last IP address you successfully logged in from.  In addition to the Denaro account security, the tokens themselves are protected by our security algorithm; built on an Ethereum-blockchain protocol, DNO tokens possess secured hashing via smart contract and Private-Key Signatures (PKS) for instant and truly private transactions.
