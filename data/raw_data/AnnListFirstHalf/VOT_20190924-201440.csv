Any chance you would work on the algo change? I understand that makes it difficult to keep updating with ZEC but I think its definitely worth considering 144.5 or 192.5 algo developed originally by the BTCz team.  Currently the entire VOTE network produces 71,280 coins worth only $35 for and entire 24 hour day. The global hashrate is equivalent to only eight A9 miners. The result is a pure mine-n-dump and eventually the blockchain will fall apart. I'm sorry you don't see how ASICs can ruin your project. ASIC owners are in a whole from day 1. They have hardware that depreciates 3x faster than GPUs. ASICS have practically no resale value about 10% in one year. GPUs are worth 60% after one year of mining. ASIC owners have no choice but to mine-n-dump to break even for their A9 bricks.

Before sapling, every shielded transaction used more than 1GB of RAM and it took several minutes to complete. Due to that, creating polls/votings through VoteCoin took long time and lots of resources, since the polls are technically stored on blockchain as a shielded transactions. Now after Sapling, only about 50MB of RAM is needed to create a shielded transaction, and it only takes few seconds to compute. Sapling shielded addresses are now default in VoteCoin (since 2.0.2), it works if you want to send a transaction to somebody else, but polls are still using old pre-sapling mechanism (called sprout) and it is still neither optimal nor fast.  So, our next goal is to switch to Sapling for polls too in VoteCoin as well. But this requires support for exporting of viewing keys from the wallet for sapling addresses, which is not yet supported by VoteCoin. Since VoteCoin is a fork of zcash, we decided to wait for ZCash to implement it, and then we can backport it easily. Anybody in VoteCoin team does not feel comfortable trying to implement this feature on our own at the moment, since making a mistake would have fatal consequences, so it's safer to wait for official support in ZCash.  Regarding portable wallet, the current GUI wallet can be safely used from an USB device on Windows, since it stores data within the wallet directory. However this is not possible on MAC, since MAC stores wallet data on local user's home directory, regardless of where was the wallet application started from.  -Tom",False

Informational emptiness is not the best way to increase interest in the project. The official pool often falls, I see the negative balances of the miners and do not see any comments from the author about this, although earlier he always reported on the failures and quickly corrected them. If the sports betting system is improved, success will raise this project to new heights. Why create obstacles to success with your own hands? Perhaps the author helps those who want to buy coins at the lowest price? This is the usual method of attracting large investors without increasing the coin rate ..  When the etherium was young the price fell down, the sponsors were constantly added, the price continued to fall, the miners complained about the low price. Vitalik said that the etherium should not be expensive. Of course, in fact it was the moment of buying coins by investors at a low price. Those who realized this were happy after a while.",False

Here are some guides on how to update to the new Wallet after overwinter update.  If you are updating from GUI walet 1. (optional step) Open old wallet, will automatically open in safe mode and wait to sync. 2. Make a backup of old wallet esp wallet.dat (votecoin folder/resources/app/votecoin) 3. Download new wallet (Dont start wallet) https://github.com/Tomas-M/VoteCoin-wallet/releases/ and copy all the files from new wallet into the old wallet and overwrite all files (170 files) 4. Wallet.dat file should still be in there unaffected 5. Open votecoin.exe after files were overwritten 6. Wait to sync.  If you are updating from original old WINDOWS text wallet.   1. Downloaded newest wallet. https://github.com/Tomas-M/VoteCoin-wallet/releases/ 2. Put wallet.dat from old wallet into new wallet (resources/app/votecoin) and votecoinid file from old into new (resources/app) 3. Start new wallet. wait for it to sync to block chain to show transactions. It will still give safe mode error. 4. Then Export private keys from back up section on new wallet. 5. Now you dowload a new wallet again,  export to a new folder, open and wait for fresh wallet to sync. 6. Import your keys from back up section.  This is the long winded way but works, make sure you back up those walelet.dat and votecoinid files somewhere else too   If you are updating from original LINUX text wallet, open the old wallet, ignore the safe mode error.  1. Type command $ vot export to get your private keys 2. Download latest wallet from @everyone overwinter update has been completed, get new wallet below... I will make a quick video on how to tansfer coins if needed https://github.com/Tomas-M/VoteCoin-wallet/releases/ 3. Open new wallet and wait to sync 4. Go to Back up tab in new wallet import your keys 5. Wait for resync (wont take long)  Cheers",False

If you are updating from GUI walet 1. (optional step) Open old wallet, will automatically open in safe mode and wait to sync. 2. Made a backup of old wallet esp wallet.dat (votecoin folder/resources/app/votecoin) 3. Download new wallet  https://github.com/Tomas-M/VoteCoin-wallet/releases/ and copy all the files from new wallet into the old wallet and overwrite all files (170 files) 4. Wallet.dat file should still be in there unaffected 5. Opened votecoin.exe after files were overwritten 6. Wait to sync.  If you are updating from original old WINDOWS text wallet.   1. Downloaded newest wallet. https://github.com/Tomas-M/VoteCoin-wallet/releases/ 2. Put wallet.dat from old wallet into new wallet (resources/app/votecoin) and votecoinid file from old into new (resources/app) 3. Start new wallet. wait for it to sync to block chain to show transactions. It will still give safe mode error. 4. Then Export private keys from back up section on new wallet. 5. Now you dowload a new wallet again,  export to a new folder, open and wait for fresh wallet to sync. 6. Import your keys from back up section.  This is the long winded way but works, make sure you back up those walelet.dat and votecoinid files somewhere else too   If you are updating from original LINUX text wallet, open the old wallet, ignore the safe mode error.  1. Type command $ vot export to get your private keys 2. Download latest wallet from @everyone overwinter update has been completed, get new wallet below... I will make a quick video on how to tansfer coins if needed https://github.com/Tomas-M/VoteCoin-wallet/releases/ 3. Open new wallet and wait to sync 4.

But now I am somewhat disappointed to see this to say the least.  A short reason ASICs are terrible:  Mining hardware cost is about residual value, not initial cost. The ""price"" of the equipment is irrelevant. The ""price drop"" over time is the actual cost. GPU Rigs are worth 60% of their original value in one year. ASICs are worth 5% in one year. So on average the ASIC hardware is depreciating 12x faster than a GPU mining rig. Since most of the ASIC buyers get their ASICs very late, it is even worse for them. So this forces them to ""Mine-N-Dump"", meaning they keep dumping whatever they mine just trying to money back that they paid for the ASIC equipment first. That ever happens because typically the equipment starts making $5/day per $1000 worth of ASIC and quickly drops to $0/day (remember X11? same is going to happen to A9 and Z9 buyers, except for the YouTube celebrities who get their ASICs 3 months before others to put up video ads). While the ASIC buyers never pay off their equipment, their Mine-N-Dump process (selling every altcoin the mine the same day) continuously lowers the price of the coin. Do the math, even if 10% of those who mined VOT dumped it on an exchange the same day, the price would go down to zero in a week and people stop mining which will in turn kill the coin or make it so easy for someone to do a 51% attack and drain large accounts out of their coins.  Look at this list, you see the ASICs that say they ROI in say 100 days? Thats utterly incorrect because the calculation assumes a flat income on a daily basis while the income quickly drops on the ASIC miner which is logically accurate too because if it was profitable then Bitmain was not STUPID to ship it out, they would just continue to mine with it. https://www.asicminervalue.com/opportunities  So that is why we need the ASICs out of this project or you will watch the price of VOT dwindle down to zero which hurts some of us who bought VOT with actual FIAT money.    Again, I love your project, you have the only VOTING system in the whole Equihash verse.  I just wish you had a mobile app or would do a fork of Bitpay Android app so I could watch the mined coins come to my phone instead of an exchange or my home computer that I never turn on.",False

What I was able to learn from the article is this: 1) somebody gained significant hashing power and at the same time he exploited some weakness in IntenseCoin to find 6000 blocks himself. 2) IntenseCoin developers decided that this is bad and they made a hard fork, causing A LOT of troubles.  I believe that there are two problems. First one is the exploitable weakness, and second trouble is mad developers making hard fork as a solution for this problem.  If the very same problem happened with VoteCoin, 6000 blocks would be worth 750K VOT coins, which the ""attacker"" could actually sell at TradeSatoshi exchange to get 1.33 BTC. The price of VOT would drop down to 100 sat. But that's the worst case scenario. Nobody gets hurt. All coins held by all users would be safe. There would be no need for any hard forking in my opinion.  VoteCoin uses a dificulty adjustment algorithm based on DigiShield v3/v4 [DigiByte-PoW], with simplifications and altered parameters, to adjust difficulty to target the desired 2.5-minute block time. Unlike Bitcoin, the difficulty adjustment occurs after every block. So I would say that VoteCoin does not have such weakness as like IntenseCoin and it would prevent such situation anyway.  There is no need to fear the upcoming ASIC release...  -Tom",False

But that means nothing wrong. It has nothing to do with Bitmain company, they will not absorb anything. Each user will choose his preferred pool.

Do you have the ability to change the algorithm yourself? Yes or no? As I understand you do not have such a technical opportunity, so why then all this to discuss, just admit it, and that you are completely dependent on the network Zcash. As I said before Zcash does not care, because its 2, 5 coins from each block they already get. Votecoin in the first place became famous thanks to miners, who spread the information about your coin. Asic for the average user is a high-risk device. Profitability falls quickly and it becomes worthless. Everything will come to the conclusion that Votecoin will produce large factories and huge farms, and the community you lose, I guarantee you, there are lots of examples.

ASICs have lots of advantages against GPUs, but lets leave ASIC advantages alone and look on community itself. I see @Skydreamer points/worries. Ordinal miners or just curious people have an option to try and mine VOT and have a play and test it. Somebody with just a single GPU can get involved in VOT. If VOT becomes ASIC driven then you lose out those people and community - running ASIC is a business so if VOT is more of a business project then that's ok, just say it . People would like to know what to do, to leave VOT community or in contrary, join it with ASIC power . What direction are we going? There are some thoughts for you Tom: if you make it ASIC resistant then lots of miners may soon join you. If you do not make it ASIC resistant then ASIC farms will join and so part of community may leave. I am not sure which route is best though. Maybe the best one is the one you are doing - just wait and see , but some may hate such waiting games. There is no way you can please us all .",False

Current VoteCoin network hash rate is 500 Ksol/s. Bitmain's Equihash miner costs around $2200 including PSU and shipping, while the miner is capable of mining 10Ksol/s.  To get over 50% of hashrate of VoteCoin network, you need to generate another 500 Ksol/s. You would have to buy 50 such ASIC miners, so the cost would be 110 000 USD. (not mentioning that bitmain will sell only 1 device to a single user) (not mentioning that having 51% of hashrate does NOT ruin the network at all)  If you want to get the same hashrate with GTX 1060 cards, you would need 1666 such cards (300 Sol per card), which would cost you around 400 000 USD today. So ASIC gives you only 4x the hashrate for your money. Not mentioning that once the bitmain's ASICs are released, the price for used GPUs will decrease rapidly and you may get 1666 such cards for say 200 000 USD while still getting several years warranty, compared to bitmain's 180 days.  In long term, the ASICs will consume less energy, indeed, so it will be more profitable that GPUs, but other than that, the advantage of having bitmain's ASIC boxes will be insignificant.  -Tom",False

A) Exchanges who have tons and tons of fake trades which in turn grabs attention and brings in real traders. Bitfinex, HitBTC, Binance, Bittrex and even Coinbase are notable ones. The US stock market functions in this matter, majority of the trades are bot trades, basically no fee trades that are fabricated between the real people's BIDxASK to create the illusion of huge volumes. IT is estimated that 90% of the US stock market https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-15/it-s-a-quant-s-stock-market-as-computer-programs-keep-on-buying is bot trades, and I am not talking about bot trades that are between one bot from one institution with another bot from another institution actually doing automatic trades, I am talking about bots fabricating trades with no money or real trades happening in the background.  B) Exchanges who do not take have fake trading bot activity. Some of these are Tradesatoshi and Cryptopia where you can see zero volume and bid spread between bidxask with some altcoins. I typically trust those exchanges a lot more than the larger ones who could collapse like Cryptsy did back in the day. ",False

I checked out your Github history and you have been active there for a long time. I am starting to love this project because of your background. Unfortunately I cant buy much every time I put a buy order against DOGE the price creeps up.  Anyway, I think a VOTE-OS could certainly be a hit by integrating the Crypto into the operating system's browser this is something no one has done before and who knows where it will take us. To get adoption by the community, the first release could be one that is used by the miners (similar to EthOS) that boots up and has all drivers etc ready to go. Then in turn the OS  auto converts anything that has been mined by the system into VOTE coins using an API tied to an exchange.  The idea of paid AD removal to protect content creators as opposed to stealing with ADBlock, is actually from BAT, not me and their Brave browser (BAT: https://basicattentiontoken.org). Although I had for years thought of a similar solution, they are the ones who actually did it and when I saw it I thought someone had read my mind. The way it could work is that you can buy VOT coins that will go embedded inside the browser that also acts as your wallet, then you can chose to block off the ads by spending tiny amounts of VOT coins. The author of that website could signup with you to get a big cut of the VOT coins spent on his page. So we are talking about combining LINUX+Miner++Wallet+ADBlock+Chrome+""BAT ideas"". Eventually the browser+wallet combo could spin off and be installed on Windows as a standalone product, while still be downloadable as a Crypto-Linux USB stick.  Future roadmaps:  The BTCZ.me technology could be embeded within the Browser or the OS.  Also some payment gateways need to get implemented INSIDE the browser such as this: https://btcz.in/#  Bitpay can be forked for Android wallet like BTCZ team has done.",False

Anyone can run/organize a vote. This is the good part, as you don;t need anything like a masternode or special permissions to do it, you just set up your own poll/election and run it (at the costs required by the network, that are very low). To use the voting you will need to follow intuitive steps from within the interface (in the next release), and to participate in a vote you will need an invite code from whoever organized that vote. The functions are more than just voting, it allows participants to stake an amount of vot coins on their decision, or to transfer funds in case of a crowdfunding.

I had some problems with it too until i learned how it works.  As a short tutorial, once you are on the VOT trading page, you check the available SELL orders (if you want to BUY), or the available BUY orders if you want to sell, then put your price equal to the first offer that has the amount of coins you want, or just the first buy/sell offer. When you click the offers, the numbers change in your BUY/SELL sections above, be sure you change the amount you want to buy or sell before submiting.  If there are not enough offers to cover the number of coins you want to buy/sell at the price you desire, you can wait untill the market fluctuates and the price reaches your desired price, or you can change the price to match the next avaiable offer.  If you are not used to exchanges or have little experience with trading i suggest you be very careful at the totals, or do just a test till you get used to it first. This exchange works in fact very similar with other exchanges, but somehow the interface is confusing many times because of the way and the order you need to click things and the way those fields get auto-filled with data..a nightmare..but eventually works.

Once the new release will be out i'll be able to discuss more about the implemented solution.  In my opinion (and please correct me if i am wrong), the only way one could control the fairness of votes inside a community (company, country, game, etc), is through ways specific to that community only. For example if the organizer of the election can limit the votes to 1 per participant, but make that vot value arbitrary, yet limited(!), that means that they can avoid this situation. An other example would be to limit voters to a set everyone agrees they should vote, so they avoid participants that could sabotage the vote.  These concepts have been extensively discussed and a technical solution has been found. It will be presented in a raw, more technical way in the next release, but it will be improved in the future.  This problem where a voter could sabotage a vote just because he can afford it, was one of my main concerns when joining this team. My concept solution to this is to ""tranfer"" this problem to the organizer of the poll/ellection/fund and offer him technical ways to do it from within the interface. I thought this so because each individual community knows best how to prevent such things in their own ways already, and VoteCoin should also be usable for crowdfunding where ""paying more"" is a benefit not an issue (unlike voting).  Presenting all these quite distinct functionalities in a coherent and well integrated way will be our next challenge.",False

I'll keep this brief and sketch out the main (but by no means the only) use of VoteCoin that I see - apologies if this turns out to be longer than anticipated...  As the coin actually represents a financial commitment when voting, then I don't think there should ever be a possibility of simply losing your money if you don't 'win the vote'. Rather, voting on some project priorities strikes me as a much better plan. As an example, voting on which wallet for a crypto coin should be developed with a GUI first (windows, linux, MacOS). This way, all three options will eventually materialise and the development time can either be divided as a simple 1st, 2nd, 3rd or a percentage of dev time weighted directly on the votes cast to the relevant windows/linux/MacOS wallets.  More generally, I'm thinking something along the lines of crowdfunding, but also including steering project direction through a voting mechanism. Effectively, funding and steering a project through it's development phase (and beyond).  So how would this work in practice? Well setting up a MySQL (or other) db to store options/results/project details/wallet addresses etc. which would be accessed from the clients wallet would be the way I'd tackle something like this, but I'm sure you'll have plenty of your own ideas.  I can probably elaborate on this a bit, but just thought I'd run this past you as a possibility before going into any great detail...",False

I have an impressive work portfolio, i don't lack acknowledgement.  If there is anyone out there that can actually help in any way with this, follow my example and lets help these guys make a great productm and compensate the points where they are not that strong. Devs where a bit reluctant to accept help in the first place, but lets be serious, who doesn;t need an extra mind at work towards same purpose.  I am not telling you ""buy coins they are great"", i dont have enough to get a profit at all, i have all my liquidities stuck in other exchanges, but i wont sell the votecoins i have anyway lol, what i am saying is that if you are a professional in some field that might help, and you have some spare time and don't expect to be paid for it (even though you might actually be rewarded for your efforts), dedicate a fraction of your ""resources"" to help this project grow as fast as its needed to survive the crypto explosion nowdays, where big companies start to ""Centralize"" the concept of descentralization.  If the devs personally refuse direct help, the truth still stands that an underfunded and unstaffed project has a hard time to surface. i am willing to centralize your help offers, to analyze them and to decide if any of your available capabilities can be put to fair and useful use, then present them for final decision to the devs.  For example i am looking for passionate people that can help me spellcheck content on the new site (i am not a native english speaker), test it out and give feedback before its even presented in any way, so in the end it will come out great. I wont pay you, this is not a job offer, but you might receive VOT from the devs if your effort matters, and from me as well, from my personal stash that is (unless things evolve and vote.coin will agree to let me handle this aspect of their development, ..something i never asked, but will be willing to do if they ever consider this helps the project.  Maybe they are fully capable of doing this alone and i am wasting my time, but i dont think so. I think they are slow due to lack of funds to fully invest in a larger workforce and being slow in this kind of market is suicidal.  I will discuss this with them today and if i am totally wrong about their current capabilities and plans i will remove this post. But at this moment, my opinion stands, any help matters. Even if you let someone else know about this project matters, or report a bug or more .  Let me get back to you about this idea, and as i said, it might be stupid idea, if so i will remove it, but if not, i will give you more update on it.",False

I've been discussing with dev the subtle renaming of the main words that define this coin, and i think i have an alternative that fits more with the actual use (that will be implemented in a couple of month probably) ...please share your opinion on this if you would like to:  ""Elections"" and ""poll"" could be rephrased to ""Decision funding"" and ""staked poll""  the reason behind this is that VOT enables participants to a poll to spend VOT and both finance and stake money on their decision choice. Also election is too much connected to politics, at least where i come from, and this might cause confusion. Tbh i don't see political elections migrate in any way to any different ""system"", so a better wording for the use of this coin is neccessary to explain its use  Do you think its good? do you find it confusing?

For example promoting this project on facebook (share it), will give you a VOT reward so you can start USING it. This coin is not designed as a money alternative, but a more complex functional funding and voting integrated mechanism. The dev behind it doesn't seem to be a multi corp style business but more a passionate team that works on this without other alternatives of being funded other than the project itself.  The Dev team needs funds to do all this, to promote everything and to develop everything. This started based on Zcash as a ""copy paste"" project, but the work done to improve zcash and adapt it to their purpose if an entirely different thing. This is not just a zcash clone. It just uses it so it can work based on the only truely anonymous mechanism , with zero knowledge proofs, it is an alternate use of the zcash tech.  When all cryto money alternatives drop and rise and become uncertain, a coin that can actually be used will be much more stable. I am hoping the dev will manage to implement the features we discussed and allow me to announce them properly, till then i can't tell more about what's to come.   All i can say for now is that i believe in the potential of this project and its a considerable share of my crypto portfolio, not because i want it to grow and sell, but because i want to start using it as soon as possible in my gaming sites network. I won't give links here so this won't sound as advertisement, but it is a significant list of projects i plan to adapt to use votcoin.

After looging at debug logs i realized there is a deprecation flag because zcash is marked as deprecated after a certain point, and the daemon won't work unless explicitly told so and/or updated.  i found useful files here: https://github.com/radix42/zcash4mac/tree/zcash4win-12/win     i got my zcash out of there..if these people are unable to work on a better interface in such a long time i am already losing my hope in their capabilities or interests.. (buying vot with them )  but i still have an issue with transactions confirming and blockchain updating in the VOT wallet.  I suspect this is related to the same issue and it needs that flag set and daemon and cli updated, but i don't know how to do it, so i will forward my findings to the dev team and they will find a solution.  Maybe its just me because i am running both zcash and vot on the same machine, i really don't know, but i posted this for others that face the same issue.  run the .bat or set the option for deprecation automanitcally, then update zcashd and zcash-cli, and you are good to go woth zcash. Hopefully VOT releases a fix to this but i know they are ultra busy now working on the voting functionality.  ",False

Fist problem is the deprecation policy, which is inherited from ZCash by all its forks. There is an automatic deprecation shutdown feature which will halt the node some time after 16 week time period after the release date, and you can run such node only after adding the parameter to the config file as described by maxlumnar. The problem with swing wallet probably is that it incorporates version 1.0.12 of zcash, which is now considered deprecated, and for that reason swing wallet needs that parameter specified. We tend to update VoteCoin wallet monthly and we keep track with zcasch changes. That means, VoteCoin wallet (newest version) is now updated to 1.0.14 core, so there is no need for that disabledeprecation parameter in any way. We also plan to keep track with ZCash core in the future, so our wallets should not have such issue.  Second problem is probably in the RPC port settings. VoteCoin inherited RPC port from Zcash, so it is not possible to run VoteCoin and ZCash wallets simultaneously, unless you specify different port. We will address this by changing the default RPC port in VoteCoin in some future release. For the GUI Wallet, the RPC port is set automatically to a different value, so it should not matter. But the CLI wallet still uses the default rpc port which is the same as for zcash, so you can't run both wallets simultaneously unless you specify rpcport=12345 manually in config file.  Finally, if you are having problems with GUI wallet syncing with the network, your node can be temporarily blacklisted by the dnssed node or by other nodes for some reason. You can try two solutions: first, try to restart your computer, to make sure the daemon is not stuck at the background. Then, if your wallet is still not connecting, make sure to shutdown the wallet cleanly and wait 30 minutes, then try to start it again.  If nothing ever helps and your sync is stuck at some block, try to remove everything from VoteCoin directory, including 'chainstate' subdirectory and 'blocks' subdirectory and also files like peers.dat etc ... remove everything there and only keep votecoin.conf and wallet.dat (this is important). Then try to start the wallet again, it should fetch the entire blockchain.  Alternatively you can try to run votecoind.exe -reindex too  Hope this helps -Tom",False

Then have another list of other pools, I think having more pools is a simple way to gain awareness.  Another option is to have someone create a pool or work with a pool to donate 100% of hashing power for ""x"" amount of time or until a certain target is reached. Then ideas which are voted on can be funded this way. If everyone dedicates some hashing power to accomplish a goal and increase the value of the coins they are HODLing it can go a long way. You can make it fun by maybe adding a jackpot so someone can win say ""x"" amount of coins for donating their time like a lottery.  Also, getting onto other exchanges will increase the value of the coin too, which will give some more money for marketing too.  Also, maybe look for any chance for this dev team to work with another coins pod or dev team. Either they help with development of VoteCoin or we help with their coin.

In the past week, VoteCoin market cap reached $2 million USD. Price has raised to ~500 sat, peaking at 680 sat per coin, and then falling to ~350 sat as of now. It seems to be a great opportunity to buy now, before the price raises again. It may of course fall down too, so please do not take this as an investment advise ;-)  We have submitted VoteCoin to almost all reasonable exchanges and we keep submitting to new exchanges on weekly basis, but as of now the only exchange which accepted VoteCoin for trading is tradesatoshi.com  Maybe you noticed that tradesatoshi.com had some technical problems in the last 4 days, and it was hard or impossible to buy or sell. As far as I can see, these problems are now fixed, lets hope it will be stable.  TradeSatoshi does not accept new user registration now, so if you desperately need to buy some VOT, you may try to ask some friend, or alternatively you may PM us here and we will help to arrange the trade for you using our account (only buy orders, and only for 20K VOT or more).  We continue our work on the GUI wallet, it should be in a beta stage during the last week of January 2018. I'll post here as soon as there are any news.  -Tom",False

The new low-memory prover reduces memory usage by 43% when generating a shielded transaction, from 3 GB to 1.7 GB.  An experimental feature in 1.0.13 is payment disclosure which can help services better manage their shielded payments. It is method of proving that a payment was sent to a shielded address. In the typical case, this means enabling a sender to present a proof that they transferred funds to a recipient's shielded address.  We also now fully support the z_shieldcoinbase RPC call to help miners sweep up and shield their coinbase rewards.

Listings on exchanges do not ensure whether the coin is alive or dead. Don't get us wrong, we would like VOT to be listed on as many exchanges as possible. We did our best to get VOT listed at several exchanges (small and big ones). But please understand that it is not our decision not to be listed, it relies solely on exchange decision which coin they list! Show us other coins that started from scratch, are 1 month old and already have listings on major exchanges.  For example look what happened to Bitcoinz. After listing on C-cex price went down from 150 sat to 11 sat. This shows, that listing on multiple exchanges will not help coin to grow. What will help to grow value of the coin is finished product which users will use. Once we have finished product, people will start using it, creating demand for VOT and this is the time when exchanges will start listing VOT. To be honest, without working product we seriously doubt any major exchange would list VOT.  And we are working hard to have our product (wallet with voting feature) finished as soon as possible.",False

We spent some time trying to get VOT to exchanges, some time recruiting more work force and now we have finally jumped on development. We collected only fraction of the necessary funds during ICO and we did NOT reach our milestone for GUI Wallet. But we want to continue on this project, since we are convinced that the idea of using VoteCoin for public voting, crowd funding and opinion surveys has big potential. Unfortunately due to lack in financing, things may go little bit slower.  We agree with your suggestions that our top priority should be VoteCoin GUI Wallet now.  There are several possible ways to go:  1) The Quick way - we can fork or extend some existing software, such as https://github.com/zencashio/eleos and release it as VOT Wallet. We're not willing to go this way, since such wallet brings no new features to VoteCoin. We prefer to focus on developing our own software. But if there is a community member who wants to try this, we will surely support that effort by providing links from our website to such fork.  2) The Satisfactory way - we can develop a solution to provide some sort of GUI on top of the text-mode wallet. Technically, you would still need to run the text-mode wallet as you do it now, and at the same time you would be able to access the most common features through your web browser, which would communicate with the textmode wallet. This way we could create appealing GUI wallet in a reasonable time, but this would be a bit uncomfortable and unprofessional. On the other hand, the code implemented for this solution could be mostly reused for our final GUI wallet too, so we may be able to do this within the next few weeks.  3) The Best way - we prefer to continue developing VoteCoin GUI wallet with all the features we want (especially the voting) in Electron, or similar multi-platform framework. Our dev team estimates that this will take few months to be completed and properly tested. We hope to provide such wallet in first quarter of 2018.",False

We're doing our best to get listed VOT on as many exchanges as possible. We've submitted VOT to several exchanges, the bigger ones and smaller ones as well: Yobit.net - we've submitted on Oct 21. VOT is still not listed there. We contacted support and sill waiting for their answer. That's all we can do for now. HitBTC - as much as we'd like to have listed VOT there, their 15 BTC fee for 6 months listing seems ridiculously high to us. We're not going to pay such high fee. Anyway, we've submitted VOT there using their form hoping they will like VOT and list it for free. We are still waiting for their answer. Cryptopia - their current listing fee is 5.000.000 DOT - that equals to approx. 6 BTC now. It is too high for us. We'd rather pour that money into VOT development. We did our research and found out that cryptopia listed coins for as low as 400.000 DOT in the past. They simply have too many coin listing requests now, so they inflated their listing price. We monitor cryptopia and as soon as they lower their listing fee to reasonable level we will submit VOT immediately. NovaExchange - we've emailed them our submission, but before we heard back from them, they announced that they are closing their exchange. Tradesatoshi - dropping price really does not stress us that much. Only weak hands are selling at these low levels. At the time of writing this post there were 14.946.125 VOT in circulation. Only 230.000 VOT is offered for sale on TS below the ICO price. That is less that 2% of available coins. If the price on TS was such big concern for us, we would simply deposit 0.5 BTC to TS and drive the price up to 0.00000570 BTC easily. We do not have the need to manipulate the price.  We've strengthened our development team and after some research, the team agreed on using Electron (https://electron.atom.io/) for developing of our GUI wallet. Electron can be used to code multiplatform applications, so we should be able to release GUI wallet for all operating systems at once. Initial work has already started.  No one commits on github in the last month simply because VOT has finished and fully working code. We've implemented a few minor fixes or added parameters in the VOT core client recently.

There is no point in developing in a silo whilst the world falls around you. Myself, i don't need lots of exchange listings - i was happy to hold and contribute, but your lack of communication is a serious problem. The lack of any progress on Yobit just felt like one more promise you disappointed on. Any small community contribution was just sniffed at whilst at the same time your concrete contributions have been zero. And before you point at the initial fork on github and whitepaper i think 29 BTC is barely nothing ...  The community get their reward from mining, yes; and that is ok if you just expect a dump; that is precisely what you will get. A miner makes a commitment in power and equipment for which they get rewarded. But you expect more; you expect the mining community to rise and carry the flag !! If you want to see that then get up and support and encourage ..  I myself contributed a quickly hacked up tool to fill a gap - your reply ""it looks ugly"" rather than ""hey, great effort - but keep a look out for our (imagineware) its just so cool""  When you constantly put down those in the same community you alienate the community.  And as far as the community contribution is concerned - you are supposed to be the seed of that - so go and seed. Don't ignore us.  I don't need exchanges - i need some incentive to develop towards a concept i had high hopes for ..",False

When you spend some VOT from your address B, like 5 VOT, it has to spend the entire amount which was received into B, for that reason it spends the entire 2500 VOT, while 5 goes to your destination and the remaining amount minus fee goes to a newly generated address in your walled, lets call it address C, which is called Change address.  When you check balance at the time when the transaction is unconfirmed, you will see 2500 missing because the coins are already sent away from your wallet, but the remainder (2495) is not received yet back because it is not yet confirmed. After the  transaction is confirmed, which takes 2.5 minutes on average, but can take 20 minutes or even longer on bad luck, then your balance will show that you are missing only 5 VOT and the rest is back.  This is normal behavior and it applies to bitcoin as well.  Regarding yobit exchange, we paid for the listing and we wait for them to list VoteCoin, however it is their sole decision if they list it or not (and in all cases, they keep the money).

Even investors are waiting several months to have their tokens distributed to them and on derivative markets Tezos futures already dropped about 75%. And investors can't do anything about it.  On the other hand, not so big VoteCoin promotion. VOT tokens are already being distributed to ICO participants. Hundreds of miners are already mining VOT - hash rate over 400 KSol/s . VoteCoin network is stable. Users can already send VOT transactions and can trade VOT on TradeSatoshi (yes, he added VOT by himself, we didn't even know such exchange existed). Yobit.net and coinexchange.io listing will hopefully follow soon.  I guess some Tezos investors now wish they invested in VOT instead of in Tezos",False

There are only 2 days left until the end of VoteCoin ICO.  During our ICO campaign, which lasts for two months, we have already raised more than 28 BTC out of our total goal of 200 BTC. That means we sold around 1.4 million of VOT coins out of the total premined 10 million, so there are lots of unsold VOT coins at the moment. This is actually good news for all investors, and still a great opportunity for you.  The ICO ends on 21st of October 2017 at 10:00 CET.  At that time, we will calculate all unsold VOT coins, and those will be distributed among all participating investors as a bonus. The split will be proportional - that means, if your investment represents certain percentage of the total raised sum, you will receive the same percentage of the unsold coins.  The bonus will be paid to all participating investors, including those who invest in the next two days. So if you decide to invest now, you will get huge bonus too!  The total bonus will depend on the amount of unsold VOT coins at the end of ICO, as you can see in the following table:   So for example, if total amount of raised investments is 30 BTC, all participants will get 566% VOT bonus! As you can see, even if the total raised amount is 100 BTC, you still get 100% bonus VOT tokens.   So take your chance, join VoteCoin ICO now and --> GET UP TO 600% BONUS NOW <--",False

The funds will be used to hire more developers, to make a GUI wallets and other stuff which we need. The more money we raise, the more developers we can hire, and the faster the development will be.  Quote 2) why dont you uncover your identities more? Developer is kinda tracable, but Mr. Josef Svoboda is really unknown person. Page of project contains some kid-style painted portraits that only looks suspicious. Also vague words of ""owner of various internet businesses"" is disaster. What should I imagine behind this? Like some scamy sites, if you are not ready to tell us?  The identity of project leader is clear. Tomas Matejicek is a public persona. Regarding other team members, they prefer to remain non-public. Imagine you are running an internet business of some sort which is completely legal, but may be considered NSFW (not safe for work). As an example consider porn industry, gambling industry, ... Just examples. It may be wiser not to connect this kind of business with VoteCoin project. ...  Quote 3) Why dont you have proper address? You use postal box, it also looks like you are more trying to hide behind something than being transparent Well, we decided to use postal box instead of accepting mail to any personal address. I'm not sure why this should be a problem, but I realize you may not like it.  Quote 4) Will I recieve any invoice if I invest into your ICO? Lets say I would like to send money from my company and I need some invoice for my accountant? If you need invoice, we can arrange that upon request.  Quote 5) What exactly makes your coin way more unique from Zcash? So far it only looks like fork of Zcash to me without any unique features. The differences are mentioned at votecoin website, that is: No founders reward, No slow start period, and Multiplatform nice GUI wallet (to be developed). We have also plans on integrating faster proving scheme for shielded transactions, but this will be implemented in zcash too. Other than that, there are no significant differencies between VoteCoin and ZCash and we never claimed or promissed any ""way more unique"" features.  Quote Hope you will answer my questions. If not, you area scam for me, because sorry.. ICOs today are 90% scams and leaders must be transparent and able to answer all questions. We realize that some ICOs are selling coins which will never exist at all. But VoteCoin CANNOT be scam, regardless of dev team or anything else, because it is ALREADY a WORKING COIN, you can mine it, you can send and receive VOT coins, and if you purchase VOT in the ICO, you will receive VOT of the promissed value, nobody ever complained here or anywhere else about that.

Definitely not change for team of 2 people. I really would like your plan to be like - if we raise this, we get 2 more devs.. but you are only promising releasing of windows wallet etc.  2) why dont you uncover your identities more? Developer is kinda tracable, but Mr. Josef Svoboda is really unknown person. Page of project contains some kid-style painted portraits that only looks suspicious. Also vague words of ""owner of various internet businesses"" is disaster. What should I imagine behind this? Like some scamy sites, if you are not ready to tell us?  3) Why dont you have proper address? You use postal box, it also looks like you are more trying to hide behind something than being transparent  4) Will I recieve any invoice if I invest into your ICO? Lets say I would like to send money from my company and I need some invoice for my accountant?  5) What exactly makes your coin way more unique from Zcash? So far it only looks like fork of Zcash to me without any unique features.  Hope you will answer my questions. If not, you area scam for me, because sorry.. ICOs today are 90% scams and leaders must be transparent and able to answer all questions.",False

Because if it's the second one that's just dumb, there's a chance that polo doesn't even list VOT because they hardly list coins in comparison to Bittrex.  The reason I'm asking is because there's two different posts on two different forums by the same person that says two different things. On a forum (I google translated from Russian to English) it said:   ""Votecoin underwent full verification on Polonix and agreed on an exclusive listing on this exchange.""

Good news is that VoteCoin starts to gain momentum and more and more people (miners, investors, promoters) getting involved in the project. Seeing all these people taking interest in VOT opens good prospects for the future.  Here is summary of our accomplishments so far:  We have successfully released fully functional VoteCoin core client: https://github.com/Tomas-M/VoteCoin Now anyone can send and receive VoteCoins (VOT) We have successfully implemented Insight as a blockchain explorer web application service for VoteCoin: http://explorer.votecoin.site/ Now anyone can browse through all VOT transactions, see mined blocks and see with their own eyes that VoteCoin network is stable and everything runs smoothly. Anyone can check Genesis block -  where we mined 10.000.000 VOT for the ICO. All 10 million coins are now sitting at this address and we are ready to start distributing them to all investors. We have successfully opened official VOT mining pool with 0% fee: http://pool.votecoin.site/ Now anyone with some technical knowledge and decent hardware can mine VOT on his own. We are pleased to see that more and more miners are joining and mining VOT, which helps to secure VoteCoin network. We have released Official VoteCoin wallet for Windows (850MB): https://github.com/Tomas-M/VoteCoin/releases/download/v1.0.11-win32/VoteCoin.standalone.Win32.zip You asked for it and we delivered! Starting now everyone using Windows can setup VOT wallet and start receiving or sending VoteCoins. It is not GUI wallet yet, it is only a text-mode server and client. The big size is due to the proving key which is included in the release, to make it simple for users to download and use.  There is still a lot of work ahead of us, to name a few:  Our main goal is still the development of GUI wallet for Windows, Linux and MAC OS X. It is a hell of work, but we know it will be well worth it. The initial release should also include functionality for voting, crowd funding and much more. We watch closely the latest developments in elliptic-curve cryptography and we are eager to implement new proving scheme algorighms to VoteCoin, for example the elliptic curve called Jubjub (to be included in ZCash too) which is efficient to perform operations on inside of zk-SNARK circuits. Rough estimate indicates 80% reduction of proving time, and a 98% reduction in memory usage, which is simply awesome. We have started the enhanced account verification process on major exchanges Poloniex and Bittrex. This step is required to get VOT listed on these exchanges and as many of you know, this process can take long time.  We'd like to thank to all our supporters! For all those who already bought some VOT in the ICO or who simply like the VoteCoin idea, please spread a word about us and recommend us to other investors. And for all those who haven't invested yet, it is now right time to do so. Seeing all our prospects we think we're selling cheap now. Keep in mind that the ICO ends in less than a month. Have a nice day everybody!",False

We are big fans of decentralisation and equihash is memory-oriented Proof-of-Work algorithm (your mining power is mostly determined by size of your RAM). So Equihash is resistant to ASIC mining.  We have ZCash. Why should we choose VoteCoin? Yes, VoteCoin source code is based on the peer-reviewed ZCash sources and follows the same trusted setup provided by the Zcash team. Offers a high standard of privacy and preserves the confidentiality of transactions through sophisticated zero-knowledge proving scheme.  Furthermore, VoteCoin provides three main advantages:  No Founders Reward: Zcash implements Founders Reward, where 20% of coins are transferred to the Zcash developers and investors during the first years. We have removed this “feature”, so VoteCoin has no founders reward. No Slow start period: Zcash implements Slow start period, where mining produces fractional reward to miners on start, and the reward slowly increases afterwards. We have removed this from VoteCoin, so miners get their full reward from the very beginning. Multi-platform wallet: Zcash is officially supported only as a Linux text-mode client.  We provide an easy to use Graphical Wallet Application for all major operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and MAC OS.      There is still a lot of work ahead of us. We watch closely the latest developments in elliptic-curve cryptography and we are eager to implement new proving scheme algorighms to VoteCoin, for example the elliptic curve called Jubjub (to be included in ZCash too) which is efficient to perform operations on inside of zk-SNARK circuits. Rough estimate indicates 80% reduction of proving time, and a 98% reduction in memory usage, which is simply awesome.   --> CHECK VOTECOIN WEBSITE <--",False
