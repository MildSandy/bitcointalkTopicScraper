In fact, often it appears to be the opposite. Students or sometimes their parents have to invest in the education with the hope that those investments will be paid off in the long term. But who will provide an absolute guarantee that after graduating from the university the student will get the desired place of employment?  As a rule, many students are simply not motivated, so they drop out. All educational institutions have funds, and a framework, for financial assistance.

People chose profession once in their life and did not change it until retirement. Usually education meant studying at a university; self-taught people were rare. However, in the post-industrial society changes in the shape, sense and affordability of education finally began.  According to Alvin Toffler, a well-known US sociologist, the emergence of the post-industrial society is a consequence of the intellectual revolution. The possession of knowledge and information will replace financial capital as the biggest value. Development of innovations, empowered by the most educated, will become the most important sector of economy. It means that high-quality affordable education will become even more important than now.  The last time when the global education experienced a serious transformation was at the very beginning of the 21st century when the wide access to the Internet resulted in the emergence of the first massive open online courses (MOOC). Distance learning is very important because of demand for new formats based on availability and low cost of online resources. The age of progress and innovation gives birth to ever new professions, creating demand for good education that never stops. To enable people to study continuously, education has to be cheap and easily available. The growth of the world population and the resulting increase in the number of those who wish to get a good education should also be taken into account.

For me it seems you want to take the money but you have no product developed, what does it prevent you from changing conditions or technology one more time when you like without asking nobody? What if next month you decide your developers don't know how to code in NEM and you change to WAVES or NEO?  Another question, you announce that the money comes from firms asking for profiles in your site (kind of headhunting business), have you numbers or proofs about that? (You are always presuming about your more than 1M students, but never say anything about the firms interested in those profiles or how much money are they paying for that information), in the paper there is ZERO information about this, how can we trust the project when the success of it depends on information that you are hiding to the investors?  Also it is not clear for me when you say that students from other countries are also contributing tokens and cryptos to the system when they pay for their courses... So... is this money bridged from tutellus.com, or from tutellus.io platform? Must the students pay for their courses in tutellus.io? How does the fees system works? How much percentage is tutellus.com winning with this? If tutellus.com is obtaining benefit, how could the platform be decentralized?  It seems people is interested in investing only for speculative purposes, but all these things about the real project value are really disturbing, I think you should explain and clear those concerns publicly.  These concerns make Tutellus quiet questionable for me, the fact that you didn't answer me in a whole month, does not help at all...  If you keep ignoring me I will publish all these information and questions in major social networks until getting your attention and explanations.  Thanks.",False

Working without interruption since 2013, currently the company has over 130,000 video courses, one million students in 160 countries, and agreements with over 80 Universities and Business Schools. Our main product is the video course. A user or school of any kind can create a video course on any topic and, after a quality check, publish it in Tutellus, with the users getting access to it by paying a price established by the teacher.   Tutellus launches an ICO with the aim of growing through a tokenized business model integrating its platform in the NEM Blockchain.  Problems that aims to solve: 1) Poverty and lack of job opportunities. 2) Low student motivation. 3) Low teacher rewarding. 4) Weak link with the job market      How do Tutellus solves that problems with blockchain?  Decentralization We want to empower the Community and let them to lead main decisions. We believe the stronger the Community are and the more valuable the token become, the better for the company. As a colaborative, peer-to-peer platform, Tutellus firmly believes in decentralization. A community where users have direct communication with each other is stronger than a community that relies on middlemen.  Payments Blockchain technology can monetize the interactions inside the community, allowing the users to reward each other, with users seeing a direct benefit for actions that add value to the platform. This is done through the use of tokens, that flow inside the community and keep it alive.    Add value for everybody Imagine a platform that pays its students for learning. The logic is simple: the better the training the student gets, the higher the value of the student for both the community and third-parties.  Imagine a platform in which teachers are rewarded for the excellence of their students: the more relevance the students get, the more money their teachers will receive.  Imagine a platform where companies may find the perfect fit for a position or contract. Both cheaper risk-minimizing, the candidates can use the platform to prove their value in any specific skill.    This is the vision of Tutellus: a novel educational model that creates a new system of incentives by which all users get rewarded directly according to the value they provide to the community. This model is possible today using blockchain, and particularly NEM technology.    **Important info about Tutellus ICO**  Tokens & Utility 2 tokens: TUT & STUT  What do you do with TUT Token The TUT token is an tradable token that can be used to buy products or services in the platform. 1) Buy products (such as courses) in the platform. 2) Buy services, such as promotion and marketing for teachers, access to the students‚Äô profiles, and other third-party services. 3) Influence in governance decisions associated to user Relevance. 4) Transfer money to other people, inside or outside the platform. 5) Trade it for other cryptocurrencies.  What is STUT Token The STUT token measures the Relevance of the user inside the platform, and is not tradable.
