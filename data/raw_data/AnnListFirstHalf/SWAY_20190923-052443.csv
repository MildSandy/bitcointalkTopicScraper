Attention!!!   This Coin isn't a coin from the Skyway Company! It is a scammer coin and from a counterfeiter!  I'm a partner and investor of the very interesting Project named „Skyway“. I saw this coin offering and the website related to it and thought immediatelly there must be something wrong. So I contacted the real Skyway Company and asked them about this ICO, the SWAY Coin and the website skywayico.com. The answer was that this is a scammer!  The Skyway Company and the Project are both real and very promising (as many of you could see in the video) but they don't have any cryptocoin! They sell shares in a crowdfunding campain. The video is from the real Skyway Company (but copied and published under the name „Skyway ICO“ which belongs to the deceiver).  Nevertheless you can invest into the very interesting Skyway project. I think it has a very big future and everyone who invests now, will have big big rewards in similar scale as it is usual in the cryptoworld. If somebody wants to know more about that or wants to invest some money you can do it here:  Register free!!!  You have to register for free and than you can make a deposit and get shares of the company with a good discont at the moment. In the SkywayOffice you can also have a look at their businessplan and other interesting stuff.  They have already reached many goals of their development plan. So I think this is a good sign. At the moment they are realising the EcoTechnopark which is needed for the certification and they are already testing some of their transport systems at the park!  Here is a link to the real Skyway Capital website were you can get more information (it's a link with my ref code, so will get me as contact person if you register).  But please don't be deceived by this SWAY coin! This coin has nothing to do with the real company (which seems to be very good and promising)! If you like this project invest the right way … don't throw your money away!",False

The video, all the links to the articles and many of the information given in the Scammer ICO here on bitcointalk have been copied from this really good and real Project. This fact you can easily verify by yourself (""Skyway ICO"" was announced here at July 08, 2017 with many copied material and links to reports describing the real Project Skyway. In contrast to this there is the Company Skyway Capital (or correct name is called FIRST SKYWAY INVEST GROUP LIMITED) which was incorporated in the year 2014 with Mr Evgenii Kudriashov as director under the Company number 09320759). If you don't believe me that Skyway has nothing to do with this ICO and even not anyhing to do with cryptocurrency than you are free to ask their support about that, if you want  ... sure the development of the right project is worth to watching ... it's very promising in my opinion ... but if you want to invest please do it really into the original project and not into a scammer where you don't get what you want and what was promised to you ...  For all who are interested to invest, you can do it here after your registration (you will also find many documents (e.g. the business plan) and further information in your account under the button ""Investors"" and than ""Documents"").

I had my suspicions given the team members.  Thanks   You're welcome  ... yes that's the right company where you can invest into the Skyway Project. They have nothing to do with this Skyway ICO which was announced here in this Threat. But many informations given in the announcement are correct, but stolen or copied from the real Project.

You can check it under ""News"" here at the real Skyway Capital website. There you can also register and make investments if you want.  The real company has nothing to do with this scammer coin.
