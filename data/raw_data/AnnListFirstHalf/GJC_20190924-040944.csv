Operating profit * 13.75. Of course, it's a very simple method for a quick guessing. If you're calculation with a yearly profit of only 40 million * 13.75, you'l receive a valuation of $ 550 millions. In the best case, we're sold out during the first days with a ratio of 420GJC per ETH. That means we will distribute 20% of our earnings to XY holders of 166,666 ETH (50 millions). With another 10% we will rebuy token on a exchange (at any price) and lock these token in a escrow for 365 days. The $35K min investment is for serving bigger investors or pools for preventing a frontrunning on the main ICO. You can check the contract on our Github.",False
