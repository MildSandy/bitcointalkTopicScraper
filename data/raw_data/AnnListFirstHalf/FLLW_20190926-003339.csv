Follow Coin is a new platform that wants to make the crypto world accessible to everyone. Our goal is to lower the barriers of crypto investment markets by providing tools and services that make interacting, handling and trading crypto coins easy.  If you are new to the world of cryptocurrency it is often difficult to know when to buy which coin. Now Follow Coin is here to help you out. As a beginning trader it is a real challenge to maintain an overview of the market. The learning curve for investing in crypto assets is extremely steep. That?s why Follow Coin connects (inexperienced) users with influencers that know everything about the cryptocurrency world.  With our platform, you can easily copy experienced traders' (called 'influencers') trades, while influencers can monetize their trading knowledge and skills. Every time a trade is profitable, the influencer gets rewarded by the novice users who copied his trades. This reward is a small portion of the profit made by the copier from the trade and is paid in FLLW tokens. This way, our ecosystem creates a win-win situation for both parties.  Why Follow Coin?  - Benefits: Follow Coin's platform will be for the user. They gain exclusive insight in how crypto traders with years of experience trade. This way they won't get left out, and will be able to react on time. Crypto traders can monetize their knowledge through our platform.  -Transparent: Every trade that an influencer makes, will be recorded on the blockchain. Entry and exit points are therefore unchangeable and accurate due the nature of the blockchain technology. With the data, influencers will have a scorecard based on their trading skills.   -Company background: The team of Follow Coin has over 10 years of experience in building platforms. We?re analytics-driven optimizing experts and we are located in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Currently, there are 125.000 people using our tailormade software on a daily basis.
