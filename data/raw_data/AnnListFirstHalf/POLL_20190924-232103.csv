So I thought it would be beneficial to try and ‚Äúzoom out‚Äù for a while and remind you all why we ClearPoll needs to exist.  I have read some comments recently suggesting that some people don‚Äôt yet understand the whole purpose or benefit of ClearPoll. Someone said today that it doesn‚Äôt need a blockchain. Someone else questioned how it‚Äôs better than other social media polls. So let me remind you all of what our vision actually is.  ClearPoll will give everyone an equal voice. It is a space where all are welcome. No favouritism, no censorship, no moderation. A truly fair, transparent and widely accessible way to vote on any topic, at any time, and have that vote secured with blockchain technology where it cannot be manipulated. As you know we are in the process of approaching stars and influencers to use our platform. We should make it very clear, we do not endorse any particular personalities on our platform. ClearPoll is for everyone. Some polls may even be offensive or confronting to some people. ClearPoll only works if everyone is equally represented. We will not pick and choose our users or stars . We have an ‚Äúall welcome‚Äù policy. If we were selective, we would be no better than other platforms who heavily moderate ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù.  https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*-rN7ZdMibrUuFxUzrdhOcw.jpeg  Our long term vision for ClearPoll is to be the go-to place to share public opinion. After launch we will continue to develop the platform and create a place to not only vote, but to discuss topics and polls and really try and tap into what people want, and why they want it. Some people think that if the option they voted for was not in the majority, that other voters are ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. Nobody is wrong, they are all entitled to their opinion and there are always reasons why they voted the way they did. This is why we do not hide any historical polls. An unexpected or unfavourable result for one person, may not be for another. If we give full access to all polls ever completed, it is fair for all users.  Now a little about our blockchain. There seems to be some confusion about ClearPoll tokens, as they are an ERC20 token. The tokens are separate to our blockchain. They are integrated into the platform in the form of rewards and also purchasing corporate services, but they are not used in the blockchain itself. Our blockchain is a fully custom built solution specifically designed for our needs. We don‚Äôt often speak about our blockchain on a technical level because we aren‚Äôt here to compete with other chains‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit was designed specifically to power ClearPoll and it works perfectly.  Lead blockchain developer Adrian Daluz says:  It‚Äôs an Ethereum-like blockchain using a trust based proof of stake model for consensus without using POLL tokens for staking. It‚Äôs highly scalable, asynchronous and has an open ledger with full access nodes. Another question we‚Äôve had recently is in regards to privacy and data handling (specifically the new GDPR requirements). ClearPoll includes an option to ‚Äúbe forgotten‚Äù by allowing a user to delete their profile permanently. How is this possible? Profiles (usernames, age, gender etc) are not stored on the blockchain. Votes are stored on the chain, not profiles. When a user deletes their profile, their votes remain as a +1 on that particular poll, with no profile attached. On top of that, we never ask for identifiable data such as name, date of birth, address or email address and we will never make any personal data available to anyone, at any time. Our ClearPoll Plus advanced poll results are statistical, cumulative data. Nobody can see specifically which profile voted and nobody can access a user‚Äôs profile to view their voting history. The only time your vote will ever be visible, is if you choose to share your vote with your friends. Entirely optional. In summary, your profile data is not accessible to anyone unless you choose to share your activity, and you can delete your profile entirely at any time.  Anyone can vote on anything, any time. Nobody can tamper with the votes or results. All historical polls are viewable. No profiles are stored on the blockchain, only votes. All are welcome. I hope this clears up some recent questions and concerns. We are always available in Telegram should you have any more questions.  Thanks again for the support. Very exciting times ahead!

It‚Äôs time to release an update on the progress of our blockchain development.  The following is an update from our lead blockchain developer, Adrian Daluz:  ‚ÄúWe spent some time working on our transaction and mining algorithms to increase speed without lowering difficulty or security. We‚Äôve managed to run a single node at 7,000 transactions a second across the globe, which is a 3x speed increase from the base speeds we were seeing originally. To do this, we added asynchronous transactions and consensus so that no large amount of traffic stops the chain in its tracks, something standard blockchains struggle with on a daily basis. This means we can serve more votes faster and give us a larger scalability.‚Äù  So in summary, our blockchain is amazing, and is perfect for our needs.

The problem ClearPoll solves is manipulation and censorship of real, genuine public opinion data. Currently, the media and corporations are able to fabricate poll results to suit their agenda. ClearPoll completely opens up the public opinion process, offering full transparency. Every single poll ever created is viewable and searchable. Users can vote on anything, any time, and create their own polls.  The ClearPoll Token (POLL) Users earn POLL tokens as rewards for votes their polls receive, or for voting on sponsored polls. 50% of ClearPoll revenue is given back to the users, according to their monthly app usage performance. Users earn reward multipliers by holding POLL tokens! POLL was around 10-12c at ICO, which reached hard cap in October. It is now trading on Kucoin and Cryptopia (as well as some other DEX options). ATH has been just over $11 (x100) in January 2018.  The Team ClearPoll is a Perth, Australia based team comprising of experienced developers, designers and marketing specialists.  The App ClearPoll is more than just a voting app. It contains so many great features, that you will have to read about them here: https://medium.com/@info_87835/clearpoll-features-an-in-depth-look-631a029ff4bc Some key features include valuable market research tools, and ""Star Polls"" - a section where stars, celebrities and influencers can poll their followers, giving great exposure to ClearPoll.

Firstly we will be launching an advanced metrics subscription called ClearPoll Plus. This platform will give individuals or corporations access to all kinds of awesome analytics data on poll results, such as age, gender, location, votes by timeframe etc. This will be a valuable service for journalists, marketing companies etc. This service will be subscription based and paid for only with POLL tokens, creating a demand for the token as well as earning revenue for the company. The data will not be personal data, it will be cumulative data (just like Google Analytics etc).  We will also be offering advertising space, which, as we know from our other apps, can be a very healthy revenue stream with a popular app.  As well as that, we have merchandise sales. Poll-specific merchandise, allowing people to wear their poll results to prove their point that the people have spoken on a particular issue.  Then we have ClearPoll Widgets, which would be free but have an advanced option to customise appearance plus have embed more detailed public data into articles or websites.  Like all social platforms, we rely on a positive user experience. We believe ClearPoll will be the go-to place for people to have their say on important issues. Something that has been difficult to do in an unfiltered way on other platforms.

NEO was around $18 when we first started to accept it for token sale contributions.  It is now around $31. Which is awesome.  We didn't expect this to happen during our ICO so we set a fixed rate. But it did happen, so now we can see we aren't offering a fair ratio.  We have just changed it to 1 NEO = 275 POLL. Previously it was 170.  We are always trying to be as fair as possible and look after our contributors because without you, we won't be able to produce ClearPoll to its full potential.  All previous contributors will receive the 275 rate, and thanks again for your contributions!  If NEO price falls again, we may adjust the rate back down but not for anyone who has already contributed. Same goes if NEO continues to climb.  Thanks!",False

We've been updating our other social media pages, Website news section and Telegram page every day.  We've got some news! A working basic prototype video, showing multiple mobile accounts voting, blockchain interaction and live poll result updates. This is the core of how ClearPoll works, and it is working perfectly.  https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Fd2WGRyNxk  We have also decided against using Hyperledger, and are creating our own blockchain instead, based on Ethereum.  Token sale is still on, and we have increased the POLL/ETH ratio due to the price of ETH increasing lately. You can now get 2,500 POLL per ETH. That's under 12c per token, for a circulation of likely under 3M.",False

I really like the idea of a Poll using blockchain, and moreover I would like that it was possible to bring this to a higher level for be used in official elections. But my 2 concerns are the following:   - How you will prevent people to vote more than 1 time? As I read you have to be registered as a User to vote with the App. But how to be sure this person is not using different users in the same App or in different Apps?. If you cant ensure people will be able to vote just once in each poll, I don't think governments, markets or journalist will find the App enough accurate to invest on it. Means ClearPoll will not succeed.   - In the team I didn't saw any specialist or with bit of knowledge related with the main aim of the project: to offer transparent and accurate poll results. Without a person like that in the team or some proved external support information, is hard that entities will trust on the ClearPoll results so, again, they will not find the App enough accurate to invest on it.   I hope there is a positive answer about this 2 concerns. And if not, I truly encourage ClearPoll to work in this 2 points to became totally reliable and useful to their main propose.",False
