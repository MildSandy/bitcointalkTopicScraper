ACE and TEAM tokens are the utility tokens which offer unmatched opportunities, like hours of training with players, meetings, tickets, advertising with celebrities for platform users, etc. These services are bought for tokens. The more often a token is used, the better it is for all participants.  Agency commissions will be paid in tokens. As TokenStars develops, the number of sponsorship contracts signed by the players will grow. As a result, the agency commissions will grow. Commission will be converted into tokens, by buying tokens on the market.  So the more revenue the project has, the more tokens will be bought. This should positively impact the internal economy.

Let me explain you the economy of our tokens.  ACE and TEAM are the utility tokens which offer unmatched opportunities, like hours of training with players, meetings, tickets, advertising with celebrities for platform users, etc. These services are bought for tokens. The more often a token is used, the better it is for all participants.  Agency commissions will be paid in tokens. As TokenStars develops, the number of sponsorship contracts signed by the players will grow. As a result, the agency commissions will grow. Commission will be converted into tokens, by buying tokens on the market.  So the more revenue the project has, the more tokens will be bought. This should positively impact the internal economy.

Our platform will interact with tens of thousands of people (with millions in the future). We aspire to introduce more than 4 billion sports fans to the blockchain world. For the reference, - Top-20 football players have 1.4 billion followers across most popular social media platforms. - The estimated number of FC Manchester United followers is 659 million of people8. This possibly is the largest fan base for a football club in the world.  Furthermore, we plan to work with the celebrities not only in sports, but also in entertainment (movies, music) and expect to have a huge user base.  Every event such as recording of a vote in the poll, collecting report from the promoter, receiving auction bids or registering advertising click will generate blockchain writing down operations. Our in-house advertising will be using blockchain to record all important events for further analysis. Daily number of these events can reach millions.  Using Ethereum blockchain for recording of such big number of events would be impractical mainly because of slow transaction speed and transaction-related expenses.",False

Network node operators will be able to audit blockchain operations to judge possible conflicts.

IMG is practically a monopoly in tennis. They can dictate terms (from the tournaments a player participates in to the organization of his or her training schedule). They turn down players from smaller countries (as the domestic market is small and there are few opportunities for advertising). And, they make mistakes in their selection process.  Roger Federer left IMG and started his own agency, Team818. He has signed several top-10 players, including Bulgarian star Grigor Dimitrov and Argentine star Juan Martin Del Potro.  Andy Murray left Lagardere and set up a management agency ‚Äú77‚Äù (name of which is inspired by the 77-year wait for a British men‚Äôs singles champion at Wimbledon, that Andy brought to an end in 2013).  As a reason for creating his own agency Murray stated that ‚Äúit will allow him more freedom in decision-making and the chance to become more involved in his business affairs‚Äù.  One of the most remarkable conflicts between an agency and a player was Ivan Lendl‚Äôs case, the winner of seven Grand Slam tournaments and undisputable No.1 in the ATP ranking. Ivan was dissatisfied with the work of agency, cause at the top of his career he experienced lack of attention from his agents. Later Lendl accused Proserv of exploiting his image for ‚Äòpackaging‚Äô with other players at less favorable terms.  Later Lendl left Proserv and started his own agency20.  ACE will collaborate with established pro players: ~20% of both top 300 in rankings (ATP and WTA) are overlooked by traditional agencies, so we can offer them our Network‚Äôs advertising capacities and expertise. Even elite players are open to changing agents and ACE will consider this possibility after initial launch.",False

Can you elaborate why do you think there was a failure?  Let me provide you with some arguments why ACE was a success that we are improving:  ACE project (and business vertical) managed to show good traction:  1. Signed first tennis players for advertising representation: - Veronika Kudermetova, 20 years old, the winner of 19 WTA & ITF tournaments, currently No. 66 in WTA doubles. - Ekaterina Makarova, current No. 3 in WTA doubles, Olympic Champion (2016), winner at Wimbledon. - Worked with 4 current top-100 players on the non-exclusive conditions for advertising deals.  2. Built a strong international advisory board to search for players in different geographies, to advise on local training academies and to promote TokenStars for attracting prospective talents and broader audience. - Tommy Haas, No. 2 in ATP ranking. Silver Olympics medalist (Sydney, 2000). - Anastasia Myskina, No. 2 in WTA ranking. Roland Garros champion. - Robin S√∂derling, a Swedish tennis star, No. 4 in ATP. - Cedric Pioline, No. 5 in ATP ranking. Winner of 2 Davis Cups as a player and one as a captain (2017). - Maya Kurilova, former Director of Operations at Octagon Russia (Top-3 global Talent Management Agency).  3. Built a steady international pipeline of applications from young tennis talents. Found the first potential professional tennis scouts for the platform.  4. Signed the first marketing deal for Ekaterina Makarova (with Natura Siberica cosmetics brand, $50M revenue) and started collaboration with the top-3 digital agency JAMI (to leverage their brands‚Äô network and sales force).  5. Has shown a strong presence in the media and received multiple endorsements.  6. Launched the platform development. The 1 of the 12 modules is expected to be launched in Q4 2017, as planned.  More information on ACE achievements is available in our blog posts: - On the 15 achievements (Aug, 25) ‚Äì https://medium.com/@TokenStars/15-good-newsfrom-tokenstars-c1cbe7832864 - On the results of the token sale (Oct, 30) ‚Äì https://medium.com/@TokenStars/httpsmedium-com-tokenstars-join-the-team-10-news-from-tokenstars-98464eb711ed",False

We understand that in order to encourage collaboration between huge number of participants TokenStars shall develop scalable digital solutions and competitive incentives for all parties.  Therefore, we build the modular blockchain platform that will allow participants to combine its blocks and achieve the desired results. Eventually it will change the way how celebrities connect with their fans and advertisers, making it more efficient and valuable.  We introduce TEAM token to empower the interaction between parties. TEAM tokens (ERC-20 standard) will serve as a form of access to the TokenStars platform and as an internal currency, required for the majority of operations and transactions within our ecosystem.  Have you seen our Brands and Advertising Layer of the TokenStars platform?  3 modules, providing smart solutions & transparent data to brands for running more efficient advertising campaigns with highly engaged audience.

On the one hand, it's clear that Next-Level's unwillingness to pass KYC is nothing but an attempt to make more money, as ETH and BTC have by now about quadrupled in price. On the other hand, TokenStars representatives here did claim that they would refund anyone who doesn't want to pass KYC. I guess what they didn't anticipate, however, I take it mostly because of their utter commitment to the project and belief in its future success is how many people would want to get out of the project now if given the opportunity. Because let's face it, most of the participants went in in the hopes of future gains above all else.  TokenStars have been very honest right from the get-go, never ducking or dodging a comment and always responding in a timely fashion, and I would hate to see someone taking advantage of that. Next-Level and the likes should be left to live with their prior decision to commit, and if they don't want to pass KYC it's their own deal, no refunds should follow. After all, they did sign the agreement and it was all there in black and white.  TokenStars should feel no guilt either for not being willing to refund because of that one comment that they made. They could've just said no refunds period, and would've been right to do so. Instead they decided to be too kind for their own good and make sure that those who failed to give the agreement a proper read wouldn't get screwed. And now people try to screw them for that.

Would it not make more sense to just hold a separate token sale for TEAM (as you already are). I feel all this does is creating uncertainty regarding the number of ACE tokens & token holders. 5b) What if everyone but me for example decide to convert their ACE to TEAM? I feel that might affect the ACE token value (understatement of the year). 5c) If you are confident in the future of the ACE token - why give the offer to convert to another token? Why not just let interested people join the TEAM token sale? That way no uncertainty regarding ACE is added. No downside. 6) If I convert ACE to TEAM, will my funds be taken from the ACE platform to the TEAM platform?  I also feel I would like more info about the TEAM token sale before I make my decision.

Thank you for your questions The most of the answers you could find in our Medium post (https://medium.com/@TokenStars/https-medium-com-tokenstars-join-the-team-10-news-from-tokenstars-98464eb711ed), but let us answer you here.  1) Yes, November 27th. 2) If you mean with 40% bonus - yes, November 27th. 3) You will stay with ACE tokens and won't get 40% bonus on conversion. 4) The TEAM whitepaper is not announced yet, please stay tuned for upcoming news. 5a) Long time ago we promised to provide ACE tokenholders with one-time 40% bonus for converting ACE into other verticals' tokens. So we keep the promises. 5b) As we can see from the activities, some people stay with ACE, some people convert ACE to TEAM, so you definitely won't be the only one Things are going well with ACE anyway. We receive more and more players‚Äô applications, we get better agency name recognition among the leading tennis players. The number one rule of the system administrator is not to touch something if it is working. Additionally, every token holder accepted the ACE token sale agreement and bought ACE token (a digital good, crypto access key). We can‚Äôt (and we won‚Äôt) replace one digital good with another one without community and ACE token holders‚Äô consent. Our promises matter. If a token holder wants to exchange ACE token into TEAM with 40% bonus, they are more than welcome to do so in the Dashboard before transferring ACE to ERC-20 wallets. 5c) See 5a. TEAM is just another token of TokenStars, it's not a competitor. As you can see in our White Paper, since the beginning we planned to launch new verticals (football, poker, cybersports, etc), so we are just following the initial plan. The only thing which we have changed is that we united all future verticals in one token TEAM. Why did we decide to do that, you can read in our Medium post: https://medium.com/@TokenStars/https-medium-com-tokenstars-join-the-team-10-news-from-tokenstars-98464eb711ed.

We‚Äôre finally here. ACE token sale is coming to the end and we‚Äôd like to make several announcements and answer all the burning questions. When will I get my tokens? What about the exchanges? Next verticals? How can I convert ACE tokens?  1. How can I get my ACE tokens?  We‚Äôll be issuing tokens in weekly batches to everyone who successfully passes the KYC procedure. Starting on November 7th‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäNovember 14th‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäNovember 21st‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand (if anyone‚Äôs left) November 28th.   2. What is KYC?  The ‚Äòknow your client‚Äô procedure takes only 5 minutes and it is required by the banks and exchanges. As our token sale agreement did not allow for US citizens and other restricted persons to participate in the sale, the KYC procedure allows to verify citizenship and make sure the token holders comply with those rules.  All the files are stored confidentially on Amazon servers. You need to upload your passport (or other government issued ID) and a 2nd document, verifying your current place of residence. There is a detailed description of the process in your personal dashboard.  Once the documents are uploaded, we verify them, confirm (or ask for additional clarification) and approve the token issue to the ERC-20 wallets, you‚Äôll specify in the dashboard. As simple as that.  3. ACE on exchanges  We‚Äôve started talking to several exchanges (two out of the top-10 exchanges by volume) and expect news in the next 3‚Äì4 weeks. Please stay patient. It is easy to get listed on some low-quality exchange with no liquidity and shady ruled, but we all don‚Äôt need this.  Subscribe to the Telegram group to be among the first to know.  4. Converting ACE token  As promised, ACE tokens might be converted in your Dashboard into other verticals‚Äô tokens with 40% one-time bonus. Conversion only works in 1 direction (ACE into TEAM only, not vice versa), and you can only convert all ACE tokens you have at once, between October 27th and November 27th. Conversion is only available BEFORE you transfer ACE tokens to your personal wallet.   5. Next verticals ‚Äî‚ÄäALL TOGETHER‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäTEAM token  Over the course of August, September and October, we‚Äôve personally met or had phone calls with several Olympic champions, world champions, coaches and agents. We‚Äôre incredibly grateful for all the advice we‚Äôve received. On multiple occasions we‚Äôve heard the question ‚ÄòWhy do you separate different kinds of sport into different verticals and use different tokens?‚Äô  Both approaches are viable and have their PROs and CONs.   We‚Äôve considered all arguments and decided to go with the 1 TEAM token.   6. Why is ACE not included into TEAM  Things are going well with the tennis vertical. We receive more and more players‚Äô applications, we get better agency name recognition among the leading tennis players. The number one rule of the system administrator is not to touch something if it is working.  Additionally, every token holder accepted the ACE token sale agreement and bought ACE token (a digital good, crypto access key). We can‚Äôt (and we won‚Äôt) replace one digital good with another one without community and ACE token holders‚Äô consent. Our promises matter.  If a token holder wants to exchange ACE token into TEAM with 40% bonus, they are more than welcome to do so in the Dashboard before transferring ACE to ERC-20 wallets.  7. How is ACE token sale going  There are still a couple days to go with the token sale, but we can announce the preliminary results.  As you remember, for security reasons every token buyer received an individual payment address (created by the CoinPayments POS processor). Token sale proceeds are currently consolidated into the cold storages with the following addresses:  https://blockchain.info/address/3F7gofQYuwundAqCHxiA5oPxT3iNUtR2Yx   https://blockchain.info/address/1AqxymppuXWGq2PV56MrrdAdG7K7LW66pd   https://etherchain.org/account/0x77021B55eF2606253f7F18475ef390b0c8C07797    In addition to that, we‚Äôve sold 90 BTC worth of ACE tokens via the ICOBox platform.  So, the final amount will equal funds collected in BTC + funds collected in ETH + funds sold via resellers‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäKYC (rejected transactions).  As of 11AM CET October, 30 the amount equals $4,928,107. The number will fluctuate, depending on the currency exchange rates.  8. What are your plans going forward with TEAM token  We are talking to dozens of football, poker, eSports and hockey players, managers and agents. The goal is to form an Advisory board of globally respected experts.  Our technology team is working on the web interfaces and smart contracts for the platform.  Our marketing team is in talks about local sports media partnerships (similar to Sports.ru model).  The closed pre-sale will start in about a week. The date of the token sale will be announced later in November.  9. What about the STAR token  We‚Äôre still keeping secret the details about the STAR token. We can only tell that it is designed for globally recognizable celebrities (movie stars, musicians whose name rings a bell from Tokyo to Paris) and that we‚Äôre in negotiations with a good number of such stars. Stay tuned!   10. Fun with flags  In the meantime, we are preparing some statistics about the token holders geographical distribution, average purchases and other interesting data.  Meet our big spenders‚Äî the highest average purchases were coming from China and Ukraine.   And here are our careful savers‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäNigeria and Brazil showed the lowest average purchases. Fun fact‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe average ACE token purchase in China was more than 20x higher than in Nigeria.   How about payment methods? Looks like a lot of BTC fans in Thailand, Ukraine, Hong Kong, China, and Switzerland‚Ä¶   Meanwhile, over 90% of payments in Nigeria, Indonesia, Malaysia, Morocco and India were made in ETH.   ACE token sale continues‚Ää‚Äî‚Äävisit our official website for more details.  Stay updated‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfollow the project‚Äôs social media channels on: Facebook Twitter Telegram Medium LinkedIn Reddit or take a look at our video on YouTube.",False

ACE is a product token which offers unmatched opportunities, like hours of training with players, meetings, tickets, advertising with celebrities for platform users, etc. These services are bought for tokens. The more often a token is used, the better it is for all participants.  Agency commissions will be converted into tokens. As TokenStars develops, the number of sponsorship contracts signed by the players will grow. As a result, the agency commissions will grow. Accordingly, commissions will be converted into tokens, which means that tokens are supposed to be bought on the market. The more revenue, the more is supposed to be bought. This positively impacts the internal economy.  The ACE token plays a crucial role in the ACE ecosystem, since it provides voting rights in the decentralized community voting mechanism. ACE holders will have the opportunity to vote on various decisions, thus influencing the success of the platform. Then, it serves as a fundamental unit of accounting and a method of payment for its agents, specifically scouts, promoters, and advertisers.",False

I have an issue with the short term value.  As far as I understand you raised 377 btc during pre-sale and 828 btc so far during main sale.  The pre-sale was made in cooperation with IcoBox, in which participants could use icobox tokens to buy your tokens at 75% discount, correct? I conclude that must mean that at this moment in time about 64% (377*4/(377*4+828) = 0.64) of the tokens has been bought at 75% discount, correct?  Won't that put a strain on the token value when tokens are released on the market? People might just sell at lower than ico price since they still make a nice profit.

You are right about our cooperation with ICObox, particularly we participated in ICOS, campaign for token swap.  In scope of ICOS you receive 75% discount if you invested via ICOBOX. However, there was only 96 hour period from the time it shows up on the site to the time it closes, and the amount of ACE tokens available for swap was limited too. Even though ACE token swap program was oversubscribed, that doesn't mean that all raised 377 btc during pre-sale were bought with the 75% discount   The exact amount of tokens which were distributed via ICOS will be published separately.  Regarding the issue how do we see the token price grow, first of all, ACE is a product token which offers unmatched opportunities, like hours of training with players, meetings, tickets, advertising with celebrities for platform users, etc. These services are bought for tokens. The more often a token is used, the better it is for all participants.  Second, agency commissions will be paid in tokens. As TokenStars develops, the number of sponsorship contracts signed by the players will grow. As a result, the agency commissions will grow. Accordingly, sponsors will convert our commissions into tokens, which means buying tokens on the market. The more revenue, the more we buy. This positively impacts the internal economy.

Besides, ACE token offers unmatched opportunities, like hours of training with players, meetings, tickets, advertising with celebrities for platform users, etc. These services are bought for tokens. The more often a token is used, the better it is for all participants.  And don't forget that agency commissions will be paid in tokens. As TokenStars develops, the number of sponsorship contracts signed by the players will grow. As a result, the agency commissions will grow. Accordingly, sponsors will convert our commissions into tokens, which means buying tokens on the market. The more revenue, the more will be bought from the market.

But‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääonly for 7 days.  The new ICO start date is August 31, 2017.  That extra week will allow our technology team and our security partners from Wallarm to significantly strengthen the safety of TokenStars‚Äô online assets, improve the anti-hacker approaches and the tools that we already use, as well as to investigate and implement additional mechanisms to guarantee the maximum level of security during the entire ICO period.  Being a certified expert in Information Systems and Telecommunications Security, TokenStars‚Äô CTO Andrey Toukmanov is sure that all our systems will be put under the ultimate control and provided with immunity against attacks by August 31. To shed more light on what we are doing, here are the key points on our way to the uttermost stability and resistibility:  We conduct the anti-DDoS monitoring and protection with the help of our partners at Wallarm.  We moved our hosting to Heroku, this provider has multiple security features out of the box that we are tuning up right now.  We will arrange an additional audit of the smart contract and website code, most probably with New Alchemy.  To sum up: We know about the attacks. We are doing our best to keep everything under our control‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand these efforts are successful, you can see it because our website is working normally. We are delaying the start of the TokenStars ACE token crowdsale until August 31, 2017, in order to protect our respected supporters and potential contributors against any security challenges that might show up. We know how to deal with all current issues in due time.  Thank you for being with us. Stay tuned. Ask your questions, please, if any.",False
