PGT can be used to pay or offset transaction fees whenever the token holders perform any transactions on the Gold Commerce platform. These transactions could be buying of gold with fiat, selling of gold or making payments to merchants. It is intended that holders of PGT will benefit by being charged just 50% of the prevailing fees when PGT is used. From time to time, and at the discretion of the Puregold, PGT can be converted to PGG at a rate announced by Puregold at that point in time. It is expected that the retained earnings from Gold Commerce will increase the stockpile of gold held in storage which would increase the supply of PGG accordingly. From time to time, and on the discretion of the Puregold, PGT holders can also be rewarded with PGG by Puregold, in proportion to the amount of PGT they hold. PGT can be used as payment for goods and services. Its low volatility as an asset and its predictability make it an invaluable form of currency. During the ICO, Puregold will also announce various partnerships with strategic alliances who are already onboard the PG Gold Commerce and Payment Gateway Platform. These alliances are merchants with products and services who will accept PGT as one of the modes of payment. This will create a strong demand for PGT by more consumers and further expand the PGT ICO subscriber base.",False

PGT can be used to pay or offset transaction fees whenever the token holders perform any transactions on the Gold Commerce platform. These transactions could be buying of gold with fiat, selling of gold or making payments to merchants. It is intended that holders of PGT will benefit by being charged just 50% of the prevailing fees when PGT is used.  From time to time, and at the discretion of the Puregold, PGT can be converted to PGG at a rate announced by Puregold at that point in time. It is expected that the retained earnings from Gold Commerce will increase the stockpile of gold held in storage which would increase the supply of PGG accordingly. From time to time, and on the discretion of the Puregold, PGT holders can also be rewarded with PGG by Puregold, in proportion to the amount of PGT they hold.  PGT can be used as payment for goods and services. Its low volatility as an asset and its predictability make it an invaluable form of currency. During the ICO, Puregold will also announce various partnerships with strategic alliances who are already onboard the PG Gold Commerce and Payment Gateway Platform. These alliances are merchants with products and services who will accept PGT as one of the modes of payment. This will create a strong demand for PGT by more consumers and further expand the PGT ICO subscriber base.",False

PGT can be used to pay or offset transaction fees whenever the token holders perform any transactions on the Gold Commerce platform.  Puregold requires users to complete registration through a Know-Your-Customer (KYC) process prior to any token swap. This is in line with financial services best practices to verify users’ identity to prevent financial fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing.",False

Basically Puregold offers two digital tokens, PGT and PGG, running on two separate ledgers. PGG works through a digitized cryptoasset whose cryptocurrency value is based on physical gold.  • PGT can be used to pay or offset transaction fees whenever the token holders perform any transactions on the Gold Commerce platform. These transactions could be buying of gold with fiat, selling of gold or making payments to merchants. It is intended that holders of PGT will benefit by being charged just 50% of the prevailing fees when PGT is used. • From time to time, and at the discretion of the Puregold, PGT can be converted to PGG at a rate announced by Puregold at that point in time. It is expected that the retained earnings from Gold Commerce will increase the stockpile of gold held in storage which would increase the supply of PGG accordingly. • From time to time, and on the discretion of the Puregold, PGT holders can also be rewarded with PGG by Puregold, in proportion to the amount of PGT they hold.  Other details include the following: PGT tokens are static, meaning that their ownership does not entitle you to dividends or earnings’ income PGG can be stored long-term in a special and secure storage with options of either converting the gold to fiat or to some form of cryptocurrency, such as BTC, ETH, Dash, etc",False

Payer does not need to pay a transaction fee when paying a merchant or business entity for products and services, and the exchange rate of gold vs currency, e.g. Gold/SGD, is at Spot Price.

Gold has a profound impact on the value of world currencies. Even though the gold standard has been abandoned, gold as a commodity can act as a substitute for fiat currencies and be used as an effective hedge against inflation. PGT may be used as payment for goods and services by merchants. Its low volatility as an asset and its predictability make it an invaluable form of currency. PGT can be used to pay or offset transaction fees whenever the token holders perform any transactions on the Gold Commerce platform. These transactions could be buying of gold with fiat, selling of gold or making payments to merchants. It is intended that holders of PGT will benefit by being charged just 50% of the prevailing fees when PGT is used. From time to time, and at the discretion of the Puregold, PGT can be exchanged for PGG at a rate announced by Puregold at that point in time.",False

Today a transaction between persons residing in different countries can still take several days and also cost the parties a significant share of the money ransferred (the average cross border transaction fee is 7.45%) as each party of the transfer chain, of which there are many, requires a small margin for their efforts. This can now be done in seconds using Gold backed cryptocurrencies via the blockchain for practically zero cost and more securely than ever before. Puregold is building Gold Commerce Platform for a digital Gold payments era. People will be able to store, spend and exchange Gold in the same way as they could any other currency, but in a quicker, cheaper and more secured environment than what is available now in traditional bank or fiat currency. The Gold Commerce Platform will be the decentralized core that interlocks the restricted financial world we live in today with a futuristic Gold economy with limitless and borderless opportunities. Puregold will take full advantage of this global contactless phenomenon, but instead of using traditional payment cards with fiat currencies, we will use personal smart phones as the medium for digital gold payments. We can skip generations of dedicated development by some of the biggest companies in the world, and adapt that technology to the Gold currency era within months, not decades.",False

These transactions could be buying of gold with fiat, selling of gold or making payments to merchants. It is intended that holders of PGT will benefit by being charged just 50% of the prevailing fees when PGT is used. PGT can be used as payment for goods and services. Its low volatility as an asset and its predictability make it an invaluable form of currency. From time to time, and at the discretion of the Puregold, PGT can be converted to PGG at a rate announced by Puregold at that point in time. It is expected that the retained earnings from Gold Commerce will increase the stockpile of gold held in storage which would increase the supply of PGG accordingly.
