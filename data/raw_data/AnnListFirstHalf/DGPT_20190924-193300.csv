So far, we've raised a third of our goal of 1600 ETH - 598 ETH from 86 contributors in 24 hours and the numbers are increasing hourly! This is our way of giving back to you - our Original Contributor who supported us after our first ICO and gave us the encouragement we needed to keep developing our Digital Inheritance service!  The Pre-sale will be held until October 1st, 14:59 (UTC) or until we reach our hard cap of 1600 ETH.

Please note that for a successful transaction, you must: 1) have DGT tokens in your wallet and 2) the minimum purchase must exceed 0.5ETH.  NB!

The month long ICO for DigiPulse has come to an end! Our idea has raised 1924 ETH from 687 contributors and we are thankful for the huge support!  Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach our minimum goal of 8’000 ETH. As stated in the smart contract, all of the contributions are refundable (instructions here: http://www.digipulse.io/refund.pdf)!  What happens next?  Despite missing the initial cap, a lot of community members still would like to see our idea be brought to life (and we don’t feel like giving up), so that is why DigiPulse is announcing a token sale re-launch that is going to take place from October 1st until October 31st, with an all improved DigiPulse Project 2.0!  What has changed (why is it better)?  During the past couple of months, we have received a lot of valuable feedback from the community on various aspects of our idea (the team, token mechanism, service setup, marketing channel usage, exchange related issues, bounty structure, smart contract conditions, etc.) and we have taken all of those into account.  Our first ICO attempt was launched with nothing but an idea and a 2’500$ marketing budget. We have gained invaluable experience on how to run a crowdfunding campaign (the “do’s and don’ts”), have made additions to our team and have upgraded (if not re-hauled completely) our service!  The improvements for the DigiPulse Project 2.0 are the following:  Investor supported ICO launch - in order for us to gain a bigger exposure (and in turn grant more value to the contributors), DigiPulse has acquired capital for an improved marketing campaign; Same idea, better concept - we have changed the way DigiPulse works at its core by removing mineable coins and only leaving a token, that now offers profit sharing. But we will also involve the community by offering them the chance to become storage providers; Bigger team - we have made additions to our team in the form of a legal advisor and a security audit specialist, who have already helped to shape the new concept; A prototype to show - we have addressed the “decentralization” and security issues by creating our own blockchain. The alpha solution we are currently working on will be made available to the public for testing till the end of September; Addressing the community - the first attempt helped us to better understand the power of the spoken word. We now have an improved plan in place that covers multiple communication channels, starting from Twitter and ending with Youtube (and everything in between); Momentum - last, but not least, the first ICO helped to put DigiPulse on the map! We are going to use this recently gained reputation to propel our idea to a much bigger audience, thus making digital asset inheritance a reality!   All of the improvements stated above can be read in more detail in our new Whitepaper v 2.0! (available here https://www.digipulse.io/whitepaper.pdf)  But, my bounties…  The bounties won’t be leaving DigiPulse for the v 2.0! If you have been a part of our first ICO’s bounty campaign, do not worry. We have an offer that will be fair to both parties.  You will be able to transfer your existing stakes from v 1.0 to v 2.0, if you continue to participate in DigiPulse Project 2.0! The old stakes will have a separate bounty pool of 1% allocated specifically to them from the new project (see Whitepaper).  E.g. If you were a Twitter contributor and had 172’660 stakes, all of these will be automatically transferred to the v 2.0, once you sign into the platform (on the 1st of October) and will grant you the pro-rata share of the 1% allocated pool. Every new Tweet in the v 2.0 will reset the stake count and grant stake admission for the 2% bounty share for v 2.0 bounty pool!  All of the bounties will be transferred automatically, once you sign into the platform (translation bounties will be transferred manually).  The bounty campaign officially closes on the 31st of August and will be re-opened on the 23rd of September. We will use this time transfer the stakes, set up the new tracking mechanism and improve our webpage! In this downtime, bounties will not be tracked!   So, what now?  If you had contributed, please refund your contribution here: (instructions here: http://www.digipulse.io/refund.pdf)! We are not able to do it for you (sorry for the inconvenience)!  In the meantime, give our new Whitepaper a read! The DigiPulse team is working hard and we are available on Slack almost 24/7! We would love to hear your feedback!  If you do choose to support us in the future, then mark the 1st of October as the launch date for our token sale!  See you soon and as always, visit www.digipulse.io for the newest updates!  Are you going to have a pre-sale?  Yes, but it is a closed investor round with a limited cap for the contributions (minimum investment amount is 10 ETH with a 100% bonus). If you are interested - drop us a line (hello@digipulse.io) and we will send you further instructions.",True

Primary purpose of our service is having the guarantee that nothing will go missing and inheritor will have access to all services.""  So DigiPulse primarily does not store assets themselves, but information about where those assets are. If someone has a wallet at Coinbase and the original owner dies, maybe the rightful inheritors will never find out. DigiPulse jumps in and provides exactly that service: the Coinbase wallet owner specifies a way to address the rightful inheritor and DigiPulse - should the original owner die - informs the rightful inheritor about the connection between the original owner and Coinbase or provides the rightful inheritor with whatever information has been stored by the original owner on the Digipulse platform.

For example, if I use your service, store a private key in a vault and specify an inheritor, then you are going to manually pass on the relevant information to that inheritor should my DigiPulse account reach the defined level of inactivity. The vault is stored on a centralized database, correct? Couldn't the whole process once be run on a blockchain so that users of such a service could set up a smart contract with the tools from your platform that automatically executes and sends the relevant information to the inheritor? I see this scenario where the nut of ""reliable digital identity"" could have been cracked and everything could be automated as every person in the world could have a unique ID and specifying and - in case of death - verifying the rightful inheritor would not require any manual double checks, hence automation could be possible. So the blockchain used within your platform only has a payment channel function, but - apart from the fact that DGT could be stored as a form of wealth on your platform - not a storage function as of yet, is that right or am I getting something completely wrong here?

However, in the whitepaper it says that only digital currencies can be stored and passed on I think. So I do believe that the growth of the DigiPulse platform also partially depends on the adoption of digital currencies in general. It would be great to have a stable digital currency integrated with DigiPulse and advertise that one as a 100% reliable store of value to those people who still fear digital currencies as a store of value precisely because of the volatility.

Yes, this was tied to the initial platform we were building and it is our first partnering service.

Saw your question regarding the stakes-coins.     So what this means is that on the 31st of August, when we stop the ICO, all of the ~1 million coins will be split on a pro-rata basis to the token holders. The DGT and DGP have 8 decimals!  Let me give you two examples (in the case of the min and max cap): Remember that bounties have 2% of tokens assigned to them from the total token amount 1 DGT = 0.004 ETH  1) Min cap - 8'000 ETH = 2'300'000 DGT (2'000'000 DGT + 15% token reward). 2% = 46'000 DGT (reserved for bounties)  % DGT DGP 100% 2'300'000 1'000'000 98% 2'254'000 980'000 2% 46'000 20'000  Now you have to take into account the specific bounty, e.g. Twitter. It has a 30% bounty pool from the 2% = 13'800 DGT. Then you have to look at the stakes you have gained by supporting us. Looking at the picture now, the top Twitter bounty user has gained 18'830 stakes, which is 3.92% of all of the Twitter stakes. This equals 540.96 DGT. Looking at the pro-rata share this is equals 235.2 DGP coins!  2) Max cap - 60'000 ETH = 16'250'000 DGT (15'000'000 + all % token rewards). 2% = 325'000 DGT (reserved for bounties)  % DGT DGP 100% 2'300'000 1'000'000 98% 15'925'000 980'000 2% 325'000 20'000  Now you have to take into account the specific bounty, e.g. Twitter. It has a 30% bounty pool from the 2% = 97'500 DGT. Then you have to look at the stakes you have gained by supporting us. Looking at the picture now, the top Twitter bounty user has gained 18'830 stakes, which is 3.92% of all of the Twitter stakes. This equals 3'822 DGT. Looking at the pro-rata share this is equals 235.2 DGP coins!  NB! These calculations are based on the idea that the contributions have stopped (a freeze snapshot of the ICO)! When more contributions are made, the total amount of DGT will increase for everyone, but the DGP amount will dilute.  P.s. If you see any mistakes in the calculations, please post them on the thread (and crush my math genius EGO  )",True

Regarding sites that you post on - we have no limitations as long as it does not interfere with ""good practice"" of the service. By ""good practice"" I mean that you have to make logical decisions that should not hurt the reputation of the project. E.g. if you post information about our ICO on a cooking site, that might be irrelevant and cause a backlash from the site you posted in. Basically, you have to post it where it is relevant and acceptable. You can not spam a post in a website, because that defeats the purpose and is against the ""good practice"". I hope you understand what I am trying to say.  Regarding ""specific sites"" to post on - think of it this way: you are given a link from our website that tracks the contributions, so most likely people are going to contribute to our project from a site/forum/blog related to crytpo currencies, blockchain, etc. It is more useful to put in the effort to post it in the right place, rather than spam the post somewhere.   Regarding posting in the forum - I would advice against this, because we might get a warning from the moderators and the minimum amount of words is around 250. So if you know the rules of the forum and might know a sub-page where to post on - go for it. As long as you keep the ""good practice"" in mind!  You can learn more about the ""quality content"" details under our bounty section on our website www.digipulse.io. I do not want to post the whole thing here (but can do that if you want to).  I hope that I have explained the basic idea behind what/where/how.",True

Our goal is to ensure that digital assets are not lost and people are able to pass them on to the rightful inheritors, in case of the owner’s death. By this we are tackling the issue of escheatment in the digital domain. Our plan is to set up an infrastructure that will become an industry wide standard for the future generations to come.  With the increasing usage of cryptocurrencies the problem of leaving your assets to inheritors is becoming more and more important. Currently none of the digital vaults offer this possibility and the user can’t be sure that the paper wallet will be delivered to the rightful inheritor.  We are launching a crowdsale for DPT - the token currency used by initial backers of DigiPulse, to support the development of this service and grant future admissions for service usage. This will be accomplished by introducing “passive mining” functionality which will be deeply rooted into the concept of the DigiPulse service.    How it works  By using the technologies currently available, DigiPulse offers a new way of monitoring a user’s activity status remotely and a way to enhance (if not disrupt) the way of passing digital assets on.  The platform automatically establishes the status of the user (the period of inactivity) via a desktop app, a smartphone app and/or other web based integrations (each service that we integrate with becomes a separate channel of monitoring the user activity).  The user is the one who determines which integrations he connects to his account and the way his/her activity should be tracked, and the inactivity period that triggers the data send out.     State of the project  As of now, the project has the platform developed and is awaiting the Beta release (this is planned to be rolled out until the end of the year).  A big milestone has already been reached in acquiring our first partnering service - San Francisco based cryptocurrency wallet provider Coinbase. Coinbase has made DigiPulse eligible to transfer up to 50,000 USD worth of assets on behalf of the users without 2 the factor authentication.    DigiPulse tokens and coins (DGT & DGP)      ""Passive mining""  The protocol behind the DGP coins is CryptoNote, which currently is minable only by CPU and GPU, thus preventing ASIC miners who would otherwise dominate the mining process.  Anyone who mines coins through the pool set up on DigiPulse will be eligible for a free monthly service subscription upon providing a minimum of 10 Hashes per second every month (based on the average monthly calculations).  Every block found on the DigiPulse pool, will be proportionally split across miners. The fee of the pool is set at 12% from which 10% will be split pro-rata to the token holders who will submit their DGT wallet address to the DigiPulse pool platform, thus confirming that they are in the possession of the mentioned token amount. The remaining 2% will be kept for DigiPulse as an additional source of income to facilitate the operations of the service. The pool commission will be split only amongst those who provide their wallet address on the platform.    Token release  The Initial Coin Offering of DGT starts on 04.08.2017 and ends on 31.08.2017. The tokens will be transferred to the users after the ICO has ended within one week. The DigiPulse team will use ERC20 tokens based on Ethereum to generate DGT. They will be generated and sent out at the end of the ICO upon crossing the minimum cap by the smart contract. By using this approach, we will be able to generate the necessary amount of tokens that corresponds to the raised amount of funds. DigiPulse will provide the source code of the contract so that the exact raised amount of tokens will be generated and afterwards - distributed. Even though there isn’t a fixed amount of tokens available at the start of the ICO, they will have a hard cap that can not exceed 16,581,633 DGT. The tokens made available during the ICO will be standard “usage tokens”. After the ICO, we will work towards adding the token to several exchanges and will be updating our progress on our homepage, twitter channel, facebook, slack and newsletters.   The maximum amount of tokens available during the pre-sale and the ICO = 16,250,000 tokens (equals 98% of the total token amount available)*  Token price = 0.004 ETH  Token ticker = DGT  Minimum purchase per person = 1 Token  Accepted currencies = ETH   *Token distribution 98% of tokens will be made available to the contributors. 2% of tokens will be reserved for bounties.    The tokens will have the following reward system Token distribution priority Token amount Percentage rewards 1st batch 3,750,000 15% (562,500 additional DGT) 2nd batch 3,750,000 10% (375,000 additional DGT) 3rd batch 3,750,000 5% (187,500 additional DGT) 4th batch 3,750,000 -    Raised fund usage and distribution  The minimum cap for our project is set at 8,000 ETH (if the minimum cap will not be reached, the funds will be re-distributed back to their respective wallets). The hard cap for our project is set at 60,000 ETH. By raising this amount, we will be able to fully develop and deliver the service to the community without interruptions, as opposed to having to raise the funds necessary through investor talks and multiple funding rounds.  45% - service development; 20% - marketing and PR; 15% - legal and consulting; 15% - reserve fund; 5% - security audits and certifications.   Escrow  DigiPulse will not have an escrow in place for the project. By conducting a research on previous ICOs, we feel that the escrow management can be (and sometimes is) closely related to the original project creators which does not add an extra layer of credibility and the escrow itself can become redundant.    Team  Normunds Kvilis, Co-founder & CEO Before focusing on DigiPulse, Normunds acquired a master’s degree in economics and was an analyst in a leading Scandinavian bank, focusing on financial market analysis and investment opportunities. Later, he took on the role of an IT project manager, with the focus on leading developer teams towards a bank merger. Cryptocurrencies have been on his radar for quite some time and as investor focus is starting to shift toward this investment tool, also new problems and opportunities arise.  Linkedin | Facebook   Dmitry Dementyev-Dedelis, Co-founder & CTO Before the idea of DigiPulse and the fact that we have half of our lives online with all the assets and valuables stored there, Dmitry was working in the fundraising sector for universities. By understanding the logic behind alumni giving and gamification, and seeing it from the IT perspective, he has gained the knowledge to merge these two worlds together - digital realm and real world behaviour. To gain a better knowledge about behaviour of people and the cognitive processes, he is currently managing a part time BSc in the field of Psychology.  Linkedin | Facebook",True

Yes, you understand correctly! DigiPulse.io is creating a service that will allow to inherit cryptocurrencies. We truly believe that it is overlooked in the rising crypto domain. There will be multiple options to choose from on how to pass assets on, starting from a confirmation of death (e.g. death certificate) to a simple ""dead man's switch"" function that will triger data send out when certain criteria are met.

If I understand your question correctly, the deceased user is the one who decides on what to share with his inheritors. He will have a profile set up at DigiPulse, that will be shared with beneficiaries after the ""inactivity"" period.  By using our service, the user will be able to provide information about the inheritors - the more specific the info, the easier it will be for us to contact them. We will contact people through emails, phone calls and any other channels, that are provided by the original user.",True
