The Sharpe-ETHLend partnership was finalized following a meeting at Web Summit 2017 in Lisbon, Portugal. The newly established relationship provides ETHLend with privileged early access to the Global Sentiment Index data-feed during its Alpha and Beta developmental stages, delivering real time insights into how the market perceives individual blockchain assets. Sharpe and ETHLend will work together to refine the product and optimize it for further commercialisation. This partnership is a key proof of the value of one of Sharpe Capital’s core products and future revenue streams — Sharpe is working to ensure the Global Sentiment Index becomes the world’s leading source for market sentiment data.  Through collecting real human insights and combining them with cutting edge machine learning, Sharpe can far surpass the traditional approach to sentiment analysis derived from often highly unreliable analysis of social media feeds and news sources. By joining forces with ETHLend, Sharpe Capital is able to tailor the Global Sentiment Index to an increasingly diverse audience, and help to reduce risks associated with blockchain-driven lending.  Sharpe Capital is a FinTech organization developing a platform to crowd-source market sentiment on global equities and blockchain assets, paying service fees in Ether to users in return for their insight. Supplemented with cutting edge, machine learning-driven linguistic analysis and quantitative trading strategies developed in collaboration with leading academic partners at University of California, Berkeley and the University of Oxford, Sharpe Capital aims to deliver best-in-class data-feeds for use by investors.  Co-founder and Chief Operating Officer of Sharpe Capital, Dr. Butler, described the newly announced advisory partnership: “By joining forces with ETHLend, Sharpe Capital is able to tailor the Global Sentiment Index to an increasingly diverse audience, and help to reduce risks associated with blockchain-driven lending.  ETHLend has been available on Ethereum main network since May 2017, providing a global lending market where loan conditions are agreed between borrowers and lenders, and parties can participate on both sides. ETHLend is a transparent, borderless and decentralized market and erasing interest rate differences between countries by providing competition on a global scale. ETHLend solves key issues regarding collaterals, decentralized credit rating and exchange volatility risks with fiat pegging option.  Through partnership with Sharpe Capital, ETHLend lenders will now access to the leading source of decentralized and crowdsourced asset sentiment, allowing lenders to assess collateral risk on loan request using real-time data from the Global Sentiment Index before choosing to fund a loan — Jordan Gustave, Chief Operating Officer of ETHLend  Going beyond simple metrics of price and implied volatility, the Global Sentiment Index will let users know precisely how the market perceives an asset’s viability over timeframes from one week to one quarter. Following the Sharpe Platform launch on 11th December, ETHLend will have access to the Global Sentiment Index as it is collaboratively developed and refined during the Alpha and Beta stages of the product.

November 26, 2017 – ETHLend, the first and only functioning decentralized lending platform, has successfully raised $10 million USD in the first 30 mins of its public token sale for early adopters of the decentralized lending application build on top of Ethereum network.  ETHLend is a decentralized lending platform with an extensive roadmap that is going to see the ETHLend team to implement various crypto financial products such as token lending, crowdlending, collateral management and a protocol for AI lending bots. ETHLend’s road map can be found at https://ethlend.io/en/roadmap/.  ETHLend already offers (https://app.ethlend.io) secured loans on the Ethereum blockchain where users can borrow Ethereum using any ERC-20 digital tokens as collateral. The digital tokens ensure repayment of the loan, and lenders can lend Ether without the loss of capital.  ETHLend’s pre-sale closed out in September from an impressive zero marketing budget to a 2000 ETH cap being met within 77 hours. The Token sale started on November 25 at 12 PM GMT and skyrocketed to an impressive 10 million dollars in the first 30 mins. There is now less than 20% of LEND token available before the cap is reached and its closing out at a steady pace with the minimum purchase of 0.01 ETH.  Leading the way in decentralized lending, Stani Kulechov the founder of ETHLend has now gathered a community of over 6 700 members. Personally involved in the group, he’s available day in and day out to answer queries which has given a feeling of security amongst the ETHLend community.

When more users are using the application, there are more lenders and borrowers that would purchase the token from the market (token holders). Moreover, ETHLend uses 25% of the application fees to purchase LEND back and to reward active borrowers and lenders with airdrops, therefore increasing the demand for LEND. This unique way is the only way to direct the the value to the product, thus to the project and hence to the token value (and token holders).",False

Here is good info on decentralized lending and benefits:  What are the benefits of decentralized lending?  Liquidity available globally. Today, borrowers are limited to local banks and peer to peer lenders, which creates a local lending market. Decentralized lending provides the ability to reach capital from different parts of the world. Borrower from the UK is not limited to UK lenders. Instead, the borrower can receive funds all the way from Tokyo to Los Angeles. Such wide scale lending might provide more competition to local lenders and pressure the interest rates to decrease.  Funding Initial coin offerings. Decentralized lending might be plausible alternative or additive for funding before initial coin offerings (ICO). Blockchain startups can take the advantage of decentralized lending by placing some of their future sold tokens as a pledge for a loan. This might be an innovative solution to fund research, development and marketing before the ICO. Once the ICO is finished, the startup can repay the loan. The solution provides temporary funding for the startup without giving away tokens.  Faster process and the unbanked. Transactions within the Ethereum blockchain network are settled within seconds or minutes. Moreover, the lending process of placing a loan request and funding a loan request takes few minutes in total including the transfers of the cryptocurrency. The speed is competitive edge compared to centralized lending process. Decentralized lending might eventually provide access to finance for the unbanked as well.",False

We are aware that reading close to 60 pages of technical focused material might not be so easy to absorb, therefore the brief covers key points and will help our community members quickly grasp what we are focusing on throughout the further development of ETHLend.  The ETHLend token sale starts on the 25th November 2017 and ends on 27th December 2017  We have allowed a whole month for the token sale to follow the industry medium.  In addition to the roadmap: Competitive bidding on interest rates between lenders  We will develop an auction-like bidding function for the decentralized application to provide the best market rate on interest rates for the borrowers. The interest rate bidding auction is a reverse auction where the lenders place bid offers for a loan interest rate. The lowest bid on the interest rate will win the auction and the smart contract will accept that particular lender as the funder of that loan via smart contract. Such bidding would provide the most competitive interest rate for the borrowers since anyone from any part of the world can participate and bid on the loans.  In addition to the roadmap: Expanding Decentralized Lending and Decentralized Credit Rating beyond the Ethereum network  An overall project is nothing without an extensive plan. ETHLend is planning to expand the decentralized lending application to other blockchain networks well beyond Ethereum. We have researched and found different blockchain networks have their own capabilities and the users are divided between these different blockchains. ETHLend plans to be accessible beyond Ethereum by providing similar lending functions on other blockchain networks as well.  Additionally, we are going to create a function to broadcast the data from our decentralized credit rating to other blockchain platforms. By compiling such data, the borrower can use his well-earned credit score on other applications in other blockchains.  ETHLend’s plan on expanding to other blockchain networks is developing as the last milestone within our immediate roadmap. ETHLend requires a fully functional application on the Ethereum network and we need to wait for other blockchain networks to mature along with the growth of the decentralized lending market before we can expand our development to these new networks.  ETHLend has added a reward program: Rewarding introductions with LEND (New utility function)  We will purchase additional amounts of LEND tokens (Amount to be decided during Q1 2018) so as to reward both lenders, borrowers and third parties who introduce new participants to the decentralized lending platform. The introductions will be rewarded with a stake of the purchased LEND that is dedicated for the introduction program. Full details of the introduction program shall be disclosed during Q1 2018.  Adding Featured functions that are accessible only with LEND tokens (New utility function)  We will provide further functions that are only accessible with the use of LEND. These featured functions will include Featured loan listings.  Featured listings are where the loan request is placed in the top of the search and/or listing results to speed the lending process for both borrowers and lenders who require a faster lending experience within ETHLend. An email marketing campaign for new loan requests- Such a marketing campaign might be beneficial for large loans.  ETHLend reserves the right to provide more additional featured functions for the LEND users.  Change: Lenders and Borrowers can alternatively sell their airdropped LEND instead of using it on ETHLend (New utility function)  We added the capability to sell the LEND that is rewarded for both the active lenders and borrowers. Such is convenient when a lender or borrower is leaving the application.  5% is allocated from core development to marketing and promotions  We have chosen to allocate 5% of the overall Lend to marketing from the core development. ETHLend believes that a strong promotions and marketing campaign is a must to succeed in the global lending market. Since ETHLend has already a functioning prototype of the decentralized application, we are far ahead of most of the lending ventures that are aiming to use blockchain technology within lending. Therefore, we shall increase the marketing allocation with 5%. After the change, the funds allocation is the following where 50% of the raised funds are dedicated to further quality assurance and development:  30% on core development 20% on user experience development 20% on management & legal 20% on promotions & marketing 10% on unexpected costs  Added the Advisory board to the White Paper  We have added the complete list of advisory board to the White Paper. We have updated the Advisors of ETHLend to correspond with our growing team.  Changing months to Q’s (Quarter) on roadmap  We have changed the format used on the roadmap. Instead of providing the month when a function will be deployed, we are now providing the Quarter of the year when such function shall be deployed. Therefore, we have more flexibility for Quality Assurance, testing and perfecting the code before deployment on the main Ethereum network.  6-month Cliff period added for team members that join ETHLend after the token sale period  For all new team members who join ETHLend after the token sale period (From 2018 onwards) and are subject to the vesting model, a 6-month cliff-period is added. This means that if the person leaves before 6 month from the starting point, the ETHLend member is not entitled to the vested tokens.  With these additions and modifications, we are proceeding with the upcoming token sale on the 25th November.

Although, I dont believe that they have a head start since we have a basic alpha dapp already running from May 2017 on main Ethereum network.   But here are the differences between the competition:  How ETHLend differs from the competition  Functionally, the known competition of ETHLend uses ERC-20 tokens as a collateral to borrow FIAT currencies such as USD. While such function might be suitable, ETHLend is emphasising in pledging ERC-20 to receive cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum or Bitcoin. Our ideal aim is to create financial tools for the crypto economy. However, we shall adopt FIAT-pegging as well which means that one could use FIAT currencies as a base calculation and send transactions by using Ethereum.  What makes ETHLend different from other ventures is that the team delivered their first ever prototype of the decentralized lending application this May. Based on the practical findings, the team wrote the white paper on decentralized lending. The ETHLend considers this as an edge since ideas that are good in theory might not hold in practice. Hence, we created proof-of-concept that our users can already adopt.  Technically ETHLend differs from others that the application is fully decentralized. Decentralization provides more security by design since all transactions are performed via Smart Contract. Therefore, the participants in a loan agreement do not need to trust ETHLend or the counterparty. Such solutions provides full transparent market since all transactions are broadcasted in the blockchain which can be explored by anyone.  Moreover, ETHLend is open to all participants from all parts of the world and the transactions are done peer to peer. We do not limited the market in any way and cannot interrupt in the lending. Participants are free to choose the parameters. Being free means that the application is open for banks, investment funds, companies and consumer end users. Never such wide-scale lending market has been deployed before. With ETHLend you can run a lending institution of your own.",False

On Entry to ETHLend  Discount: LEND enables 25% discount the deployment fees for a loan request and for funding a loan request on decentralized lending application.  On Use of ETHLend  Airdrops and Rewards: ETHLend uses flat 20% of the collected platform fees (upon loan request and funding a loan) to purchase back LEND from the market. This purchased LEND shall be distributed to the active lenders and borrowers (monthly or quarterly) based on activity. The airdropped LEND cannot be transferred, and the airdropped LEND is used either by the borrower as an additional collateral (when defaulted, the LEND is transferred to the lender) or by the lender for paying fees or featured listings. The airdropped LEND will reduce lenders’ risk in case of default and reduces the amount of collateral the borrower needs to set. The aim is to accelerate user adoption and strengthen the product by lowering the threshold of collateral and risk of funding. The airdropped LEND must be used within 24 months or it will be redistributed to other active users.

Digix was one of the first proof-of-concept on tokenizing valuable real-world assets. Tokenization means that a value is translated into a tradable and easily transferrable digital format, a token. Digital tokens may represent any value from the real world, such as commodities, shares or property.  Every DGX token contains the right to 1 gram of gold that is stored in an audited vault. Therefore, the value of the tokenized gold can be easily traded or pledged against a loan without moving the physical gold repository. This digital gold standard provides more flexibility to investors that are trading in physical gold.  Moreover, unlike many digital tokens whose value is based on speculation on a blockchain startups future, DGX tokens are subject to the price of real gold. Therefore, these tokens are useful in situations where an investor aims to avoid volatility, while still having the benefits of owning a digital good.  ETHLend is a decentralized peer-to-peer application that is running on Ethereum network. ETHLend is a global lending market that connects lenders and borrowers from all over the world. ETHLend offers secured loans with the use of ERC-20 compatible digital tokens as a collateral. The application is ideal for token holders who are in need for liquidity and all those who want to participate in a free lending market. Instead of selling and closing a token position, a borrower can easily pledge digital tokens to receive Ether.  ETHLend is additionally adding a function to tie Ether loans to fiat currencies to avoid volatility and allowing familiar loan agreements for everyone, while keeping all benefits that separate blockchain technology from traditional banking: fast transactions even across borders, transparency for all parties and safety-by-design through self-executing contracts, called smart contracts.  Today Digix and ETHLend announce a mutual partnership that will create new use-cases and investment strategies for the DGX token holders and value stability and new functions for ETHLend platform users, whether they are individuals or businesses. The partnership consists of R&D collaboration, shared products and functions as well as combined efforts to educate and inform more people about the possibilities of business on the blockchain. The suitability of the DGX token on the ETHLend platform has already been tested successfully with test loans being collateralized by the gold token.  First, DGX token will be added as the first fixed token on the application. This means that a borrower who is willing to pledge a DGX token on ETHLend does not need to provide a smart contract address of the token. Instead, such information is readily available on the application.  Second, introducing a volatility feed. Since digital tokens bear volatility which must be taken into account, ETHLend and Digix will categorize the volatility of different tokens and map the results for users to understand the inherent risk of volatility. Such categorization is beneficial for the safety of  loan participants and it highlights the power of asset-backed tokens such as DGX. Also ETHLend will seek to incorporate a collateral-swap option, to allow on-platform asset swaps to low-volatility tokens, such as DGX, if the collateral value is dropping below a certain threshold in the middle of the loan.  Third, DGX as the token. ETHLend shall develop a smart contract on Kovan testnet to research the topic of token lending. ETHLend has received plenty of requests for lending tokens for different strategies such as short selling or hedging. DGX would be the token of choice for a stable lending basis. ETHLend will adopt token lending on the live decentralized application if the community continues to express the need for it.

About the project  ETHLend, a 100% decentralized peer to peer lending platform, is a decentralized application (DAPP) developed upon the Ethereum Network.  As the global P2P lending market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 53.06% during the period 2016-2020, the need for a secure, blockchain based way of lending is growing steadily. Moreover, lending between participants from different parts of the world is now accessible.  Smart contracts  From now on, ETHLend’s Smart Contracts ensures - anywhere, anytime – immediate secure lending and borrowing possibilities, stimulating lenders and borrowers quicker than any known financial institution on the planet. Finally reducing interest rate differences between different parts of the world by providing global liquidity pool by peer to peer. With our first loan completed on 8 June, ETHLend is already working hard and efficiently to give everyone the ability for decentralized lending. One of the major advantages of Blockchain-based decentralized lending is the fact that it offers accessibility to global capital and reduces the dependence on bank procedures or even the access to banking infrastructures in developing countries.  Collateral  The process is simple. Instead of lending FIAT currencies, users use Ether, a crypto-currency that runs the Ethereum blockchain network. Since lending is decentralized, the loans are running on blockchain, which means that once deployed, no one can manipulate, change or prevent the loans (not even ETHLend), thus providing security by design. Secured loans. The borrower uses ERC-20 compatible tokens that may represent any value as a collateral for loans. Alternatively, borrower may use Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains as a collateral. Today ERC-20 tokens are valued over few billion USD and ENS domains contain locked Ether that is rising near to a billion USD. As these figures are increasing astronomically, demand for decentralized crypto-lending will boom.  The power of tokenization. In the near future, the borrower might buy a house in the UK, place the house on ERC-20 compatible token to represent the value of the house and pledge the token for a loan on ETHLend. Instead of settling for local lenders, the borrower can access funders across the world, adding more competition on interest rates. Tokenization could be used similarly to fund a solar power plant, buildings, tuitions or even a purchase of a dog.   Team ETHLend consists of an international team committed to change the world’s perspective on access to credit and micro-credit. The ETHLend team aims to provide more democracy to lending by removing interest rate differences between different nations by providing more liquidity when there are less excessive barriers on lending.

Profit sharing was considered as a method of reward. ETHLend has decided to improve the reward method by introducing systematic buybacks. Instead of paying ETH to token holders addresses, ETHLend will use the ETH that is accumulated from lending on ETHLend (the 5% + 1–5% of the platform fees) to buy LEND from exchanges and ‘burn’ it.  The aim is to reward token holders by limiting the total supply of LEND which will increase the value of LEND token. Each buyback and burn will increase the token holder’s percentage of the ownership (reducing supply). It is up to the token holder to decide whether the token holder wishes to sell or hold the increase of ownership to realize profits.  What this means?  Percentage of token holder’s ownership grows each time ETHLend buys LEND and burns it.  The token holder can sell accrued percentage to realize profits.  The same model (5% + 1–5%) is used to calculate the amount of LEND that ETHLend will buy from the open market and burn.  Buyback and burn will occur every quarter of the year.  EHTLend will issue a quarterly report to advise on the buyback and burn statistics.  Why?  Avoid paying profits to exchanges. When token holder wishes to trade tokens, tokens are sent to the exchange and the ownership of the token is changed to the exchange’s custodian address. This means that the exchange receives the profit. Since there is no profit sharing structure currently adopted by the exchanges, this would create a risk. Moreover, holding assets at centralized exchange is subject to higher risks (e.g. Mt. Gox). Buybacks and burning ensures that the ‘real owners’ of the token is the will benefit from the reward.   Transaction costs are avoided. When profit share will be distributed in dividend-like manner, there would be thousands of transactions monthly or quarterly. Each transaction would exhaust a small amount of gas. With buyback there are only few transactions, which means that the saved gas will be utilized to buy and burn more LEND. Regulatory uncertainty. If assets are associated with dividend-like profit sharing, LEND could be seen as a security by regulators. Buybacks ensures that more jurisdictions will allow usage of LEND resulting in larger demand and use for LEND.  Profit sent to LEND addresses that are dead. There are situations where Ethereum addresses are lost. In these circumstances tokens might be lost as well. This would mean that profit would be distributed to addresses that are dead. Sending ETH to addresses that nobody uses does not provide any value to anyone. On the other hand, if this value is used to reduce the supply of LEND, the value is distributed amongst all token holders.  Uncertainty on taxation. Dividend-like profit share might be seen in the near future as taxable income for token holders since the profit accumulates for holding an asset. On the other hand, buyback increases the value of LEND but might not trigger taxes on income. Of course, this does not avoid the fact that any value increase is taxed once sold, just as any other cryptocurrency.  Impossible to collaborate 100% with exchanges. It is understandable that most token holders will keep LEND tokens on exchanges for trading. It will be impossible to achieve 100% collaboration with exchanges to distribute ETH accumulated from lending on ETHLend.  Buyback solves all these issues and supports the aim to deliver strong token on the market.  The mechanics of the buyback will be advised after the ICO with community inputs.",False

The earning is quite simple. The when the borrower places a New Loan Request, the borrower inserts the amount of premium (interest) that the borrower will pay for the loan. Loans and premiums are in ETH. When placing the loan request it is up to the borrower to place such a premium that is attractive (and for sufficient ERC-20 token or ENS domain as a collateral). And it is up to the lender to fund loans that are attractive to fund.  Since the profit is the ETH that the lender receives from lending ETH, the earning is not subject to price movements of ETH (of course compared to collateral yes).  2. When the borrower places a loan request, sufficient collateral must be used. Otherwise the loan will not get funded at the market since it is not attractive for the lenders. Since the ETHLend is 100% decentralized, the borrower must use external data to assess the value (I use http://coinmarketcap.com or https://etherscan.io/tokens for popular tokens and for ENS domains I of course use the amount that is locked in). So what the borrower needs to do is asses the value of the tokens or ens domain that he is about to pledge as a collateral, and decide how much the borrower will ask. For example, if I would have 10 ETH worth of ICONOMI tokens, I would not probably ask the full 10 ETH (even though will be highly likely that it would get funded). Instead I would ask for 8 ETH, giving 2 ETH flexibility for the token price movements (volatility, btw we wrote a steemit post on how to take the token volatility into consideration when lending: https://steemit.com/ethereum/@ethlend/lending-ether-interest-free-on-ethlend-and-how-to-choose-the-right-amount-of-ecr20-token-collaterals). This would give 120% collateral against the 8 ETH loan, which is attractive for the lenders and they might go for lower premium as well. On ENS domains i would recommend 1:1 ratio since the is no price movements on ENS domains due to the locked ether.  3. Since in most jurisdiction ETH (or Bitcoin) is not seen as money due to the fact that it is not issued by any govermend, KYC might not directly apply. However, we do believe that regulation will follow, and that is why we are implementing KYC procedure on certain threshold to give more certainty for the users. We actually found couple of decentralized ways to do it. On lending laws, source of law primarily is the freedom to contract and contractual agreement between the parties (This is the Terms and Conditions of ETHLend). However, in most jurisdictions there are laws against excessive interest rates, here as well the issue of ETH no being a currency does not settle the question. On the other hand, since the borrower is the one that deploys the loan request, this should be a large scale issue.  On the question where the loan is made, we settle the question by the choice of law clause set in the terms used in the Terms and Conditions.  At the moment you can do basic lending on ETHLend (http://ethlend.io) by pledging ERC-20 tokens or ENS domains (secured loans), we will also add this week unsecured loans by using Credit Token (CRE) that is the reputation system in ETHLend. Practically every time you borrow and repay an secured loan (token or domain), you will get 0.1 CRE on each 1 ETH you pay back. 0.1 CRE can be used to borrow equal amount of unsecured loans (up to 0.1 ETH with 0.1 CRE balance). If the borrower does not repay the loan, the all CRE is burned, therefore reputation lost. Therefore, the unsecured lending on ETHLend is about building reputation through secured loans first. Once the borrower has enough reputation, the borrower does need to resort to lending with collateral (of course collateral will always reduce the premium as in real life).",False

Below we have a loan transaction with two ending scenarios, repayment and default. In the first scenario the borrower deploys a smart contract (Loan Request) and confirms with MetaMask. Next the borrower goes to the All Loan Request Page, finds the deployed Loan Request. Places data such as loan amount, collateral token name, collateral token address, collateral token amount (how many tokens for pledge), premium (interest rate) and loan period (for how many days you want to borrow) and confirms with MetaMask.  After setting the data the borrower will go back to the loan agreement. The borrower is here instructed to send x amount of tokens to the smart contract address (0x0000...). Now the borrower goes to the wallet and sends the tokens to the smart contract. Goes back to the loan agreement and submits that the token are sent and confirms with MetaMask. Now the smart contract will perform a check whether this is true. The tokens are held as a collateral in the smart contract. Once confirmed, the loan is on ""Waiting For Lender"" stage.  Now the lender can fund the loan simply by having sufficient amount of Ether on MetaMask account balance and pressing ""Fund This Loan"", then confirming with MetaMask. The funds are sent to the smart contract, which distributes them to the borrower (all transaction are going through smart contract for security reasons). Now once the borrower wants to repay the loan on due, the borrower simply presses ""Get Tokens"" on the loan agreement and sends the ether + premium to the smart contract, then confirms the transaction with MetaMask. The smart contract will then sent the Ether + premium back to the lender's address and releases and sends the tokens back to the borrower.  In case the borrower has not repaid the loan on time, the lender can claim the collateral by pressing ""Get Tokens"" on the loan agreement and by confirming with MetaMask. The smart contract will then sent the pledged tokens to the lenders address. Moreover, the borrower's whole reputation (CRE) is burned. The lender can now go to an exchange (decentralized preferably, such as EtherDelta   ) and liquidate the tokens to regain any losses.  These scenarios are all decentralized, therefore even ETHLend cannot change or intervene the loans once deployed. No account or login needed, just MetaMask to access the Ethereum network",False

Until today, lending Ether on ETHLend required the borrower to pledge any ERC-20 compatible tokens such as DigixDAO or GOLEM token as a collateral for the loan. Alternatively, the borrower can pledge Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains as a collateral for the loan.  Therefore, if the borrower would not pay the loan back, the collateral is transferred to the lender (who can sell the collateral on exchange or at auction). Using collaterals results that lending in decentralized crypto-world would be efficient since the collateral increases the threshold for not paying the loan back and decrease the loss of loan capital since the lender can sell the token on exchange or the domain at an auction for regaining any losses.  Unsecured lending as such is challenging in decentralized environment. This is due the fact that distributed ledgers such as Ethereum network works with pseudo-anonymous addresses. Since the transactions are irreversible, there is no assurance that an untrusted borrower will pay the loan back. This results to the point that unsecured lending would be unworkable if the untrusted borrowers would not repay loans.  ETHLend introduces reputation system for unsecured loans. ETHLend provides more trust on unsecured loans by adding a reputation system that is managed by the use of ERC-20 compatible Credit Token (CRE). On each secured (or unsecured) loan repayment the borrower is credited with Credit Token (1 ETH = mines 0.1 CRE). Therefore, Credit Token represents the borrower’s reputation, which is used to borrow without a collateral (0.1 CRE allows borrowing up to 0.1 ETH).  If the borrower does not repay a loan on any amount, whether it is secured or unsecured, the whole balance of the borrower’s CRE is burned (permanently deleted). Using a reputation system motivates the borrower to build reputation to borrow more without the use of collateral.  The decentralized application is accessed  with the use of MetaMask. ETHLend also has a sandbox version of that is running on Kovan testnet. The latter is a good place to test the functionalities of decentralized lending.  Due diligence is required. CRE increases the threshold for defaults. However, unsecured lending is not risk free. Due to the pseudo-anonymous nature of the Ethereum network, there might occur misuse on unsecured lending, just as in the centralized lending. Therefore, lenders should explore and review the borrowers’ addresses on blockexplorers before deciding to fund loan requests.  More exciting stuff coming up. ETHLend’s Founder Stani Kulechov reveals that there are interesting expansion coming up. The ETHLend team will work hard during the next few months to expand lending to Bitcoin, Altcoin and maybe few other crypto-currencies. ETHLend’s financial and legal advisors are putting much research on KYC (Know Your Customer) compliance.  ETHLend declines to accept any VC funding. Unlike other blockchain startups, ETHLend does not have any venture capital fund backing the development. ETHLend has a team consisting of 16 people that found each other from the Ethereum and [Suspicious link removed]munity. Since ETHLend is building a global lending market, the team wants to have a distance on traditional banking and institutionalized funding.  Stani believes that associating with traditional banking and fund raising might compromise the development of decentralized lending. “We do not want to be guided back to the hands of traditional banking. We truly have an opportunity now to create something unique, which will help many people in different parts of the world.” ETHLend is also preparing for an upcoming token sale (ICO) and the team has come up with an innovative way to fund the pre-ICO phase, which will be introduced within few weeks. Stani adds: “our idea might change permanently the way pre-ICOs are funded.”.  ETHLend is open for contribution at Slack. Anyone can join and assist and brainstorm with the team on the development of the global lending market.

Fixed max gas estimation issue with MetaMask  Until this point MetaMask recommended 0.6 ETH transaction cost. Now MetaMask proposes around 0.06 ETH for max tx fee (this can be adjusted). The total transaction costs for the first Loan Request (token based) we deployed after update was:  Gas limit: 4282267  Gas price: 0.000000015 Ether (15 Gwei)  Gas used by txn: 2854845  Actual Tx Cost/Fee: 0.042822675 Ether  Took about 1 min 30 seconds for confirmation, which is bearable since lending is not high frequency.  Reputation-based Lending  Besides using ERC-20 compatible tokens or ENS domains, now borrowers can use reputation to borrow. The reputation is based on previous borrowing on ETHLend. On every secured loan (or unsecured as well) that is repaid, the borrower receives Credit Token (CRE). Each 1 ETH mines 0.1 CRE. 0.1 CRE allows the borrower to borrow up to 0.1 ETH (1:1 ratio) without a collateral.  Due diligence required. Just as in real world, unsecured lending is not risk free. The lender should always review borrower’s address with blockexplorer (http://etherscan.io) and review the transaction data.  In case the borrower does not repay a secured or unsecured loan, the whole CRE balance is burned and permanently erased.  5 times Faster DAPP  We changed the algorithms of the decentralized application. Now the DAPP is 5 times faster    New Colours  We changed the colours a bit (hope you like it) and use the red colour for the unsecured loan requests. Therefore, the lenders can indicate easier which are secured and not. Secured loan requests (tokens and domains) are in blue as usual.  Kovan Testnet and Old Smart Contracts  We launched a sandbox so that you can play around with ETHLend without using real Ether.  You can find it here: http://test.ethlend.io  The sandbox is on Kovan network so you would need to beg Kovan Ether from the Kovan Gitter:  https://gitte[Suspicious link removed]/kovan-testnet/faucet  Just ask for Keth and post your MetaMask address, remember to switch to Kovan testnet on MetaMask    For test tokens use MetaMask set to Kovan Network and go to here: https://tokenfactory.surge.sh  Loans that were deployed with previous smart contracts are here:  http://old.ethlend.io  http://oldest.ethlend.io  And of course the real thing is here: http://ethlend.io  Have Fun!

So, as opposed to a traditional loan where a defaulted loan would result in repossession of a house or business, a default would transfer only the coins that were set aside.  I""ll assume that most people who take such a loan only have a small amount of collateral in coins (since otherwise they'd just use the coins instead of borrowing against their value - and if they can't be sold easily then they're not worth it as collateral either). Technically it's not an unsecured loan, but it will be only a fraction of the loan value. In that case, the interest would usually be much higher since the lender is taking a bigger risk.",False

Actually it does no differ from traditional loan, since in the traditional loan in your example, the house or a business is the token! So in traditional sense the house/business ownership transfers to the lender, who then does the repossession. So to realize the house or business (the token) the lender must sell it in order to regain any losses. This is exactly the same pattern as in decentralized lending using ERC-20 tokens.  So what you are actually usually doing in real world with secured loans (loans with collateral), you do pledge value against value. That is the logic of secured lending, otherwise it would be unsecured. With the same logic shares, art, commodities are pledged, liquid or no-liquid, even if you have the market price and would quickly realize. I think the reasons why one pledged instead of selling comes down to different answers. With property, I want to own the token, even if I dont afford to yet. With shares, I believe that the company will grow and would not like to close my position since I might not get the shares back or back for the same price.  For me, a regular Joe, I pledge my tokens because I need more liquidity to participate in different ICOs. I get a decent salary, and I pay the loan amount back before it defaults. This way I can have more liquidity when needed (this was my personal reason why I wanted to use ERC-20 tokens for collateral). Also what I do quite frequently is that when I see the ETH price going down, I pledge my token portfolio to get a decent amount of ETH when it is down, and once I have my payday, I pay the loan back. For me it is just a quick way to get ETH when I need. But this is how I use my tokens and might not suitable for all. I dont sell my portfolio because my blood pressure would be too high if I would have to buy the same amount of tokens back from the market.",False

Yes any ERC-20 compatible tokens, the DAI project is interesting I have eagerly waited it too Although I found in my research DAI a bit complex, that why we actually came with the USD-peg explained below.  We are soon adding USD-peg lending option to our roadmap. This means that the borrower would not suffer from volatility since all loans could be calculated in USD even if the transactions are in ETH. This means that our non-crypto buddies can also borrow ETH, spend it in FIAT economy and pay the loan back with FIAT earned income without suffering from volatility.
