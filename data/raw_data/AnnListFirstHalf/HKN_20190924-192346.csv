A lot of good questions are coming up on Telegram, so for those of you not joined up (I recommend it), here's a little bit you may have missed.  Some easy ones:- How much has already been raised? > 820k HKNs were sold in the pre-sale (900k USD at today's rate)  Is there a soft cap for the ICO? > Yes, 1.5mln USD with 85% going to the HackenProof platform and 15% to the HackIT conference. The more that's raised, the more development that can be resourced. Maximum cap of 20 mln USD. Check out what hitting each of the milestones enable: https://hacken.io/#milestones   A couple of harder ones:- Why do we need HKN token? People can already pay via Bitcoin to hackers for the same purpose. > Hacken's burning model allows White hat hackers to have their own community token which increases in value with the platform developemnt. It will provide financial incentive to all memebers and help to build a strong community whilst improving the popularity of the profession and helping the blockchain and cryptocurrency community to develop with protected cybersecurity.  Why use a token at all? >The future of cybersecurity is within decentrilized platforms. There is huge amount of work that needs to be done in blockchain cybersecurity and Hacken's mission is to attract more and more people into the cybersecurity field through the use of the HackenProof platform, regardless of borders.   -That's it for now, I'll update regularly as there's more to ask and answer.  In the mean time, check out the whitepaper here: https://hacken.io/common/files/HackenWP.pdf Want to get involved and help spread the words? Might as well get some rewards too, check out the current bounties here: https://medium.com/hacken-ecosystem/hacken-bounty-campaign-6eaf46f956db",False

Might consider signing up for the bitcointalk sig/post campaign. The more I read about it the more I like it.  Was there an estimation on how much these services would cost? Between the coin burns, the white hats being paid for finding vulnerabilities, and the team themselves, it would all start to add up. Would the team be setting the price per request subjectively, based on how hard they think it's going to be, or will it be some sort of hourly thing? Really curious about this and think it's a great idea... Not sure how it's quite ""Decentralized"", considering there's a core team that has to be there running it, and all of your identities are posted. Other than that, everything here seems pretty on point and reasonable. Good job. Might actually invest in an ICO for the first time.  Another ICO I saw last week was outside the United States, just as you are, and they said that for tax reasons we weren't allowed to invest in the ICO, or the pre-ICO sale. Same thing here? Or can I invest.  Thanks.",False

We answer them in the order in which they are mentioned in your post: ‘I assume that only data related to product is shared on blockchain not the product release and source files itself’ This assumption is correct. We only use blockchain to issue HackenProof Vulnerabilities and Countermeasures Certificate and to prove authenticity of its contents ( number of vulnerabilities was fixed, client reaction) and timestamps. We store no customer sensitive information in the blockchain. Now, if a white hacker finds bugs or vulnerabilities, where he/she will share this information, on the blockchain or to some centralized servers? The researcher will share this information to our web portal HackenProof platform via bug bounty participant panel. Who will authenticate that found bugs etc are relevant and hacker has to be paid for this? The technical team of the client will investigate the vulnerabilities and determine whether they are relevant. The terms and rules of the bug bounty program will be stipulated by the document called policy. Policy will contain all the information covering the depth and scope of the work to be performed by the researchers. It will explain to researchers what the customer needs. We will also use policy as a proof of the customer’s intentions in an unlikely event of conflict between the client and the researcher regarding the relevance of the vulnerability that was discovered. If the client disagrees with our understanding of the policy, the incident will be submitted to the Public Board of Trustees of Hacken Ecosystem for further mediation. And what if other hacker found more bugs in the same product? Will he/she paid again for this? We are not sure we understand this question. The bug bounty program can have as many participants as the clients decides. They will be all submitting bug reports, which will be sorted chronologically and grouped by the issues covered. The purpose of the bug bounty program is to discover as many bugs as possible within the scope determined by the client. Each participant of the bug bounty program gets paid proportionally to the number of bugs discovered, reported and accepted by the client.",False

What is more important is you take every question and answer it. I want to clarify my last question:  Let say a client hire Hacken platform to check its product vulnerability. Client paid bug bounty to Hacken platform to be release to successful candidate. Hacken platform propagate information regarding this project on blockchain. Now assume there are 10 bugs (I know that no body knows about exact number of bugs) with severity: 1 critical, 2 high, 3 low, 2 blocker and 2 trivial. One hacker found all but critical bug. He/she reports 9 bugs in the system. He/she gets paid. One hour later other hacker reports 6 bugs as 1 critical, 2 high and 3 low.  Will he be paid? Or he should not report as bug bounty is closed?  The question from @Maxicripto is also relevant. Why are we here? Just because of decentralize-trustless environment. Where law of code works not trust. In the Hacken platform we have to trust the negotiation servers and at the end humans. So first they have to be decentralize one way or another. But in my opinion it is technically impossible for a code to negotiate between real parties in the current scenario. So at least information should be encrypted and/or in a vault until client (if code is private) or client and public (if code is public) is satisfied. But my above question is still valid.
