""The Giftz™ Network Community will have access to a trading platform within its ecosystem (without Exchanges). At the moment, most if not all trading platforms for virtual currencies are based on the operations of exchanges. Exchanges serve an important function, but are not without problems. The Giftz™ Network will implement a completely different and innovative approach to trading tokens that is based on auction technology. The proposed solution has two major characteristics: (1) it solves most of the problems with current crypto currency systems, and (2) it is compatible with current systems, i.e. it does not require any modifications. Our auction platform will make The Giftz™ Network a true crypto-community.""

Starting NOW,"   Hey there. Would love to explain what we're doing here. The Giftz Team is developing a Do-It-Yourself (FREE) Loyalty Rewards Program for small to mid-sized merchants (just pay for points) and a managed Black Coin Program solution for its enterprise clients. With either program, consumers can collect tokens in stores, apps, games, websites and more via a rewards e-Wallet (Waulit). With value now in our www.waulit.com app. Shoppers have fun earning Rewards Tokens and blockchain makes Loyalty secure.  Giftz can help get liability off balance sheets around the world by distributing physical tokenized points to customers who receive the asset in their private wallet.  Giftz opens up a network of new customers to merchants, without the huge overhead costs associated with traditional programs.  Participating Merchants give away tiered tokens; ITC Silver or Gold (or their own branded ITC) to reward their customers for engagement. Enterprise Black Coin Program clients will have the option to give away the public token; ITC Black as well as Gold & Silver.  Consumers collect their ITC in a digital Waulit and redeem to their Value-Based Loyalty Card at Point Of Sale; Mobile or Plastic.  DURING THE Giftx token sale those who buy 3 BTC or 50 ETH or more worth of itCoin Black will pre-qualify* for our High-NetWorth, Black Giftz Card. Available until token sale ends. *Rules & regulations apply.  You can learn more on our website: https://www.giftz.io/ Do Note: The token sale has started and will last until March 22nd 2018. See our website for more details.  ",False
