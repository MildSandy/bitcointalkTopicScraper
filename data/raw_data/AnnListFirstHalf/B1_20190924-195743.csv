As of last ICO news look great, we must admit the campaign goes well so far. 680 483 B1 tokens have been sold so far!  As we said before, our customers' and investors' needs are our priority, and we will do anything to meet them. In order to provide our investors with a sense of certainty and confidence, we decided to set a soft cap for our fundraising campaign. It will be 2,000,000 B1 tokens, amounting for US $1,000,000. This is a sum that guarantees our foothold on the market. We are already 1/3 done with the goal in the first days of the ICO. And nothing is looking like it can stop our project from achieving success! Especially with the support of  our rapidly growing community. Thank you all for everything! Let's write this page in history together!  Please note that if we do not reach the planned target of 2,000,000 B1 tokens, all the investments will be returned to the investors at the end of the campaign. However, it does not mean the work on the project will slow down at all!  With that being said, we will continue our work on the project despite any results of the ICO. We have stated this before, and we stand by our word. BeOne platform is too important to simply give up on it.  Stay in tune with the campaign!

To celebrate this milestone in the history of the company, the team has decided to offer 84 hours of bonuses for early bird investors. The month-long crowdsale is launching on September 7, 2017. It is a big step for the ambitious project, aimed at revolutionizing the industry of online education.  Compared with other businesses, this area seems to be uncrowded, there are not so many projects, with the exception of a few established players. In essence, the platform embarks on a path paved by big whales such as Coursera and Udemy, in an attempt to take their best features, enhance them, and bring in something new. What really sets it apart, is a decentralized structure, with all its entailing implications. Without trying to sound pompous, if we think of it for a while, BeOne is arguably the first online education project with a distributed ledger base. Time will show how this goes in practice, but for now, BeOne seems to have a number of attractive features for its users.  The full article: https://coinidol.com/beone-ico/",False

By each and every day, the project grows stronger, more reliable and promising. Our goal â to become one of the worldâs leading online education platforms â is getting closer.  Nevertheless, now is the moment we let you know of important news concerning the upcoming fundraising campaign.  By popular request among members of our community we decided to include WAVES cryptocurrency as an option for B1 tokens purchase. Till recently our payment processing partner, CoinPayments, has not supported this coin. Since WAVES support has been accepted now, we have to make sure it works successfully for monetary operations.  To ensure that the campaign will go smoothly and without any accidents, we are making enhancements into the security system. We are arranging everything within our grasp to increase stability of the server by locking down any vulnerabilities. Our priority is to be confident our future investors will never have to worry about security issues or safety of their funds. At the moment we are running a series of tests on our server and payment system mechanisms.  Furthermore, as we promised to unveil the Alpha version of the platform right after the ICO ends, we want to verify its readiness for open testing. It has to perform well for the sake of our professional reputation.  As a result, we shift our key dates roughly 9 days forward. Now the schedule looks like this:  ICO STARTS: September 7, 2017, at 12:00 MSK (UTC +3:00). ICO ENDS: October 7, 2017, at 23:59 MSK (UTC +3:00). ALPHA OPEN TESTING STARTS: October 9, 2017. The exact time to be confirmed later.  THE DATES ARE FINAL. WE GUARANTEE NO MORE FOLLOWING POSTPONEMENTS OR DELAYS.  To compensate for the delay we decided to come up with something special for our future investors. The period of 50% off discount for tokens purchase is to be extended from 3 hours to 12 hours.  It is hard to be a team of perfectionists. However, some tough decisions are to be made for the better product and better delivery. We try our best to make sure we meet your expectations by 100%!  Hope you understand and thank you so much for the patience.  Follow our news! We have prepared some exciting things to be shown very soon so you will not be bored in the meantime before the start of ICO.  So, stay tuned! Best regards, BeOne Team",False

If I understood the whitepaper right, 1. B1 will be used to buy credits / products on your site - if there are only 10M in circulation, how do you plan to scale? Considering that Udemy & Coursera both have 15-20M users. Users could take multiple courses, meaning you will need more tokens?  If so, wont the value reduce/ will it be pegged at a constant?  2. Most of your competitors have a competitive advantage - tie up with Universities. Which is value for a student as the courses are validated/approved and hence credible + there is a clear business case. I dont see anything on this front; What are your plans for signups and who from the team is responsible for it/has previous experience in this industry?   3. your team has no experience in the education field and if they do, I dont see that on the site/paper. Can you rope-in  some advisors/supporters from the industry?  Thanks",False

Only 10,000,000 B1 tokens to be issued totally; this number is not a subject to change. However it does not affect scalability in any way. If demand rises, the price for a coin goes up. For instance, every one knows the maximum number of bitcoins is 21,000,000, and the market is thriving.                        While creating a course or preparing a consultation, an instructor sets a price in US dollars, which automatically converts to B1.                         We have close connections with high-profile instructors who give us advices and feedback on a regular basis how to improve our project. Even though our core team don't have educational experience, we are interested in the subject and we believe in our product wholeheartedly. Therefore we are ready for new challenges. We plan to use a part of funds from the ICO to attract top specialists from different areas to help us with the platform development and functioning.                         We are in the stage of negotiations with prominent people from the academic world. Establishing partnerships with the universities is our next step after the project gets some credibility on the market.",False

I am professionally from publishing industry print and online both.  On page 4 of Whitepaper you have raised many problems regarding current scenario. I want you to elaborate some of them.  1. Lack of personal contact to teachers and fellow students How do you improve this? It is still going to be online one way or another.  2. Publishing a course is costly and 3. Language barrier. How (and How much) do you publish course at very low price with respect to the market? There are 100s of tools and softwares to publish the course. How is your platform better and cheap? About language barrier: it is always an expensive affair. How do you bring down the price?  4. Courses are low quality No. This is not a correct premise. Courses are not low quality. Demand of high quality courses is low. Do you think about it? I guessâno.  5. Cutting-edge tools to create courses. So. I assume that I will not have any problem in typesetting STM (scientific, technical and medical) and accounts courses. Beware to commit on this! Do you have special symbols support? Do you have different dictionaries (medical, engineering etc) support on you platform? What about typesetting of mathematical equations, chemical reactions and basic diagram designing. How do you combat all this on your platform? It is not an easy task.  You said, ""This will reduce the time needed to prepare educational materials."" You are committing on an IMPOSSIBLE task with respect to current tools available in the market. You can make the course preparation easy, very easy, too much easy but cannot reduce the time for all subjects on a single platform. You are going to challenge Adobe, Corel etc.  I can generate a mock test software from raw text digital files with 2000 question-answers (10 sets of 200) with solutions (i.e. multiple choice quesitons) on a stand-alone CD in 2 days most, single-handedly. And for your information I'm just nothing.  What I find out is: you are connect the publishing industry with the blockchain which itself is a good try and I hope for a good platform for users.

Of course, there is little to no sense to expect the same experience as in reality. At least for now it is impossible due to the limits of current state of science and technology. With that being said, we now live in a digital era and people are quickly adapting to it. For instance, people suffering from social anxiety feel more comfortable to communicate online than in real life. And comfort of our users is our major concern. We try our best to make the edge between students and tutors to be as transparent as possible. Moreover, every student has all the means to find like-minded people in the groups of interest, created for sharing thoughts, engaging into discussions, and quite possibly making friends! 2. As we have stated several occasions before, use of blockchain helped us significantly reduce commission size. Conventional methods (i.e. plastic cards) quite often have way higher commission per transaction. Please name one of the online education platforms based on blockchain. What is their number at the moment? Right, zero. We offer the lowest commission per transaction for our instructors on the market. 3. As for the language barrier, if you carefully read our white paper, you noticed that a considerable chunk of the funds goes to instructorsâ sector. That means we want to expand our base of instructors from different countries and of diverse cultures to the possible maximum. While looking for the right candidate, we donât pay attention solely to professional knowledge but also language skills are very important to us. 4. Regarding your statement that demand for high quality courses is low, we strongly disagree with you on that one. If demand for a product is low, then the product simply failed to find common ground with the target audience. If we are to draw an analogy here, iPhone was the most high-quality mobile device for quite a long period of time, and subsequently has become the most popular one on the planet, despite its high price. 5. Now, letâs talk about the âcutting edge tools to create contentâ. Have you ever used similar tools on other platforms, like Udemy, etc.? If yes, then you know their benefits. They really help with creating a course and save time for the author. They help with designing a visual appearance of courses, with making diagrams and charts, and so on. As for our turn, we try to enhance those tools and thus offer our own modified version of them. Each day we try new features, however you cannot expect all of them in one platform immediately. Some things may be added later, some, realistically speaking, may never.  By the way, your constructional way of thinking has prompted us about something. We would like to offer you to become one of the first testers of the Alpha version of the platform which is to be unveiled later. We are surely convinced that your recommendations will enhance our product. If you are interested, please let us know!",False

My only concern is generation of course material which can be easy but not less time consuming for ALL subjects especially STM and accounts subjects. About your analogy of iPhone, I disagree, because apple by their marketing make people aware (or say educate) about quality and design they offer. But in publishing (or in education in whole) industry there is no one (coursera, udemy etc) comes up with comprehensive educational subject for students. They (coursera, udemy etc.) are indeed good but they have very-very few courses with respect to offline (brick or mortar universities and colleges) courses or subjects.

Our tools allow implementation of graphs, charts, formulas, etc. However, they are not perfect yet. We want to optimize the publishing process but we realize that in reality they will not be ideal. That is why we need to work really hard with instructors and testers during the open testing period to polish the rough edges. If we come up with a solution to save time for publishing complex subjects by even 10%, it will be already a significant success.

If I understood the whitepaper right, 1. B1 will be used to buy credits / products on your site - if there are only 10M in circulation, how do you plan to scale? Considering that Udemy & Coursera both have 15-20M users. Users could take multiple courses, meaning you will need more tokens?  If so, wont the value reduce/ will it be pegged at a constant?  2. Most of your competitors have a competitive advantage - tie up with Universities. Which is value for a student as the courses are validated/approved and hence credible + there is a clear business case. I dont see anything on this front; What are your plans for signups and who from the team is responsible for it/has previous experience in this industry?   3. your team has no experience in the education field and if they do, I dont see that on the site/paper. Can you rope-in  some advisors/supporters from the industry?  Hope it helps! Thanks",False

I'm an American that taught English in China in 2010.  There are now websites that connect native English speakers with students in China for 1-on-1 tutoring.  The system rewards teachers for being effective at their job because they can build a book of business among return students.    When I was an English teacher in China I had very little experience teaching but the school I worked at provided me a book in advance to prepare lesson plans.  It wasn't easy to prepare lesson plans from the book alone because it was terrible.  It took a lot of time for me to tweak the materials and become what I thought was an effective instructor.  I think the Chinese market could be huge for BeOne but how do you ensure the students receive competent tutoring?  Will you: Conduct some kind of competency exam whereas the teacher must demonstrate they can effectively tutor students Provide materials and a lesson plan to the tutors Provide materials to the tutor and let them devise their own lesson plan Provide no materials to the tutor and let the ""free market"" run its course  Or perhaps a combination of the above?",False
