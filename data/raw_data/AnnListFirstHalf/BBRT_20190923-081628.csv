Therefore, it creates a gap where independent businesses suffer to start and manage the small-medium business. Funding shows interest in financial and tech institutions, but other industries are not showing interested. As a result, theses lead to decrease from Small to medium enterprises which cover all the important sectors in it.  Blockbank will allow global access to assets-backed low-cost commercial loans in FIAT currency to those countries under developing and developed countries.  All this will help in closing the funding gap and encourages SMEs to flourish across all the sectors.

Blockbank will be listing BBRT on LATOKEN from 29th November, starting at $4 a token.  The move to list on the rapidly growing crypto exchange comes in the wake of Blockbank’s smash hit success at their ICO - which closed having sold a whopping £12.83 million worth of tokens. Offering affordable commercial loans on a global-scale, Blockbank are leveraging blockchain technology to provide accessible funding to those who need it around the world. Having already built their own exchange (Blockbank Exchange) to trade their token (and others), Blockbank are now scouting to join other exchanges, emerging within those communities to provide new funding opportunities through BBRT.  LATOKEN – with a $30-45m daily turnover and over 80,000 registered users - is a dynamic first start for BBRT listings. With over 180 crypto pairs for trading, LATOKEN provides diverse interactions that enable onboarding of BBRT to snowball.  With the build of their commercial loan platform complete, Blockbank’s launch on LATOKEN comes at a great time for BBRT buyers. With the platform fully-functional already,Blockbank have closed £40m in commercial loans in the one month since the company launch in late October. With a £12.8 million success from the ICO and a completed bank acquisition under their belts, Blockbank are already becoming keen favourites within the banking industry globally and are showing sure signs of promise. AdamCuffe, co-founder and CEO of Blockbank, sees this as just the beginning, saying:  ‘Our main goal is to provide accessible funding to close the poverty gap on a global scale. We’ve already built the platform and showed it can work, so now we’re asking ourselves how we reach as many people as we can, to truly disrupt the banking industry and transform economies.’  With this in mind, Blockbank’s leap forward to join LATOKENS only serves as a further example of the dynamic ways in which Blockbank are seeking to engage their audience, disrupt the banking industry, and redistribute funding to close that funding gap – helping businesses thrive worldwide.  BBRT launches for $4 token on LATOKEN on 29th November 2018. Don’t miss out register using this link to trade BBRT.  Registration",False

This evening we met at a dinner exclusively for the keynote speakers and sponsors of the GCC Financial Forum which was organised by the EDB and Euromoney Instituition based in london. Amongst the key note speakers which included Lord Mervyn King, and Dr  Mohamed Aly El-Erian  there were senior  figures from the Bahrain Central Bank and the Bahrain Financial  Ministry Office, and senior bankers and financial innovators. We spoke about how we will be moving our license application forward and what we will be able to offer the region as a next gen commercial funding platform, and how Bahrain can support our project.  The Significance of Bahrain to block bank.  Bahrain has a strong history and reputation as a key financial centre in the Gulf. The country itself is going through a  transition which is being driven by Fintech Innovation. As some of you may know we were invited to the Capital Club here in November by our advisor Angela Morrison. That was where we met with David Parker The Executive Director of Financial Services Development on the EDB. David and his team have invited us to join the EDB and incubate the Banking entity we will be registering in Bahrain.   What does this mean?  Well this truly is a great opportunity for us as we have been invited to a EDB accelerator program overseen by C5 Accelerate (http://www.c5accelerate.com/.) C5 Accelerate is a London, Washington D.C., and Bahrain based technology investment firm. Its mission is to accelerate best-of-breed start-ups to meet the growth opportunity being created by the geographic expansion of AWS, the world’s leading cloud computing platform.The support on offer with C5 will be increbily valuable to our projects development and help secure a solid foundation on which to build in this region.  How will this benefit Block Bank and our community?  The approach from the regulators and the EDB mean that Block Bank will get a direct line of contact with the central bank of Bahrain as well as infrastructure support, business development expertise, office space and  a place in the Bahrain Fintech Sand box.  I have spoke before about how we anticipate growth in the Gulf region which is being supported by programs and regulatory changes.  This kind of growth is what will create funding opportunities for BlockBank and its users.  Tomorrow we are attending the second leg of the conference and in the evening  have been invited to the fintech innovation launch event. We will also be speaking directly with the Governor of the Central Bank and the Finance Minister of Bahrain about how best to structure our third banking license application.  I will provide another update tomorrow evening as to how we are progressing on this trip.  Thanks again for all your support and get in touch if you have any questions.  http://telegra.ph/Block-Bank-Community-update-03-13",False
