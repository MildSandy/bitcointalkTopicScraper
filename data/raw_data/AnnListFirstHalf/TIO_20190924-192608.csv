Tio Guides is actively looking for an exchange to be our flag bearing major currency exchange point.        At this point we are only listed on EtherDelta and have not been listed on any other exchanges. We have written some exchanges but we have not concluded with anyone yet. We were about to start a massive promotion about our new super cheap  Domain Registration to domainers and webhosting forums before the Ethereum network pushed up their gas fees to prices that would have been counter productive to any promotional campaign.        All we are looking for at this point is an exchange that we can point our future clients to buy TIO from and fund their wallet.       Here is what we promise to bring to the table.    - We are passionate about our project. We will continue doing this until it works out. We are here as company that will not stop trying until we take our position on the global stage.    - We are not just a token, our project has real life applications. While we may not be very attractive right now to the cryptocurrency community (Because we are not ""Quantum Physics""etc) , once we capture the attention of the markets that we intemd to capture, that is a growth potential that will be felt massively through on the exchanges that we are on.   - We are doing our own promotion. Because our platform(s) will be used by most likely people who don't invest in cryptocurrency, we have to promote our products/services to them, and wherever we promote our services we will be mentioning your exchange and asking them to buy TIO on your Exchange and that is free promotion for you. So far we have spent over $40,000 in promotional campaigns and we are only just starting because the biggest campaigns will be once our project is up and running.   - We are a funded company Yes we are funded with restrictions. Our expenses have to be justified and without large risk. So paying $50 to $100k to list on an Exchange of whom those who recently listed are doing less $1,000 a day is an absolute risk that we can not justify taking, so if you require that amount of money for a listing and those who recently listed on your exchange are doing poorly, then we simply can not take that risk.  - We are yet to be listed on coinmarketcap The fact that we are yet to be listed on coinmarketcap at this point is a gifr and a curse. With the backing of a good exchange, right after listng on CMC, we can grow very quickly to over $1 and more. That will bring attention/users to any exchanges that we are on.  - We know the value of money We are building real structures and facilities in the real world and we understand the value of money. Again what this means is we can not just throw around money without justifiable reason, $50k is a good fraction of the total amount of money we need to furnish the current hotel we're building.      This is an open request and we are open to hearing directly from the exchanges not Agents please.     Thank you everyone!",False

The reason is because we suffered an attemped hack on our platforms wallet. Those who may not know, our main mission here is to build a platform for tourist, tour guides and tour operators to easily interconnect and book hotels/tours and other services using TIO.    What this means is that the safety of our online wallet is extremely important to avoid losses when people start funding their wallet and keeping their money on our platform. We have hired some top internet engineers to help us put this together correctly. They are currently working on it, if we think that a completion of a hackproof safe wallet will take much longer, we will launch the platform without the wallet for now, just so that you can be able to see what it looks like, and log in and play around with it. Please give some more to make that decision.    But in all honesty, most people on here care more about profit than using a new platform, regardless of how great it is, and since there will be very minimal demand on our platform for sometime until we grow our userbase, the launch of our platform would have had nothing to do with the value/demand of our tokens. I guess this is the reason why many companyies even with working products are doing badly.    In addition to our Tour Guides Platform, Our Hotels being built, and all the other projects which we have in the works, we have new project which will instantly build demand pressure on our currency.

I read anytime everything before i invest in a new Project or I try it. Sometimes it is not easy but i'm happy if a Dev gaves me a long nice answer like you.      ""how should this be if you are already in the TOP 20 with 1 ether investment?"" I am not sure what you mean by this question.  I was meaning that i was able to buy so much TIO for under 1 ETH at this time and now i'm one of the Top 10 Holders.  The next point is that we are loosing Holders from 349 down to 331 and why did we have so less holders?  Perhaps i can't use Google Maps right but i can't find a house at this adress > 134/20 Nawamin Road soi 24, Bangkok  Is there an older website from Tio Tours? How has Tio worked since 2015 without a website?  And why is the Reddit Thread closed?  Has the Team Linkidn Profiles?  And how can i partizipate in your bounty and the other campaigns if i have only 60 Twitter Followers and no Facebook?  I hope my questions are not so hard.  and if the rest will come up soon i'm sure we will have a great time together!",False

However our prices are still very cheap, as we are yet to be listed on any other centralized exchanges and on coinmarketcap, so anybody still trying to get in early still has a chance. A lot of the people who hold TIO are holders of very small amounts. so when they put in on the Exchange, I'm pretty sure they put the whole thing in. there's 97k+ in the exchange, thats where alot of the holders are.    TIO has been in the works since 2015, means we have been putting together the company since 2015. First website is that which you currently see, And it was intended to be a promotional website for the token sale. So our first real website, as TIO tours, open for business will be in three days, 25th November. Hannah wanted to have people who she had worked with in the past and trusted on the team, so that took a while to get some of the team members to leave previous engagements to do this full time. The entire members of the team have known ourselves for quite some time now.    Some of the team members have linkedin, some don't. Linkedin is not a very popular platform in Germany and Thailand, and most Germans are uncomfortable with having public internet profiles, you are german yourself I'm sure you understand that. Go through Hannah's Linkedin Profile and you can see the rest of us as her connections.   I don't think google map works that way in Thailand, not unless if it's an address is pinned on google map, most definitely not for an address in Nawamin. Point is can you find Nawamin Road, Soi 24? Soi Means small Street in Thai. If you're at Nawamin Soi, all that is left is to count the house numbers from there. Again send us an email and we'll give you a hand drawn map, to save you the headache of counting house numbers when you're in the Soi.    The reddit thread was basically opened for us to meet the listing requirements for HitBTC, it's obviously not being used and it's not a proper subreddit. We have to create a new one.     You can participate in the bounty.    Have a good day snuggles!",False

Our biggest goal here is to make TIO a currency that will become a neccessity to everyday people, not just cryptocurrency users.   Listing on big exchanges are not good enough, even on a big exchange after a while if your token/currency is not a necessity it will become forgotten in this quick changing cryptocurrency environment.   Obviously any cryptocurrency that is not working towards mass adoption, is most likely just here to collect ICO money or waste time.    ...Just give us a bit more time, we will make the special announcement.       Beyond the special announcement, we have some other news.     1. We posted some more shirts, as promised. To those, whose addresses are correct in the bounty form. Siggi should be announcing those tomorrow Asian time.     1b. We are launching a google campaign to promote some the videos which we have on youtube.     2. If you have been paying attention, we promised some viral videos,4 weeks ago. It's read for release. We only just put them up on twitter and fb after making the special announcement, in order not to confuse anyone.    3. In September, we announced that we were working on a partnership with the World Federation of Tour Guides Association, (WFTGA), we are proud that to tell you guys that, it's still on the table, the WFTGA is quite slow with responses, because it's a global non profit organization, with so many top bosses who have to make decisions, but we are 80% sure that we will have an exclusive deal which will support the Tio Tour Guides Brand. WFTGA is backed by the EU.  4. And finally for those of who are excited about making some profit right now, coinmarketcap is supposed to list us in 48hours. That should give some you guys a quick turnover.     All of thses are just updates, None of the above is the special announcement we are about to make.  Just give us a bit more time, we are perfecting and finalizing our presentation.    Thank you guys.                       ",False

We've spent so many days and put in a lot of effort to try to get to them and it's honestly becoming more or less of a distraction, if they get to make their own rules and pick their own tokens based on how they feel, and also don't have maybe a listing fee for those who are not up to their requesting requirements, then their is really nothing we can do about it, we can't force them to list us. All we can do is wait as they have said. And the last thing we are going to do is start fake buying our tokens to create a fake volume so that the tokens can be listed on coinmarketcap.

If you took $ 1.5 million in the ICO, but only $ 100k through official ICO sales, how many tokens were sold in total, and how many are frozen in what contracts for how long? What is the address of the offices in Hong Kong and Thailand, is it possible for me to come over there? If you have sold 1.5 million tokens to more than 2000 people participating in the ICO, why are there currently only 346 holders including the whole Bounty Hunters?  Sorry but if i can, i will ask  ",False

I'm afraid the folks at coinmarketcap prefer being somewhat unreachable, you can only contact them through their request form on their site, their bitcointalk contact and their facebook.     The process of preventing anyone from being a whale with us was taken care of during the ICO. No one has that much token to create a possible dump in our system. We have no private unknown whale traders.      ""how should this be if you are already in the TOP 20 with 1 ether investment?"" I am not sure what you mean by this question.     You have your information mixed up. 1.5 million tokens was sold. After recalculating, we dropped the value of ur ICO to only 586 ETH, and $103,000 was raised.      Only 450,000 tokens will be available for trading until november next year. This is because some of the companies /friends/partners/people who bought the largest amount of our tokens have chosen let them be for now for the project to gain grounds.     Yes our office is on 134/20 Nawamin Road soi 24, Bangkok. If you are planning to visit us please book an appointment first. send us an email to contact@tiotourguides.com      We will be moving to a more savy office on Sathorn road,Bangkok in January, and we are excited to show the pictures to our community here once the move is done.      Our first TIO hotel is currently being constructed and its right next to the famous Wat paryar surin in Bangkok, you can't miss it, there is a big contruction going on there, thats us. And holders of TIO token will be able walk-in and pay with TIO next year, this is one of the many TIO hotels that are being planned     In hong kong our registered address is at Miramar Towers, on Nathan Road, Kowloon. Tsim Sha Tsui.     We are currently setting up a Warehouse/Repackaging factory in Nanchang, China in preparation for our entrance into tech gadgets.     If you really want to meet us in person, we are organising two different events in the coming months this year and next.     1. We are excited to meet some of the members of our community in person, we will be having a lottery draw in late december for our bounty particpants, that event will also be an end of year party, we are going to give out official information on that here once we are settled with the details.     2. We are planning on hosting a cryptocurrency expo in thailand before the middle next year to sensitize the Thai public about the importance, advantanges and disadvantages of cryptocurrency. That would be a good place for companies looking to promote their crypto product to come in and participate. And also a good place to meet and greet us.     It's good to know that I'm talking to someone who reads what we are writing. Most people on bitcointalk don't, obviously because there's way too much going on here.     If you have any more questions please feel free to ask.                        ",False

The Green Dollar Sign after your name means you are in our rewards list, will explain on that a little further in a bit.     Here is how the stakes were calculated ( for those who never asked the rules behind the bounty)     So you are limited to 2 activites each a week. Means 4 activity max, and we have 7 weeks. Like and Tweet/Post, Share/retweet.    So if you liked and shared at least 2 times a week you would have full four activities per week which means 28 activities (act) The entire campaign to the 25th of septmber.      Those who got the maximum full activites for the week that they started from, were given an extra 50 Tio Bonus.       For example if you started from week 1, your maximum activity is 28, if you started on week 2 max is 24, week 3 max is 20, week 4 max 16, week 5 max is 12, week 6 max is 8. No bonus was given for the final week.      If you had more than one account, the accounts with lower activities were deleted and the account with the highest activity was listed.        Again guys, you can only have 1 facebook and 1 twitter account. Anything else is a duplicate. If we didnt find out your duplicated account, please honestly let us know and we'll take it out.             How much you get then depends on how many friends you have on your twitter or facebook.         and extra bonus was given to those who have been obviously visible on our facebook, twitter  and on the threads...and those are the people in our rewards list.     Your stakes are calculated from the week you started, and also when you shared/retweeted the post/tweet.    If you retweet a post thats says ICO ends in 24 hours after 2 days, then it can not be counted for you, as your retweeting is irrelevant.                                                   ABOUT OUR REWARDS PROGRAM    Bitcointalk is majorly filled with finance companies, and it's easy to forget that we are an internet travel technology company.  As we progress further into our project, we want to know those who are on board with us and also reward them and grow financially with, we are a small company with big dreams and community means everything to us.    Our rewards program is a way of saying thank you, and identifying those who we know are in our inner circle.    If you find your name in our rewards program it means that your opinion really matters to us, everybody's opinion matters but your's is very personal to us.    Those who's names appear in our rewards program, are some of the most noticeable people in our project, and on all our social media's, in the comment sections of our post/tweets,they  in the other language threads, some of them are bounty hunters who also invested thier money in this project. We welcome anyone else who would like to see their name in our rewards list to get on board, get active, be helpful on the threads,  and you'll see the green sign  after a while.   Here is what you stand to benefit by being on our rewards,   1. More Tio Bonus Tokens. (We'll occassionally, gift bonus tokens to members of our rewards program)       2. Whatever items we are giving away, Those on our rewards program will be the first to get it, before we start giving to others. For examples, The Technogical items for travel that we are currently manufacturing, (we are not talking about them yet here because of copy cats.) Members on our rewards list, will be first to get and test these items.  3. A possiblity to get free flights/flier miles that you can travel with, free flight upgrades, extra discounts on hotel stays, or free hotel stays, discounts on tour tickets, or outright free tours Extra Discounts when using our platform.  4. When hiring for full or part time job, we'll pay attention to those on our rewards list.  5. There is a possibily to get Tio Loans from us. Very rarely but yes, possible.  6. Allowed access to events that we could be hosting or sponsoring around your city in the future    more will be added to the list as we go on.  What we hope is that as a member of our rewards list,                                                      NEW PRICE CONTROL POLICY  As the crypto community becomes more and more crowded, we believe most crypto traders will start to pay attention to the difference between a Cryptocurrency/token with a community and Company with a cryptocurrency and a community. There is a huge difference between the two - Anybody can create a cryptocurrency/token and list on an exchange and then the survival on that cryptocurrency is based on luck.    While to create a cryptocurrency that will stand the test of time and become relevant requires a serious company, dedication, planning, sacrificies.     Here is what we are trying to say...A lot of you bounty hunters are already collecting all kinds of tokens/cryptocurrencies right? but what you are really looking for is a token that has or will have a good value right?    For any cryptocurrency to have a good value, their has to be price control (economic policies). We talked about price control so many times in our whitepaper, price control is a key part of this project.    For any currency to have a high value, their has to be demand or scarcity. Since this is a new project, demand is what we do not have yet, but what we can create for now is scarcity.    We want Tio to be trading above USD$1 on a minimum and we are looking at $5 to $10 down the line on good days.[/b]       In order to acheive this, we have decided on the following,    This bounty rule does not apply to those who bought the tokens during the ICO or from the exchange. Those who bought the tokens have the right to buy or sell the tokens at will.    This is a very temporary price control, once the demand from our platform becomes strong enough to carry large supply of our tokens, we will remove all restrictions and every bounty member can then trade as much as they want. We will move quickly with the platform and building customer base to drive demand for our services and we believe a lot of you guys will be glad that kept your Tio Tokens.    We will be paying out only half of all bounty payments worth more than 200 Tio, Every monthly payment cycle.  For the half that is given to you, we expect that you keep half (of the half) of the tokens in your wallet at all time in order to continue to receive payment from our bounty. Those who dump their entire half of the tokens that was paid out on the market will be removed from the bounty program,and the balance of the tokens owed will be paid once the price control is removed.",False

Here is how the stakes were calculated ( for those who never asked the rules behind the bounty)     So you are limited to 2 activites each a week. Means 4 activity max, and we have 7 weeks. Like and Tweet/Post, Share/retweet.    So if you liked and shared at least 2 times a week you would have full four activities per week which means 28 activities (act) The entire campaign to the 25th of septmber.      Those who got the maximum full activites for the week that they started from, were given an extra 50 Tio Bonus.       For example if you started from week 1, your maximum activity is 28, if you started on week 2 max is 24, week 3 max is 20, week 4 max 16, week 5 max is 12, week 6 max is 8. No bonus was given for the final week.      If you had more than one account, the accounts with lower activities were deleted and the account with the highest activity was listed.        Again guys, you can only have 1 facebook and 1 twitter account. Anything else is a duplicate. If we didnt find out your duplicated account, please honestly let us know and we'll take it out.             How much you get then depends on how many friends you have on your twitter or facebook.         and extra bonus was given to those who have been obviously visible on our facebook, twitter  and on the threads...and those are the people in our rewards list.     Your stakes are calculated from the week you started, and also when you shared/retweeted the post/tweet.    If you retweet a post thats says ICO ends in 24 hours after 2 days, then it can not be counted for you, as your retweeting is irrelevant.                                                   ABOUT OUR REWARDS PROGRAM    Bitcointalk is majorly filled with finance companies, and it's easy to forget that we are an internet travel technology company.  As we progress further into our project, we want to know those who are on board with us and also reward them and grow financially with, we are a small company with big dreams and community means everything to us.    Our rewards program is a way of saying thank you, and identifying those who we know are in our inner circle.    If you find your name in our rewards program it means that your opinion really matters to us, everybody's opinion matters but your's is very personal to us.    Those who's names appear in our rewards program, are some of the most noticeable people in our project, and on all our social media's, in the comment sections of our post/tweets,they  in the other language threads, some of them are bounty hunters who also invested thier money in this project. We welcome anyone else who would like to see their name in our rewards list to get on board, get active, be helpful on the threads,  and you'll see the green sign  after a while.   Here is what you stand to benefit by being on our rewards,   1. More Tio Bonus Tokens. (We'll occassionally, gift bonus tokens to members of our rewards program)       2. Whatever items we are giving away, Those on our rewards program will be the first to get it, before we start giving to others. For examples, The Technogical items for travel that we are currently manufacturing, (we are not talking about them yet here because of copy cats.) Members on our rewards list, will be first to get and test these items.  3. A possiblity to get free flights/flier miles that you can travel with, free flight upgrades, extra discounts on hotel stays, or free hotel stays, discounts on tour tickets, or outright free tours Extra Discounts when using our platform.  4. When hiring for full or part time job, we'll pay attention to those on our rewards list.  5. There is a possibily to get Tio Loans from us. Very rarely but yes, possible.  6. Allowed access to events that we could be hosting or sponsoring around your city in the future    more will be added to the list as we go on.  What we hope is that as a member of our rewards list,                                                      NEW PRICE CONTROL POLICY  As the crypto community becomes more and more crowded, we believe most crypto traders will start to pay attention to the difference between a Cryptocurrency/token with a community and Company with a cryptocurrency and a community. There is a huge difference between the two - Anybody can create a cryptocurrency/token and list on an exchange and then the survival on that cryptocurrency is based on luck.    While to create a cryptocurrency that will stand the test of time and become relevant requires a serious company, dedication, planning, sacrificies.     Here is what we are trying to say...A lot of you bounty hunters are already collecting all kinds of tokens/cryptocurrencies right? but what you are really looking for is a token that has or will have a good value right?    For any cryptocurrency to have a good value, their has to be price control (economic policies). We talked about price control so many times in our whitepaper, price control is a key part of this project.    For any currency to have a high value, their has to be demand or scarcity. Since this is a new project, demand is what we do not have yet, but what we can create for now is scarcity.    We want Tio to be trading above USD$1 on a minimum and we are looking at $5 to $10 down the line on good days.[/b]       In order to acheive this, we have decided on the following,    This bounty rule does not apply to those who bought the tokens during the ICO or from the exchange. Those who bought the tokens have the right to buy or sell the tokens at will.    This is a very temporary price control, once the demand from our platform becomes strong enough to carry large supply of our tokens, we will remove all restrictions and every bounty member can then trade as much as they want. We will move quickly with the platform and building customer base to drive demand for our services and we believe a lot of you guys will be glad that kept your Tio Tokens.    We will be paying out only half of all bounty payments worth more than 200 Tio, Every monthly payment cycle.  For the half that is given to you, we expect that you keep half (of the half) of the tokens in your wallet at all time in order to continue to receive payment from our bounty. Those who dump their entire half of the tokens that was paid out on the market will be removed from the bounty program,and the balance of the tokens owed will be paid once the price control is removed.",False

We not just heading to the exchange yet, Tokens will only start trading on the exchange Nov. 1st, but before then, we have to continue with our publicity exposure campaign. We need to have millions of people around the world hear the name Tio.     We have two Viral Videos to release any moment from now, we mean videos that will draw international attention, and rack up viral views. We are currently shooting them now. And we have atleast 7 more celebrity endorsements to pick up. We are hoping the viral videos will help us rack up some more followers on Twitter/Facebook and Youtube to meet our target.     And also we need 3 more articles, on Yahoo Finance, BBC and then Forbes.     Most importantly, we need to get our platform up and running make sure it's top ranked on google search, and prepare for official launch Nov 25th.      Coinmarketcap only list tokens that  are already being traded, so we can be listed only after we start trading. We are already about to announce bounty for different voting processes to get on the exchange, but we will hold off trading until november 1st.      The idea of hosting a party somewhere on a exotic place and have members of the Tio community attend sounds very tempting.  This would be more workable if we get our currency strong enough so that those holding very little amount of it can be able to book a flight and hotel on our platform and make it to the party.     hmmm...that's something to think about!",False

The higher the market value of the tokens turn out to be later on,  farther you'd be able to travel.      We are actually looking at $5 to $10 a token once things kick.          So prediction is an immediate $1 to $$2.5 dollars or more, right after we get to exchange, their is a possibilty for some to attempt to pump or dump the tokens or create a fud, no one really owns that much of th Tio tokens, so no one can really cause an effect in the market. Honestly, we can't judge anybody who choses to sell their tokens at $1 or $2 given the insane profit at that point, for those who bought from the ICO and given the unpredictability that comes with cryptos.      What we are going to do is continue our price control policy, we'll build a huge necessity/demand for Tio Tokens not from traders but from regular people who will need our products/services and however, we'll continue to keep scarcity.         So in the long run 6 months after we start trading, we expect our price to be in the double digits.

All adverts on our site can only be paid for with Tio tokens.    2. We are working on a partnership deal with the World Federation of Tour Guides Association to collect payments from prospective tour guides who would like to be certified by them. These payments have to be made using Tio.   3. We have 4 confirmed tour/travel aiding hi-tech gadgets which we will be producing in Large quantities (Tens of thousands), People can buy these products from stores/other vendors, but if they buy directly from us with Tio, they get a big discount.   4. Tio Tour Magazine and TV Channel (under Tio Entertainment) Again ads can only be bought on these portals using Tio tokens only.   * Under Tio Entertainment, the list of possible products is limitless, and all products paid for with tio comes with a bonus.   5. Our Lottery which for now is only open to bounty participants, will be a seasonal thing, and in the future, as the lottery becomes popular, people who would like to participate in the lottery without having to participate in the bounty, can simple just buy the tickets using Tio.     So there you go, we are looking to create a real world necessity for Tio Tokens, for people who may not be cryptocurrency traders, expect this list to increase as we proceed further down the lane.

Almost 3,000 Entries in all  bounty categories and in order to protect our tokens from being taken by fake/fraud entries, we had to manually review every like and share for all tweets/retweets since august.  That means we had to manually review over 1,000,000  activites (Tweets, likes shares, posts,comments, blogs on all our social media). Doing a manual review has saved us a large amount of tokens, if we had used bots as we planned to, a lot of the fake/fraud entries would most likely not have been found.     This has been a really hard work, every single member of our team has been involved in checking this and we had little sleep in the past four days, this has also slowed down our ability to do other aspects of our project. We take the bounty particpation very seriously, and we wanted to have this sorted out. Good news is we are almost done, we have finished reviewing participation on all campaigns but facebook, we hope to be done with the facebook reviews in the next 36 hours, we  will publicly list the spread sheets with the amount payable to each participant and start paying immediately afterwards. We are looking at paying every participant within the next 3 days. That would mean that we beat our own target of three weeks after ICO.     Looking forward, we are looking at smarter and efficient ways to continue our bounty campaign and make this process of data collection and reporting of work,much easier for everyone involved.     Thank you for asking and thank you for your understanding.    ",False

FYI alot of private companies bought some of the largest amount of our tokens. And they are deciding not even have these tokens released from the contract yet, they want it held back in the contract for the next year.    What that means is that the total supply of our token is now going to be 450,000 Tio tokens for almost year, after which it will be about 1.7million. So you're no longer looking at a token that will be trading for $1 but rather $5 or $10.

So we want to say a big congratulations to you guys. Some of you bought this tokens at $0.04 or $0.05. Profit margin is impressive!!!

Wouldnt be much longer, we are about to release the app for public testing.     To directly answer your question, it's tours like never before, all possible search options. And if the searched keyword is not in our system, we take it up and place it as a new possible search term.     So think of any possible range, we'll have it in there.

Take it easy mate!    Let's try to re-imagine a postive question out of your post. I guess you mean which exchanges are we going to be listed on?    HitBtc,   EtherDelta,   Yobit,   Novaexchange,   We've been working on Binance, we are not completely clear yet how the ICO ban in china will affect been listed on BNB now, still waiting for clarification.   Maybe Cryptopia if they reduce their current listing price from $40,000.   BXthailand   Bitcoin indonesia    The listing on all these exchanges will not be at the same time, we'll gradually get on these exchanges. We'll pick one or two to immediately list on, so that bounty participants who are in a hurry to get their tokens out can do so. Our core investors are with us because they believe in the idea that we stand for.      Let's leave you with a word of advice. Bitcoins and cryptocurrencies are still not mainstream yet. Some of todays Biggest Exchanges will be 3rd grade by the time Mainstream Companies starts to Jump on board. The best thing any company with a tokenized platform can do for itself is focus on the product, focus on the consumers, focus on building a brand. If you build customer loyalty, and create a genuine demand for your tokens. The exchange that you are listed on will not be important, because the demand that your platform creates will find your tokens regardless of where they are. And that is exactly what we are going to do.   With governments around the world starting to take a second look at cryptocurrencies and policies, it's fair to predict that most tokenized companies without a ""realworld"" necessity/demand for thier product/tokens will die off. As a travel/tour company we are a safer bet!       In the meantime, we have a lot of work to do, large number of marketing targets that are yet to be met. This ICO has been slightly a bit of a distraction, but obviously not for much longer.    Here's to hoping that we've enlightened you a little bit!   ",False

However, we will be compiling total accurate amount on our website once the ICO is done.    Don't expect the amount to be too much though.

We, as tourist have often less to say on how we would like to be guided while taken on a tour. I'm also asthmatic and therefor limited to certain kind of activities. There's no platform out there, that allows you to search for tours based on your personal needs or like you say, preferences.

But we want more, we want people to be able to walk in to any hotel or tour operating office and pay with your Tio tokens. For us to be able to pull this off, we have to be listed on a lot of exchanges of which Bitcoin indonesia could be one.       As an official Exchange/ Initial Exchange, Binance looks good to us.      If you pay with paypal, your money is automatically under escrow, you can request for the money to be refunded at anytime. For us paypal is a safer escrow than some of the other questionable options offered here in the cryptocommunity.       About why people were using paypal more, The question was already answered on our page 14.   Questions  Why are the Bonus tokens almost sold out even though there is no activity on the Ethereum account?  Because people are buying through Paypal and debit card.  Why is everybody buying through Paypal and debit card?  We pegged the ETH price for the entire ICO at 1 ETH to $310. The price of ETH has risen significantly higher since then, so buying at USD$rate through paypal seems more like a better deal for some.",False

You really wanted to go on a tour of all the IT universities in Paris, you want the tour to have a native english speaker and have not more than 5 participating tourists. So you google search it and our site comes up. On our site you see the tour guides and operators that are offering the same exact tour you are looking for, so you contact them.  They tell you their price and it's calculated in Tio. You look around and on the top of the site it says you can buy Tio directly with your debit or credit card. So you put in your debitcard information to buy tio and bingo it's succesful Now you have 100 Tio to pay for the tour you searched and found on our site and also have some left for next time you want to get another tour offered by the guides or operators on our site.

If you are asking us, we believe Yes, we will stand the test of time. Why?    1. Our business model will create huge demands for our token. Read some of our previous post on this very page to get an idea.   2. We will be putting a sell gate on how much can be sold per IP address per day for the first 90 days, and slowly increase the amount every 90 days until the sell gate is out. So this will not be a coin for anyone to massively dump on.  If that would discourage you from participating. That's ok...We only want those who believe in what we believe in to participate.  3.

This is about tour guides, tour operators, and tourists who want to use their services for tour purposes.   We are happy to address your concern, although you're quite off from what we're offering. With regards to what you have just said about countries having their own currency, it's actually a very possible and logical business plan for any company or token to have and/or aspire to. And even though Tio is not a Tourist coin, we will not rule out the possibility of us venturing outside the tours sector of global tourism.    So what is Tio about? We are creating a platform for anyone to find personalized tours or create theirs, Tio token will be used on our platform as a payment tool between the tour guides/operators who offer these personalized tours and the tourists who wish to participate in these tours.    Here's something closely connected to your initial comment above, We are getting ready to announce the first roughly 300 hotels/tour operators that will be accepting Tio as a payment tool.(Note this is not an official confirmation yet, an official confirmation will be announced appropriately).   If you had read our website or white paper, you would have seen, that our token will have a sell gate per day, which will be signed and contracted with the Exchanges that we list on. There is no way for any single person to dump the coin in large amount to disrupt the price.    We hope this explanation helped to give you an insight into what we are about!    ",False
