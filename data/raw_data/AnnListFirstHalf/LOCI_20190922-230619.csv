We are Loci, a search engine company focused on discovering novelty and indexing the world's inventions and ideas on a Blockchain! The global invention process is fundamentally flawed, which creates a chaotic and risky innovation landscape characterized by wasteful research and development spending. This process, convoluted and fraught with expense, inherently stifles progress. Legally protecting an idea is essential, but the patent process is difficult and expensive, and many inventors are forced to go straight to market or never follow through their invention. Globally, over $1 trillion is wasted in R&D spending each year because of outdated global intellectual property laws and processes. This wasted productivity accounts for nearly 80% of the global R&D budget. From patent attorneys, to inventors, to corporate analysts, there is a widespread need for the ability to quickly and comprehensively search the intellectual property landscape. Loci exists to solve that problem. Current tools for patent research are difficult to use, not precise enough in their search mechanisms, expensive, limited to outdated data, and do not deliver comprehensive results. Loci addresses these problems with a context based search tool from an expansive database that shows results in a simple and intuitive Venn diagram. By mapping the known, Loci can begin to fill in the “unknown,"" or in many cases, the “didn't realize it was known."" Loci analyzes the trends of research, how users find what they are looking for, and trains our patented machine learning process to continue the momentum of research. What Loci gets back is a comprehensive map of all known patents and relevant information. When its queries fail, this map helps reveal the expanses of the unknown and unexecuted ideas and inventions. Loci then applies this approach to look back at older technologies, and attempts to find trends into what might happen next.  Loci and its patented technologies are poised to change the way the world invents, and the value of an idea as a whole.    Loci, a company of 23 employees serving around 500 existing clients, invented, patented and launched the platform that is revolutionizing R&D. Loci's first patent, “System and Method for Fuzzy Concept Mapping, Voting Ontology Crowd Sourcing, and Technology Prediction,"" accessible from ( US9461876 B2), reconstructs the mechanisms by which ideas are discovered and attributed to owners. Loci's user platform, InnVenn, is a data aggregation source for search queries that allows users to recognize the location of novel inventions and ideas. This visualizes results in an interactive, user-modifiable, and a visually appealing Venn diagram of technologies, inventions, patents, ideas, and concepts. Loci's backend uses the data aggregating from InnVenn searches and refinements. The process is a patented proprietary tool built upon a unique combination of contextual searching, predictive analytics, machine learning, heuristics, Bayesian statistics, and user input. Under the current legal system, the idea discovery and patent process takes years. Loci can reduce that process to minutes. Using the blockchain, this system acts as immutable proof of intellectual property rights on a global scale. Once every past and present invention are on the blockchain, Loci will predict the interactions between every idea that exists or could exist. The gap between current technology and undiscovered connections is what Loci calls “whitespace."" Loci helps inventors discover this “whitespace"" and make the next big discovery  Loci will be launching a token sale on August 10, 2017, 00:00:00 UTC that will last until September 1, 2017, 00:00:00 UTC. We will be launching Loci Coins (LOCI) that has a fixed supply of 100 million tokens. The first public sale of LOCI Coins will be auctioned off at a rate of 100* Loci Coins (LOCI) to 1 Ether (ETH).  LOCI Coins are an integral part of the function of the Loci system. To access the full version of the InnVenn search engine, one must pay in LOCI Coins or fiat. In order to save and stake your claim to IP on the blockchain, you must do so using LOCI Coins. Every time a LOCI Coin is spent on our platform, it gets deposited to one of Loci's wallets and placed back on an exchange for purchase. These funds will be used to further expand the development of the platform and seed inventors to bring their IP to reality. Our Token Sale will be used to ramp up the development of the InnVenn front end and all of its back end needs - algorithms, natural language processing tools, clustering functionality, naming systems, blockchain integration, ideation securitization - and other aspects of the business including building out the cloud infrastructure and dev-ops teams, sales and marketing teams, investor relations team and its legal team.  Our White Paper is available at www.loci.io  If you have an idea you want to check it's novelty, use our contextual search engine to discover if you are the first person to think of it here: http://innvenn.com.  Feel free to ask us any questions and follow us on twitter @Loci_io  Best,  The Loci Team",False

Pre-sale token purchasers will receive a 10% discount on the initial sale price.  Individual tokens can be purchased for the equivalent of $2.25 USD in Bitcoin, Ether or any fiat currency through an accredited investor in the U.S. with a signed SAFT contract.  Loci.io is selling a total of 5 million utilitarian tokens, or $11,250,000 USD, that can be used only to access their already viable product, InnVenn.  With these tokens, Loci intends to substantiate the underlying value missing from most existing cryptocurrencies with a globally recognized asset, Intellectual Property.  For $249 a month, InnVenn drastically reduces the cost and time needed in patent searches for entrepreneurs who cannot afford to spend $15,000+ on attorney fees and typically are forced to either give up their ideas or riskily proceed without patent protection.  Patent attorneys and investors can use InnVenn to offer the highest quality understanding of the intellectual property landscape to their clients by providing real-time patent search and registration data.  Before it's crowd sale scheduled in October 2017, Loci will be working on integrating into the InnVenn platform a distributed database to further enhance the security and privacy of patent searches and existing patents.  The Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT), a legal instrument and open-source framework, is highly relevant and important to this and other token sales because it aims to make the risks that come with early-stage investment opportunities clear to those individuals that purchase tokens or coins as part of an ICO (Initial Coin Offering).  Created by Cooley LLP, designed by Protocol Labs, and inspired by Y Combinator’s SAFE, the SAFT also serves to address the fact that federal securities laws now apply to the sale of virtual coins or tokens, according to a recent statement released by the SEC.
