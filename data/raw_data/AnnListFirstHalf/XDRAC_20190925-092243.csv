Bounty question:  You ask to use this beautiful Gaudi Drac logo as image profile. And to include a html code signature. Did you notice we, Jr. Members, can't use image profile? (Just Jr. Members registered before 2015). Is it necesary? Because if it is, we are automaticaly excluded.  About the signature, I understant that we should paste the text in each message we post, as signature, isn't it? Because there is a limitation up to 42 char, so we can't include it in the profile signature.  Thanks.  PD: If necesary, I will send this as PM to  Gothorum, as manager of this, but a public answer may also help others with the same questions, I thought.
