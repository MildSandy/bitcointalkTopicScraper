Forgive me if I miss the mark a bit, feel free to correct.  There are a number of components to Mingo, but we are really trying to focus on just a few of them so as to avoid confusion.  The core utility of MingoCoin is Behavior Incentivization. In other words, we turn learning cryptocurrency into a game and reward you with real cryptocurrency. The implications of this are huge as Behavior Incentivization is the basis for advertising, loyalty programs, etc. MingoCoin becomes the unit of reward that we can quantify behaviors with.  Keep in mind, we don't intend to become an ""Advertising"" platform. If we ever get into advertising it will be strictly opt-in. Loyalty programs, learning programs, and straight up gaming integrations are where we are planning to go. Loyalty and Learning can already be implemented with our current strategic partners, but we just made some serious progress in the gaming space...something we have had planned since day one.  I hope that addresses some of your question.",False

Cryptocurrency firm MingoCoin - which is chaired by former Baltimore Technologies chief Fran Rooney and cites One Direction star Niall Horan as a shareholder and brand ambassador - aimed to raise €2m in a token presale which ended on October 9.  The pre-sale raised over €650,000 in the first hour alone. The firm, which has received startup funding from Enterprise Ireland (EI), was contacted last week by EI officials and ordered to amend or remove promotional material linked to the ICO that could be misconstrued as an endorsement by the Stage agency.  Mingocoin founder and ceo Joe Arthur confirmed the firm has held talks with Enterprise Ireland about its use of the State agency's name in promotional material. ""They have asked us to clarify the position in relation to the ICO,"" Arthur said.  ""We have discussed that with them and obviously we have clarified that in our prospectus.""   -  What happened here? You still have the Enterprise Ireland logo on the site.",False

We were supported and backed by Enterprise Ireland and the quote on our website is exactly as given. To say we have been ""ordered to remove"" is very strong. We spoke with Enterprise Ireland and have follow up calls tomorrow. They have outlined that their backing was for the messenger component of our business but that they don't directly support an ICO because its unregulated. They have supported and continue to support MingoMessenger""  The author of the article was asking EI if they supported the ICO, which they don't and did make a call to Joe for clarification.

This represents an opportunity to contribute to our mission of teaching cryptocurrency to the masses, whilst enabling enterprises to accept crypto payments via Mingo’s messenger interface.  Mingo is an interconnected set of supporting products. MingoMessenger is a multi-channel messenger app designed to discover, share, and transact with your messaging contacts. MingoWallet is a multi-currency wallet and tutor which also rewards users for learning progress with real cryptocurrency. MingoCoin is the cryptocurrency of Mingo to drive user adoption.  Currently 0.05% of the world's population use cryptocurrency - yet 75% of internet users use messaging apps. The fastest and easiest way to introduce cryptocurrency to the rest of the world is through the familiar interface of a messaging app, and Mingo is positioned to lead this charge.  MingoMessenger is rapidly growing and currently has over 50,000 users across 170 countries. These users can view all their messages on multiple messaging providers as a single feed per contact. The delivery of MingoMessenger is proof of team Mingo’s ability to execute on the planned roadmap.   MingoWallet makes getting started in cryptocurrency as simple as downloading an app. Users can send and receive the built-in cryptocurrency MingoCoin and exchange between crypto and fiat currencies. Users can transact with MingoCoin using MingoMessenger. Mingo has a partnership program and is building partnerships of substantial value globally. This is evidenced by our existing partnerships including Xunison, a home automation and streaming company, and CYFX, a forex trading company that gives Mingo liquidity.  The strategic relationship with Xunison can provide at least 1.2 million users in the near future. Each of these new customers can use Mingo to manage their relationship with and pay their monthly subscription to Xunison using MingoCoin. This relationship will give Xunison’s other 20 million users access to Mingo.    When does the pre-sale start? 25 September, 2017 @ 3pm GMT  What is the pre-sale target? €2,000,000 is the pre-sale target  When will the ICO be? We are planning for Q1 of 2018.   Token Economics  Vesting Pre-sale contributors will have their tokens vested over a 6 month period in two 50% installments with a 3 month cliff Team/Advisors/etc will have their tokens vested over a 4 year period in four 25% installments with a 1 year cliff Exchanges We are in the process of getting MingoCoin listed on a number of exchanges. MingoCoin will be available for trade through CYFX at launch.  Bounty Campaign Learn more here: https://medium.com/mingocoin/mingocoin-bounty-program-6413cea871cb  Token Specifications MingoCoin (MGC) is an ERC223- and ERC20-compliant token contract that will be issued on the Ethereum public blockchain. The contract will be developed prior to the completion of the ICO and publicly available for review. All contracts can be reviewed as they are developed at our Github account: https://github.com/mingocoin  Paypal became the world's leading online payments company by harnessing strategic partnerships. This philosophy is at our very core.  We have a guaranteed partnership with Xunsion which will bring in 1.2 million users in the first 12 months - but provides access to the rest of their 22 million (and growing) userbase. We also have a guaranteed partnership with the fully regulated CYFX which will provide the first exchange to offer MingoCoin - while Mingo payment cards and more already under discussion.

Makes sense though since you obviously serious about this. I do not doubt that and I also feel this is legit as well. Sorry but these are things we as investors need to know you understand I'm sure.  So far so good. Keep this up. While I might not use the app I am still very interested and impressed and who knows maybe I will use it one day. It's a good app bo doubt. But I want to make money I'll be keeping close attention to this thread and think long and hard about investing and how much to invest. I make smaller safer investments but lots if them. I'm patient. You must be. However buying your coins or bit I still support Mingo and Mingocoin.

Kik is actually complimentary to what we are doing. They are a single channel of communication. Mingo allows users to link their multiple channels in a way that they can see all of their messages from each contact in one feed, instead of jumping between apps or even jumping between tabs in the same app. It's literally one feed for each of your contacts regardless of how many that contact is connected to you through.  There may even be an opportunity to incorporate Kik into Mingo at some point. We're evaluating all of the major messaging channels in addition to the ones we already have.",False
