The landlord needs to get a lot of more information about the tenant. Last time I rented a flat I had to show latest bank statement that showed my income and had to give a confidential information on my credit rating. A simple rating like 'Mr. Tenant A always payed on time (5/5)' won't be accepted by the majority of the landlords. They rent their houses/flats sometimes for years and they want the safety to get their money on time. Maybe I am imagining the rating system completely wrong but I think it should be more of a list of documents about the tenant the landlord can access than a actual rating. And to respect the privaty of the tenant these documents should only be accessible after the first contact. The rating of tenants will depend on several parameters, including those.",False

Landlords publish offers and potential tenants bid to rent the real estate. In addition to the auction format, the platform also allows for regular rental offers. The service is available via a website and Android/iOS apps. The system allows potential tenants to calculate travel time from the property to a required geolocation, i.e. the office, work out the ideal price for the real estate based on data analysis, see 3D photos of the space, access an account area to share utility bills and communicate with the landlord, as well as other functionality. The account area and chat service are subscription-based.  The platform will offer the ability to pay using its own cryptocurrency (REST), which can be converted into fiat currency onto a card and back in the account area. Operations with fiat currency can be executed using a tied bank card, with currency exchange facilitated through integration with a cryptocurrency exchange. The platform's competitive advantage is payment using REST which is free of fees and commissions, unlike wire transfer.
