Other than that - the idea of adding such coins if someone invests heavily in the ICO sounds good, we'll try to implement it, although we may have problems depending on the currency logo (some of them are really bad).  We will have the coins for sale together and separately from the board game during the Kickstarter of the game. It all depends on the quality though, making something that represents a game token (the board game term, not the ICO token) is easy, but it is fairly low quality compared to a HQ metal coin.

The project is highly unusual, and since it doesn't follow the set of large promises and advertisement, it's bound not to attract the level of attention even ICOs with fairly obscure but well-dressed promises got in the past, and right now there are hundreds of ICOs. We can't make people look deeper here instead of ... say a coin that is advertised by famous rapper. If we could afford the said rapper, it would just take from the the funds invested, and following that - from the profits, as the project cap is low*  As for clarity, besides having a team that worked in public for over 15 years and old companies with clear history, passing all checks for connections with shady practices, and pretty much everything regarding the games part of the project already shared with the public, and we are publishing the mining project specifications in a day or two. There is another announcement on the way, as one of the top game development companies in Central Europe pledged their support for Cryptum in the form of developers and artists, but until we get clearance to publish it, there is no more to say on the matter.  It's just there isn't a lot more to add. We make games and a backup mining project scaling with the total funds, and token owners get profits and games subscription. The coin project is not revolutionizing anything, it's a currency we would use and people would trade. Since trading Cryptum tokens is in our own interest, exchange listings and other similar data is meaningless as of this moment, or it was already in the whitepaper or the articles on the website.  If people want specific answers they would ask.  Please do not mistake basic attention hooks like translations, bounties, etc. with project interest. The same way we got countless offers or paid listings, we also got quite a few people willing to back a real business plan with tons of potential. Should be visible once the sale starts anyway.  *there is only so much we need and can manage. $100 million target would make it so much news-worthy, but with $65M we would just buy the top two of three board games publishing companies instead of starting a new one.

I'd still advise you to get them now with ETH, the bonus is  better than the BTC bonus, even if you swap them at exchange and get them back in your wallet, but it depends how much you want to buy, ofc.

We obviously cannot ship to warzones, countries with civil unrest or countries that lack normal posts infrastructure, or they are located in the most expensive shipping zones (distant islands and so on).    Cryptum Tokens are based on the Ethereum blockchain and the reason we are using the technology is to be able to create simple proof-of-ownership pass to all of the token features, based on a claim process, with unclaimed funds being redistributed in future rounds. Similarly, we will use the token ownership-based claims to distribute a pre-mine of the Cryptumcoin in December 2017. The Stage I Sale ended with nearly $136 000 raised for 19,776 the CRTM Sold, and we made a number of changes for the second stage, including cancellation of one of the initial project and reducing the volume of available Cryptum tokens.    For a full team list, please check the About us section on the website. Our team is the core team being the largest and oldest Bulgarian IT community (hardwareBG.com Forums, the core team is the admins Ba4o Kiro, GrigorBG, geniusloci and Bloody) and the heart of two successful businesses - HardwareBG.com and BoardGames.BG. We have some amazing contributors and partners in the face of one of the top mining blogs - Crypto Mining Blog and our long term partner and leading game development company Imperia Online.  Simply put, Nikolai is the visionary or the project and a co-founder of the ICO. He worked in the IT industry for nearly 15 years as a reviewer, magazine editor, PR specialist, and product manager, before he started his own company dealing with board games and turned his hobby into successful business. He has been into mining since 2010, and is now working on the mining board game Blockchain. Anton is a huge tech enthusiast and the leading figure behind so many online projects that even we stopped following all of them. Hardware, 3D/VR, 3D printing, software, actually anything IT-related, and a whole lot of hobbies to complement his already impressive skills. He's responsible for most of the software development for the Cryprum projects, and we greatly value his knowledge and experience. Kiril is our chief technology expert. One of the co-founders of the leading Bulgarian IT community at hardwareBG.com and the company with the same name, a skilled technician with plenty of experience dealing with almost every possible hardware or software-related problem, and even more knowledge when it comes to cryptocurrency mining, we have him working on the development and support for any mining-related project. Another of the hardwareBG.com founders, Grigor is the lead technical advisor of the Cryptum project. He has been into mining ever since it became a thing, and, after years of working on different mining ventures, he has an extensive knowledge of the supply chain and demand, management and scalability, and possible issues and solutions for any scale of cryptocurrency mining operations.    There is no team allocation in Cryptum. We are adding a small marketing expenses allocation for the Stage II Sale, with most of the ongoing expenses being drawn from the Cryptumcoin pre-mine pool, as these are the only expenses we are facing currently. We will not advertise through paid channels, considering the advertisement prices raised to insane levels and their overall value doesn't add much to the actual contribution to the ICO, based on our experiences during Stage I Sale and the theoretical maximum funds we can raise.

We will still use Kickstarter for profit and marketing purposes, as there is no better marketing tool available, but we would not depend on it. In order to ensure higher profits for the token owners and long-term funding for our game line, we will make a partial investment in a mining farm and offer shared profit from the moment it starts working (for 24 months at its full power or equivalent at lower processing power).   Board games  BLOCKCHAIN: THE CRYPTOCURRENCY BOARD GAME is the first high-end strategy game involving the  cryptocurrency mining process and investment. The game features: 1-5 player competitive gameplay Under 90 minutes play time 85* coins for mining 15* ICOs/TOKENS 25 algorithms Hardware ranging from a single CPU to mining rigs and ASICS Small share of exchange mechanisms are in the base game * Numbers may vary because of KS stretch goals and paid additions ** Missing currencies may be added upon request for a fee  There are four planned expansions for the base game, featuring additional mechanics, market updates, new cryptocurrencies, new hardware and rig upgrades. The expansions will add exchanges, mining farms and forks, and the final expansion will introduce complete revamp of the gameplay mechanics. * More expansions may be released depending on product success  We have one game nearly ready to be published (in beta test soon) -  Primewarp: Genesis is a post-cyberpunk PvP/PvE game, mixing realistic sci-fi and dark fantasy in a narrative story, and featuring some unique, never seen before gameplay mechanics. The game is massive, with 18 map tiles, over 600 cards, 15+ different great models sculpted by Francesco Orrù (total number of miniatures TBA).  Our plans also include two more AAA games that would be announced closer to completion. Both of them will receive lots of attention by the hobbyists. Every game we publish will be kickstarted in order to gain a maximum marketing value of each new project.    Our plan to make Cryptum Tokens profitable for you  Cryptum tokens are basically a subscription for our future games (with artifical inflation of the required number of tokens based on tiers). On top of that you can claim a part of each new game profit based on your token ownership (details announced separately) and initial amount of our upcoming Cryptumcoin (TBA).  They are not cheap to begin with: 0.02 ETH / 0.00135 BTC per CRTM token Every 25/35/65/100+ tokens you own can give you free access to different package of games We do not exchange your tokens in order to give you free games. We only check if you own them The number of tokens you have to own becomes higher for access to more games You get free cryptocoins [CRYC] once the coin is launched (1 CRTM = ? CRYC) We share 20% from the profits of the first board game line and up to 40% from other games The shared profits gets higher for games with larger profit later on the line    Cryptumcoin [CRYC]  We would release a new crypocurrency initially accessible to all token holders. ASIC-proof GPU-only mineable Value-bind Secure User friendly software (wallets and miners) Anti-instamineable via small initial blocks Highly-prospective, based on the number of coins mined and periodically halving of amount mined Free coins for token holders Airdrops to top holders Accessible on a wide range of exchanges Planned to be accepted as a payment method for our board game project   Cryptum Tokens Datasheet SYMBOL:  CRTM BLOCKCHAIN: ETHEREUM SALE DATES (STAGE I: ETH & BTC): 16 Sep 2017 – 16 Oct 2017 SALE DATES (STAGE II, +ALTCOINS, +25%): 17 Oct – 17 Nov 2017 DISTRIBUTION: AFTER STAGE END EXCHANGE RATE: 1 ETH = 50 CRTM, 0.0135 BTC = 10 CRTM (Stage I) TOTAL SUPPLY: 160 000 TOKEN ALLOCATION: ONLY SOLD TOKENS, NO ADDITIONAL ALLOCATION FUNDS DISTRIBUTION: 95/5% BOARD GAMES/COIN PROJECTS PROFITS: OPTIONAL* PRODUCT ACCESS: OPTIONAL* BOUNTIES: CHECK TWITTER AND FACEBOOK TRANSLATIONS: ENGLISH ONLY PROJECT** *Statement on SECs: all revenues and free products access are optional and based on claims. Citizens of countries with regulation may opt for buying the tokens for their trade price instead of any revenues they would receive. **We will not publish board games in languages other than English, and we will not release information about the project in any other language.     UPDATE: Games information:  For the Primewarp game development you can check Cute Lizard's page, the 3D sculpts are being pushed even now (albeit at a slower rate as we have to pay for each of them, and right now there is a conflict of interest between paying sculpts and paying for Cryptum advertisement, one of my big rants), the art is 100% done and paid to Nicolas Nexz (and much of it is on the page), but we don't have final layouts, and considering there are over 500 cards, this will take a while. Then there is half the boards to be finished, we have the basic layouts from the artist that worked on them, but all the details and lighting on 9 of the steampunk-ish tiles and on one of the sci-fi tiles are not added yet - again, because its a full time job, and right now it's lower on the priorities list.  About the Blockchain game - the graphics are the last thing to come to the game (after all, they depend on the ICO), so no pictures. Below are the lists of algos and coins included so far, mind you - we will probably add more as stretch goals during the KS campaign. In fact I will compile an article and put it on the website, none of us considered it that important, testing mechanics and rules doesn't require that information (we have just numbers there) and it's considered part of the final workings, and some of them might change, considering there will be some changes on the market by the time the game enters more active development.  Of course, right now we are mostly concentrated on the sale, listings and so on, considering the game depends on its result. If the funds are low at the end of the sale we may consider pushing Primewarp to top priority, as it's in later stage of development, and the funds it would generate would pay for the work on the Blockchain.

May be some of the digital world product access tokens, but they are very hard to evaluate for most people, so they stick to the PR and hype. We are launching this because we were frustrated by all the pointless ICOs as much as everyone else while we had much better idea how it should work.  There is some good publicity on the way, we haven't even announced the game in the hobby world, and it's nothing short of unique, and tied to a very unique project. Right now we are busy submitting the sale to all the ICO listing websites (darn there are many), it should start to pop-up in a day or two    BTW, some personal thoughts: Quote I hope people would make a right choice regarding the project. It's simple: we get a working high-end game publishing business in less than few months time (it would take us 1-2 years any other way) and a long term funding for it, people get a high value, high demand token that pays for itself for 2 years + as long as we keep publishing games, and on top of that gets them lots of free stuff. And it might finally draw quite a few people outside the ICO crowd, which would be a small miracle by itself.  Everyone is happy.  We are not allocating 5-50% for friends and family (ehem, co-founders and investors, right), apart from 100 000 we'd keep for the Stage II sale (but we'll burn any unsold), we don't have 3 bosses with limousines around us to keep most of the money, no dumping the ETH right away for dollars, and certainly not using a generator for ICO PR like 90% of the stuff sold atm (sure we can sprinkle some more decentralized, digital, blockchain, anonymous, secure, future, assets, etc.). Short of someone copying the whole idea, there is nothing to compare it to. But then they'd have to hire half a corporation of people to do a 5-men's job, so the money would be wasted.",False
