A category creator with the first messenger-based neobank, Bankex (https://finsum.jp/2019/competing-companies/) has been enjoying explosive growth of its MainWallet user base, averaging 1,000 signups per day during its limited launch as part of product’s alpha testing.  MainWallet has many important characteristics, establishing payments and cash-outs with messenger screen names and logins doubling as bank names and logins – with the money being safely kept by Bankex via its custody solution. One function – being able to transfer the money from one user to another even if they have different messengers (insofar both messengers are supported by Bankex) – especially endeared Japanese investors.   With this feature, a customer in Tokyo using Line (Line support coming soon) could instantly send money to a customer in New York using Telegram. The money will leave a Line-connected account and will arrive to the Telegram-linked account, instantly.  At FIN/SUM 19, MainWallet was presented by Jayden Yuen (Bankex Hong Kong) and Seki Kazonori (Bankex Tokyo).  To test MainWallet, please message @mainwalletbot in Telegram.  FIN/SUM is a fintech summit and conference that connects the global finance and tech industries while promoting disruptive innovation across the globe.",False

We have three important announcements.   First, we are rolling out the alpha version of our D-App platform today. This is our flagship product built on BANKEX platform and utilizing BANKEX token. Our platform allows for in-message purchases for merchants interested in Telegram and other messenger storefronts. The alpha version already has almost 100 merchants that have developed their D-Apps in order to be a part of this release. We are very grateful to our new and improved development team who has pulled off this incredible feat. The alpha version is available only to pre-qualified developers.   Second, we are happy to announce the first financial transaction of the current quarter. BANKEX executive team has arranged a $5 million BKX sale to a large international family office active in the crypto market. The proceeds will be used to fund further development of BANKEX products, to support operations and to manage BKX token liquidity.   Third, BANKEX has exited MovieCoin JV and has rebooted the project as BKX Movie.  Christopher Woodrow and BANKEX have mutually and amicably decided to end their partnership on the MovieCoin project, having encountered strategic differences. BANKEX has taken over full responsibility for the former MovieCoin ""MOV"" Utility Token which is now the official currency of BKX Movie platform.

Los Angeles Ballet filed suit against MovieCoin on Thursday, accusing the film finance startup of trying to pay a $200,000 pledge in worthless tokens.  MovieCoin was founded in 2017 by producer Christopher Woodrow, the former CEO of Worldview Entertainment and Vendian Entertainment. The company offered the chance to invest in films using a blockchain-based token.  According to the lawsuit, a MovieCoin representative, Igor Khmel, attended the ballet company’s annual gala in February 2018 and agreed to donate $200,000. In September 2018, Woodrow signed a gift agreement, in which MovieCoin agreed to give $200,000 either in cash or the equivalent value in MovieCoin tokens. In return, MovieCoin would be listed as the official sponsor of Los Angeles Ballet’s arts and education programs.  The suit alleges that MovieCoin agreed to provide the tokens in late December 2018, “but concurrently advised that the MovieCoin Tokens were useless and any attempt to dispose or otherwise sell them would be futile as there was no market to facilitate same.”  “LAB declined to incur the expense necessary to establish a ‘wallet’ in light of the worthlessness of the proposed content,” the suit alleges.  The suit states that MovieCoin has been repeatedly asked to provide the gift in a monetizable form, and has refused to do so.  MovieCoin made a number of announcements in 2018, and attracted some news coverage. In November, the company called off a public sale of tokens due to “overwhelming interest during the company’s private pre-sale.” The company has not made announcements since then, and its PR firm, Prosek Partners, said it is no longer working with the company.  A company representative told Variety on Thursday that the company is “reorganizing.” In a statement, the representative blamed the ballet dispute on Khmel, who is said to no longer be involved with the company.  “The pledge was made by a former principal at MovieCoin Holdings Inc. who is no longer with the company. When MovieCoin parted ways with the individual, he declined to honor the pledge. The company is currently in the process of reorganization and therefore an offer to transfer the pledge to a new entity was proposed but the LA Ballet flatly declined. It’s an unfortunate situation for everyone, and although initially rejected by the LA Ballet, the offer to make a donation through a surviving entity still stands.”  The suit seeks the $200,000 gift, plus $1 million in incidental damages, plus interest.   https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/moviecoin-ballet-worthless-tokens-1203198171/",False

As Bankex foundation won the ETH Hackathon last year and promoted themselves as “the first plasma protocol implement case”, many investors think this is a solid ICO to invest on. However, many issues happened during and after the token sales of Bankex, making many investors lost their confidence. In this article, we will discuss many, but not all, mistakes made by Bankex foundation, showing that even though a team have solid technology foundation, the market would not favor them if they are not trustworthy and have bad public relationship to its community.  1. Abnormally long public sales period  The Bankex ICO began on November 28 and ends on December 28. At the meantime, the ETH price increased from 472.9 to 737.02, which is nearly 55% increases in USD value. Thanks to that, in the first two weeks, the team nearly received enough USD for the project already, but instead of ending the token sales quickly, they did nothing and only end the token sales 2 days earlier. Thus, they received $70,600,000 USD, which exceed their USD cap by 150% while many token were not sold.  2. 5 exchanges promise  During token sales, many admins in Bankex Chinese telegram group mentioned about the token would be listed on 5 exchanges soon after the token sales ended. After the token sales, this information spread to English telegram group as well. In the first week of January, this statement altered and changed into “BKX token would be listed in January. We have committed five exchanges.”  This kind of statement mislead investors during the token sales, many of them thought they could sell their token in few weeks and underestimated their time costs in participated Bankex ICO  On 28 January 10:22 am UTC +8, in Bankex telegram group, the admins there will be “good news regarding the listing information” in 2 hours. And when the time came, they announced that there would be a Facebook live on 9:30 pm UTC +8 where Bankex Managing Director Constantine Kurbatoff would provide “exchanges information”.  While the way of “announcing an announcement” received many negative attitude, many investors were expecting Bankex team would provide the information about what 5 exchanges would Bankex get listed on.  However, in the live, Kurbatoff stated “the team has filed everything in December, and now is up to the exchanges to decide the listing.” The truth is, the team only sent documents to exchanges, without any conformation from exchanges, they told their investors “committed five exchanges” and would “definitely listed in January”. The team redefined committed, definitely and January. This is definitely a false promise.  3. Announced first but fail to get shortlisted in Binance voting competition  On 8 February, Bankex team tweets this: Again, the team announced too soon before having any confirmation from counterpart, making them look like a joke when the truth revealed.  4. Listed on OKEX, circulation supply and advisor token problem  Information about Bankex on OKEX On 26 February, the team stated that the coin would be listed on OKEX tomorrow (27 February). And people discovered that the circulation supply of Bankex token is 120m according to OKEX information, while the token sales only released 80m token, and telegram group admins kept telling the community the circulation supply was 62.2m. Bankex team accused that is the fault of OKEX.  When the trading started, the price of token pumped to 0.002599 ETH then dump to as low as 0.00088 ETH, which is normal price action for many ICO.  However, with the crash in token prices, investors tried to find the reason behind the reason of the crash, and some of them realized an advisor, whose token should be locked for a year, transferred his/her token on OKEX exchange without any announcement.  TxHash: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x26e346aa8336ab004e12dcda4a24cae72e5597acb3c44e25c42d37bb7afd8102  https://etherscan.io/tx/0x315f12f1db61306e9a607d07bc452b154182db8ac02a81f708e05a9edff2a2b7  This create panic to many investors and they tried to find a proper reply from the team, so the problem raised in Bankex telegram group. Instead of having proper response instantly, the telegram admins ban everyone who raised the advisor token issues. On next day, they claimed that the advisor didn’t sold any of the token, but they didn’t provide any proper reason regarding the transfer of token.  Only after a week, in an article “How to get listed on exchange” written by Bankex COO Dima Dolgov said the advisor transfer his/her token for testing, but the best time to response the doubt has gone.  In conclusion, the team keep repeating their mistake and always fail to response to community in time, leading many doubts among investors. So, this is reasonable for the price to dropped by 67%. While many of solid projects are underdeveloped by Bankex team, including App coin, Media coin, Movie coin, that’s a shame to have this kind of bad public image after all these mistakes. Bankex team is definitely a bad example to all the solid projects to the ICO spaces, and let’s hope similar silly mistakes would not be made in other projects as well.    https://medium.com/@jordanwong_70450/how-to-make-a-shitty-ico-even-if-you-win-ethereum-hackathon-using-bankex-as-example-968de0b8475b",False

BLOCKCHAIN OF CHOICE Security tokens should choose massively popular blockchains. Thus the main thing about blockchain is its rate of adoption. Not its scalability, speed and consensus. It's easier to fix technical problems of an existing blockchain, than launch a new one.  2. REGULATION DOES NOT ADD ECONOMIC VALUE Regulation is necessary but not a guarantee of security token success. Regulation does not create new qualities of a digital asset. It's importance is overvalued.  3. FRACTIONAL OWNERSHIP Fractional ownership is necessary but not a guarantee of a security token success either. Fractional ownership adds secondary market liquidity for existing assets, but does not create new qualities of digital assets.  4. DECENTRALIZED OWNERSHIP Ownership registration on blockchain cuts costs of changing ownership registration. It enables multi-origination, decreases barriers for securitization, and improves liquidity on secondary market for existing assets. It does not create new qualities for digital assets.  5. CONTINUOUS SECURITIZATION Decentralized ownership decreases minimum sizes of portfolios required to access capital markets. It enables the process we call “Continuous Securitization.” Continuous securitization is the key process for lowering barriers to capital markets for traditional security assets.  6. INSTANT AUDIT Instant audit, asset tracking and scoring create new digital asset qualities. It's important for securitization of assets that are rare or do not have access to securitization, such as movies or objects of art. It creates new qualities for digital assets.  7. TOKENS = SECURITIES    7.1. Security tokens are a digital representation of traditional capital market financial instruments: equities, security bonds, commodities and commodity futures. They do not require new regulation because it already exists.     7.2. Security tokens will be traded as tokens on token exchanges and as securities or commodities on traditional securities or commodites exchanges.     7.3. Utility and currency tokens continue to exist, in a parallel universe with security tokens. The two are different by nature.     7.4. Security Token Offerings will provide an alternative to IPOs.  8. SECURITY TOKEN ASSET CLASSES Crowdfunding doesn’t work, institutional capital markets do work: group tokens into “Security Token Asset Classes”. This is the process behind Token Asset Class creation:     8.1. Standard of industry transaction settlements and contracts for money flow are the basis of “Security Token Asset Class.” It enables asset pooling to portfolios.     8.2. Pooling enables diversification. Diversification decreases risks for investors. Tokenization eliminates borders and grants global access to investors.     8.3. Instant digital audit of money flows creates transparency of portfolios. Decentralized ownership enables pooling of portfolios from multiple stakeholders. Continuous securitization of portfolios enables granular refinancing and capital markets access -- eliminating the need for all intermediates, such as banks, placement agents, etc. It decreases the cost of capital for asset holders and unlocks liquidity.     8.4. Blockchain is not controlled by one organization. Neither should Token Asset Class be controlled and dominated by one issuer. Ownership, audit and operations should be decentralized in the same way as during securitization of traditional assets.     8.5. Stable coins are backed by commodities or fiat. They are important for avoiding currency volatility and for safety of movement of funds through blockchain. The latter is a prerequisite for institutional capital getting involved with security tokens.  9. CAPITAL MARKETS WILL DOUBLE IN SIZE Security tokens will enable new “Security Token Asset Classes” issues and trading on capital markets that will generate volume comparable in size with the current $200 trillion in traditional securities traded annually on capital markets worldwide.  10. FOR GREATER GOOD The newborn Token Asset Classes will improve access to capital for people who create new things, qualities and meanings. This will decrease the role of financial and legal intermediates. This time all of mankind -- not just the 1 percent -- will be eligible to get a share of these financial benefits.",False

Here at BankEx, we believe in the efficiency of offloading of some transactions from Ethereum blockchain to Plasma chains especially if the proper incentive is present for Plasma operators to behave appropriately (such incentive can be presented in the form of competing with other operators for obtaining end-users). Another advantage is flexibility of Plasma chain implementation as long as it can be effectively cross-checked by contract on a parent chain. With the new cryptographic primitive added in Metropolis fork, one can extend our PoC implementation with transactions utilizing ring signatures of zkSNARKs for the privacy of end user.

Simply put, blockchain is a database technology that leverages two unique features, namely transparency, and decentralization. We all value transparency — the willingness of a person or organization to accept scrutiny. Even the desire to be audited or examined by our peers is seen as the hallmark of honesty and integrity. Decentralization is a less familiar feature that nevertheless offers familiar market-like qualities — when a system used by a large group of participants doesn’t depend on any one of those participants to function properly and in which their effectiveness judges actions. The ability to realize these features has only become possible very recently with the advent of low-cost, high-speed Internet connections and affordable high-capacity computers. This foundation, which enables mining, has been a prerequisite for the proliferation of blockchain technology.  https://blog.bankex.org/commercial-applications-of-blockchain-6b732638075a",False

Current system has several problems: • Friction problem:  the industry has an abundance of platforms, aggregators, royalty collection services, agents, and other gatekeepers and intermediaries that collect money from consumers, deduct fees & expenses and delay payment to the proper channels. Stakeholders looking to verify the accuracy of their payments are subject to substantial audit fees. • Access problem: the vast majority of the most desirable content is produced and distributed through an entrenched global system that is dominated by a handful of companies and a few privileged insiders who are able to participate in the financing of that content. • Transparency problem: “Hollywood Accounting” obscures the true performance of entertainment assets. While a film’s box office is public, this one number represents only a single frame of a movie’s performance. • Liquidity problem: there is typically no secondary market for a financier’s participation.

No smart contracts or multisignature transactions are allowed on this private blockchain yet. Using different structures of blocks, transactions and consensus algorithm, it can reduce the cost of transactions as well as make them faster, simultaneously having a “master” contract on the main Ethereum network that can enforce proposed transaction rules on private network.  Currently, Ethereum is able to conduct roughly 20 transactions per second. Further, with the current growth rate of Ethereum, the cost of transactions will continue to increase. BANKEX technical team developed the world first private blockchain that supports Plasma Protocol for public audit. And BANKEX immediately got feedback from the community.

If tokenization achieves global saturation, many different types of real assets will be included in the blockchain system. For example, in the case of real estate, there will be tokenization of assets of different qualities, which will allow for a new method of their evaluation. It is possible that at first tokenized real estate will be valued at a lower cost, but after the market develops and grows everything will return to normal.  This will be possible through the globalization of capital, which will significantly increase demand. Ambitious tokenized projects will be revalued highly rewarded when the amount of tokenized assets have grown. Then these assets will acquire new features, such as voting, analysis, dividends, and the possibility of quick unrestricted transactions among many others. As a result, the market built around tokenization will become more sustainable.  https://blog.bankex.org/tokenization-of-assets-as-a-stimulus-for-economic-growth-ade11c230d05",False

Even though blockchain itself is decentralized and secured, who can guarantee that the smart contracts will be executed properly by both sides of the deal? Can a smart contract guarantee the quality of the service or product? The smart contracts are executed under the automatic regime. And they meet user need by recording the terms and conditions that cannot be altered or deleted. Still, we can’t escape from the human factor. Or can we?  Let’s take a look at an example: Alice, a client, and Bob, a freelancer.  Alice orders a service from Bob and the two decide to sign a contract on BANKEX’s Trust Service so it can be recorded on the blockchain. For some reason, Alice is not satisfied with the quality of Bob’s service. In frustration, she chooses to file a dispute. Bob then receives a notification about that. But Bob, on the other hand, believes that he did a good job and Alice’s claims are unreasonable. How to settle this disagreement? BANKEX Claim Solution Board  BANKEX has developed a solution: the Claim Solution Board. The essence of the Board is simple: it is a voting system that settles various disputes over the transactions in the blockchain community.

I'm not FUDDING just really hope the team can turn this around. Such a disappointment thus far. From the refunding which should have been understood prior to having them invest. To the false timeline on exchanges and misinformation. Then voting on exchange which had previously been stated that 5 exchanges are slotted. Just sloppy communication and a lot of misinformation. This needs to get a lot tighter because as an investor I have little confidence in this project anymore. I've pretty much chalked it up to a loss.

Here are the topics he covered:  Exchanges I know that many of you are asking about the exchanges — I am afraid I am not able to talk about it right now. I was advised by our lawyers not to disclose information about this topic. But one thing I can tell you is that we are in the final stage of entering the exchanges. So please bear with us and stay tuned.  Today I will focus on our products and our business plan for 2018.  Plans for 2018 We are working in several directions right now, I myself concentrate on developing business in the US, Hong Kong and Japan.  BANKEX Proof-of-Asset Protocol One of the most important things now is our Plasma protocol.  This technology is easily accessible to the mass market and can potentially reach 100,000 transactions per second. Plasma protocol can be used to enable exchanges for each of our vertical.  Meanwhile we are also working on our Trust Service and Bounty Program.We are planning to bring tokenization to Instagram as well. Tokens will be used to advertise accounts on Instagram and monetize followers.  We are also working on BANKEX charity, which is another area where our protocol can be implemented. This way BANKEX can contribute to the non-profit projects. Right now we are discussing with UN on using our technology in a clean drinking water project in African. Each token will be backed by a liter of water. We will help to make donation process easier and more transparent.  In asset management we have achieved a huge development, we are developing crypto tools, crypto management in brokerage money making, all the things used by investment banks as a service to traditional markets, we make a crypto version. We are improving the existing solutions in the traditional market in order to reform it and integrate with the cryptocurrency.  In US we intend to launch several verticals, you will see several platforms where big corporations and other players can raise money for their business.  https://blog.bankex.org/q-a-session-with-bankex-ceo-igor-khmel-25fa83f41709",False

I now have to say due to the teams failure to inform people that US citizens were not able to contribute i have changed my rating to 1 star. Everythhing about the ico website was geared towards americans even stating how much money they raised in USD. I contributed over an ether and never once was told US citizens wouldnt be able to join. The main page even bragged and advertised that they were US compliant. Two days ago I go to clain my tokens and they suddenly have a notice up which came only after the sale had ended. So they basically held my money all this time and now are telling me it could be a cpl weeks before i get it back. they wont even acknowledge they screwed up so it seems to me they wanted americans to contribuite so they could use your money to do whatever they wanted and then give it back when they feel like it. maybe they plant to hold it through the ethereum hardfork and keep all the ETZ that people should be earning on money they have unfairly held from them. This is a ridiiculous, unprofessional, and downright dirty move by an ico that seems to have raised plenty of money. The customer service is even very defensive over this issue. it was yalls fault you advertised in huge writing on ur ico page that you were US compliant not ours.

No need for 2FA, as no funds can be accessed once you log into your personal account, neither you can change your receiving address from your personal account and no sensitive personal is displayed.  Regarding your second question, after TSE ends.  Quote from: Pizza35kk on December 26, 2017, 02:16:17 AM I thought it's fake news I am really happy about the success of this ico  No fake news here!

Most recent info is that TSE ends in a few hours, you can check a countdown on BANKEX's website https://bankex.com/  Regarding listings, they're being discussed, when there's news you'll be able to see them.

That's normal, thanks for the support.  Quote from: tientien6 on December 26, 2017, 02:19:50 AM If BKX provided dividends then it would need to be a security token and be under much stricter regulations. It is a Utility token i understand bankex is like a bank... etc but how will i benefit? By selling the tokens?  As you very well said, it is a utility token, so you'll be able to benefit by using it to access BANKEX's Platform/services.

This restriction is intended to protect our individual token holders based on the assumption that investors with great financial resources may try and affect the market through large purchases or sales of BKX tokens.  For those who are interested the following link will take you to this article:  https://blog.bankex.org/bankex-insider-respond-to-questions-from-crypto-community-about-the-bankex-token-sale-and-more-e47d5c0a50bc  This is so institutional buyers don’t create unwanted price volatility and there is a steady flow of tokens into the secondary market..... It’s a great idea by the Bankex team and demonstrates that there are ICO’s that are not just for speculation, but rather are standing by their product, their vision.  I am glad to be financially participating in this ICO and have been recommending to my friends and colleagues who are already involved in the crypto world.",False

Our idea is to link people using cryptocurrencies, banks and other financial institutions through blockchain and more precisely by a set of smart-contracts that we have developed for some real world assets (gold, lithium, cars...) and other that will be coded by our community members. Say you have an owner of many office buildings in downtown Moscow asking you to tokenize his/her different office spaces. If our community finds the project attractive, meaning that the ""rentTokens"" can be sold, then the community will code a new smart-contract for this office owner. This new ""office smart-contract"" will be universal, ie it can be used in USA, China, India.... Moreover, BankEx will act as an escrow for the smart-asset (=rentToken) and will guarantee that those office buildings are in good condition, that all that was promised by the office owner (office class, size, furniture...) is indeed there. I hope this gives you a better idea of what BankEx is building.",False
