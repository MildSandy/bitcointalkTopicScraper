Method of capsulation (fixation) is banned in Europe. What kind of ecology are you talking about?  2.   Why can’t I see the documents about UBSH 1,5 and contracts with oil companies before investment? Do they exist?  3.     In your business plan for two units you have written that they recycle 3140 tons per month, which is equal to 2.2 tons per hour. Does that mean that your unit operates 24 hours a day, 31 days a month? Do you consider the time for any breakdowns and maintenance?  4.     In your  White Paper  you say that after 8 months you are planning to repurchase  the tokens in the amount  equivalent not less than 129.600$ (net profit) monthly. Also, on your website there is a manual for reverse repurchase, but below in the same White Paper you write that you expect the distribution of dividends in the amount of 5.5% and the reinvestment into the project of 94.5%. Which is the truth?  5.     You indicate that the total amount of the tokens is 25,000.

We just have started ICO few days ago, but we listen to our community and very grateful for all the support and all concerns that you raised.  We are extremely motivated to bring this project to inevitable success and have made this decision to pause ICO campaign for number of important reasons, such as a priority #1 is to provide legal safety for our investors and few more others:  adjust token structure switch to Ethereum platform (we heard you) tailor and execute juridical strategy to legalize token, make it available for US Citizens and China. (we couldn’t accept investments from USA and China and so let them miss such opportunity too in real sector of economy) sign-up with more Exchange platforms work closely with anchor Investors invite additional international Advisers to join us hire outstanding PR firm to communicate globally (we care about your emotional experience with us too) Create official business entity in Russia to legally bind with following documentation: agreements with oil extraction companies intending to use our services (Currently, “Rosneft” and “SurgutNefteGaz”) agreements with local government institutions to support our project development (Yes, we are quite interesting project) necessary Licenses technical documentation and intellectual property contract with Tyumen factory to manufacture complex  Thank you for staying with us and supporting our mission to make Planet cleaner!

As a result of a thorough market analysis and study of blockchain technologies in the real sector of the economy, it was decided to establish the Blockchain Industrial Club (BIC).  Blockchain industrial club creates its own blockchain platform to regulate interactionamong club members and token holders.  Bi Platform is an open source project based on Ethereum source codes with the full functionality to link investors, businesses and end customers without intermediaries to solve the basic problem of escrow* in the projects.  Club’s tokens and tokens of the platform will be distributed separately and are digital asset for the implementation of different operations on its own platform.  *escrow(escrow) or the escrow agent is a third party that monitors the compliance with the obligations  between a company and an investor with the help of secure transaction. The company (a scientist, a startup, an operating company, etc.) receives a guaranteed prepayment on a certain stage for the implementation of its project, the investor minimizes their risks in the event of cancellation of the transaction or fraud and a third-party which is an escrow agent, ensures commitment of obligations  with smart contracts and is responsible for its proof-of-stake** and reputation.  **Proof-of-stake is a method of protection in which the probability for a next block in the blockchain  to be made by a partner is proportional to the share of tokens owned by that token holder.  Therefore we changed the amount for ICO and the start date for the 1st of December. Soft cap remains $1 400 000 and will be spent on the implementation of the ODMC project. After the soft cap is raised all ODMC tokenholders will get Bi Platform tokens and  Blockchain Industrial Club tokens via smart contracts. Mid cap for implementation of the ODMC project is $2 800 000. After that only Bi platformtokens will be sold. Hard cap is $4 200 000. ICO will be hold on the Ethereum platform. Further Blockchain Industrial Club projects’ICOs will be held on its own Bi Platform.  Those who have already taken part in preICO will get Bi Platform tokens.  Bi platform is a blockchain platform that secures transactions using smart contracts and escrow agents (investment, profit sharing, loans, patents, etc.). A distinctive feature of the platform is: the creation of smart contracts without the knowledge of programming with the help of  templates and forms; registration on the Bi Platform of real resources of users and organizations for their further exchange  Each investor will have a wallet application, which is a part of the blockchain node. We useblockchain version 2.0 with our smart contracts, which are responsible for the commitment of obligations. To expand the functions of the Bi platform and BIC audience Ethereum blockchain app platform will be integrated.  Bi Platform and its functionality also allows the scientific and innovative community of young people and professionals, experts, scientists, engineers, advisers, designers etc., to participate in the development of the platform. Social entrepreneurship is provided through the support of young professionals, innovators in cooperation with accelerators, Universities and high school.  With the administrative support it can provide the platform with necessary ideas for the planned development of co-created projects in domestic and international markets.  Summary: Blockchain Industrial Club is created on the Bi platform to exchange information among all participants ofthemarket.  Bi Platform: cooperatesthe industry (real sectors of the economy, IT companies, green technologies, etc.); attracts investments to start-ups and performs the role of escrow; enables the creation of credit smart-contracts and insurance smart-contracts without knowledge of programming; implements a patent base with transparent payments from companies to authors for using their technologies; creates a stock exchange of resources and finances; provides access to global markets.
