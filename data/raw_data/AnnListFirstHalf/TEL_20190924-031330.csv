Put differently, this means that all the funds invested during the pre-ICO and ICO phase will stand for 25% of the whole telcoin supply value. And because we have a limited telcoin supply of 100 billion coins, the value of 1 telcoin will be calculated automatically at the very end of the ICO using the following formula:  (Total amount of funds raised during the pre-ICO and ICO phases) ÷ 25% ÷ 100,000,000,000  Ex: If we reach out hardcap of $25M, the value of 1 telcoin will be $0.001  Memo: We used to say we're selling 20% of the supply and keep 5% bonus pool separately, but for technical reasons we have merged this two entities into a 25% pool.  WHAT BONUS CAN I GET?  ・100 ETH: 5% bonus (limited to first 100 ppl) ・150 ETH: 7% bonus (limited to first 75 ppl) ・200 ETH: 10% bonus (limited to first 50 ppl) ・250 ETH: 12% bonus (limited to first 30 ppl) ・300 ETH: 15% bonus (limited to first 20ppl)  If you plan to invest more than 500 ETH, contact us directly to discuss a custom bonus.  We also have a cumulative time bonus which unfolds as follow:  ・+10% if the investment is made before we reach $10M equivalent in ETH. ・+5% if the investment is made when we have gathered between $10M and $20M equivalent in ETH.  Ex: If you make an investment of 300 ETH now, you will get access to 15+10=25% bonus.  We also offer a 5% referral bonus. If you refer a friend to invest into our ICO, you are eligible to a bonus equal to 5% of the amount invested by the friend you've referred. To achieve this, please provide them with the public key address you registered with us and make sure they enter it as a referral address.",False

Interoperability is the key, operators can't make something that can be sent between networks, look at mobile money. By having a coin that is heavily accessible and distributed, we can actually grow the cryptocurrency economy and benefit the Telco at the same time. Moreover, it's all about scale, mobile money or a bespoke single operator coin cannot scale outside of its network. To reach scale, it needs to be available.

Personally (chris) I joined the team because I found the disaster relief use case to be fascinating. I read about the California wildfires and donations centers receiving 3,000 toothbrushes & toothpastes. Most of which would be thrown away. What they (those affected by disasters) really need is some monetary help that would help with provisions that doesn't need to come from a centralized authority like NPO's, NGO's, or governmental agencies (too slow...i.e. FEMA).

At Telcoin we deeply believe market reach matters when it comes to mass market adoption. Mobile operators are in a unique position where their products, feature phones or smartphones, are in the pockets of more than 5 billions people worldwide. It's hard to find any product that can beat that, and it's definitely one of the reason why we work with them.  But it's not all, mobile operators are also important to improve some problems currently found in the crypto space, like trust issues and KYC practices.  As for transaction fees, there will be no specific transaction fee applied to the use of Telcoin. The fee deduction will happen between us and the operator. About this specific point, I invite you to consult our white paper, where you will be able to know more in details about how we will work with telecom operators.  If you have more questions, don't hesitate to join our telegram group: http://t.me/TelcoinCommunity",False
