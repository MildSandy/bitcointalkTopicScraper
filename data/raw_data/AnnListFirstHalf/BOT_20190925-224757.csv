Deployment of Bodhi Ethereum dapp contracts done. Start integration of BOE into light client.  Q1 2019: Finish integration of BOE light client into dapp to have multi-token platform.  These are the outlined portions of things to come within the next few quarters here at Bodhi. As often experienced with many crypto projects, the roadmaps generally do tend to overpromise or overstate their abilities to get things done on time. So… with that in mind, we would like to take a more realistic and humble approach and give periodic updates to our roadmap as things progress and take shape. We feel this will lead to more accurate estimations and the fact that we don’t want to let you all down by overestimating ourselves. https://medium.com/bodhi-prediction-market/bodhi-development-update-7-15-2018-81c364e59aef",False

We will airdrop 4,000,000 BOT to QTUM holders during Chinese New Year on Feb 16th.  Every One-Hundred (100) QTUM will receive Four (4) BOT tokens. Only wallet addresses that contain more than 10 QTUM will receive the airdrop.  Here are the details:  We will take a snapshot of the Qtum blockchain on Block 93333 (expected to be between February 1 and February 5) for the Airdrop. Users MUST complete depositing QTUM tokens into their wallets (e.g., Qbao, Qtum Core Wallet) before Block 93333 to be eligible to receive the airdrop.  We recommend users collect their QTUM tokens in a single wallet address before Block 93330 to leave time to verify that the balance can be properly queried using the Qtum Explorer. To ensure accuracy, we also recommend holding the QTUM in your wallet through Block 93335. Users may freely transfer their QTUM tokens after Block 93335.  Please store your QTUM in wallets (such as QBao or Qtum Core Wallet), QTUM stored on exchanges will NOT receive the airdrop.  Using this snapshot, the Bodhi team will perform the airdrop of Bodhi tokens on the February 16th, 2018 on Chinese New Year.

We have some exciting news to share with you all. We are glad to announce our first Bodhi Application beta version release on the Qtum Testnet!  Packaged Executables With our alpha test feedback, we noticed there was one big barrier for you all. There was too many steps in order to get the application running!  We are happy to announce that we have packaged the Bodhi Application conveniently into a single executable file for Mac OSX, Windows, and Linux operating systems. We got you covered!  All you will have to do to get it up and running is run the executable file, then your web browser should automatically open up to http://localhost:5555.  Removal of Invalidate One of the important changes to know in the overall flow of our Prediction Market participation is that you can no longer invalidate Oracles. We felt this was an unnecessary extra step in the process to reach the proof of agreement.  In the previous flow, if the Centralized Oracle (or Result Setter) did not set the result before the Betting End Block, there would technically be no result yet and anyone could invalidate the Centralized Oracle and start a new round of Decentralized Oracle voting in which all the results could still be voted on.  Now in the beta flow, if the Centralized Oracle did not set the result before the Betting End Block, anyone can assume the role of the Centralized Oracle and set the result. This would in turn create a new Decentralized oracle (as expected), and participants could vote against the Centralized Oracle’s set result.  Addition of Betting Start and Result Setting Start Blocks Previously, the only block numbers that would be required to be filled out were the Betting End Block and Result Setting End Block. We now have added the Betting Start Block and Result Setting Start Block.  This will give participants greater control in the periods that will be allowed to place bets or set the result.  Invalid Result In addition to user defined results for an event, we have added a default “Invalid” result to every created prediction event. This result signifies the ability to make the entire event invalid as a whole. This result will be treated as another result that can be bet or voted on.  A good use case for this would be say if a sporting event was cancelled due to bad weather. It wouldn’t make sense to reveal a winner when no one won, which is where the Invalid result would come into play.  Leaner Contracts We have stripped out all the unnecessary code from our contracts to make it leaner and thus made the gas transaction fees lower for you all. This should make you and your Qtum wallets happy.  Intuitive UI/UX Redesign We are listening to your feedback and are trying to make the best possible product for you all! We are in process of redesigning our Bodhi Application to make it more intuitive and user friendly.  Keep the comments coming and we will keep on listening and improving!  https://medium.com/@bodhitoken/bodhi-beta-alive-on-qtum-testnet-developer-update-jan-26-2018-d54d32924b9f",False

Timestamps, Timestamps, everywhere! We’ve changed our contracts to use UNIX timestamps instead of block numbers. We felt this would give greater accuracy in terms of setting events that would take place at a future time.  With ever-changing average block times, it made sense to rely on an actual date and time instead of trying to predict when a future block would take place. Instead of entering a future block, our Bodhi App will be providing a date/time picker for the purposes of selecting start and end times when creating a Prediction Event.  This will provide an overall variance in the block prediction by a maximum of one block.  Bodhi App UI Changes We have separated the Finalize and Withdraw stages of a Prediction Event. We felt like it was confusing for users to combine these two stages together.  UI Revamp Incoming! Please stay tuned for more updates. We have some exciting changes that will follow soon. Some things we have in the pipeline are some user experience changes that we feel will provide more intuitive usage of our Bodhi App.  We are also in discussion of the creation of a light client so that you won’t have to have a fully synced Qtum blockchain.
