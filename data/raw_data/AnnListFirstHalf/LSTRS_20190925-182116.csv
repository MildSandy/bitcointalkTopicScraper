Apply for the Whitelist.      Luna is an incentive-aligned dating platform powered by blockchain and machine learning.  Contemporary platforms suffer from many problems:  Misaligned incentives: platforms are incentivized to match users with advertisements rather than compatible partners, or else they are incentivized to keep useful features out of reach so that users will subscribe to pay for them. Imbalanced attention: users are either overwhelmed by messages or receive none at all. This imbalance creates and reinforces feedback loops of negative behavior that encourage users to send ever more messages of ever lower quality. Unproven algorithms: current match algorithms are limited to input data from online activity and are not informed by feedback from real world interactions.  As a result, user satisfaction remains low.   Luna's Solution     Luna's tokens are called Stars.  Blockchain allows the alignment of user and platform incentives by capturing the value of the Luna network and sharing it with token holders. It also enables P2P transactions without need of a 3rd party, thus creating a trustless free-market ecosystem.  Social networks — online dating in particular — are attention economies wherein users compete for exposure and interaction. Luna acknowledges this and presents a tokenized ecosystem that appropriately rewards users for the value they bring to the platform.  Stars enable Message Optimization: Users can limit the first messages they receive each day and prioritize their first messages to popular users' inboxes. Starburst: Users can boost their profile visibility and earn tokens by viewing boosted profiles. Anti-Flake Stake: Users can mutually stake tokens, earning them back plus a bonus upon meeting, else they forfeit them to the other if they flake.   How It Works  Compatibility is predicted by machine learning recommender systems. These are trained on user behavior both on the app, and off. Luna will use NFC technology to allow users to verify meetings with other Luna users. After meeting, users can provide feedback on the sense of chemistry, compatibility, and safety they felt with their match. Luna’s algorithms select for real-world compatibility, and as Luna grows, so does the fidelity of each connection.  The Luna app will be free to use. With regard to messaging, Stars are necessary only to open a conversation with a user who is receiving an influx of attention. First messages can be queued without Stars, to be delivered when, if ever, the recipient’s queue is no longer full. To maintain aligned incentives, Luna takes a transaction fee only when a user responds to a first message: user success is our success. With a verification system that protects against bots and abuse, and a tagging system for more effective sorting, Luna will bring online dating.   The Luna app demo will launch Feb 1st.

With a subscription model, the platform is motivated to get the user to push 'go' on the subscription, and then maintain just enough satisfaction that the user doesn't cancel afterwards - or so that the user forgets entirely. It also doesn't reflect the value the user gets out of the platform - a ""one price fits all"" model means a majority of users are paying either too much or too little.  Typically speaking, businesses love subscription models because they're super profitable. But we anticipate, with our new system, we can have a similarly successful business but with way more nuanced and streamlined user satisfaction methods.",False
