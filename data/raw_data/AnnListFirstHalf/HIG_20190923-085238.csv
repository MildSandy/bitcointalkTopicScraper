Our Vision  Our development team has tailored the underlying smart contract of Ethereum High Token with the purity of simplicity in mind. Going further of Ethereum High’s aforementioned core features, we crafted this token for the general public with a vision for the future.  Ethereum High is a safe place to invest assets. Ethereum High Token has the ambition to become one of the essential components of a sound and diversified portfolio. Internal factors, be it its robust and feather-light code, combined with external factors, be they the context of its creation and fast evolving environment, cumulate to render Ethereum High a sound value proposition.  The parameters of Ethereum High’s smart contract are set to answer to a simple yet strong portfolio strategy that was set up by a team of seasoned investors on the FIAT markets. Simply put, in lieu of a complex Coin, with numerous parameters that each increases the level of a wide array of risks : failure to comply, failure to finish, failure to protect, Ethereum High will instead concentrate its sole reason of being to diversify those risks.  Ethereum High’s aim is to provide to new entrants with a first step investment on their journey to valuation. We have set parameters to allow a vast amount of units of the currency to be traded, with a set in advance limit.
