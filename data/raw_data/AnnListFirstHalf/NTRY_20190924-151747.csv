Contracts are an integral part of business and everyday life. The current labour intensive process of creating, signing, and storing contracts is an expensive way to create agreements between different parties.  Current solutions require third party involvement; consequently contracting parties need to be in a certain place and time to come to a written agreement.  Notary aims to tackle this using cutting edge blockchain technology to create an efficient method of creating, storing and signing contracts - anywhere and anytime.  The solution? A mobile application built on the blockchain framework. The application offers the use of templates for standard contracts for different real-life cases in an intuitive and user-friendly interface.  2)   Endless use cases and business opportunities The Notary platform will be built in 3 stages. Below are a few examples of use cases for each stage.  In the first, the application will be targeted at the general population where it will let individuals create, store and sign documents such as: ●   sale or lease of property, ●   marriage contracts, ●   last will and testament, ●   grants of easement, ●   etc.  In the second stage the application will be targeted at businesses. Some practical examples where the application might be used are: ●   contracts between companies, ●   loans (bank to company) ●   services (notary services, insurance services) ●   transaction validations, ●   etc.  In the third and final stage the application will be adapted for use in governmental agencies in matters such as: ●   government procurement, ●   electronic incorporation forms, ●   updating corporate information, ●   sending filled-out electronic forms (tax forms, social insurance forms), ●   licenses (small industry services, trade services, industry services), ●   etc.  The higher stages will incorporate artificial intelligence methods. Artificial neural networks may help to prepare case-specific smart contracts. Moreover, they may play important role in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) for different industries.  3)   Cooperation and support from different companies If you go to Notary Platform BTT thread or www.notary-platform.com you will see that they have listed some companies under “Cooperation and Support”. Those are the companies that are collaborating with them and will be the first one to test their product and eventually implement it to their business.  4)   Role of the token – Proof of Stake The members of the core team, working on the Notary Platform project envision the NTRY Token as a utility token, intended to play two crucial roles in the Notary Platform ecosystem. In the early stages it should serve as a means of financing the purchases of the services, offered by the Notary Platform — such as timestamped and secure contract templates. Later on, as the Notary Platform matures and moves to its own blockchain network, it will also serve as a Proof of Stake, allowing the network to run smoothly and stay secure.  Proof of Stake is one of the possible transaction validation mechanisms, ensuring a blockchain network can be trusted. At first, the Notary Platform will be built upon the Etherum blockchain network, but as it gains initial traction, the core team will immediately begin to develop a separate blockchain network, upon which the Notary Platform will be moved eventually. Once that happens, the Notary Token will assume another important role as the Proof of Stake, allowing the users to stake their NTRY Tokens and be rewarded by a percentage of the fee collected in a transaction. The reward will be automatically transferred to the user’s wallet and remain on his disposal.",False

As they combine the universality of associative thinking with the precision of a mathematical model, they are able to capture the most complex trends in the phenomena under consideration. In mathematical terms, they are able to describe highly non-linear behavior of the modeled phenomena. Note that an average human thinking in everyday situations is, as a rule, linear as it originates from an instinctive response to relatively simple situations through the evolution of the human species (eg, a triggered response to a dangerous situation: defend yourself or run away).  Blockchain is already a huge phenomenon today. Its use seems to be limitless, but can blockchain really fulfill its promise? The answer is huge yes — there is already a number of use cases, which will evidently simplify number of processes and improve the whole sectors within different industries. But we at the Notary platform believe that the real break-through of blockchain will come from the combining the power of AI methods and blockchain technology.  Unfortunately, there is a significant difference between the blockchain and the artificial neural network (ANN) on the mathematical and the programmable level. Basically, blockchain by its nature is linear and is meant to store time series data or transactions (sequential processing). On the other hand, artificial neural networks will likely need to be highly parallelized (parallel processing) in order to be more efficient. The problem of combining both approaches can be solved in different ways. There are two main approaches: the ANN can be used as a platform upgrade in a decentralized way for the added value of its service, or it can fully implemented in a decentralized way that corresponds to the ANN parallelism. Of course, there is also a third method which include combination of both approaches.  Apart of this, when dealing with all kinds of phenomena (be physical or social), we have to be aware that their nature is not deterministic, but non-deterministic (probabilistic). In layman terms this means that any prediction, given without an estimation of its reliability, is rather useless and misleading.  In the follow-up article(s), we will present general framework of how to apply ANN to its underlying blockchain technology. The concept is not yet fully tested but simulations show its potential and efficiency. Note that this technology will be implemented on the second and/or third stage of the Notary platform.  IoT seemed a good idea to the author of this article, but due to many problems never gained enough traction. However, blockchain technology (also DLT — distributed ledger technology) enables different approach which seems to fully comply with IoT. On top of that, inclusion of ANN and/or other AI techniques will bring the disruptive blockchain technology to the new level which will change the way of life we know today.  Why are we so confident about this? Below is the excerpt from an introduction to ANN software which was co-developed by author for commercial purposes many years ago. Basic principles were still the same and we expect that they will come to full fruition when we will combine it with DLT. Note, that names were intentionally changed.  In the beginning of 1992 Iggy, one of our team members, began with the use of the neural networks. He tried to solve some simple problems in the field of civil engineering and all results were very promising. After he had moved to some more sophisticated problems, he also encouraged some of us to try neural nets.  We ran our neural net programs with all possible combinations of neurons in many different layers. Several weeks were spent, without any results. We gave up; the problem remained unsolved and we lost our faith in the neural networks. (We must confess our knowledge about neural nets at that time was pretty poor. Some expert would probably succeed in solving it.)  A few months later Iggy got an article from Prof. Grass, where some new ideas about neural networks were presented. He added some improvements, programmed his computer and tried out the new neural network on some simple problems. Everything worked fine. Finally, he also tried to solve our “unsolved problem” and he succeeded. Moreover, he solved it in one hour.   The story repeated itself a few months later. Iggy was visiting a university in Italy, where he met a team, who was also concerned with neural networks. They had a problem and after they had made several experiments with a number of hidden neurons, the final learning phase took about 30 hours. The results were good, but Iggy achieved better results within half an hour, although he had never heard of the problem before. They did not trust his results (Just like we did not in example above.) The awareness that something can be done a couple of times faster than it was done before is always frustrating, especially if the new way is much simpler, too.",False

I read this at bitcointalk:   Notary tackles one of the largest and most common problems in business and life:  Safely creating, signing and storing digital contracts.  Contracts are an integral part of business and everyday life. The current labour intensive process of creating, signing, and storing contracts is an expensive way to create agreements between different parties.  Current solutions require third party involvement; consequently contracting parties need to be in a certain place and time to come to a written agreement.  Notary aims to tackle this using cutting edge blockchain technology to create an efficient method of creating, storing and signing contracts - anywhere and anytime.  1)      The solution? A mobile application built on the blockchain framework. The application offers the use of templates for standard contracts for different real-life cases in an intuitive and user-friendly interface.  2)   Endless use cases and business opportunities The Notary platform will be built in 3 stages. Below are a few examples of use cases for each stage.  In the first, the application will be targeted at the general population where it will let individuals create, store and sign documents such as: ●   sale or lease of property, ●   marriage contracts, ●   last will and testament, ●   grants of easement, ●   etc.  In the second stage the application will be targeted at businesses. Some practical examples where the application might be used are: ●   contracts between companies, ●   loans (bank to company) ●   services (notary services, insurance services) ●   transaction validations, ●   etc.  In the third and final stage the application will be adapted for use in governmental agencies in matters such as: ●   government procurement, ●   electronic incorporation forms, ●   updating corporate information, ●   sending filled-out electronic forms (tax forms, social insurance forms), ●   licenses (small industry services, trade services, industry services), ●   etc.  The higher stages will incorporate artificial intelligence methods. Artificial neural networks may help to prepare case-specific smart contracts. Moreover, they may play important role in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) for different industries.  3)   Cooperation and support from different companies If you go to Notary Platform BTT thread or www.notary-platform.com you will see that they have listed some companies under “Cooperation and Support”. Those are the companies that are collaborating with them and will be the first one to test their product and eventually implement it to their business.  4)   Role of the token – Proof of Stake The members of the core team, working on the Notary Platform project envision the NTRY Token as a utility token, intended to play two crucial roles in the Notary Platform ecosystem. In the early stages it should serve as a means of financing the purchases of the services, offered by the Notary Platform — such as timestamped and secure contract templates. Later on, as the Notary Platform matures and moves to its own blockchain network, it will also serve as a Proof of Stake, allowing the network to run smoothly and stay secure.  Proof of Stake is one of the possible transaction validation mechanisms, ensuring a blockchain network can be trusted. At first, the Notary Platform will be built upon the Etherum blockchain network, but as it gains initial traction, the core team will immediately begin to develop a separate blockchain network, upon which the Notary Platform will be moved eventually. Once that happens, the Notary Token will assume another important role as the Proof of Stake, allowing the users to stake their NTRY Tokens and be rewarded by a percentage of the fee collected in a transaction. The reward will be automatically transferred to the user’s wallet and remain on his disposal.  5)   Product Notary Platform already has a working beta application, which will launch at the time the ICO.",False

Well done team!   https://medium.com/notary-platform/poc-notary-platform-beta-app-download-and-usage-instructions-4433f6c1bf7d   PoC Notary Platform Beta APP — download and usage instructions  Notary Platform proof of concept (PoC) or as we call it, beta release can be downloaded directly from our website (12.10.2017). For the time being it is available only for android. Installation process if pretty straight forward. You will need an .APK instaler to install it. When you finish your installation of the app, you can move towards some blockchain related things that are involved in the process of the signup. Please note that all of the blockchain things that are mandatory during the setup are only required once — for signup process.  Prerequisites  In the process of installation you will need: Ethereum Wallet Rinkeby Testnet Ethers If you don’t have Ethereum wallet or testnet ethers please follow this shott guide.  1. Creating an Ethereum Account on MEW Please create your MyEtherWallet account. The following link is the step by step guide on MEW creation (please follow the part 1 in the article): https://www.cryptocompare.com/wallets/guides/how-to-use-myetherwallet/  2. Obtaining Rinkeby Testnet Ethers To get your Testnet Ethers, come to our telegram: https://t.me/joinchat/F2wLskHLoA8UUhb3Iomt_g and our team members will be more than happy to provide it to you. Another way to get test ethers is through this link.  Getting Started with Signup Start Notary Platform Beta and click “sign up”. Fill out the blanks with your email and password and click “Register”. A verification email with Smart Contract details and your User ID will be sent to your email address.  Smart contract includes important parameters of the contract which defines the deal. Defined are seller and buyer IDs as well the unique hash of the deal as immutable proofs on the Ethereum blockchain. Conclusion As you can see our current release of the app is a working prototype/Proof of Concept in which we have proved, that the merging of blockchain and a smartphone is possible and working. Our goal in the next few months it to evolve the existing solution further and upgade it with more user friendly ways (signup process, design polishing and incorporation of some new technology).

Later on, as the Notary Platform matures and moves to its own blockchain network, it will also serve as a Proof of Stake, allowing the network to run smoothly and stay secure.  NTRY Token as the means of payment: If one defines network as a system of interconnected elements, the Notary Platform could not have been seen as one, without the NTRY Token. It will be the glue holding it together and connecting all its moving parts. In fact, one will not be able to access the Notary Platform and use its services without the NTRY Tokens in the early stages, as the NTRY Tokens will be the only means form payment of the rendered services. Obtaining and holding the NTRY Tokens will thus be necessary to participate in the network and rip its many benefits.  That said, the goal of our team is to provide the serve to the masses and allow everybody to enjoy the service of engaging into safe, timestamped, contracts on the go and without required involvement of third parties. With this vision in mind, we will eventually enable an automatic conversion of other currencies into the NTRY Token by an automated auction contract. This will allow people of all ages and walks of life to participate as they will be able to pay with various currencies. Any fee collected outside of NTRY Tokens will be used to purchase an equivalent amount of NTRY Tokens on the market and then moved to a permanent address by the auction contract. This way, the demand for NTRY Tokens will continuously increase as more and more people begin to use the Notary Platform.

The reward will be automatically transferred to the user’s wallet and remain on his disposal.  As our vision of the Notary Platform manifests itself and progressively gains traction, we will continuously improve the concept, to integrate the best possible technical solutions. The role of NTRY Token may thus expend beyond it being a means of payment for the services, rendered by the platform and perhaps even beyond it serving as the proof of stake.",False

Many ICO's have just whitepaper and imaginary plan -  you have beta already built!   And this convinced me to invest in Notary ICO!  Some more use cases with great potential are:  Arrangements within the family: wills and/or family arrangements the division of money and goods the concern for parents and/or children treaties on extradition and the distribution of assets during life endowment contracts, waiver agreements without the introduced succession promises of gifts and gift contract in case of death  Architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry:  Blockchain can provide a trustworthy infrastructure for information management during all building life-cycle stages. In case of building information modelling (BIM) usage which assumes a centralized building information model, there is a role for blockchain to manage information on who did what and when and thus provide a basis for any legal arguments that might occur. On the construction site blockchain can improve the reliability and trustworthiness of construction logbooks, works performed and material quantities recorded. In the facility maintenance phase, blockchain’s main potential is the secure storage of sensor data which are sensitive to privacy.  Lease contracts: These are contractual arrangements calling for the lessee (user) to pay the lessor (owner) for use of an asset. It simplifies the process of leasing rental property. Certifications:  A formal procedure by which an accredited or authorized person or agency assesses and verifies (and attests in writing by issuing a certificate) the attributes, characteristics, quality, qualification, or status of individuals or organizations, goods or services, procedures or processes, or events or situations, in accordance with established requirements or standards. Under this category, we can confirm various kinds of certifications with NTRY contracts. From fitness (personal trainer) certification, scuba diving, and learning a new language, to finishing business courses — just to give you some examples. The goal of this kind of contract is to prevent forging certifications and give people credible sources of knowledge.  Warranties on products and services: Usually a written guarantee of the integrity of a product and of the maker’s responsibility for the repair or replacement of defective parts or the contractor’s responsibility for the work/service done. Meaning, with the services done on your car, house, boat etc., everyone wants some warranty in case something goes wrong after the work is completed. The proposed NTRY contract is ideal just for that. With the signed contract, you have the security that you need if anything goes wrong after the contractor is gone.  Grants of easements: An easement is a legal right to use another’s land for a specific limited purpose.  Letters of credit: For the time being, a letter of credit is a letter from a bank guaranteeing that a buyer’s payment to a seller will be received on time and for the correct amount. Due to the nature of international dealings, the use of letters of credit has become a very important aspect of international trade, which can be further and more successfully facilitated with NTRY contracts (blockchain technology and/or smart contracts). One of successful solutions to this problem has been already presented by consortium R3.  Option contracts: An option contract is an agreement between two parties to exchange the ownership of goods with a transaction of the underlying items (land, house, cars, phones …) at a preset price. This option is the first and the most basic use case. It could be used as a form of safety for buying land, buying (used) cars, apartments, houses, and so on. The uses of this use case alone are countless. An exclusive product’s traceability of limited editions: Examples of this are limited edition prints, issues of rare batches/series of wine etc. A well-known example are Casascius coins (see https://casascius.uberbills.com/). Minutes of meetings (associations, companies, organizations …): Minutes are the official written record of meetings of an organization or a group. They are not transcripts of these proceedings. The minutes should contain mainly a record of what was done at the meeting, not what was said by the members. The organization may have its own rules regarding the content of the minutes. Etc.  Which markets is the Notary Platform targeting? There are a lot of markets in which Notary Platform application can speed up the process and guarantee more safety and transparency. The goal of the platform is to cover all of the markets, starting with the most complex (regarding the safety and integration) »Customer to customer« and move on to the wider and more regulated markets. Final integration will happen with »Government to business« market.  Customer to customer (C2C) C2C, or customer to customer, or consumer to consumer, is a business model that facilitates the transaction of products or services between customers. It is the starting point of Notary Platform integration in the real life use cases. Examples of C2C services are literally unlimited. Some of them are: Contracts between two persons (selling/buying a car, renting an apartment, marriage contracts, …) Last will and testament Grants of easement Certifications Business to customer (B2C)  B2C, or business-to-consumer, is the type of commerce transaction in which businesses sell products or services to consumers. The main difference between C2C is, that the customer is engaging in a relationship with business instead of another customer. Examples of B2C services: Warranties (warranty for services or product) Certifications (successfully completed diving/climbing/IT course) Services (Notary Platform can be an addition to the existing notary/bank/insurance services).  Business to business (B2B) This term simply means business-to-business, which is a model that focuses on selling products and services to other companies. B2B is often contrasted against business-to-consumer (B2C). In B2B commerce it is often the case that the parties to the relationship have comparable negotiating power, and even when they don’t, each party typically involves professional staff and legal counsel in the negotiation of terms, whereas B2C is shaped to a far greater degree by economic implications of information asymmetry. We can clearly see the fit for Notary Platform in those B2B relationships.  Examples are: Contracts between the companies Loans (bank to company) Services (notary services, insurance services) Transaction validations Services for operational reasons Government to customer (G2C)  Government to consumer markets provide numerous opportunities for consumers, both private and commercial, to take advantage of the many government offerings available. G2C business involves everything from grants and loans to copies of property transactions and credit reports. Government contracts can be very lucrative and constitute a huge market for government to consumer businesses. Examples of G2C services are: Educational services (applications for scholarships, applications for student loans) Judicial services (child adoption process, apply for organ transplant, apply for name change) Citizen details (every change of personal details) Government to business (G2B)  G2B is the relationship between institutions of public administration and enterprises. In this model the initiative comes from the government and businesses are the target group. It includes laws and regulations targeting businesses, official communications by government and regulatory agencies, tender processes etc. The relationship may refer the demand for information from the enterprises in any life situation or a transfer of an official document to the statutory body. The model is usually used to refer to the ICT solution that converts such communication to the electronic form or to describe a solution that simplifies the communication between public administration and enterprises (e.g. internet portal of the procurement authority or electronic solutions for purchasing). Examples of G2B / B2G services are:  Government procurement Electronic incorporation forms Updating corporate information Sending filled-out electronic forms (e.g. tax forms, social insurance forms) Licenses (e.g. small industry services, trade services, industry services)",False

We are preparing the part 2. It will be published in coming days.  Quote from: masstahcoiner on October 08, 2017, 11:43:59 AM I would invest 200eth  if someone from team explain me why should i invest in Notary Platform ICO?  And why i should HODL NTRY token long term in my portfolio?  I read whitepaper and everything but i am interested of your vision why should i invest?  Regards  Masstahcoiner  There are a few reasons I think you should have NTRY token in your portfolio....I will try to make is as short as possible:  1)   Project Notary tackles one of the largest and most common problems in business and life; Safely creating, signing and storing digital contracts.  The solution we offer? A mobile application built on the blockchain framework. The application offers the use of templates for standard contracts for different real-life cases in an intuitive and user-friendly interface.   2)   Endless use cases and business opportunities The Notary platform will be built in 3 stages. Below are a few examples of use cases for each stage.  In the first, the application will be targeted at the general population where it will let individuals create, store and sign documents such as: ●   sale or lease of property, ●   marriage contracts, ●   last will and testament, ●   grants of easement, ●   etc.  In the second stage the application will be targeted at businesses. Some practical examples where the application might be used are: ●   contracts between companies, ●   loans (bank to company) ●   services (notary services, insurance services) ●   transaction validations, ●   etc.  In the third and final stage the application will be adapted for use in governmental agencies in matters such as: ●   government procurement, ●   electronic incorporation forms, ●   updating corporate information, ●   sending filled-out electronic forms (tax forms, social insurance forms), ●   licenses (small industry services, trade services, industry services), ●   etc.  The higher stages will incorporate artificial intelligence methods. Artificial neural networks may help to prepare case-specific smart contracts. Moreover, they may play important role in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) for different industries.  3)   Cooperation and support from different companies If you go to Notary Platform BTT thread or www.notary-platform.com you will see that we have listed some companies under “Cooperation and Support”. Those are the companies that are collaborating with us and will be the first one to test our product and eventually implement it to their business.  4)   Role of the token – Proof of Stake NTRY Token is a utility token, intended to play two crucial roles in the Notary Platform ecosystem. In the early stages it should serve as a means of financing the purchases of the services, offered by the Notary Platform — such as timestamped and secure contract templates. Later on, as the Notary Platform matures and moves to its own blockchain network, it will also serve as a Proof of Stake, allowing the network to run smoothly and stay secure.  What is Proof of Stake? Once we transition to our own network/sidechain, the NTRY Token will assume another important role as the Proof of Stake, allowing the users to stake their NTRY Tokens and be rewarded by a percentage of the fee collected in a transaction. The reward will be automatically transferred to the user’s wallet and remain on his disposal.  5)   Product We already have a working beta application, which will launch at the time of the ICO.  Those are a few of the reasons of why I would hold NTRY tokens  Best, S.",False

The members of the core team, working on the Notary Platform project envision the NTRY Token as a utility token, intended to play two crucial roles in the Notary Platform ecosystem. In the early stages it should serve as a means of financing the purchases of the services, offered by the Notary Platform — such as timestamped and secure contract templates. Later on, as the Notary Platform matures and moves to its own blockchain network, it will also serve as a Proof of Stake, allowing the network to run smoothly and stay secure.  NTRY Token as the means of payment: If one defines network as a system of interconnected elements, the Notary Platform could not have been seen as one, without the NTRY Token. It will be the glue holding it together and connecting all its moving parts. In fact, one will not be able to access the Notary Platform and use its services without the NTRY Tokens in the early stages, as the NTRY Tokens will be the only means form payment of the rendered services. Obtaining and holding the NTRY Tokens will thus be necessary to participate in the network and rip its many benefits.  That said, the goal of our team is to provide the serve to the masses and allow everybody to enjoy the service of engaging into safe, timestamped, contracts on the go and without required involvement of third parties. With this vision in mind, we will eventually enable an automatic conversion of other currencies into the NTRY Token by an automated auction contract. This will allow people of all ages and walks of life to participate as they will be able to pay with various currencies. Any fee collected outside of NTRY Tokens will be used to purchase an equivalent amount of NTRY Tokens on the market and then moved to a permanent address by the auction contract. This way, the demand for NTRY Tokens will continuously increase as more and more people begin to use the Notary Platform.  NTRY Token as the Proof of Stake: Proof of Stake is one of the possible transaction validation mechanisms, ensuring a blockchain network can be trusted. At first, the Notary Platform will be built upon the Etherum blockchain network, but as it gains initial traction, the core team will immediately begin to develop a separate blockchain network, upon which the Notary Platform will be moved eventually. Once that happens, the Notary Token will assume another important role as the Proof of Stake, allowing the users to stake their NTRY Tokens and be rewarded by a percentage of the fee collected in a transaction. The reward will be automatically transferred to the user’s wallet and remain on his disposal.

Thats why we have a legal team amongst the advisors, to sort these things out and make them legaly acceptable.  Photos, video and voice recording are not there to proove your identity. The option to add media is there with another reason. Example: you make a video of the car you are purchasing, so if anything goes wrong you have a proof of the state of the car in the time you have purchased it.  No, you can not include a selfie you have taken down from facebook. You can only include a selfie you are taking in that exact moment, and not before. The app will not approve that you add photos from library that existed before.  Lets go to the proof of identity. Do you have mobile bank in your country? They have a system that they are sending you a key (like google authenticator) which is enough to prove that the one signing was you.  I will ask our developer to come and explain to you some more of the technical stuff behind the proof of identity, in our case, so you know it is safe to use.  Regards, Saso",False

As I said, all of this will be explained by our legal team and by our devs. They will make an article about that, because this is the issue many are worried about, and I must say, that this was our first priority at the start od development.  You are asking of how to make a contract? You dont have to do anything. There will be a template, and each user will fill only the required fields out. There will also be an option of editing the contracts.  Security of what? Your identity? We developed a system which is secure. Our devs will talk more about this soon.

What will be the shortest time to create and certify a contract (a standard one, if it requires specialists, I assume it will be longer to create it) ?  Regards  The standard contracts will have templates, which will be editable to some degree. You can engage immediately in that kind of contract. We will try to cover more contract in time and list them as standard templates.  The most time you will loose, will be the first time you will use the app (sign up data), which will take you about 5minutes for establishing your identity. Later on, when we upgrade it with facial recognition will be also quicker.  More advanced contracts will logicaly take longer, because they will be tailored to your needs. Unfortunately I can not give you a timeframe for that at this point.  Regards, Saso",False

To provide you a better feeling for this we decided to devote this blog post about the application which will connect the blockchain technology with the notary services (and vice versa).  The integration of different digital sources will be offered for users to use. The sources could be used separately or in combination. These include: - templates or written and then scanned forms - sound - picture - video - proof of existence (e.g. facial recognition, a retina scan) - (the possibility to upload a digital file or just the hash of a digital file in case of confidential data).    The picture above, shows a rough process of how engaging in contracts on a go will work.  Our main focus is on two different and equaly important things. Design and functionality. The design of the Notary App is intended to be clean and minimalistic and with only necessary features included, so everyone can use it intuitively and understand it from the beginning on.  The basic features/functions included in the first official release, are:  Contracts First feature that the user will come across in the Notary Platform app is the possibility for using the templates of various contracts. There will be specifically designed templates of contract awailable for different geographical regions (different laws,…), that you just add your personal information, and that is it.  Second option under “Contracts” will be the option which enables you to upload your own contract. Later on we will make it possible for customer to request an individual contract tailored to his needs.  Example: You want to buy a car or rent an apartment? You just use the designed template meant for buying a car and fill out the fields with required data.  Media Each contract will have an option to add some form of safety which will serve as an additional proof in front of the court of law. For now, we are looking to implement audio, photo and video recordings (+proof of existence — fingerprint, retina scan and facial recognition) to contracts and run them through blockchain technology together, under one hash.  Example: Before you sign a contract you have an option (for the safety of both parties involved) to take a video of the state of the car you are buying. The video will be added to the contract.  Storage Signed contracts will be stored by the parties involved (their email), in the cloud and/or by Notary Platform (later on).  Payment NTRY token will be used as a method of payment for the services inside Notary Platform. Of course we will also accept other currencies as $,€ and £. Our goal is to cover wide range of people (all generations and all life scenarios).  Please note, that this app is intended for the stage 1 of Notary Platform Project. Later on, many of features (smart contract, AI tech., combination of both, etc. ) will be unlocked/added. Beta version of Notary Platform App (for testing purposes) will be available at the end of September.  Regards, S.",False

G2C business involves everything from grants and loans to copies of property transactions and credit reports. Government contracts can be very lucrative and constitute a huge market for government to consumer businesses. Examples of G2C services are: - Educational services (applications for scholarships, applications for student loans) - Judicial services (child adoption process, apply for organ transplant, apply for name change) - Citizen details (every change of personal details) - Etc.  Government to business (G2B) G2B is the relationship between institutions of public administration and enterprises. In this model the initiative comes from the government and businesses are the target group. It includes laws and regulations targeting businesses, official communications by government and regulatory agencies, tender processes etc. The relationship may refer the demand for information from the enterprises in any life situation or a transfer of an official document to the statutory body. The model is usually used to refer to the ICT solution that converts such communication to the electronic form or to describe a solution that simplifies the communication between public administration and enterprises (e.g. internet portal of the procurement authority or electronic solutions for purchasing). Examples of G2B / B2G services are: - Government procurement - Electronic incorporation forms - Updating corporate information - Sending filled-out electronic forms (e.g. tax forms, social insurance forms) - Licenses (e.g. small industry services, trade services, industry services) - Etc.  EU parliament - dr. Ziga Turk will present our project in front of the EU politicians.  Regards, Saso",False

Quote from: albertdros on August 27, 2017, 12:06:22 PM Cool project and nice graphics. I really like the logo. Why does this project need to be on a blockchain though?  Hey albertdros,  Let me ask you something. Is the contract legal binding if you and I engage in it, via an app, without blockchain tech behind and without the presence of a notary?  Blockchain is essential for providing a timestamp which makes a contract legal binding. This is how you eliminate a third person (notary) which was not possible before.  This is the short version. If you want, I can go in to the detail and explain it further.  Regards, Saso",False

A lot of companies are developing something similar, even Microsoft is trying to implement something in the MS office (as far as I know)  We are specializing for the Notary process on the go. Our plan is to make an app for:  1) general public (C2C) 2) businesses (B2B; B2C) 3) governmental purposes (G2B; G2C)  Beta version of the Notary Platform app for general public will be available around the ICO (so in one month!).  Business app will be the next step. We have companies that will test our product (and implement it), and more companies are still to be announced.  Further on we will move to our own blockchain and enable POS. ""Our own blockchain"" is meant as a sidechain (plasma like- we really like it but want to see how they will be implementing it) or we go totally on our own. Point is, we dont want that ""ethereum overload"" happen again, Imagine people waiting 10-15h for a confirmation of a contract on a car...it doesnt make sense and we can not afford that. Especially now, that we have companies that are counting on us to provide them safer, faster and cheaper solutions for their businesses.  How will we compete with Silent Notary? The people will decide who they trust, simple.  Regards, Saso",False

In June we had a presale. then all went silent from our side, because we focused on development of the app, acquiring the companies, marketing and so on ( see full list a few posts back).  In the meantime competition came to BTT....I will not comment about the fact that they (may or may not) copied our idea - I wish them luck -  but yeah, thats one more reason to it, of why you see ""notary"" so much (they have similar name).  Why the new thread? We are back, stronger than before, with an amazing team, advisors and companies that are supporting us (and want to implement our solitions in their businesses), and we are going for the ICO with the intention to establish a company which will be amongst the top of the companies that are, or will be, offering Notary solutions on the go (based on blockchain) to general public, businesses and governments.  regards, Saso",False
