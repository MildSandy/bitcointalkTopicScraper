They are meant for those who want to help us build this project at this very early stage.  They will give various discount for the future RGE crowd sale after October. To sum up, every ether invested in RGXn will give the right to get n times the current price when you will buy RGE (for example with 2.5 ether of RGX9, in case you want to buy 2.5 ether of RGE, you will receive automatically a bonus of 2.5 x 9 times = 22.5 ether of RGE).
