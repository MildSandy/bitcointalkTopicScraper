Updates from PAYPIE.  We acknowledge that the further clarifications are necessary for the community to better understand the situation we face regarding the regulatory scene in our local crypto space. Canada is a very rigorous and responsible country, and we respect our premium institutions and regulatory bodies. It is our understanding that only companies that fully abide by guidelines can thrive and remain viable in the long term.  As some of you know, our team has been in direct, close, and constant contact with our local regulators since July 2017, so far over 10 long months now. We have been nothing but completely cooperative. Our founders have personally spent over 500 hours directly working with our legal team toward achieving an efficient outcome and we are making positive progress. We strongly believe that we have the best legal team in the country in place to move things forward in this kind of environment.   Despite all this effort, things have been taking vastly longer than we all expected and that is causing everybody unnecessary hassles that are out of our control. The company won't adopt a reckless posture and act according to its own will disregarding what the competent bodies might think or say. Our team is aware that there are other companies in similar positions that are choosing that path and doing things their own way. We don't see a bright future coming from such practices. A look at the history shows us that Napster was doomed even after having the first-mover advantage while Spotify and iTunes are still thriving for having engaged with regulators to solve a real problem.   The scope of this update is to inform the community that the team shares your frustration. The company and the community are in the same boat together. All navigating through rough waters in the pursuit of peaceful times that is coming as we move forward on a certainly positive path. We are developing a business to grow in a way that is strategically correct for the long run. We are building PayPie to thrive for years to come, and we can do it better while working with regulatory bodies. We do understand the importance of having a platform where tokens can be bought and sold in a safe and secure environment and we will pursue it at the right time.  We also know that sometimes the community can be anxious about more frequent updates from the team and we have tried to keep you updated with one or two monthly emails. It's important to keep in mind that we are also always available for clarifications through our Contact Us form on our website.  There are numerous improvements being done on the platform. We are currently working on an entire cash flow forecasting system to be implemented in the coming weeks. This will let SMEs clearly see when they would be in a negative cash flow position so that they can plan ahead and take advantage of invoice factoring for immediate access to cash. The cash flow forecasting will feed the data right into our credit risk assessment on the blockchain and will be invaluable.   The SMEs outreach has been constant, and we now have more than 200 (!) SMEs signed up. That's a quite respectable number already for only one month of Beta and we will make full efforts for it to keep growing exponentially with time. A good number of them have successfully connected their QBO accounts to the platform and the remaining ones will also be onboarded. We have a real-value-first approach to achieving our goals. Real value first, viral exposure later – not the other way around.   We are also thrilled to share that one of the most skilled experts in the content writing fintech industry has joined our ranks – our new Content Writer and Strategist, Michelle Mire. She is debuting on the PayPie blog with a rock-solid article about reporting, cash flow and how to improve your business' financial health, so go nuts and share it at will: https://blog.paypie.com/uncategorized/reporting-cash-flow-and-your-business-financial-health/  Best,   Yohan Varella CMO",False

My understanding is that Paypie are not in a position to list their tokens on such exchanges due to concerns from regulators in Canada. They have been engaged in a conversation with them from very early on in their development and are being required to show the utility of their token before being able to get the exemption which would allow them to list without having to complete the paperwork required to be listed as a security.

First, let's start with the main meat - Beta of our soon to be launched platform by the end of the month. Everything is on track and PayPie will have a Beta out of the gate within the next two weeks. That's close!   Our goal is to showcase the real work that is being done behind the scenes so you can have an idea of the breadth that PayPie will deliver on. If you are an SME (small and medium-sized enterprise), you will be able to directly connect your accounting software to PayPie with the click of a button. The platform will then apply its unique algorithm and perform a complete credit risk assessment of your business' s financial health and will give it a score to be hashed on the Ethereum blockchain. That means you can join PayPie as soon as we launch Beta and provide us the valuable feedback so that you can make your business ready to leverage the immense benefits that come with stellar financial performance analysis.   And Beta won't come alone. With it, PayPie's marketing campaigns will kick-off to bring the platform the exposure it deserves. We have developed a comprehensive marketing strategy that will be put in place and both SMEs and crypto audiences are at the core of it. During the initial Beta stages, our marketing efforts will be focused on creating awareness and bringing SMEs on the platform to spread adoption while enabling our risk analysis team to perfect the risk forecast.   Our brand new website will also come with Beta along with improved branding and our complete long-term value propositions. The website, as the platform, will reflect a real-world company with a real-world product that solves real-world problems. We are not about mere speculation, we are not about mere hype, we are about empowering token holders, accountants, lenders, and businesses with invaluable tools to transform their financials.   The PayPie Credit Marketplace will connect SMEs with potential invoice buyers and its functionalities will also be introduced with Beta in stages. At launch, Beta will feature test tokens so security procedures and bug-hunts can be implemented and optimized before real token operations take place. The safety of all funds handled on the platform will always come first and market best standards should be followed.  And then there are the regulatory aspects of remaining compliant. That is something that our team takes EXTREMELY seriously and we completely believe it will be a major differentiation factor in the blockchain field. As you know, our team sought to ensure compliance with the applicable local laws and have been in constant communication with the respective authorities in Canada from the very beginning. There are no shortcuts if one aims to disrupt the fintech industry while remaining compliant. We know that the road is long and painfully slow and we much appreciate your support during all this time, but this road has an end. We are in the final stages and we fully expect to have everything finalized before long. We can say that we are truly close. We. Are. Almost. There.  So stay fresh guys. The very best is yet to be served!  Cheers,   Yohan Varella CMO",False

I wouldn't have believed Paypie would be so undervalued if people told me earlier during the ico. It's undervalued and not talked about much at public discussions. So I think It's because most people aren't aware of the project's concepts or most investors are just obsessed with vaporwares and hypes.,False

PAYPIE CREDIT RISK ASSESSMENT TO BE ADOPTED BY DEBITUM NETWORK  VANCOUVER, Canada, February 9, 2018 – PayPie and Debitum Network announced today that the business credit risk assessment powered by blockchain technology provided by PayPie will be adopted by Debitum Network as its dedicated blockchain-based risk score provider for business loans exclusively for businesses in North America.  The PayPie and the Debitum teams have come to an agreement for developing a partnership with joint interests in expanding their array of benefits to broader audiences across platforms. Debitum’s CEO, Mārtiņš Liberts, said that “Debitum aims to tackle the SMEs global loan markets with constant focus on technology innovation and growth, and bringing the PayPie credit risk assessment to scrutinize businesses in North America and beyond will bring even more value to our users by granting additional trust and reliability for them to make better informed decisions.”  The partnership will involve joint efforts toward developing an integration between the platforms so Debitum Network users can directly access the PayPie scores from within the platform for greater convenience. PayPie PPP tokens will be needed for accessing the platform’s credit score, so PayPie and Debitum will agree on initially exchanging PPP tokens for Debitum DEB tokens to seed user adoption. Afterwards, PPP tokens should be directly used by Debitum users or by the Debitum platform for accessing the PayPie credit score and make it directly available through the platform.

All of my experiences with this team have been optimum. They always over-deliver on their promises, and sooner or later people will realize that PayPie has the exact same type of invoice factoring system built-in to it like Populous, and so in my honest opinion I would not be surprised at all if we see the price do a 30-60X increase by the time the platform is launched (March- April) and when they finally get listed on large exchanges. Right now it is only available on EtherDelta which people find difficult to use. This is a smart investment in my opinion and I have had many friends invest large amounts into this project as-well. There is a reason that they are not listed on any large exchange at the moment and that is because of Canadian Regulation. The Alpha must complete first to prove the tokens utility before Canadian regulators will give them an exemption from filing as a security. I have done a ton of research and I also live here in Canada where PayPie is located. The investment is a no-brainer in my opinion.",False

It is very hard for people to understand why this project is just as valuable as populous - actually it is more valuable due to the accounting aspect built-in.  The project needs to be discovered, and until it reaches exchanges and the marketing starts, it wont be discovered. Give it some time and the price for this token will explode due to what the token does. Any money invested into PayPie is at very little risk. Even if the token itself was to stay at a very low price, once the company finishes its beta and does a full launch, the price will skyrocket for three reasons:  A) Many of us investors will be using our tokens to buy invoices and make the 2-5% monthly profit, which means there will be very few tokens on the market for sale. This means supply and demand rules will come into effect. Less tokens listed on the exchanges, people can ask a higher price for them.  B)The PayPie token will be listed on multiple large exchanges and thus the price should  match or come very close to that of Populous, which in my opinion by that time should be around $100+. Right now the token is not listed on any exchanges because PayPie is working with Canadian regulators to get their license and securities exemption (that is in part the reason for the alpha only being related to the utility of the risk-score algorithm). PayPie is used to dealing with Canadian regulators since before the ICO even started. I am located in Canada, I know the financial laws enough to understand what PayPie is going through and that they will Succeed.  C) PayPie is being built in the same office as their parent company is located. Many people don't know that PayPie has a pre-existing company dating back to 2013/2014 which is called SlickPie and it has nothing to do with blockchain. It is an online accounting platform that people around the world have been using for the past few years. You can compare SlickPie to companies like Sage, Quickbooks Online, Xero, etc... So what does this mean? PayPie is building on top of their pre-existing business which has been very successful with tens of thousands of customers (small to medium size enterprises - SMEs).  One reason many people are confused about PayPie and do not yet see the tremendous value in this token, is because the invoice factoring part of PayPie is not being heavily promoted, and again, that is because of Canadian Regulation. Once people start learning that PayPie is like Populous on Steriods, the price will reflect that.   I have been researching and studying PayPie since it was first announced. If anyone has any questions for me regarding PayPie, I would be happy to answer them for you. You can ask me on here through a private message or in this thread.",False

Surprise, surprise, Alpha is here! Yay! Yes, we know it's not the 31st yet, and yes, we know we're two days EARLIER than announced, but that's just how we roll! Better and faster all the way up! PayPie style!  So, first things first, let me brief you a little on what this Alpha is all about in three main points:  This is an Alpha version, which means that it’s a very basic version of how the core platform will look like once it’s fully done. In other words, it’s just a slight taste and feel of the real big things to come.   However, even despite being an Alpha, the tremendously important thing to have in mind is that the data you'll see is being directly pulled from companies connected with an accounting solution! The test companies are set up in an accounting solution and PayPie is frequently fetching the info straight from the source! And then (*dramatic sound effect*) the platform is applying the PayPie credit risk assessment algorithm to generate the scores and results you'll see! It's a working product, not screenshots!   Another main purpose of an Alpha version is to find areas of improvement on the platform, so please email our team regarding any feedback that you’d like to share. Alpha data will be frequently updated to correct data errors or issues that come up so go nuts! On a side note, we have a potential partnership being developed and they are performing security audit and stress tests on the platform, so if you experience any lag or crash that will likely be a temporary issue for this week only. The big guys are coming!  And that's basically it! Now that Alpha is out, our team is going full throttle at developing Beta. We expect to have it launched very, very soon. Things are going better than ever! As you know, Beta will bring all those wonderful functionalities that you all want to see, so stay tuned! Go ahead and enjoy Alpha while you can because it won’t last long! So here it is, the PAYPIE ALPHA: https://alpha.paypie.com  Enjoy!  Cheers,   Yohan Varella CMO",False

And if you are an SME selling on credit, you must be feeling credit stress on a fairly regular basis. The world today needs a solution that can look at financial data and offer tools to ward off fraud to propel businesses to the next level.  PayPie is disrupting the way business is being done. Our credit risk analysis along with blockchain-powered publicly visible Credit Risk Scores is going to help millions of SMEs change their financial expectations.  In a relatively short period, our platform is introducing a product and that has been out of reach to SME’s worldwide.  The alpha version of our platform is officially being launched on January 31, 2018, and we couldn’t be happier about it. Our whole team has been putting the highest effort and care to develop this wonderful way for SMEs to improve their realities. This alpha version will be solely focused on the credit risk assessment side so you can have a good taste of what’s to come.  Alphas are known for being far from perfect, but we are very happy with the way the platform is behaving so far and we hope you will be too.  PayPie will not only analyze accounting data and apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) analytics to see whether a business will succeed or default, but will also support an entire ecosystem. Accountants will be able to give their clients actionable financial insights, lenders will be able to reduce underwriting times and costs, an investor in South Africa will be able to provide credit to a business in USA, all because of our cloud infrastructure powered by blockchain thus opening new doors for endless possibilities that reinvigorate the economy.  I would love to live in a decentralized world, but today we still need to integrate with the pre-existing global economy. That being said, we have already built the core framework that will allow us to focus on USA\Canada first and to expand globally in a scalable way based on our success in these markets. We are starting with the credit risk assessment side of the platform and we will share other details on further services at the right time.  We at the PayPie are very confident and excited about our vision. I have never seen a community and team more inspired, dedicated and talented than the ones we are blessed in having. Collectively, we will bring peace of mind to both SMEs and thousands of our supporters who are waiting for us to change the world.  PayPie, you will like it hot!",False

Yes my friends, our delightful alpha version is coming on the early side of our hopes! Our team is always putting our hearts and souls into the development of this platform that I guess things are conspiring in our favor because our alpha is already looking hot and steamy!  I myself have been diving deep into the UI and UX waters to help our developers bring not only a world-class technical platform for you, but a platform that looks and feels great, a platform that you just can’t get your hands out of. Of course, this is still an alpha version and alphas are well known for being far from perfect, but we are very happy with the overall performance of it and I’m sure you will be too! So without further ado:  THE PAYPIE ALPHA WILL BE OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED ON JANUARY 31!  Our alpha version will solely focus on the credit risk assessment side of the platform. That part should be first polished so we can then move on to deeper waters knowing that all data will be as accurate as we envision. This will be a great opportunity for the community to FLOOD us with feedback to help us take PayPie to the crypto Olympus!  And hey, we have another outstanding news for you! After getting hundreds and hundreds of emails from people interested in joining out alpha testing phase we decided to run a completely PUBLIC ALPHA testing open for all willing to join! Woo-hoo!

Getting stuff done in the background and not constantly diverting time from development to make announcements that they wrote another few lines of code and had a smoothie. This is the kind of dedication that speaks volumes. Getting deliverables ready ahead of schedule and *fingers crossed* having them hit a home run on their first trip to the plate.

At this point in time 20-30 gas is a minimum, which is driving transaction fees through the roof. What happened to the days of a 10 gwei transaction being confirmed in under a minute? Is it just post-kitties everyone is now using 20 gwei as a floor and this will continue to creep up as more people look for a slightly faster transaction making 40 be the new norm in a month and 80 the next month.

Oh yeah! Oh 2018... Such a young year and already bringing so much joy to our hearts. Yes my friends, our delightful alpha version is coming on the early side of our hopes! Our team is always putting our hearts and souls into the development of this platform that I guess things are conspiring in our favor because our alpha is already looking hot and steamy!  I myself have been diving deep into the UI and UX waters to help our developers bring not only a world-class technical platform for you, but a platform that looks and feels great, a platform that you just can't get your hands out of. Of course, this is still an alpha version and alphas are well known for being far from perfect, but we are very happy with the overall performance of it and I'm sure you will be too! So without further ado:  THE PAYPIE ALPHA WILL BE OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED ON JANUARY 31!  Our alpha version will solely focus on the credit risk assessment side of the platform. That part should be first polished so we can then move on to deeper waters knowing that all data will be as accurate as we envision. This will be a great opportunity for the community to FLOOD us with feedback to help us take PayPie to the crypto Olympus!  And hey, we have another outstanding news for you! After getting hundreds and hundreds of emails from people interested in joining out alpha testing phase we decided to run a completely PUBLIC ALPHA testing open for all willing to join! Woo-hoo!

And if you are an SME selling on credit, you must be feeling credit stress on a fairly regular basis. The world today needs a solution that can look at financial data and offer tools to ward off fraud to propel businesses to the next level.  PayPie is disrupting the way business is being done. Our credit risk analysis along with blockchain-powered publicly visible Credit Risk Scores is going to help millions of SMEs change their financial expectations.  In a relatively short period, our platform is introducing a product and that has been out of reach to SME’s worldwide.  The alpha version of our platform is officially being launched on January 31, 2018, and we couldn’t be happier about it. Our whole team has been putting the highest effort and care to develop this wonderful way for SMEs to improve their realities. This alpha version will be solely focused on the credit risk assessment side so you can have a good taste of what’s to come.  Alphas are known for being far from perfect, but we are very happy with the way the platform is behaving so far and we hope you will be too.  PayPie will not only analyze accounting data and apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) analytics to see whether a business will succeed or default, but will also support an entire ecosystem. Accountants will be able to give their clients actionable financial insights, lenders will be able to reduce underwriting times and costs, an investor in South Africa will be able to provide credit to a business in USA, all because of our cloud infrastructure powered by blockchain thus opening new doors for endless possibilities that reinvigorate the economy.  I would love to live in a decentralized world, but today we still need to integrate with the pre-existing global economy. That being said, we have already built the core framework that will allow us to focus on USA\Canada first and to expand globally in a scalable way based on our success in these markets. We are starting with the credit risk assessment side of the platform and we will share other details on further services at the right time.  We at the PayPie are very confident and excited about our vision. I have never seen a community and team more inspired, dedicated and talented than the ones we are blessed in having. Collectively, we will bring peace of mind to both SMEs and thousands of our supporters who are waiting for us to change the world.  PayPie, you will like it hot!",False

I email Paypie and I got to admit it was an extreme professional and well thought out email. I have heard of issues around tokens and securities and that I get now is a real issue.  All token need to be very careful they are not miss represented as security. Which makes sense other wise there is regularitity issues. Paypie is no different. So the token needs to be used as that a function of the network.  Therefor until the platform is ready and working there is no use for the token other then speculation. Which, makes it look like a security rather then a utility token. Once the platform is up and working the token can be added to exchanges as the utility has a use.  I’m guessing there is a whole heap of reasons to not make your utility look like a security. I’m not sure of the specifics however I did happen to read bittrex won’t accept any token that is being treated like a security and it is possible other exchanges have the same policy.  So if your waiting for Paypie to be added to more exchanges hold you tokens until the platform is up and working.",False

Hi ***** Thanks for reaching out. PPP is a utility token that can be used for credit risk assessment and other services offered by PayPie platform.   Regarding your question about listing PPP on other exchanges, as PayPie tokens (PPP) are utility tokens, we as a company, cannot and will not be actively involved in discussions regarding trading tokens/ market price/ future price estimates/ exchanges. However, all measures for the platform’s development are already being taken and our team is now putting all their efforts on delivering the roadmap milestones. PayPie platform is moving forward as expected, which means it is just a matter of time until the platform’s benefits can be available to all token holders. Once the platform is ready, we will support information from exchanges if they request it.   Please let us know if you have any other questions.

I’m sure the Paypie team monitor these forums so I guess it’s approriate to comment here and assume they will see it.  I saw an email a while ago, from a telegram user who emailed Yohan regarding PPP being added to other exchanges. His response some what shocked me and really has stuck me. He stated that Paypie where not Interested in having their tokens being added to other exchanges as the ppp token was a function of the network and not a token purely for being traded.  It got me thinking and how tokens really give you no assureance of what your actually buying. These tokens don’t give you a right to the profits or offer you any opportunity to profit. We have basically handed over cash for them, with absolutely no understanding of what will return value for us. Their not shares and even if Paypie was hugely successful what’s stopping Paypie effectively never using these tokens for anything.  I’ve watched a lot of you tube videos and even asked on telegram. I’ve noticed when asked Paypie almost always dodges the question of the purpose of the ppp token.  This leads me to my next problem. The only place to trade Paypie is Etherdelta. Since the recent hack of Etherdelta Paypie has struggled to hold its value. Etherdelta it seems, is now not trusted by the general community of crpto traders. If it did disappear their is absolutely no where to trade this token and given the attitude of Paypie it’s unlikely they would want it to be traded on exchanges. Etherdelta in itself isn’t really an exchange, more a market place for people to swap their tokens for ether directly. So as someone who owns several hundred of thousands of Paypie where do I go from here? Paypie is an awesome project that I 100% believe in. Yet I have no idea if it is successful if I’ll even profit from this ! I have no idea if in the future I’ll be able to exchange this token for cash. Given the huge  amount of money I have tied up in this, it is deeply concerns me. Looking st the price seems I’m not the only person with these concerns and do I just dump and run from here, I’ve made good money but get out while the times are good.  I’m an descrite for some guidance on this as are others. I think it’s a fair question. If Paypie don’t want to add PPP to other exchanges, they should be transparent about it. Obviously we all got into this to make money and I believe it is only fair the investors who helped build this platform profit from it.",False

PayPie is not like some many other projects that need only a good dev team to work, the success of PayPie depend on many real bussiness using the plataform. They already have many real bussiness from SlickPie and many others, so for they make it work they need to remain a total legal and functional company so this bussiness are allowed to deal with PayPie.  To remain a total legal and functional company they need to make sure that the PPP token is seeing as a pure Utility Token (what it is!).

Is because of that they do not talk about exchanges or the price of the token, thats does not mean they can't (or will not) add the token in a exchange, is just that they will not do it without a product (a use of PPP as utility), because they are expericed and do not want to screw this over!!!

For those of you who invest and then cry because the price went down, maybe should reevaluate what your strategy is.  Don't go blasting a project because you didn't get a 10x or 50x return when you bought in.  These projects take time to develop.  Go to the whitepaper for additional information if necessary.  Don't invest more than you're willing to lose.  Do your own research, there is a ton of sites and information out there! I understand there is a herd of people moving into the crypto space, I get it, you saw someone go from nothing to a millionaire in a week or so and you want a piece of the action! Been there done that, but don't get all pissy when it doesn't happen for you and then cry foul or it's a scam because you lost on your initial investment.  These companies are just starting up and it will take time to develop.  Get a bag full when you can, have patience and sit back and ride it out.  Paypie from various sources I have is looking at a pretty good increase for 2018...anywhere from $8-15 dollars...even Clif High has mentioned this as well.  He's been uncannily accurate on crypto for awhile now.  No, hes not right about everything, but, some of this stuff he's mentioned, I've bought, and, well it's been pretty good to be honest.  So just get you a bag when you can and HODL for the long haul.  PPP is currently up 30% today and really, .75 cents is a steal in my opinion considering where it will be this time next year.  Look at it like this, ETH was $9 this time last year...yea, where we at today in ETH....$460 currently?  Exactly!!!! Just HODL guys and have some patience.

Hello PayPiers!  First things first. If you haven't done so already, take a 10 second break from all the Black Friday fun you've been having and vote now for PayPie's Best Concept nomination in the SBBC Awards! It only takes one click:   Last chance: http://sbbcawards.ca/award/concept/paypie/  Cool. Now that you've done your civic duty and helped making PayPie into the global powerhouse we all know it will become, let's talk business.  As you may know, we'll have some slick platform screenshots to share with you guys in a couple of weeks. From a development perspective, we've been heavily focusing on the structural workflow of the platform and now we are just putting the whipped cream on top for nice and shiny interface. I could get my hands on the material our devs have made and I can tell you - it's shiny!  We're also expanding our growth channels for 2018. Besides the already planned partnerships and integrations for strengthening our credit risk assessment usage in Q1, new opportunities are already being knitted for bringing some extra SME muscle down the road. New financial groups and fintech companies have reached us out and we were happy to present with our cutting-edge technology proposition, so the bottom line is that everything is going swell both from the development side and from the growth side.  I'm already craving for sharing those slick screenshots with y'all. Our unique credit risk assessment platform based on blockchain accounting is looking better and better and a lot will happen in the next few months. As always, stay tuned!  Cheers,   Yohan Varella CMO",False

I am 99% certain this is not a PND.   Just look at how its building steem.  Its a very healthy graph with normal ups and downs and normal amounts of profit taking.  Listen to the members in here on this thread saying how they are not selling despite huge gains.I am one of them. I bought 21K coins at .21 and havent sold a single coin.....  That should tell you a lot.  Previous post someone said the same thing when it was at .46 and I held.  It is still having normal dips after the big rises.  Personally if I was getting into it right now I would buy if it hit .60-.65 .....  I think I will add to my position if I ever see it below .60 again.  Nothing worse than trying to chase a market up.  You end up with your feet frozen.. Good luck  Oh and wait until it hits more exchanges... That's when it will go beyond the moon.,False

These past couple of weeks have been hectic with hundreds and hundreds of emails regarding the tokensale. The vast majority of you have already successfully claimed your tokens, but if you still haven't done it please follow these instructions to get it all done within a few minutes: https://www.paypie.com/addtoken  Okay, now that we got that part covered let's move to the info and updates:  - The team is already moving things ahead at full steam. All focus has been shifted from the tokensale to the platform's development and we are all immersed in that. All structural measures are already being taken and our team is now putting all efforts on delivering on all roadmap milestones, so everything is moving as expected and all goals will be met.  - Our website is being revamped to reflect a business and product instead of a tokensale. Sections will keep being altered, removed, or implemented accordingly from now on to convey our message so potential business users of the platform can start the awareness and onboarding process.  - We signed agreements with Robert Half, Angus One, and Tek Systems, three major local placement agencies to hand-pick the best talent on the market to expand our development team. A few candidates have already been pre-listed and interviewed, so our team will get bigger very soon.  - For the ones that participated in our bounty program, please note that bounties will continue to be distributed on a regular basis and we aim to finish all bounties distribution by October 27th. Please refer any bounty-related questions to our bounty manager Wapinter on BCT. Emails and chat messages about bounties will be deleted and won't be replied.  And that's it for today! Updates will be shared in mini-batches like this whenever a new set of info pieces get together. Stay tuned.  Note 1: we've received many applications from people interested in helping with the development of the platform in some way. We kindly ask you to refrain from contacting us about that at the moment. We will soon expressly request for such applications through our website.  Note 2: Since our team has all efforts focused on working for moving the platform ahead as soon as possible we won't be actively posting on the Telegram group chat. The group chat will remain as a medium for members to exchange constructive ideas among themselves, so any official info from the team will solely be shared on the Telegram announcements channel (https://t.me/PayPie) and through email. If you have any specific questions, the best and appropriate way for anyone to directly communicate with the team is by emailing us at help@paypie.com. All emails will regularly be replied within 24 hours on business days.  Remember: our only official website is https://www.paypie.com/  Cheers,   Yohan Varella CMO",False

Once there's some early buzz a lot of people think they can make money with a quick flip, helping the ICO sell out quickly. But unless there's ALSO significant excess demand from people who want in, but weren't quick enough (or who couldn't invest because of KYC restrictions), there won't be any buyers to flip to.  If the entire ICO buyer pool was made up of long-term holders, the token price probably wouldn't go below ICO. But if you've got that large pool of flippers, they get nervous very quickly and will try to move on to the next trade if they don't see things moving right away. The first flipper might only sell for a tiny loss, but this starts a wave once the others start getting skittish and it starts the downward trend.  This can all be exacerbated by strategic advisors/investors or bounty participants who got in cheaper than the ICO.  It's all just human emotion and the quality of the token may not have anything to do with it. This was my rationale for the price ""prediction"" earlier. You won't see upward movement until there's real news from the company, but in the case of PayPie, I don't expect that to be until mid-2018 based on their roadmap. It's got nothing to do with creating FUD.",False

To the extreme of calling this a SCAM and creating FUD, this seems to be going too far.  If you want a heavily regulated market go participate in IPO's, those occur all the time.  I suspect those are more rigged than most of these known ICO's, but you might get the feeling of knowing what you are buying into.  Too each his/her own.

So, what should I say? Ah, such a wonderful day it was! Seriously, the adrenaline frenzy was spreading everywhere! That was wild!  By now you all must know that the pre-sale was a huge success and all tokens were sold out in just a few hours. We had planned to run an entire tokensale until mid-November and all measures had also been prepared for that. Pre-sale was such an astonishing surprise for us and the usage demand for risk algorithm is huge. Keep your PPP utility tokens safe, as they will power the usage of world’s first credit risk algorithm based on blockchain accounting in just few short months.  So as many of you have already requested - here they are! Your tokens are here! Oh yeah!  Please follow the these instructions (they'll also be added to our website in the following hours). There are two mandatory steps that you must take:  Step 1- Send 0 (it's a zero) ETH to our pre-sale contract address from your wallet address that you used to participate in presale Step 2- Create a custom token on your wallet  Directions below are for the MyEtherWallet, the wallet that was recommended for the token sale.  To complete step 1 you must:  a) Enter "" 0 "" (it's a zero) on the Amount to Send field b) Enter "" 0xf8a15b1540d5f9d002d9ccb7fd1f23e795c2859d "" on the ""To Address"" field c) Enter "" 250000 "" on the ""Gas Limit"" field d) Enter "" 0x48c54b9d "" on the ""Data"" field (to enable ""Data"" just click on ""+Advanced Data: Add Data"" e) Click on ""Generate Transaction"" then just check to see if your transaction was sent  (FYI: don't enter any ""quotation marks"" on the fields)  After you complete step 1 you can move on to step 2. This is how you create a custom token on MyEtherWallet to complete step 2:  a) Click on ""View Wallet Info"" and then click on ""Create a Custom Token"" b) Enter "" 0xc42209accc14029c1012fb5680d95fbd6036e2a0 "" on the ""Address"" field c) Enter "" PPP "" on the ""Token Symbol"" field d) Enter "" 18 "" on the ""Decimals"" field e) Click on ""Save""  (FYI: don't enter any ""quotation marks"" on the fields)  And that's it! Your tokens will be automatically added to your wallet after that and you'll be good to go!  Thank you once again and have fun!  Security note 1: it's very unfortunate that a few people were victim of scams practiced by websites and/or people pretending to pass like our official website and team. Those websites are all FAKE WEBSITES! If you unfortunately ended up sending any ETH to them there is nothing that PayPie can do since this is something completely out of our control. As we mentioned several times, our only official website is https://www.paypie.com/ .  Security note 2: Seems like a few contributors did not follow directions and used some other wallet than MyEtherWallet thus limiting your ability to add a custom token. If you made a mistake, you will need to contact the support team of those wallets.  Cheers,",False

I am not sure it worked.  I was not present at the ICO opening. I had to go out. When I got back it was about 79 mill out of 82 mill completed. I panicked a bit.  I had some Litecoin and OmiseGO. I had to convert them in separate transactions to get some ETH. I got 6 ETH and 5.5 ETH. One completed before the other though, and I dared not wait to buy the Paypie tokens. Shapeshift can sometimes take hours to convert coins.  From MyetherWallet, I first sent 6 ETH for Paypie tokens. About 10 minutes later I sent another transaction from the same MyetherWallet to buy another 5.5 ETC. Together they are under the limit of 75 ETH.  However, when I did the second 5.5 ETH buyin, a red message came up at the bottom of the screen, indicating that I had already sent a transaction to the same address. It just seemed like a notification message though. It did not indicate that the transaction was blocked. I have checked the logs, and both 6 and 5.5 ETH transactions were successful and 11.5 ETH has left my wallet.  I am just wondering if the second 5.5 ETH will be blocked though by Paypie, and they will have to refund the ETH to me, and I will only have got 6 ETH worth of Paypie?

And you have been very accommodating to the communities needs. Mucho appreciated.  Now onto issues:  I got a bonus and I wasn't even expecting one. Cool. Unfortunately, what isn’t cool, is the Paypie team said one thing and did another. Bonuses were supposed to go to the smaller contributors. But that's not what happened.  The payee team did not release the bonus structure openly for everyone to review until right before the pre-sale started. At the time, I honestly didn’t think much about until now. Now when I really stop and think about it everything, it all seems kind of shady how this whole thing has played out.  So lets review:  This morning a email was sent out right before the crowdsale with this Note attached to the bottom:   “Note: we have signed a deal with a strategic partner for contributing to the platform's development in a long term commitment. The terms of the agreement are confidential and this partnership is one of the most valuable things that could have happened for the platform's progress. We just wanted to share that bit with the community before the pre-sale. Future looks bright!”    According to the white paper, 82,500,500 PPP tokens would be available for the crowdsale.  1ETH = 909 PPP tokens(0.0011 ETH = 1 PPP)   Smart Contract? Yes  82,500,000 PPP Max Hard cap for Crowdsale  4,500,000  PPP soft cap minimum req for crowdsale  27,500,000 PPP for Team and Advisors  55,000,000 PPP for Industry Reserve to help develop partnerships and future acquisitions to become a dominant market leader.  Accoring the the contract ETH provided to us today (0xf8A15b1540d5f9D002D9cCb7FD1F23E795c2859d) = (0xF821Fd99BCA2111327b6a411C90BE49dcf78CE0f)   61,082 ETH was contributed publicly which means 55,523,538 PPP tokens were bought publicly.  This leave 26,976, 462 tokens left that are unaccounted for.   Hypothetically, If everyone had gotten a bonus of 5%(we all know that didn’t happen) then that would then give contributors as a whole 1,348,823 PPP tokens. But that still would leave 25,627,639 PPP tokens left.  This begs the question, why wasn’t this transaction or set of transactions of roughly 26,976,62 PPP tokens recorded on the blockchain at the same time as and under the same contract address as the rest of the crowd sale?? And if this was a strategic partnership deal as stated in the thank you email this morning, then why didn’t the paypie team  use the INDUSTRY RESERVE tokens of 55,000,000 to make this deal instead of taking from the crowdsale AND also at the same time renege on a earlier agreement of giving smaller donors a bonus? The argument that giving everyone a bonus is not really a bonus is very shallow argument and a slap in the face to small investors. Because if going off of that logic, then I see no reason why Paypie shouldn’t have been able to stick to the original agreement which gave the smaller donors the bonus and none for the larger donors.   Also why did you feel that you had to make a SECRET NDA deal with business individuals to advance the company along?  How are we to trust that you have investors and also future customer’s  best interest at heart when nothing about the deal has been disclosed???   How is anyone supposed to be okay with that and be expected to just blindly trust you? This is a new era guys and what would have been acceptable in the old fiat, large corporation way of doing business, is NOT okay in the blockchain era. Blockchain requires transparency and the was the absolute opposite.  This wasn’t in the white paper guys and you need to make it right.",False

Here’s a fresh from the oven scoop for you – PayPie to Be Integrated into Jaxx multi-token wallet! PayPie and Decentral have just issued a joint press release officially announcing that Anthony Di Iorio has joined the PayPie team and that PayPie will be integrated into Jaxx! That’s thrilling news! Check it out:   ""Anthony Di Iorio Joins PayPie Team; PayPie to Be Integrated into Jaxx   6th October 2017 – Decentral Community Space – TORONTO – Decentral Inc, home of the Jaxx Blockchain Interface and the Decentral Community announced today that Anthony Di Iorio, Founder of Decentral and CEO of Jaxx, and Co-Founder of the Ethereum platform, is joining PayPie as both an advisor and as a prominent supporter.   Anthony and the Decentral team are eager to support projects with experienced entrepreneurs delivering blockchain innovation, like  PayPie. Anthony said that “by introducing the world’s first Ethereum-powered credit risk assessment based on decentralized accounting, PayPie hopes to bring ultimate trust and transparency to the financial market. I’m a believer in the power of decentralized technologies like PayPie to add huge value to existing auditing markets and practices. Supporting PayPie’s team in a key advisory role and by integrating the PayPie token into Jaxx are the ways I’m most eager to pitch in.”   The PayPie decentralized, blockchain-based platform was built to make the financial information on businesses more accurate and transparent, allowing a better picture of a company’s financial health for credit risk assessment. Anthony continued, “PayPie leverages blockchain to enable live financial audits, speed up credit approvals, and improve the overall credit scoring processes for businesses. It’s a huge improvement in efficiency for lenders, auditors, accountants, and other financial institutions.”   “Often a company’s financial situation is inaccurate, due to a lack of information and the fact that this information is usually outdated”, said PayPie CEO, serial entrepreneur, and member of the Forbes Technology Council, Nick Chandi. “By harnessing technology – blockchain in particular – we can avoid these issues and make the system fairer both for the businesses themselves, as well as those who wish to access the financial information. Anthony’s participation as a key strategic advisor and the integration of our token into the Jaxx platform are great accelerator to our future.”   Link to Decentral’s press release (also available on their homepage): http://decentral.ca/anthony-di-iorio-joins-paypie-team-paypie-integrated-jaxx/  Link to PayPie’s press release: http://blog.paypie.com/uncategorized/anthony-di-iorio-joins-paypie-team-paypie-to-be-integrated-into-jaxx/   That's some thrilling news!

Pre-Sale officially opens on October 08th, at 13:00 UTC!  First of all, I'd just like to THANK YOU for the tremendous engagement levels that you've all been demonstrating! We've just reached the 10,000+ milestone on our mailing list and couldn't be more excited for the pre-sale to start!  Reminder: join us on Telegram now and don't miss on all the action.  We've also just created a new announcements-only channel! Join us now!  That being said, we strongly recommend that if you want to be sure to get any PayPie Platform tokens at all you should most definitely be ready to buy them at the first minute of the pre-sale. We absolutely can't guarantee that any tokens will be left for later and, in case we sell-out, there won't be a regular sale on October 15th.  About the pre-sale structure, we also have some terrific news for you! We decreased both the Individual Minimum and the Individual Cap for the pre-sale! We wanted to democratize participation as much as possible so everyone can enroll, so check it out:   Pre-Sale Structure  - Opens: October 08th, at 13:00 UTC  - Closes: October 15th, at 12:00 UTC  - Individual Minimum: 0.5 ETH  - Individual Cap: 75 ETH  - Price per Token: 0.0011 ETH  - Total Soft Cap: 4,500,000 PPP  - Total Hard Cap: 82,500,000 PPP  - Only Currency Accepted: ETH  - Whitelist: No  - Smart Contract: Yes  - USA/Canada Allowed: Yes  - Tokens Delivery: Within 14 business days after tokensale completion  - Bonus: TBA. There will be a bonus for smaller contributors to benefit from. We want to prevent “pumping and dumping” from happening and you won’t see anything astronomic like in some other tokensales out there. PayPie is legit and we want contributors that are in it for its real value proposition.   Still, we have some very serious alerts to give:  - Rule #1: our ONLY official website is https://www.paypie.com/ Just go there and favorite/bookmark it to your browser so you can make sure you're always accessing the correct one.  - Follow Rule #1.  - Always triple-check our website address on your URL bar.  -  The ONLY place showing our official wallet address will be our website. If you see a wallet address on any other channel it will be fake, don't trust it.  - We'll never ask you to send any ETH over Email, Telegram, or any social media or other channel besides our official website.  - There are tons of scammers just waiting to take your money. Please follow these instructions. More detailed instructions on how to proceed will be sent soon.  Start your engines and get your cryptos ready!  Note: PayPie will accept contributions from residents of most countries, including USA and Canada. Our legal team is of the view that our tokens do not meet the definition of “securities” under Canadian law. Our ongoing discussions with Canadian regulators have been very positive and we will continue to work with the regulators leading up to the token crowdsale and on an ongoing basis.  Cheers,   Yohan Varella CMO",False

Remember, there are 3 parties involved.  1) SME = Invoice sellers = small and medium enterprises 2) Token Holders = Invoice buyers = lenders who pay the SME in advance in return for their invoice 3) Customer companies = Invoice debtors = whom the token holders have to get money from  PayPie's credit risk algorithm seems to be mainly focused on the SMEs, who are connected through their software to the PayPie platform, instead of the customer companies, who may not be on the PayPie platform yet poses the most risk to the token holders.  Still, PayPie's whitepaper mentions the customers companies a couple of times:  We know their customers, vendors, income, expenses, and money in the bank as live bank feeds pull data on a daily basis.  You will have best possible financial data on the companies whose invoices you are buying and their customer companies who owe you money.  But as Dorky said before, PayPie's risk management of the customer companies is primarily data driven, not legally enforced or insured.  It seems to boil down to ""These customers paid the SME in the past, so they are likely to eventually pay this invoice too. You can pay the SME in advance if you do not mind waiting to get you money back including interest. Disclaimer: we do not guarantee you will get your money back without dragging them to court.""

So Litecoin information has now changed to basically say that its as good as ETH and the rest is pretty uncommital when it comes to forecasts, its some information but not enough. The last 3 reports have really disappointed me with the content, no numbers on anything else but bitcoin. Granted I've only read it once and I will do it again 2 or 3 times but I want dirt on what the chinese plans are from the data. I'm so sick of hints on interpretted data, my portfolio has basically gone no where since I went 100% into Litecoin at 38 and 42 and the Veritaseum has halved. I basically just have to go to work and not work, just sit and watch crypto's all day to make money  Frankly, my opinion about Clif High's reports are more or less the same. For your information, I no longer refer to his expensive Bare Naked report anymore. The information is more or less junk quality. Clif High got a lot of things wrong too, not just on gold and silver, but on cryptos as well. So be careful what you read. Learn to fish yourself. Don't be dependent on Clif to give you fish.  A lot of people are actually just jokers; jsnip4, mike b, bix weir, clif high, etc. The ones that really do count are those with related experience and make comments critically.

No doubt, there is no issue of scam. But this is not my point. Every transaction involves risk, and a mechanism needs to be in place to significantly reduce, if not eliminate, such risk. So far I really don't see any mechanism in place to deal with such risk. Like I said before, it means nothing to do risk scoring and/or KYC on the SMEs selling the invoice, because they are not the weakest link.  PayPie is basically just trying to indirectly monetize its SlickPie customer base through blockchain. Everything else is hype. No doubt its customer base may grow. But the issue here is the quality of the invoices that will be traded at PayPie market/platform/exchange. How will PayPie try to prevent and/or recover any default? Sure all transaction has risks, but if no mechanism is in place to reduce the risk, then you can bet things will 100% go out of control. I say it again, risk scoring and/or KYC on the SMEs are irrelevant.  Edit: The kind of competency I meant relates to legal competency, not accounting software competency.  Edit #2: Waiting for the SMEs' invoices to default (and cause token holders to lose money) before we know who to stay away from, is a very bad approach. If 1000 of SlickPie's customers unknowingly submit $100,000 worth of invoices to sell that will end up default, that translates to $100 million of loss. And without any mechanism in place to enforce the quality of invoices to sell, SMEs (regardless of their credit scores) will naturally try to sell the ones with lowest chance of recovery. And the worse part of PayPie's mechanism is that such junk invoices will actually be sold based on bidding process (!) as if the bidders would know any better.  Edit #3: What makes Populous stands out is that there is no transfer of ownership of the invoices (unlike PayPie) and so the SME will still have obligation to do the recovery for the buyers. And Populous shifts the weakest link from the entity-debtor to the SME-seller, put a risk scoring on it based on the proven Altman Z-score metric with insurance, guarantee, and/or debenture for safety. No doubt Populous will have a much harder time trying to penetrate larger market share with such strict requirement, but rest assured most (if not all) invoices that will be traded at Populous will be high-quality stuffs.",False

The right thing to do is to do risk score and KYC on the entity listed in the invoice, but this will introduce more complication into the business model.  If there is default, how exactly will PayPie recover it? Will it be under PayPie's responsibility, or others? If it is others, then the cost incurred in recovery will be borne by others, i.e. the token holders. Of course there are debt collection mechanisms in offline industry, which is exactly why I said the recovery involves persistent threats; debt collecting agencies keep calling up the debtors with threats of legal actions.

Simple, you will stop calling Nike to pay up. Nike will prolong the payment well beyond 120 days. Indeed Nike default will damage their reputation, but this is what's always happening to at least 50% of all businesses out there, all the time. Otherwise, such thing should have ceased to happen since hundreds of years ago, but not.  Like I said, doing KYC on the SME is not the point.

I can assure you, having worked in banking and credit reporting agency in some part of my life, I can tell you these requirements are super solid stuff in preventing defaults. While Populous is an invoice trading platform, it also employs the proven risk scoring metric that is Altman Z-score to evaluate the SME's financial health, check it out yourself. The metric is proven to work with pretty high accuracy; there is absolutely no need for some unverified ""most accurate"" risk scoring metric/algorithm to do the same job. Populous extracts SME's financial information from public official sources submitted by the SMEs themselves, so the info is as legitimate as it can get. By using insurance, guarantee, and debenture on the invoice, Populous is shifting the weakest link from the entity stated in the invoice to the SME that sells it, and also legally securing it as well at the same time. So any SME can sell its invoices, regardless of investment-grade or junk, safely with very low risk of default. Populous is doing everything right.

For example I thought the remark about collateral was interesting.  Will PayPie's credit risk score algorithm be enough to protect invoice buyers from defaults?  Who dares to be the first invoice buyer when the algorithm does not have enough data to base a score on, and how do you build up a credit score as an invoice seller who is just starting out?   Quote from: Rigorous on October 02, 2017, 07:01:13 PM Quote from: Dorky on October 02, 2017, 11:13:51 AM Banks are okay with that because they demand collateral to secure the loan.  But what will help secure invoice buyers from invoices sold at PayPie that will default?  The PayPie platform is centered around transparency, credit scores and smart contracts. Here are some key quotes from the whitepaper:  PayPie's credit scoring data will be indicating and assessing the risk of invoice default so that buyers can make educated decisions.  To prevent defaults, all parties involved will be able to rate each other at the end of the transaction and this history will be recorded on the immutable Ethereum blockchain to build a Decentralized Trust and Transparency Rating (DTTR) so that others can make well-informed lending decisions. Smart contracts will automatically amend each party’s trust rating according to an algorithm after completion of the lending process.  For example, if a smart contract can be written between an investor and an invoice seller to say that once the seller is victorious in reaching a particular credit score in PayPie platform, 80% of the funds will be released to the invoice seller.  I suppose you would be right to say that there is no mention of physical or monetary collateral. The main collateral appears to be their credit score and their reputation. If an invoice seller defaults that will be for everyone to see forever.",False

If I owe you money, and you issue an invoice for that, and you sell that invoice to Mr. Noob, and I choose not to pay you, you have no worries because you already got the money from selling the invoice. It's the buyer (Mr. Noob) that will suffer if I don't pay. The SME submitting its financials to the blockchain is completely irrelevant. Putting a risk score on the SME that sells the invoice is also irrelevant. Putting a risk score on the customer that owe the SME is also irrelevant, because ultimately the SME wants the business. In a world of stiff competition, the SMEs have no luxury to cherry-pick which customer to sell to, regardless of their risk scores. Many here claim to be accountants, but I am surprised why they can't see through this weak link. This is a risk of default. Populous already solved this from the very start.  Edit: The factoring industry is lucrative, and that's because bulk of it is related to consumer debt (sold pennies on the dollar), not corporate debt. And recovery is usually through persistent threats. This won't work with corporate figures.  Lots of SMEs will love this because they can finally unload their junk invoices to gullible buyers willing to bid up the price for such junk.",False

Further they mentioned that they will do KYC on all SMEs looking for liquidity.

Here are some key quotes from the whitepaper:  PayPie's credit scoring data will be indicating and assessing the risk of invoice default so that buyers can make educated decisions.  To prevent defaults, all parties involved will be able to rate each other at the end of the transaction and this history will be recorded on the immutable Ethereum blockchain to build a Decentralized Trust and Transparency Rating (DTTR) so that others can make well-informed lending decisions. Smart contracts will automatically amend each party’s trust rating according to an algorithm after completion of the lending process.  For example, if a smart contract can be written between an investor and an invoice seller to say that once the seller is victorious in reaching a particular credit score in PayPie platform, 80% of the funds will be released to the invoice seller.  I suppose you would be right to say that there is no mention of physical or monetary collateral. The main collateral appears to be their credit score and their reputation.

SlickPie is PayPie's accounting solution. If so, how successful was/is SlickPie today? Was/Is it wildly successful? Or was/is it very little known/used?  2. How is PayPie's risk scoring algorithm better than the proven, popular and well-researched risk scoring method, the Altman Z-score, which is free to use by everyone?  3. Other than providing the ""most accurate"" (how to know it's really the most accurate?) risk scoring algorithm as a main advantage/selling point, what other advantages does PayPie have?  4. Personally I don't believe the blockchain will solve creative accounting. Now, if a company committed creative accounting, submitted some invoices that will definitely go non-performing, how will PayPie help to recover any potential loss?  5. How does PayPie have data better than banks on the financial health of a business? Where can I validate this claim?  By the way, so far in this thread I encounter mostly hyped up personal opinions that PPP is solid, that it will be successful, that banks and governments will love this project, etc etc, just as I can say I am actually Superman (yes, I actually am, believe it).

Instead of waiting for the invoice to be paid by business B, business A can sell their invoice to you. That means you buy an invoice  and pay a large proportion of their value directly. The rest of the money of the invoice is then paid once you have received the full amount of the invoice by the business B. As a reward of your service you then get a part of the invoice amount (~2%?) and keep it.

First we should know that the project you are investing is a project that will not give up easily, even if the percentage of the fall is very small. If you fail on gambling, your money is gone. But in an ICO, your money will not disappear as long as the project does not give up. If you do research properly, its not a gamble anymore. How you can profit in investing is dependent on your research ability. Know the team, know the prospects. If you are not sure dont jump in. Jump in and hope is terrible, only jump in if youre sure. But the most important thing is never invest money you cant afford to lose, do some risk management.

It's totally up in the air what the government deems sufficient deterrents, whether a checkbox or a just warning is enough, or blocking access to the whole site for example. Let alone what other things they might come up with such as requiring identification under KYC, or like China, rolling back and refunding all investments to their citizens. It might be a problem to find out where they came from if they used VPN if you are mere mortals, not if you have the power of the NSA...

Experts in the industry know that growth in the ecosystem is very important to increase the demand of tokens. If you look at any major ICO that’s disrupting the legacy players, you will see partner tokens are very important. I Recently I had a chat with few friends who are CEOs including Steven (Rivetz) & Vinny (Civic) and they have already started building these relationships on the future use of those tokens. In fact, one of them is already taking a piece of the pie from a multi-billion dollar company just because of partnership tokens. At PayPie our goal is to execute fast and, not only become a market leader but control that position just like Google does it today for the search market. Google gets almost 80% and next company gets only 5-6% of the market. We want to become like Google in our industry.

The hash of the transaction will be stored in the block chain but the document itself is stored in the distributed web through a technology called IPFS.  Here, I looked it up in the whitepaper.  An accounting transaction is based on the journal entry data that is tokenized, so each transaction has a unique identity visible on the blockchain with rest of the information published at IPFS.  Then my question is: how does PayPie make those documents anonymous?  We will also be able to anonymize financial data from many kinds of businesses  They still have to be stored somewhere in their original form before the process.",False

We achieve this by bringing transparency to our methodology. You will be able to see how the platform actually assesses the credit worthiness of individuals and businesses. You will be making decisions on the underlying financial data that is real time. I believe DTTR rating is of tremendous value over time and will eliminate all the bad apples. PayPie will have a KYC process in place to ensure SMEs are legit. Think about it, a financial software used by businesses do have access to critical business information like bank account#, CC#, bank balances, short term/long loan balances, credit card balances, customer history etc. which is of tremendous value. As far as we can envision there is no better way to make an informed smart decision and identify sound investment opportunities. If a customer is paying their invoice for the last 8 months, and there is full tracking of it in the system from the origin of the invoice to the money in the bank that get reconciled in the ERP system, you can be pretty confident that 9th invoice has very low chances of going at default if our algorithm detects that all other indicators about business health are excellent. All this would be on top of the standard financial process that would be in place to prevent loan defaults or steps to take to aid debt recovery. In fact there are debt collection mechanisms that are well established in offline financial industry. For large amounts, it will make sense that borrowers take the credit insurance option from providers like AIG, Euler Hermes etc.",False

By not considering whether the person could afford the payments if they were to increase in the future, many of these loans may have put the borrowers at risk of default. Some banks have reduced their reliance on FICO scoring. For example, Golden West Financial (which merged with Wachovia Bank in 2006) abandoned FICO scores for a more costly analysis of a potential borrower's assets and employment before giving a loan. According to the experts at MyFico.com, credit scores are enhanced by having multiple credit cards, the use of credit cards, and having installment loans. However, financially secure individuals who do not use multiple credit cards and/or self finance installment type expenses may be inaccurately assessed a lower credit score.""

Quote from: Rigorous on September 12, 2017, 10:57:43 AM Quote from: viljy on September 12, 2017, 08:13:53 AM Only one thing does not understand - where will the platform take the initial data? From an open reporting? And if there are errors, then you will have to check everything first. Do an audit. And if there is an error or data there, then they will remain in this system, on the blockchain?  I would expect errors to remain in both the system and the blockchain and store corrections in new transactions. Just like with software version control systems, you don't erase history (to be clear, it's technically possible, but not recommended) but you append a new commit to fix a past error.    How can this be so? Each block follows from the previous one. If the error is in block 100, and it is fixed in block 200, then all blocks 100 through 199 contain an error. They need to be fixed. If you do this as shown, the blockchain is not needed, it makes no sense.",False

ERC20 is already existing token standard used by ethereum tokens. ERC23 is a new version of token standard.  Problems:  You can't deposit ether in contract that is not specified to accept ether deposits. For example you can't deposit ETC in dao-withdrawal contract. But you can send your ERC20 tokens anywhere so you can deposit BitEtherCoin in dao-withdrawal contract where your BEC will stay forever as dao-withdrawal contract is not designed to work with BEC and there will be no way to access BEC on this contract. ERC23 tokens can't be sent to a random contract similarly to ether. Only contract specified with ERC23 deposits will accept ERC23 tokens.  Transactions:  Transactions between addresses are same in ERC20 and ERC23. When you need to deposit your ERC20 token in contract you should call approval function in token contract to approve a specified (amount*token decimals) to be transferred from your address to target contract. Then you need to call deposit function on target contract to finalize your deposit and transfer your tokens. Note: If you accidentally sent your ERC20 tokens to target contract without calling approval your tokens would be lost!  Interaction between ERC23 and other contracts is much easier. You need just to send your ERC23 tokens to contract address like you send them to another wallet. There is no difference for user to send ERC23 to contract or to address.  100% Backward compatibility:  ERC23 supports all ERC20 functions and can also be transferred via approval method.  Optimization:  In fact transfer of ERC20 tokens between address and contract is a pair of two different transactions while transfer of ERC23 tokens is a single transaction. ERC20 tokens transfer to contract fires Approval event on token contract and then fires Transfer event on contract receiving tokens. ERC23 tokens transfer fires only Transfer event and can prevent extra blockchain bloating as every event is stored in blockchain.,False

But still guessing. I think you actually have it backwards. PPP tokens are the investment vehicle and PieCoin are stable stores of debit/credit value.  Assuming PPP are the PayPie tokens that are traded on the exchanges. PPP will be converted to PieCoin (PIE) for internal transactions in the PayPie market.  PIE are pegged to a several major currencies at the same time: a currency basket. For the sake of argument, assume the currency basket is 1 PIE = $1.  You owe someone $300. Which means you are 300 PIE short.  PIE can only be exchanged through PPP tokens.  PPP tokens fluctuate, but according to the whitepaper the price per token starts at 1 PPP = 0.0011 ETH.  If the price of $300 = 1 ETH you need to buy 1/0.0011 = 909 PPP.  If PPP doubles in value, you need to buy 454 PPP instead. Your debt, in terms of currency basket value, has remained the same amount, ie. 300 PIE = $300.  If you were indebted 300 PPP instead of PIE, after PPP doubled in value you would owe $600.",False

But it's worth nothing, till you create a market for it. Thus the reason i insinuated that the token might only have internal use.   Again this is just a guess on my part but as i aforementioned, due to SEC rules, the piecoin might have been conceived as an alternative to incentive Paypie customers/Paypie coin holders. Piecoin might be distributed as a form of dividend (note that i use the word a form to denote that its not an actual dividend) and the distribution could be exchanged on Paypie's platform for fiat. Since it's not the main coin associated with the project and only has internal use, i.e.( Paypie won't provide an exchange for it) this deflects any issue that the SEC rules might pose.    As for pegging to multiple currencies, am guessing they will peg it to the currency that's currently worth the most, and use exchange rates from that currency to pay out on other currencies. Again, am just guessing and none of this should be considered viable till statement is obtained from an admin",False

The basis for Bitcoin and any cryptocurrency you can think of is based on this principle. So Paypie is not the first to utilize it. Rather they are using blockchain (1.e triple entry accounting) to deal with specific accounting needs like credit management etc. As I aforementioned in earlier pages, if you would like to get a better grasp on what Paypie is doing, or just acquire a better understanding of the whole crypto/blockchain phenomena, then you should read Momentum accounting and triple-entry bookkeeping by  Yuji Ijiri. Yuji Initiated and popularized this idea back in the late 80's. It's a really good read.",False

Think of the PPP token ( whatever they choose to call it in the platform) being pegged to a major currency like the USDTether coin. No matter what the Bitcoin price does, 1 USDTether coin is ALWAYS worth 1 USD.  The PPP token that is used internally will be used the same way. This is in order to facilitate the transfer of funds between the ""buyer"" and ""seller"" in the platform. So there will be no volatility.  Example: Lets say you use the platform and somebody gets the equiv of $10,000 in BTC. If it took 1 week for them to get the $10k in BTC, the price could have fallen or risen by the time they ""Cash Out"". By using their internal token that is ALWAYS tied 1:1 with the USD, the receiver of the tokens could wait 8 months, and they would still have EXACTLY $10k worth of ""tokens"".  I hope this helps you out in understanding how the process will work.  Edit: I am NOT part of the PayPie team, but I will be  HUGE investor when this (PRE) ICO goes live. Also note to Devs, as my name implies, I am more than happy to offer services as a point of contact for a very reasonable fee",False

""Initially we will be attracting established companies to the marketplace by enabling east and fast lending process from anywhere, anytime. Current process with banks is cumbersome, time consuming and very expensive and can eat up to 25-30% of the invoice value in agreement cost, interest and fees. This exposes them to the benefits of blockchain accounting and create wider awareness among them. We already have and will build more relationship with organized groups like accounting and bookkeeping firms who usually advise businesses on what platform to use. The benefits like ending duplicate data entry, automated reconciliation and automatic audits are some of the huge benefits that are simply too hard to ignore because they impact your profits.""   Finally, is there a similar credit score rating contemplated for individuals? What I mean is are you proposing a score that would compete with FICO for rating consumers? If so, this could have promise as well.     ""Only if person is self employed like a contractor or web developer. We will be able to build a risk score based their income, expenses  and other historical data.""   Hello dev team, this is really promising IMHO and will consider an allocation as I learn more about the project and possible valuation. Is this product intended to compete with the oligopoly of S&P, Fitch, and Moodys for credit rating services? Or are you primarily targeting smaller businesses that are outside of the purview of the large rating services? It seems to me to be the latter. Either way there should be room for growth.   They are actually targeting the big players and offering a lot of incentives to use the paypie platform ""Yes, we are not building an accounting software but an accounting platform that exposes to the many benefits of blockchain to the SMEs. It's a mix of accounting software and credit scoring companies....you can think this way because we use the blockchain to solve their cashflow problem.""  you should join the slack to communicate directly with members of the team. https://paypie.herokuapp.com/",False

Everything that makes the system ""thinner"" while giving more influence about the future decisions back to the community,  is very welcomed. + cutting corrupt big time, with blockchain and  transparency.     Quote from: Islapdonkey on September 02, 2017, 01:53:01 PM Quote from: Pajulapoiss on September 02, 2017, 12:37:50 PM It's kind of hard for me, to be all mad about folk who want to avoid taxes. I find that taxation itself is fraud, biggest of them all.  But that is no reason, to not have an accounting platform, that gives clear awnsers about an entity's financial situation.  I'm actually looking forward to trying the finalized platform out, maybe it will give me a better understanding.  I too sometimes wish I didn't have to pay tax but I love having access to moderate to top notch amenities like clean water, safe road, moderately safe environment etc. all task is accomplished by public servants and how do public servant get paid? thru citizen/company taxation. So if everyone stopped paying tax, a nation will decay because finance needed to uphold this aforementioned task will be dependent on public donation. Countries where taxation is strictly enforced and its use is transparent, tend to do very well.   It's not really about paying for the common good, or paying to the good man and women at public service. They are necessary.  But I can not say the same for the government officials and paper pushers, because they don't have the common good of the people in their mind. They've been at power positions for too long, and they have become alienated from the reality.  If everyone stopped paying tax, and would start using a system like described above, we would live in a better world.",False

So they dig up the data they need on a company, if someone requests it on their platform, then they save it there for future use too? and gradually increase their database size?     And how can they be sure, that the data they have, is accurate, if some of it is being entered manually?",False

So, I don't anticipate a mass adoption for awhile but it's inevitable. At first, the service offered by Paypie will garner support in the first world countries (though I hate the idea of denoting a country as a second/third world, reality bites) these countries tend to value transparency, their citizens are more inclined to bolster their credit and officials will go to extreme lengths to punish anyone suspected of committing a fraud. Anyway, with time the idea is bound to be adopted by other places. With blockchain implementation, transparency is bound to be norm and companies will either have to concede to grow or refuse and stay dormant, if they choose to stay dormant, it will inevitably lead to its demise.",False

To put it in a few words, the platform solves the problems of fraud and inconsistencies which exist in isolated accounting systems by allowing for live analysis of financial statements on the blockchain, which is intended to facilitate the determination of credit risk in lending operations. This analysis will be done using a single ledger approach and will consider the all-time historical financial information of participating businesses to safeguard and transform the way credit risk is assessed by lenders, investors, banks and other financial institutions while building an entire blockchain-backed ecosystem. All accounting inputs will be bound to the blockchain, which will secure the entire transaction-checking process in a trustless environment generating unbiased data. The Platform development is halfway complete. There is nothing like this currently in the space. As per competitors, the closest thing to that would be the conventional risk score providers that generate results based on archaic models with narrow data sets. Thank you for the good wishes.",False
