When i read the whitepaper i can only read:  - Zoran Rehar: adult marketing and analysing how everything works (sounds a bit vague, no samples or detailed info whatsover) - Yuu: adult designer, and photographer  Yuu, looks like someone who does add some value. Yes a designer isnt exactly a big thing in the industry to say the least, but i can see he has done some nice projects, and might add some value in the form of designing things and contacts he got over the years.  In addition you have 2 advisors with a bit of a vague connection (and lets be honest, an advisor just means adding someones picture to make the overall package look nicer)  - Lauren MacEwen: social media expert - Brad Mitchell: hosting company  Uhm, well how do i say this without being an asshole.... Uhhh.. ""hosting some adult sites"" doesnt exactly qualify as experience in the adult industry lol. Its like saying: i watched some porn on pornhub last week, so i have experience in the business. It sounds more like you tried to make connections to the industry to make it sound nice.  Lauren does seem to have a link to the industry, but again a job that doesnt really qualify as that being a big deal. Sure, social media is part of the job as well, but not exactly a person who can get things done in the industry.  Still, not to be negative, some of the whitepaper really sounds interesting, but if the only one who has experience in the industru is ""just"" a designer and a ""social media"" guru, well... thats far from being an impressive team. Im basically missing real people from the industry, meaning, content producers, studios, famous pornstars...well people who are the industry, so not people with jobs that support them..  But as you mention everyone from the team has experience in the industry, maybe im missing something?",False

Here is a simple overview and understanding of what we're going to do. We will not bother you with high tech terms, some crazy deep algorhitms. Because most of the people do not understand how the system or platforms will work, because devs and high tech geeks are talking completely different language than normal people. So let us explain in a simple understandable language what we are going to do and how we will change the adult online industry as we know it so far!   HOW WE WILL CHANGE ONLINE ADULT INDUSTRY â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚  1. Free video and picture sites 2. Adult social community 3. Amateur stars community 4. Pron adult market place 5. Pron payment system 6. Adult gamin platform 7. Integration of our coin with crypto credit cards   WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE SOLVING? â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚  We're solving many problems! Beside decentralizing the whole system, we're avoiding bank fees, high credit card fees, chargebacks that are the biggest problem in adult online industry. To pay each user for contributing to adult community, with current online adult system would be very hard. Each user should make a contract with company, everyone have different payment options, some of them are not accepting adult transactions, like PayPal for example. So by paying you in Pron tokens and sending money to your wallet is easy, fast, almost no fees and no contract needed. All payments will be handled by smart contracts and will be deployed automatically. How you will spend that money and where is up to you! And the biggest problem we're solving is, that any user of platforms will be able to earn PronCoins and will be able to earn money. Until now, this was not the business model in online adult industry, because of complicated payment structure to each individual. And the last problem we're solving is protecting any user of adult platform, that there wont be any hidden charges as most of the sites are doing now. So usually when you signup to one site membership, you also get charged and get access to some other sites. But you didn't know, because there is a small print and you didn't pay attention on the join page. So we're solving this with smartcontracts and there wont be any hidden charges with our payment system.   WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF PRONCOIN FOR ADULT INDUSTRY? â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚  As a user of any platform, you will be paid in Pron coins and the transactions are easy and fast. You don't need any contracts, any payment systems, credit cards or anything. You will be paid to your Pron token wallet and from there on, you can do whatever your want. You can turn it into FIAT, you can spent them on other site memberships, products and eventually we will be connected with crypto credit cards, from where you can buy anything in any store all over the world. Since the cards will be used as creditcards. For site owners and webmasters, PronCoin advantage is that there are practically no fees, you can send money to any webmaster, you can easy transfer to any ad agency. Also, all site owners, companies are avoiding high bank and credit card fees, high chargeback fees, since there wont be any. Companies will be sending money to webmasters or anyone that they need to send money with almost zero fees. Right now the fees for wire transfers, or loading money to creditcard companies or sending money through PayPal are huge.   PRON COIN TOKEN â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚  PronCoin tokens will be issued on the Ethereum network and will be freely traded on the open market. Ethereum is an open-source project which allows creation of smart contracts and provides users with a secure and fast transaction system.  PRESALE PERIOD Presale period will start at 00:00 on December, 23rd 2017 and will last until 24:00 on December 31st 2017 (GMT+1). Within this period, investors will have the opportunity to buy PronCoin Token Sale at the presale price of 0.069 USD. The results of the presale will be published on the official PronCoin website.   ISSUANCE OF TOKENS â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚â–‚  PronCoin tokens will be issued on the Ethereum protocol. According to the algorithm of the World population clock, published on the official PronCoin website, all PronCoin tokens will be created the moment that the presale will start, and will be instantly injected into the liquidity pool.

Hello tolyasan and kruseno,  Thank you for your question!  We believe in blockchain technology and we believe in decentralizing the systems.  Regarding your question: Why does decentralizing make it better than current centralized?  With centralized platform normal visitor or surfer watched videos, uploaded content, shared links, comment, maybe at the end even buy premium membership, join dating site, buy enhancement pills etc... whatever that site advertises. So centralized platforms have huge profits from them. With us, normal user, surfer that will upload, share, like, comment or even buy premium memberships, will be rewarded. So by doing what they did until now, they will have a chance to earn money. Profits that platform will earn, will be distributed to Proncoin token holders or they will be able to use it for buying memberships, premium videos etc. How can it get any better than that! While watching your favorite video, you get rewarded and at the end even get paid for that. Our algorithm will decuct actual costs for running platform, the rest will be distributed to token holders. There is a complicated algo behind all this, which would be hard to explain in short, but our devs are already working on it, but I can assure you that we're changing the game and we're disrupting online adult industry by decentralizing it. People are building and helping big systems to operate and profit big money. We want to reward those people and get a cut! All you need to do is to be Proncoin owner and you will be rewarded by doing what you did before. We're preparing an artcile how much money is involved in adult online industry and how much centralized platforms earns out of normal users.  There are many other things we will do, so I invite you to read our whitepaper in case you missed it. If you have any more queations, please do not hesitate to ask.  We have some big news coming, so stay tuned!  Best regards,  Zoran PronCoin - CEO",False
