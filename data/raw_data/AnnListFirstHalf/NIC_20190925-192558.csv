Iconic was thought to improve the entire ICO market as self-sufficient environment, meaning that it was built to provide not only the technical and business (including those provided by third parties, as environment managers) tools to launch ICOs, but also a place do have those bought tokens traded and specially instruments of assurance to the whole cycle of life of projects-businesses.  There is no way of having a safe and sound ICO environment without instruments for assurance, such as audits, escrowing and arbitrations.  And Iconic will provide them to the market, aiming to help it develop and achieve a new level.  2 Our token - NIC - has a very unique design.  It was built to have a lot of utilities within Iconic's evosystem, such as participating in exclusive ICOs or having a date reservation to participante in ICOs; buying some specific licenses Iconic will auction, etc.  But we think that our big differential is the DAO Fund to be built, planned to be NIC's ballast. The DAO fund will provide the finantial amount of support for the NIC so it absorbs the power of the cryptocurrency market, operating with greater stability as time goes by.  The Fund will also provide any token owner with an option at any time of its existence: the token owner will be allowed to retriever a % of the Fund total equity in exchange for the NICs, which then will be automatically burn in order to preserve the Fund - Token relation intact.  Take a look at the token documentation and get back to us if you have any doubt.  Thanks!",False

Iconic is providing a good opportunity for more than one profile of investor and user - both the trader as who would prefer to keep their token. For one side, Iconic's financial model contemplates not just a way to be profitable with an environment for another ICOs - as Iconic's Business Head said here https://goo.gl/5ZNrmu , a middleman for a middleman makes no sense in blockchain industry - but we think in every aspect of this process: The Offer, the aftermarket and the guarantees and security to show that decentralized does not have to be unorganized.  So, if we are talking just about the company, we believe that is a really well-designed and planned business that has all the tools to be successful  But, moreover, we offer a decentralized ballast fund on our coin that is called DAO NIC Fund, providing a strategy to make our investor have its assets valuing naturally with the development of Iconic's operation and relative business (ICOs, trading, audit, arbitration). It's a way to prove the value behind Iconic's own coin (NIC)  To finish, Iconic has an independent Escrow Manager to manage its funds to release it with fullfiment of milestones to show that its ICO is a way to expand and operates, not just to profit.
