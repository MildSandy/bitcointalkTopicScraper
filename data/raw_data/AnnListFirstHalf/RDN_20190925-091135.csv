Specifically to Raiden, Raiden will help Ether scale by allowing transfers that are verified on the blockchain initially, and then routed offchain until it reaches its final destination, onchain, to complete the transaction.  Since the transaction is only verified onchain, you can be assured that nothing has been modified or changed in the smart contract.  As Raiden scales, transaction speed increases and the cost to use the Raiden network falls.  Raiden has a competitive advantage as the lowest cost provider and having the lowest latency, effectively giving it a blue ocean strategy, if it manages to deliver.  Considering that Raiden is about to release uRaiden, which is a one-to-many payment protocol process on Nov 28th, which can be verified at Raiden's github, it gives a lot of confidence that Raiden will deliver on its promises.  It is currently in the process of an audit, which started on Nov 14th.  Additionally, RAIDEX is an exchange that the brainbot developer team (the Raiden team) is working on which will likely be a direct competitor to 0x.",False

Many DAPPS have mentioned how they plan on utilizing ÂµRaiden in their whitepapers because it will increase both efficiency and responsiveness of payments.  The Raiden Network is still being developed, but will allow many-to-many payments and will give the raiden token utility as it will be utilized for payments.  Additionally, the Raiden team is working on Raidos, which is Raiden 2.0.  Raiden 2.0 is the Raiden teams answer for generalized state channels, which will allow transactions between any smart contract.  Furthermore, as stated above, Raiden is also working on RaidEX, which is a decentralized exchange that the Raiden team is working.  While there are not many details at this time, regarding this project, it may give the Raiden token additional utility.  This is a great project.  Given that Raiden is exactly what the ethereum ecosystem needs, I feel as if early investors in this project will be very satisfied with their investment.  For those of you who missed out on the ICO, don't feel down, because there were many restrictions that limited the amount of Raiden that could be purchased during the ICO.  A lot of people will instead purchase on the secondary market.  Personally, anything under a $100M market cap is an absolute steal in my opinion.  There is plenty of FUD out there regarding Raiden, as people are asking redundant questions like why is it necessary if Plasma is being developed?  Well first of all, Plasma is being developed, and secondly, anybody that has taken a look at Plasma's whitepaper (https://plasma.io/plasma.pdf), could simply reference page 13 and see a chart showing ""lightening"" built on top of Plasma.  People that are familiar with Raiden will realize that Raiden is essentially the same thing as lightening, meaning that Raiden and Plasma will compliment one another.  There is massive upside.

Are you from the future?  From https://raiden.network/faq.html  Transaction fees  Using blockchains is expensive. Once a blockchain hits its limit, paying high enough fees to be included in a block becomes a competitive endeavor, as is the case with Bitcoin today. Ethereum will be no different, eventually leading to even higher confirmation times and transaction fees on the order of a few dollars per transaction. For the vision of a global, decentralized, and dependable computer this is highly detrimental.  Raiden Network transfer fees will be several orders of magnitude lower than on-chain transaction fees. Instead of paying for global consensus, you only pay for forwarding peer-to-peer consensus. Low fees allow for a long tail of new use cases which have not been practical before due to high transaction costs. Especially IoT and the Machine-to-Machine economy depend on being able to transfer tiny values. Raiden aims to be the predominant payment layer for these applications.  And...  Are there fees in the Raiden Network?  Yes, there are two kinds of fees in the Raiden Network:  Protocol level fees Peripheral fees  Protocol level fees are necessary to keep the payment channel network balanced. Nodes will use fees to prevent their channels from being depleted over time. These fees will be comparatively small and be denominated in the token that is transferred in the channel.  Peripheral fees will be payable to services in the network that, for example, assist with finding a path with sufficient capacity or services that provide channel monitoring services for offline users. Users running these services themselves will not need to pay these fees but can earn them instead. It is assumed that >95% of all nodes on the network will be light-clients happy to pay tiny fees for the convenience of not having to run the full stack of services.",False

Just plain and simple for all the dumb idiots who just throw money here and there, here is the definition of Raiden Network tokens:  Raiden Network tokens allow for micro transactions and up to 1,000,000 transactions per second.  What does this mean for dumb idiot investors whom don't understand?  Well it means that retailers like Macy's, Grocery Store Chains, Dave and Busters, Starbucks, can easily and quickly accept Ethereum without worrying about getting transactions so late and spending $10 for a $5 purchase.  Also, 1,000,000 transactions per second means that it is now 100% possible for companies like Monaco/TENX/CENTRA_Tech to have their crypto Credit/Debit cards because they can use the Raiden Network for speed of transactions and it won't bog down the Ethereum Network.

Itâ€™s complementary to the Ethereum blockchain and works with any ERC20 compatible token. The Raiden project is work in progress. Its goal is to research state channel technology, define protocols and develop reference implementations.  Features  Scalable Scales linearly with the number of participants  Fast Transfers can be confirmed within a subsecond  Private Individual transfers donâ€™t show up in the global shared ledger  Interoperable Works with any token that follows Ethereumâ€™s standardized token API (ERC20)  Low Fees Transfer fees can be orders of magnitude lower than on the blockchain  Micropayments Low transaction fees allow to efficiently transfer tiny values    Technology  The Raiden Network is an infrastructure layer on top of the Ethereum blockchain. While the basic idea is simple, the underlying protocol is quite complex and the implementation non-trivial. Nonetheless the technicalities can be abstracted away, such that developers can interface with a rather simple API to build scalable decentralized applications based on the Raiden.  Raiden Network 101  Blockchains donâ€™t scale well because there needs to be global consensus on the order and outcome of all transfers. Every participant needs to learn about all updates to the shared ledger. Hardware and bandwidth constraints set a limit on the number of updates per second that can be shared in a decentralized network. The basic idea of the Raiden Network is to avoid the blockchain consensus bottleneck. This is done by leveraging a network of payment channels which allow to securely transfer value off-chain, i.e without involving the blockchain for every transfer.  To learn more, read the Raiden Network 101, take a look at the current specification or check out the code.   Use Cases  The obvious use case for the Raiden Network is payments. Currently, the global payments industry generates roughly $2 trillion in revenue annually - and itâ€™s growing.  Retail Payments  There are quite a few high profile Ethereum token based projects competing to bring blockchain based payments to the masses. Especially in developing countries these efforts may potentially improve the life of millions. The Raiden Network can be a crucial building block, as significant adoption relies on scalable technology and competitive fees.  P2P Cash  Cash as we know it is on the retreat as there is a trend towards cashless societies. Scalable blockchain based payments can help to preserve the private and decentralized nature of cash while updating its user experience to the expectations of a new generation.  Micropayments  Blockchains are a hot candidate to become the payment infrastructure of the upcoming machine-to-machine economy. IoT may increase the number of commercial transactions by an order of magnitude - and the cheaper the cost of transfers become, the more use cases emerge.  Micropayments can be used to get fine grained access to APIs, bandwidth, computing power, storage, electricity, basically any infrastructure. The same goes for content or entertainment such as webpages, gaming, video or audio streaming.  Already today many proposed DApps rely on tiny payments between participants in the network to incentivise cooperative behaviour.  Instant Token Swaps  Next to payments, the exchange of tokens is probably the second most prominent use case of blockchains. This is even more so the case, if the current trend of tokenization continues. Decentralized exchanges built on Raiden Networkâ€™s atomic token swaps feature allow to instantly exchange tokens at low cost.  Works with any token that follows Ethereumâ€™s standardized token API (ERC20)          Some Links: Website:https://raiden.network/ Summary:https://raiden.network/101.html Blog:https://www.medium.com/@raiden_network Reddit:https://www.reddit.com/r/raidennetwork/ Token Sale:https://token.raiden.network/ [/list]",False
