We imagine a world where you can take your eBay reputation and use it to sell on Craigslist. Ink Protocol also has built-in escrow and 3rd party dispute resolution to make P2P marketplace payments safe and easy!  Ink Protocol is developed by Listia, an 8 year old VC-backed company with a thriving existing marketplace. Listia.com will become the first marketplace that is fully integrated with Ink, giving it an immediate use-case (10M registered users and over 100M items trade since 2009)!

Sign up on Listia to get 1,000-5,000+ Credits immediately. You can then earn more by selling your used goods on Listia, inviting friends or through various activities, but all you need to do is sign up to participate in the air drop and start earning additional bounties.

Let's get technical!  First, reference our Whitepaper to get a good overview of our mission and how we plan on getting there.  At the Ethereum level, we will basically be using our Ink smart contract to drive our Ink transaction states: https://paywithink.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Ink-State-Diagram.pdf  Our smart contract will be responsible for:  - Creation of transactions by the buyer - Acceptance of transaction by the seller - Handle disputes between buyer and seller - Request mediator interaction if necessary - Allow mediator to determine the outcome of the transaction (where the Ink goes) - Allow buyer to leave feedback on the transaction once it's completed - Linking accounts/addresses so that reputation aggregators will be able to combine reputation between 2 or more accounts/addresses. - Authorize an agent to create/progress/complete transactions on your behalf. This is useful more marketplaces (like Listia) to make transactions on behalf of our users.  The functions outlined in the state diagram are the actual functions we've implemented on our smart contract. Once we get closer to the launch, we will be publishing our smart contract on GitHub.
