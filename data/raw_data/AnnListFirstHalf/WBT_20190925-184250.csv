Let's get to know each other! We are a Whalesburg team, mining a pool that helps earn more with automatic switching and transparent statistics. We're not selling you Whalesburg here. It's just that we genuinely love what we do and we want to talk about it.  There will be posts about our lives at Whalesburg, new chips in development, and services. Here we will talk about the problems of the world of mining and crypto, about new technologies and projects that change our industry.  I want this blog to become alive, and you have the opportunity to address personally the people who run it. Basically, I will write here, and my name is Yuyukova Alena.     I am the PR director of Whalesburg, and I have been in it for a long time. I finished MIEM, I was engaged in issues of system integration, automation of technological and business processes of enterprises, and then I went into marketing. For the last 11 years, I've been doing PR. This topic is very close to me.    My credo is only a happy, calm and satisfied employee can bring a pool of profit. Therefore all our PR activities I make so that children feel important and necessary in the world of mining and our pool, and want to develop in the profession.  In this blog, there will necessarily be appeals of our founder Eugene Knitkin.     For 14 years, Eugene has been engaged in entrepreneurial activity and was the first in the Russian market who thought that it was possible to make a qualitatively new analytical product with transparent statistics in the mining market. This problem became particularly relevant to him when he saw the needs of miners which were not met by existing solutions in the market. We treat miners as entrepreneurs who need high-quality and pleasant analytics, detailed statistics, transparent reporting, good and responsive technical support. It is for this that Whalesburg is loved by more than 1,000 miners who continue to use the pool to this day. By providing feedback to developers, together with our customers, we systematically improve the product with kernel and interface updates.    Over the past two years, we've been a team going from idea to a mature company. Through success at TGE in June, through the market crisis in December. At the end of 2018, the ETH/USD rate was at $90, which affected the capital of many projects in the market very negatively. The situation was exacerbated by the fact that many start-ups, bypassing key stages of development, ""began to play in corporations"" with all the accompanying features. Young companies closed without the time to realize their plans. Few were able to survive such conditions and stay afloat.   Now the strategy of the company is based on the services of providing detailed analytics and providing analytical data to miners on their equipment. Whalesburg believes that computing power is the ""oil"" of future generations. We plan to occupy 3% of the market in 2020 and 5% in 2021 of the GPU mining market.  Igor Avakov Igor can develop even the most complex technical solutions. The latest updates from Igor blew our telegraph chat with delight of many of the Whalesburg pool miners!   Igor began his career as a developer in one of the Russian banks, where he gained experience in the team and development of applications for stock exchange trading platforms, and already on the next project, having received full freedom of development, he designed and implemented the architecture of the platform for carrying out ICO and trading crypto from scratch. The topic of crypto and mining has always attracted Igor, and our pool - a unique implementation of complex and interesting algorithms, where he can fully realize the potential of the developer. Igor provides stability of transactions, reliability of award distribution to miners and efficiency of the algorithm of return switching. In his spare time, Igor is engaged in integration with exchanges and is studying new coins for addition to our pool. You can communicate with Igor in Telegram ‚Äì @gargantua88    Nikita Bystrykh It was he who made technical support convenient and simple, not only in the project but also among pools in the market. Nikita considers any task or idea for the project to make it better! He has 17 years of experience ‚Äì in his portfolio of Transneft-scale companies; in the crypt, 6 years, and last year's crisis was not the first for him. That is why, together with the team, he was able to find opportunities to prevent collapse, to make sure that the company began to make a profit. As a result, the project for him became native. You can communicate with Nikita in Telegram ‚Äì @nekeat     Alexey Tkachenko Makes the product passionate, which you want to promote in the areas not only of our homeland but also outside it! He has 3 years of development experience in React/Redux. During this time he created 4 large cross-platform applications. Today using his experience and best practices in the field of microservice architecture Alexey makes our product better. Alexey loves difficult tasks, he is not only not afraid of them but seeks to solve each in the most interesting way. He works on the appearance of Whalesburg.com and develops Whalesburg Monitoring Bot.    We want this blog to be as open as possible, so Leave comments, share an article in chat rooms!",False

As the future of Cryptopia remains uncertain we would kindly recommend you to suspend payouts to your Cryptopia wallet.

After you suspend your payouts to Cryptopia wallet that might be compromised you may change your Whalesburg mining wallet to a new one. You can do that by writing to support@whalesburg.com  We do hope your funds remain safe as Cryptopia comes back to fully operational more.

Dear Friends!  We treat your stability and security as a top priority and we know that uninterrupted mining process is very important! That‚Äôs about money after all.  Now Whalesburg has 2 connection addresses instead of 1:  eu1.whalesburg.com:8082 eu2.whalesburg.com:8082   In the unlikely event of failover miner will be able to automatically switch to the reserve address and continue mining.  All you have to do is make some quick adjustments to your miner‚Äôs settings. For your convenience we have updated instructions (link) for the most popular miners and OS.  Meanwhile our current address p.whalesburg.com:8082 will still be valid so changing address is optional and you can continue mining as you do now. Switching to new address is not mandatory and is an optional measure to improve your mining stability. Every Miner Matters: How To Continue Mining With Your 3Gb Cards!  We do value every miner that is with us and therefore we have come up with a solution to address one of the major concerns raised in our Telegram community!  Can I still mine with 3Gb cards? Good news is YES, you can!  We will create 2 separate ports for 3gb cards:   eu1-3g.whalesburg.com:8083 eu2-3g.whalesburg.com:8083   You will be able to mine coins with DAG that can fit into your memory.  As we know Ethereum‚Äôs epoch is very close to the limit we recommend to use finminer as it will allow you to mine Ethereum with 3Gb cards as long as possible.  Currently we would propose using finminer + linux (for example HiveOS), as this will allow 3Gb cards to mine ETH till 9-14 January 2019 (based on current network difficulty ). Finminer is using available memory in a smarter way, and linux unlike Windows uses available resources wisely.  You can download and set up finmainer on our website at Instructions section https://whalesburg.com/start_mining  As of today ETC is no longer available for 3Gb cards, in future ETH will be eliminated as well. But we‚Äôre working on adding new Ethash coins that can be mined with 3Gb cards.  If you have any questions please ask one of your tech support specialists in Telegram channel.  Thank you for choosing us! We do our best to make mining more profitable and enjoyable for you!  Your Whalesburg Team",False

Hello again to our long term supporters and welcome to our hundreds of newly joined miners!  You may have noticed crazy growth in the number of miners and the pool hashrate over the past couple of weeks, despite the recent market decline. Miners stay strong!  In case you were wondering what prompted the spike, the answer is that we have launched a massive YouTube marketing campaign that caused a bit of a stir within the Russian miner community. We will get everyone talking about Whalesburg soon!  On the topic of product development, the past few weeks have been incredibly busy for our development team as we are approaching the token unlock and token integration (update coming soon). Not to mention we are working on adding new Ethash coins and the CryptoNight algorithm.  Meanwhile, we still found time to bring you some exciting new features in this latest release.  Enjoy!  UX/UI Minimum Payout This is by far the most requested feature ever. Yes, now you can manually change the minimum payout amount in your account settings    Multi wallet monitoring via Telegram Bot Many of our miners have been asking for the option to do multi wallet monitoring. With this release, you can add up to five wallets that you would like to monitor. This means you can get convenient notifications from our bot if there‚Äôs a problem with your farm. In case miners wish to add more than five wallets, we will add such option later.    Easy registration In order to speed up the registration process, now when you enter the wallet, the system identifies whether you are in the referral program. This means that you won‚Äôt have to enter a promo code again.    For your convenience we have also added a description for errors that occur when you have entered the wallet that mined with us before.    Other UX/UI Upgrades:  Added Sign In button    Enabled instant refresh of the rewards list. This means now you don‚Äôt have to wait for the table to update. Added ‚ÄúTotal Paid‚Äù amount. Because it‚Äôs always good to know how much you were paid in total.    Under the Hood Maintenance As we are growing rapidly, we care more and more about stability and security of the pool. In order to be able to scale easily and to get the best performance possible, we have added more CPUs which resulted in significantly increased pool performance.

Our team took some time to recalculate our token economics model in order to bring the best solution for everyone. It wasn‚Äôt easy, and we went through multiple iterations. We decided to take a slightly different approach than we had outlined in the white paper in order to not interfere with our popular referral program. So, without further adieu, this is what we‚Äôve come up with:  No Pool Fees Yes! Starting from 20th December 2018 we will no longer have a pool commission! Instead we will offer a increased share price for each ascending tier. No matter the tier you are in, though, you will still be getting the most attractive profit on the market per monthly period thanks to our pool‚Äôs superior profit switching algorithm!  Why do I need WBT tokens? Holding WBT can bring you to the next level in terms of mining profitability. You can increase your share price and thus your overall profit by holding enough tokens to upgrade to the next tier.  However, you can still mine without holding WBT and stay at the START tier. We decided to keep this tier in order to allow quick onboarding for new miners. We understand that as a new miner you might want to test the pool first without any obligations. Think of it as a test drive:)  Once you have finished your test drive and want to stay with us (we bet you will), you will likely want to get the most out of our pool and increase your profitability by moving to the next tier up.  Those who have both feet in mining and want to mine like a PRO will consider upgrading to tier 4, which in the long run, will bring a noticeable profit increase.  Here are the tiers we offer:  Tiers: START - basic share price (average market price) - no token required 1 tier - basic share price + 0.5% 2 tier - basic share price + 1% 3 tier - basic share price + 1.5% 4 tier - basic share price + 2%   How many WBT do I need to qualify for each tier? We will calculate tiers against your hashpower. The amount of WBT needed for each tier is dynamic and is calculated based on the current WBT/ETH price.  1 tier - X amount of WBT equal to 0,12 ETH/ GHs 2 tier - X amount of WBT equal 0,23 ETH/ GHs 3 tier - X amount of WBT equal 0,357 ETH/ GHs 4  tier - X amount of WBT equal 0,57 ETH/ GHs  This means if you buy WBT now and the price goes up, you might have surplus WBT on your account. In that case you would be free to either to sell your surplus WBT for a profit, or use it to upgrade to the next tier and enjoy an increased share price and thus profit. In the event of WBT price going down, you might need to top up your WBT balance or go one tier down.  Where can I buy WBT? As of today WBT is listed on Idex. We‚Äôre working on getting listed on other exchanges in early 2019.  In early 2019 we will develop an integration with exchanges that will include the option of buying WBT automatically (from your Whalesburg account). This means you won‚Äôt have to go to exchanges to manually buy WBT. If you enable ""buy WBT automatically"" in your account settings, a sufficient amount of WBT will be bought automatically using your mined ETH. You can think about it as if you mined WBT directly.  Important: WBT stays in your account and doesn't get ""burned"" by the platform. This means you are free to sell your WBT at any time (for instance if you would like to quit mining). Therefore, you can not only mine with us enjoying increased profitability by holding more WBT, but you can also sell WBT and get your money back (or even multiply your original investment) should you wish to stop mining.   Basically WBT is a tool that not only brings you to the next level of profitability, but itself is a tradable token.",False

In fact most of you enjoyed it so much that didn‚Äôt want to switch back to the old one once testing was finished.  That‚Äôs why we decided to go live with new interface now, without waiting for Release 0.5.0. We want all of our miners to see it! As always new interface is aimed to make your mining experience enjoyable and bring transparency to the next level.  We do understand that every miner wants to know if his worker is performing well in order to get maximum profitability. Now you don‚Äôt have to sit and monitor your worker.  At any time you can check new graphs on statistics page:    - your overall workers statistics as well as break down stats for each worker.    - 3 types of hashrate available in your stats: current or average for 30 mins, 6 hours average –∏ reported hashrate. Reported hashrate is the one sent by your miner.    - As for shares you will be able to see your valid, stale, invalid shares.    - Added link to etherscan for each payout transaction.    Quick access to pool blocks page from distribution capacity table.  Again we would like to thank everyone who helped us with testing and gave valuable feedback.

Even if you mined let's say UBIQ and then algorithm switched you to ETC, you still get a part of block reward for UBIQ as you have contributed to finding the block. This is what our profit switching idea is about. As I can see on your stats page - there was only one switch to the UBIQ (Bittrex fee is so small, it cannot affect too). By the way, your stats show a lot of invalid shares, which tells me you have some overheating or too much overclocked hardware (disconnecting miners, unstable hashrate).

Now it is time to present you with Whalesburg version 0.5.0.  To make new release even more exciting we include a PROMO CODE: WHALESBURG0.5.0 to enjoy 33% OFF your pool commission (in case you are not registered in our referral program yet). Activate it now! In response to our mining community‚Äôs requests for more coins to be added to our minable coins list, we have been researching potential candidates. We are aiming to bring the best to our miners and we realize that adding new coins is essential. Today we are excited to announce the news everyone has been waiting for: new coins! The first two coins we‚Äôve decided to add are Dubai and Music.   Why these Two? Both Dubai and Music are ideal choices mainly because they have sufficient trading volumes and high-volatility. This makes them the perfect fit for profit switching: we are confident there will be significant time-periods when mining these coins is more profitable than mining ETH. And this is why we keep sticking with the profit-switching concept! It not only ensures stable high profitability at times of medium to low volatility, but also allows you to grab super profits when coins rapidly pump. Those who are switching between coins manually might easily miss this opportunity because sometimes it is a matter of minutes. With Whalesburg you don‚Äôt have to worry about missing out of high profits due to pumps: profit-switching identifies and anticipates pumps before you and does the work for you! Stay tuned because we are analyzing the market to select even more well performing and profitable coins for the pool. Also please take a moment to answer a few coin related questions in our questionnaire posted in our Telegram channel.  Whalesburg Miner Coming Soon We are in the process of developing on our own miner to allow us to switch between different algorithms such as CryptoNight (Upcoming) and Ethash.  Front End Improvements Based on feedback from miners gathered in the past month, we have taken the step of significantly improving the miners‚Äô statistics page. The improvements are summarized as follows: - We have segregated the wallet payments and rewards earned per block so you can easily differentiate between them.    - We now provide detailed statistics on how much your miner received for each block. We also added an option to convert these statistics to a CSV file which can be downloaded for further analysis.  - The income graph is now based on your specific time zone rather than a generic UTC like it was before. This means you will no longer have to deal with the confusion of blocks being mined on one day and payments made on the next day. - We added a miner performance history graph. This enables you to see how your miner has performed against its own average. - In addition to improvements to the miners‚Äô statistics page, we have added instructions for a new miner: Finminer. This means there are now a total of five different miners to choose from, depending on your preferences.   Back End Improvements We are constantly working to improve the backend efficiency, reliability, and security. In this release, the improvements are summarized as follows: - New services which aggregate statistics from all endpoints of the pool have been added. The resulting reduction in frontend server requests translates into a significant improvement in overall pool performance. - The profit switching module has been fully rewritten. The result is faster and more reliable coin switches. - Transaction groupings have been changed from exchange rounds to blocks. - Multiple changes related to security and optimization of the pool‚Äôs performance have been implemented. - Pool monitoring has been improved and some modules have been rewritten. - CPU consumption has been reduced, improving server performance.

The common perception among crypto-miners is that they must choose between consistent daily payouts and high-risk / high-reward profits. The choice appears to comes down to either valuing the peace of mind that comes from stability, or recklessly gambling with the hope of one day hitting the jackpot. Today we‚Äôd like to offer proof for why you no longer have to make that uncomfortable choice.  Yes, with Whalesburg you can have both stability and high profits!  Introducing PPS+, a New Reward Distribution Scheme!  Stability:  We consider our miners‚Äô user experience a top priority. That is why we decided to switch to PPS+. With PPS+ you no longer have to worry about wildly volatile payouts. PPS+ makes your daily payouts consistent and comfortable. PPS+ is a payout scheme that allows miners to receive payment for every share submitted, regardless of how many blocks were found and so called ‚Äúpool luck‚Äù. This scheme enables consistent payouts every 20 minutes. The reward for every share is calculated based on the average block reward that the pool receives and the average network difficulty for the past 20 minutes. We treat all the blocks mined as blocks with 100% variance, and we are paying our miners even for blocks that are not found yet. How is this possible, you ask? Isn‚Äôt that an advance payment system? The answer is that we have full trust in the math. We know that over the course of several hundred blocks, variance will be equal or very close to 100%. This is why neither miners, nor the pool are in a disadvantaged position when PPS+ is implemented. Meanwhile transaction commission which pool receives with every full block will still be distributed according to PPLNS scheme because transaction commissions may vary and we cannot predict the number. So to be fair to our miners we will use PPLNS so that everyone gets their % of reward.  Profitability:  By far the most common concern raised by miners is that when we move to PPS+, profitability is going to drop down to just ‚Äúaverage‚Äù! Rest assured. This will NOT happen. First of all, Whalesburg was never meant to be average You don‚Äôt need to worry. That‚Äôs because our advanced profit-switching algorithm will keep working for you to bring you higher profits. The only difference is that with PPS+, the reward for every share is calculated based on the pool‚Äôs average block reward. This means the high profits stay, while the uncomfortable volatility disappears. In case you‚Äôre still not convinced, let‚Äôs take the theory and put it into practice to prove the effectiveness of the new system. We have built a model of pool balance to simulate using PPS+ starting from the moment when we enabled ETH mining at the beginning of October. As you can see from the graph below, the pool balance had rather dramatic ups and downs. However, if you look at the overall monthly balance, it has evened out by the end of the month. This is proof that the PPS+ scheme works correctly for both miners and the pool. Everyone gets their fair share    If that looks too volatile for you, here is another graph to give you an idea how this new PPS+ will look like for a regular miner with 1GH/s. For this model we took the same period. As you can see miner‚Äôs income is consistently high.    Our mission has always been making mining not only profitable but enjoyable. Start mining now and enjoy stable payouts and high profits! Stay tuned!

Today we‚Äôd like to tell you about the path taken by one of our valuable team members, Ivan Sidortsov.  Passionate about computers since he was a child, Ivan graduated in 2005 from Murmansk State Tech University with a Masters degree in Information Systems and Economics. Ivan got his start in the tech world through the Russian Navy where he served as a cyber warfare technical support specialist for four years until 2009. ‚ÄúThis was pre-social media really, so nobody was election hacking by gaming Facebook,‚Äù Ivan jokes, ‚ÄúBut it was fascinating to be exposed to that level of professionalism at the start of my career.‚Äù  Having gained valuable experience at the highest levels, Ivan was able to transfer his skills to a database administrator position for the Russian Ministry of Labour. ‚ÄúI enjoyed my time working for the Russian state, and I learned a lot, but I always knew I wanted to have a more independent impact.‚Äù In his free time, therefore, Ivan started by launching a successful computer maintenance and sales business.  Ivan caught the crypto bug in 2013 and has never recovered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cliche at this point, but the idea of a currency that‚Äôs not controlled by the government is really what attracted me.‚Äù Ivan went down the rabbit hole, using his technical skills to build mining rigs. In the last 3 years he‚Äôs set up more than 120 mining rigs and helped to launch two successful mining farms with 70 rigs each. Always looking for ways to improve the performance of his rigs, Ivan eventually stumbled across the solution proposed by Whalesburg.  ‚ÄúWhen I first heard about Whalesburg in February, I immediately identified project‚Äôs vision. As a miner, I knew firsthand that what Whalesburg was proposing to build was desperately needed and would be very successful if done right. I was one of the first people to add my rigs to the Whalesburg pool; it has simplified my process dramatically, and of course it has improved my rig‚Äôs profitability.‚Äù Ivan was thrilled to join Whalesburg team later on. In his starting role as tech support, Ivan‚Äôs passion for mining and expertise were obvious to fellow miners who consistently offered glowing feedback. Now, after four months of hard work, we are happy to announce Ivan has been promoted to Product Manager.  With his professional experience in technical support and personal devotion to crypto mining, Ivan was the perfect choice for the position of Product Manager at Whalesburg. He knows exactly the issues that miners face on a daily basis so he is well suited to push development of Whalesburg platform in the right direction. He is very passionate about the product and constantly brings new ideas on how to improve it.  Over the last few weeks Ivan has been working closely with Whalesburg‚Äôs development team to enhance the Road Map. Also Ivan is part of marketing team helping to work out the best marketing strategy and product positioning as he not only understands but also anticipates miners‚Äô needs. The goal remains fulfilling our customers needs by delivering the best product possible.  Congratulations Ivan!  We will continue this series about our team members so that you get to know us better!  Stay Tuned!

Partners of Whalesburg will receive a promotional code which they can share with friends.  2. We attract partner miners The Whalesburg City is now ready to accept more residents, so at the beginning of August an advertising campaign will be launched in two key areas: a brand development campaign aimed at increasing brand awareness, and performance marketing aimed at increasing sales Within the framework of the campaigns, a wide range of tools will be used, which will be implemented step by step: contextual advertising, partner programs and CPA, SEO, social media and messengers, video content and other relevant Internet marketing tools. We are also working on involving the current partners of Whalesburg in the marketing campaign.  3. Strengthening the relationship with clients The team at Whalesburg has established a direct sales line. A team of consultants joined us, all of whom have their own superpowers.

The decision ultimately reached by the Ethereum Foundation will have a huge impact on not only Ethereum and its stakeholders, but also a large segment of the crypto Yflecosystem.

What this means is a whole next level of recognition within the industry and a great exposure of our product. Think big: Ethminer has hundreds thousands downloads and one of most popular GitHub repositories visited by thousands daily. Today Ethminer is one of the most widely recognized and usable miners out there. In fact, it enters the top medalists trio: Ethminer, Claymore, and Phoenix. And Ethminer is super popular for a reason it is one of the simplest and the most efficient miners.  The best things about Ethminer is that it supports many of the protocols used by miners already (again, all over the world), there are regular updates, it is compatible with the top OS‚Äôs, and you basically hardly have to change anything when you switch to Ethminer from something else. What does it mean for me? As we mentioned above you can now find Whalesburg at official Ethminer Github listed as one of the featured Ethash mining pools with configuration instructions.      Not only does it mean that we‚Äôre getting our name out there among the whales of the industry, also in a sense you will become a part of a community of hundreds thousands miners that use Ethminer to set up their rigs.

The numbers are almost final (pending review) so we are now able to announce the final crowdsale process and contribution cap.  Firstly, we just want to thank you for all your enormous support! We had to close our whitelist early since the amount pledged exceeded our total supply of WBT. The pledges from people that passed KYC show that the demand for WBT is 18x more than what we‚Äôve allocated for the crowdsale! This is just incredibly humbling.  The majority of the whitelist pledges were in the amount of 10+ ETH. Although we would be more than happy to fulfill every single pledge, our sale has almost reached its cap and we don‚Äôt have this much left to sell! That being said, please take advantage of the following schedule to make sure you aren‚Äôt one of the unlucky few participants who misses out on their chance to take part in the Whalesbrug crowdsale.  We have broken down our crowdsale into three rounds in order to give everyone in our amazing community a chance to participate. We have split our crowdsale into these three rounds in order to strike a balance between offering everyone a chance to participate as well as an ability to purchase a significant amount of WBT.  Round 1: Our initial round will be a 2 (two) hour window with a cap of 1.25 ETH per person. This round will run on a first come, first served basis with the chances of being allocated up to a maximum of 1.25 ETH being quite high (although not guaranteed). This round starts at 16:00 UTC June 3rd, 2018.  Round 2: Following round 1, round 2 will run for another 2 (two) hour window also on a first come, first served basis but the individual cap is increased to 3.75 ETH (including any contribution made in round 1). The round starts at 18:00 UTC June 3rd, 2018.  Final Round: Our final round will run for 30 (thirty) days and the contribution allowed per person will be uncapped. The final round starts at 20:00 UTC June 3rd, 2018.  Please note that the sale will end when the hard cap of 3800 ETH has been allocated, regardless of which round we‚Äôre in.  If we reach 3800 ETH in round 1, there will be no round 2 or round 3.  Remember, our goal is to build the best all-in-one mining solution for the crypto community. To reach that goal it‚Äôs in everyone‚Äôs best interests that WBT are distributed as fairly as possible so that our community remains strong and motivated.

Dear Whalesburg Community,  Whalesburg is proud to announce a new addition to the team: Vladimir Gusev will be assuming the position of a Chief Operating Officer. Vladimir will be in charge of management at the highest level, which will include operation control, handling Information Technology, Internet and multimedia, production, technology, and vertical integration of people and resources to enable smoother and more efficient work of the platform.  Vladimir‚Äôs key strength is over a decade‚Äôs worth of close management of individuals and intricate understanding of teamwork.  As we are always looking to enhance user experience, lose the red tape and have you spending less time managing and more time gaining profit, we are proud to present a specialist who has an extensive background in, but not limited to:  1. Managing account managers and project managers,  2. Running a projects office,  3. Supervising multiple IT departments in several branches:  ¬∑ launch of various projects,  ¬∑ development strategy,  ¬∑ budget management,  ¬∑ business process optimization,  ¬∑ effectivity audits,  ¬∑ implementation of automated systems.  Vladimir‚Äôs track record is clearly indicative of his exceptional team-organizing skills, which was our top requirement for this position.  Nurlan Abdrassilov, our existing Chief Operating Officer/Solutions Architect, will be staying with us and focusing on the rapidly growing sector of cryptocommunity support and maintenance and audits for crypto-exchanges and observance of our members‚Äô interests.  Because our sphere of influence is growing (and so is the workload) we are strengthening our team with Vladimir, and dedicating Nurlan to a specialized niche so that he can get completely immersed into maintaining the structural integrity of the community‚Äôs experience.   Tangible achievements  Vladimir has an extensive track record of achievements, the most notable of which include attaining the following positions:  ¬∑ Head of PMO, COO in MVNO (mobile virtual networks, Internet of things, Machine 2 machine, system integration, software development) at Center 2M finance group  ¬∑ Head of Department at Sberbank‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäTechnology (Russia)  ¬∑ Deputy Director of the Department for International Projects at Megafon  ¬∑ Strategy Director (Aquafon)  ¬∑ Head of the Department of Information Systems and Communications at ArcticGas (Gazprom)  ¬∑ Deputy Director of the IT Department at Mobile TeleSystems (MTS)  ¬∑ Director of the Department for Network Development and Operation, Technical Director for the Central region at Effortel (Russia)  We approach HR extremely seriously as we know that in today‚Äôs furiously competitive business world only top-of-the-range professionals have what it takes to lead a business to success.  Although operational prudence, integrity, and ability to handle feedback are key, before anything else we look for an awesome track record and uncompromising commitment to liaisons with fellow team members.  What made us choose in favor of Vladimir was first and foremost his colossal field of expertise (over a decade of managing corporate IT and Telecommunications divisions).  The Whalesburg is focusing on taking teamwork to another level with the highest standard first and foremost, and Vladimir is the best person we have seen for the job for the following reason.  In selecting Vladimir we were guided by his personal communication skills, his ability to lead a team and at the same time to be a part of it, as well as last but not least achievements and professional qualifications.  Skills  Secondly, we couldn‚Äôt help but note his wide array of skill sets, from developing software products aimed at management of pharmacy chains, logistics, procurement and In-Tech marketing to running Sberbank Technology (Deputy Head of Department at the time).  Vladimir is one of the most prominent specialists in his field, which is undoubtedly primarily thanks to his exceptional level of education.  Education  There is nothing more important than education, which is why we only take on board professionals with education at a global standard of excellence.  With Vladimir‚Äôs MBA in strategic management and entrepreneurship business from London Metropolitan (Guildhall) University and another MBA in the same field from Moscow International Higher Business School as well as a diploma of a Professional Business Manager and a diploma in International Accounting Standards from The Institute Of Professional Finance Managers, we are completely confident in Vladimir‚Äôs ability to deliver nothing but irreproachable service.  Vladimir‚Äôs Vision  We are tremendously excited to have such a reputable specialist assuming one of the leading roles here at Whalesburg. Besides from the above, Vladimir‚Äôs experience of working in multicultural corporations and conducting programs of projects with a high budget, both in Russia and abroad, will be in great demand with us as we extend our influence into the global market.

The successful completion of our token sale marks a turning point for our project so in the last few weeks the executive members of our team have taken the opportunity to reflect on the project and craft a long-term strategy going forward with the aim of developing our project into a sustainable business. Our goal remains capturing the highest possible market share and bringing the greatest possible value to WBT holders while staying true to our mission of offering the best and only all-in-one mining solution in the business.  Here are the key points we‚Äôd like to share regarding our latest activities: 1. Our executives performed a detailed analysis of the market in several sections with a view to solidifying the positioning of the company for the next two years. This analysis included a study of the competitive environment, potential partner relationships, and product marketing. 2. Based on the above analysis, we identified the main and secondary goals for the year ahead and we‚Äôve set tasks and milestones for their effective achievement. These goals are concerning software development, marketing strategy, sales strategy, and operational activities. 3. We drew up a detailed budget for the year. This includes a financial model of the company with cash flow, profit and loss, and return on investment for forecasted plans. 4. We created a new organizational structure which allows for the addition of new staff. This will be critical for the realization of our goals for the coming year. First and foremost, we hired a very experienced COO, Vladimir Gusev. He has already been instrumental in helping develop our strategic plan going forward, and he will be essential for ensuring the plan‚Äôs smooth execution. Our next addition was a new CMO who officially joined the team on June 24th (a separate announcement is coming) and who will be focusing on the additional marketing segments that are required for us to reach the new milestones and achieve a sustainable business expediently. 5. We established relations with local regulators in the countries where we operate and we are working to ensure compliance in the most efficient manner. 6. We consulted with a Big Four accounting company to complete a number of important tasks in the field of accounting and legal relations. 7. We completed several important tasks related to information security. 8. We have started and are continuing negotiations with our partners in mining. This includes the creation of a new combined product that is currently in the process of being carried out (an announcement will also be made about this).  Development  1. Pool optimization: our developers made significant progress in the past month. Based on our preliminary analysis, Whalesburg currently has the highest average block reward among all existing Ethereum mining pools (!); this was achieved by optimizing the pool‚Äôs performance. We‚Äôll be giving more details on that in an upcoming post. 2. Upcoming release: we have prepared the next maintenance release (version 0.3.2) which is now in the final stages of testing. We will announce complete details of that update in the next few days.  Audit and Tokens  We are pleased to announce that we successfully passed an audit from Aurora Dao and as a result have been listed on IDEX. Meanwhile audits by other exchanges are still ongoing and, as we are in the queue, unfortunately there is nothing we can do to influence this. Therefore WBT tokens will remain locked until those audits are completed. We will announce the unlocking in a separate post as soon as possible. We know bounty participants have been waiting patiently so we are pleased to inform you that we have finished the calculations for the bounty rewards and will be announcing the distribution shortly. Also, we are glad to confirm that finally all private sale contributors have successfully completed KYC and so we are starting their token distribution. As usual, we are happy to keep you as informed as possible about our latest news, development, and overall progress. Stay with us and we will make mining easier, more enjoyable, and more profitable!

While the dust was settling on our token sale, our dev team was hard at work on the latest maintenance release. So we‚Äôre proud to be able to announce our latest update, which includes several significant improvements:  Mining Pool Upgrades  Whalesburg is constantly working at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our mining pool so that all members end up with the highest possible profitability. This is the foundation of what is quickly making Whalesburg the best all-in-one mining solution in the business.  Smart Upstream Switcher  We are super excited to announce that we‚Äôve made big improvements to the pool‚Äôs upstream switcher to ensure every millisecond of every connected miner‚Äôs power is used in the most profitable way possible. Before this release, the switcher was merely checking the availability of the coin node. Now it's much more intelligent. Here‚Äôs how it works: In the background the pool constantly monitors the state of all nodes and the mining tasks produced by them. Our new Smart Upstream Switcher now notices when one of the nodes follows blockchain consensus faster and immediately gives that node‚Äôs mining tasks priority over the others. At the same time, our updated Smart Upstream Switcher notices when a node is not ready for a new task. Instead of interrupting the mining process by waiting for that node to, for example, reorganize the transaction pool, our Smart Upstream Switcher chooses another node for mining; one that‚Äôs ready now.   In general these changes mean faster jobs propagation to miners as well as the important benefit of avoiding the very wasteful situation of accidentally solving a stale job. Ultimately the updated Smart Upstream Switcher increases the overall node pool for mining so that now the pool has the capacity to use more nodes to take on mining jobs.  With the implementation of the Smart Upstream Switcher we‚Äôve also improved our own ability to internally monitor the system, adding metrics and graphics for mining job generation and receiving. This should allow us to make further improves in the coming weeks and months.  Here‚Äôs a run-down of the pool-related big fixes we‚Äôve made for this update: 1. We  increased the limit for worker names to prevent very long worker names from being omitted. 2. We‚Äôve customized and improved the Stratum Proxy protocol by fixing two bugs and adding new charts to our internal monitoring system  Payouts  Everyone in the mining game knows it‚Äôs all about the money. Nobody wants to wait days for their payouts, get charged unnecessary fees to receive them, and deal with infuriating error messages. That‚Äôs why we are happy to announce that we‚Äôve delivered more frequent and more reliable payouts at lower fees. 1. Now your payouts are calculated and executed every three hours! 2. We‚Äôve made gas price estimation enhancements that have resulted in decreased transaction confirmation time while ensuring the lowest possible transaction fee. Here‚Äôs how it works: The payouts module estimates the gas limit for each transaction to not waste a miner‚Äôs money, then it sends the payout straight to the miner‚Äôs address. This includes support for smart contract payouts, however it must not consume more than 50,000 GWei. The number has been increased from 21,000 so there should be any possibility of suffering an ‚Äúout of gas‚Äù failure. 3. On top of that, adhering to the ‚Äúfail fast‚Äù principle so that we can reduce errors in the most efficient manner possible, we have improved fail fast checks at every stage. 4. Finally, we have improved the API. This has resulted in a reduction of requests on some endpoints by as much as 6 times meaning the website loading time should be reduced.  Frontend  Finally, because we know it‚Äôs important to have a comfortable and intuitive user experience, we‚Äôre constantly working on improving the frontend of our platform. To that end, here are the fixes we‚Äôve made in this latest upgrade: 1. We‚Äôve fixed the ‚Äúmining now‚Äù badge that had been displaying incorrectly under certain conditions. You can now rest assured that the coin the platform says you‚Äôre mining is actually the coin you‚Äôre mining! 2. We‚Äôve fixed the URL for ETC new blocks. 3. We‚Äôve improved charts‚Äô Y axis display making them clearer and easier to read. 4. Finally, we‚Äôve added more details to the pool blocks page including ‚Äúcurrent round variance,‚Äù ‚Äúnetwork hashrate,‚Äù and more. Here‚Äôs what the new pool blocks page looks like:   Rest assured that our developers are already working hard on the next upgrade in our constant battle to make Whalesburg the most profitable, easiest to use, most complete, and overall best mining solution in crypto!

Broadly speaking, all our improvements come down to these three steps, which are all necessary for you to enjoy an unrivaled service.  We have so far:   - Improved the way the interface is presented on widescreen displays, tablets, phones (about 70 different useful changes throughout the interface).  - Fixed incorrect formats of menus on tablets.  - Fixed issues with icons on iOS devices, which could occur in some cases.  - Added more information about coins on the main page. Current round variance (precise expected time to find a block) has also been added.     - Fixed an unpleasant lagging effect when prompts come up.  - Updated internal libraries on which the application is running.  - Improved the performance of graph drawing on the statistics page.  - Added transaction commission information for mobile version.     - The income graph currency is now stored using cookies and therefore is not reset after leaving the page.     - The workers information block for mobile version was redrawn completely.

We are truly excited about this project because it has the potential to improve communication and collaboration between miners using our platform.  Revain Board Member Dmitry Fedotov  As some of you are aware, Dmitry Fedotov, Board member of Revain, joined Whalesburg in March. Dmitry is a board member for multiple technology companies based in the United States and Asia. An expert in artificial intelligence, autonomous robotics, drone technology and digital marketing. Dmitry regularly speaks at international technology events. Projects he participated in include development of an AI driven marketing platform and engagement with Airbus in UAV development. Dmitry‚Äôs involvement with Revain brought our teams closer together, making this partnership possible.  Mining Profiles Within The Whalesburg Platform  Those of you who follow Whalesburg closely know that an important component of our platform is the ‚ÄúProfiles‚Äù section. Whalesburg users can select a profile that will govern how their mining equipment is used. Each profile contains script that customizes variables such as which coins to mine and when to withdraw coins. This enables miners to easily select and change mining strategies as the landscape of minable coins changes. For example, with a single click users can choose the ‚ÄúWhalesburg Profile,‚Äù meaning that their resources will be optimized using Whalesburg‚Äôs profit-switching algorithm. A single click allows users to switch to another profile such as ‚ÄúETH Only + Immediate Withdraw.‚Äù More details of the functionality of profiles can be found in our whitepaper. The profiles section also enables users to easily develop their own profiles. For example, a user could create a profile that mines a single coin, withdrawing coins immediately as they are mined. Alternatively, a user could set their profile to wait until a portion of mined coins have increased in value to a set percentage before withdrawing them. If a user wishes, they can share with the community the profiles they have developed. Top performing profiles that have been shared are ranked and listed on the platform. Other miners have the ability to write feedback on the profiles and leave tips.  Synergy in action  It is this system of feedback, reviews, and tips that Whalesburg is working on with Revain. The goal is to implement the review system in such a way as to ensure the best quality reviews are featured most predominantly. ‚ÄúRevain‚Äôs use of IBM‚Äôs Watson Tone Analyzer and Natural Language Understanding will help to automatically ensure the reliability of reviews. We are excited to integrate this technology as well as other expertise provided by Revain‚Äôs team of highly capable developers,‚Äù said Evgeniy Kitkin, CEO, Whalesburg.  About Revain  Launched in November 2017, Revain integrates AI with a unique system of token-based economics to incentivize and ensure higher quality reviews. Initially focusing on reviews for the progress of post-ICO projects, Revain has the potential to improve the overall quality of information available for the hundreds of projects that are now moving into the beta stages of their development. Revain is now a top 100 project with a respected team and a market cap of over about $150 million. ‚ÄúIt is exciting to enter this partnership: Whalesburg‚Äôs community is filled with highly knowledgeable miners working on the fine tuning of their mining output. We are excited to apply Revain‚Äôs solution within. In the long run we hope that this will produce highly demanded transparency in the entire post-ICO landscape‚Äù said Dmitry Fedotov Whalesburg‚Äôs developers will be working with developers from Revain over the coming weeks and months to build and implement review functionality.

Also, please note that residents of the USA (and all its territories) as well as China, are ineligible to purchase tokens.  KYC submissions will be processed by a third-party solution and you can check the result by logging into your dashboard.  This final stage of our token generation event will begin on June 3rd at 16:00 UTC and will be completed on July 3rd or until the hard cap of 3800 ETH is reached. Please note that as 2300 ETH have already been contributed to the project, only 1500 ETH is eligible to be contributed in this final stage. The price of WBT is set at 0.0000718 ETH and there is no bonus.  We want to thank everyone for your continued support and we look forward to serving you by building the best all-in-one crypto mining solution and mining pool in the industry.

John‚Äôs unique combination of technical know-how and leadership experience makes him the perfect person to lead an ambitious project like Whalesburg.  Educated in Prague, Czech Republic, John started his career in IT as a web developer working on projects like eCommerce systems and services, CMS plugins, HTML5 games, and support marketing campaigns. Starting off freelance, he quickly assembled a team that, in conjunction with Zurich-based global media agencies, was able to offer IT solutions for large corporations like Heineken and Swarovski.  It wasn‚Äôt long before he began to take on higher-level managerial positions, working as IT project manager for freelance network Diebuendner and COO at tech startup Booking Analytics.  His professional network expanding, John founded Talent-Guild in Moscow in 2016 with the aim of bringing top Eastern European IT talent to hungry global clients. Meanwhile, having discovered cryptocurrencies, John began trading on Poloniex and consulting for private mining investors and traders.  The logical next step for John was to merge his connections of the best IT talents in Eastern Europe with the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency mining. Seeing the inefficiently run setups of newly established mining farms, as well as the lack of technical know-how that newcomers to crypto-mining had, John founded Whalesburg as an all-in-one solution to the challenges faced by miners‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbig and small‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin a rapidly evolving and increasingly competitive environment.  In his role as CEO of Whalesburg, John manages a quickly growing team of top developers making sure they complete the goals laid out in Whalesburg‚Äôs ambitious roadmap.  ‚ÄúWe have the talent and we have the supportive and active community. I‚Äôm confident that Whalesburg will quickly achieve its goal of being the go-to solution for crypto-miners. In the process we hope to make crypto-mining easier and more profitable for everyone involved.‚Äù  Stay tuned!

They‚Äôve been making some great advancements in the efficiency of profit-switching while providing a transparent and user-friendly mining pool interface,‚Äù said Oddocash CEO Dmitriy Mironov. ‚ÄúWe are going to start by dedicating a quarter of our hashpower to their mining pool. If it pays off as we expect we‚Äôll be adding more.‚Äù  Oddocash, which focuses its mining 100% on ETH, has been able to expand its mining operations very quickly in the last year thanks to its profit sharing structure which allows people to participate with a contribution of as little as 0.01 ETH.  ‚ÄúWe really like that Oddocash has transparent financial accounting as this is something we strongly believe in at Whalesburg as well. It‚Äôs great that, just like with Whalesburg, Oddocash participants can see exactly where the money flows so they can know they are getting their fair share of the pool‚Äôs profits.

Majority of them is about setting up your equipment. We are constantly learning how to improve overall stability and optimize settings, therefore we came up with the following recommendations based on our own experience in mining. We hope that you will find them useful and it will help you to get the best of your mining experience.  Setting up motherboard BIOS and operating systems to maximize stability and hashrate of your rigs should be your main task which should be accomplished before you start setting up the miner of your choice and starting to mine cryptocurrencies.  For your benefit we put down some advice and recommendations concerning the setups. We want to remind you that the name of the paragraph, sections, as well as location of the adjustable elements may differ depending on your manufacturer, equipment version and software.  BIOS Setup  Update BIOS to the latest version, this could be done with the help of user instructions and programs from the official site of your motherboard manufacturer. Paragraph Restore on Power Loss‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää¬´Power On¬ª‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe rig will wake up automatically when power is back, power supply will be restored after power loss. Paragraph CPU Fan Control‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää¬´Auto¬ª‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääautomatic setting where your system fans speed will automatically adjust based on its use and temperature. Reduces noise level and prolongs term of service. Paragraph Audio Controller‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää¬´Disabled¬ª‚Ää‚Äî‚Äädisabling audio firmware controller, it‚Äôs of no use to mining but is wasting precious resources. Paragrah PCIe Speed‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää¬´Gen2¬ª‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin some cases helps to stabilize and increase hashrate, as it switches port PCI Express to PCI Express 2.0 mode and increases its capacity from 250 Mb\s to 500 Mb\s Paragraph PCIEX16_1 Link Speed‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää¬´Gen3¬ª‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähelps to increase PCIe16 ports capacity to 1 Gb\s If you don‚Äôt use your built-in graphic card for image display during Windows installation, than it makes sense to turn it off.  Windows Installation and setup  For operating systems installation should your disk storage space should be at least 60‚Äì120 GB HDD or SSD, we recommend SSD for higher download speed and work acceleration as a whole, disks with smaller storage capacity are not advised for Windows Installation, you will experience lack of free disk space if you proceed further. Also you should not partition your hard, use it fully for C drive. No need to connect Ethernet cable during Windows installation, you can download all the updates you need later. For the time of Windows Installation and Setup use only one graphic card connected to PCIEx16‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit can help avoiding problems with your devices operational systems recognition. Download only those drivers which are essential, normally that would be: Chipset, network interface driver(LAN) and graphic card driver without additional programs. Increase virtual memory to minimum of 16 GB, way to do it is:        1.Right click on My Computer, and choose Properties        2. Then click Advanced System Settings        3. in the tab Advanced, in chapter Performance click on Settings        4. go to the tab Advanced        5. below you will see Virtual memory, click Change        6. Uncheck ¬´Automatically manage paging file size for all drives¬ª        7. Check ¬´Custom size¬ª        8. in field ¬´Initial size (MB)¬ª write 16000        9. In field ¬´Maximum size (MB)¬ª write 16000        10. Click Set, then Ok and Apply        11. Do not forget to reboot system  Disable ¬´Sleep mode¬ª- otherwise the computer will be shutting down every 30 minutes, as operational systems see mining programs work as inactivity time. You can find ways of disabling this mode here: http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-enable-or-disable-sleep-mode-in-windows-10/ It would be helpful to create a tab *.bat for miners launch file within the ¬´Startup¬ª‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis would help to start up the miner automatically when the operational systems powers on. You can find ways of doing it here : https://tunecomp.net/add-program-to-startup-windows-10/  As we mentioned earlier Whalesburg Support Team is committed to improving your mining experience and bringing you the best possible solution.

After our last major release (0.3.0) which included the addition of ETH mining we‚Äôve upgraded several components of our pool. We‚Äôve also seen over 20x growth of our pool in the past month! Originally starting with a hashrate of ¬±10GH, our overall pool hashrate was increased to ¬±200GH. This increase in hashrate was accomplished with zero degradation in service quality and was achieved while ensuring a stable environment for our users. The infrastructure we‚Äôve built out has proven to be robust and scalable‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa necessity for a successful project. We just wanted to say thank you to both the community and to our amazing devops team for accomplishing such unprecedented growth in such a short period of time!  At Whalesburg, our goal is to make cryptocurrency mining as user friendly as possible therefore we‚Äôve added some adjustments to both the UI/UX as well as the backend to optimize performance and ensure a pleasant and effortless user experience. Although we have included a variety of upgrades in this release, we are continuously collaborating with stakeholders & partners on a daily basis in order to ensure that we document and roadmap all requested changes and platform improvements. Our future vision for Whalesburg includes major upgrades and pool components which will be incorporated through various major releases (as well as several minor releases) as indicated on our roadmap.  Front End  We‚Äôve upgraded our Smart Mining Platform user interface with a variety of graphic alterations, interface optimizations, tooltips and visual data sets. The front-end improvements will allow the user to easily interpret displayed data (aggregated from real time mining statistics such as ROI, Time to Next Block, Difficulty, Profitability etc.) to allow the user to understand exactly how his miners‚Äô effort is calculated. The user will also maintain a detailed breakdown of his assets and pending payouts in his user administration panel.  Front End Improvements Summary  Added more details on workers statistics:      Displaying orphan blocks in pool blocks statistics:     Add tooltips:     More detailed balances info:     Add currency selector on profits chart:     Internal changes (dependencies upgrade, refactoring, various internal bugfixes) Miscellaneous visual improvements   Payouts  We realize that all the improvements in the world will not compensate for a lack of steady payouts to our most important asset.. our customers! To allow for an optimal user experience, mining pool payouts have been improved upon, ensuring that payouts continue to be effortless and automated for both pool operators and pool clients. We‚Äôve pre-emptively employed a fix which ensures pool payouts for mining participants as well as perfected the coin addition process allowing for quick and simple integration of new coins into our pool.  Payouts Improvements Summary  Fix the issue when current day stats were not returned by daily stats API Update Ruby to the latest version Update Rails to 5.1.2 Use serializable isolation level in updating transactions instead of pessimistic locking in order to improve fault tolerance of the service Add new coins support as easy as possible‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämove all the coins configurations to the separate file. Adding new coins is a matter of updating this file and adding new field to the database Decrease the API response time with new DB indexes Double application level constraints on the database level in order to improve fault tolerance Fix bug with minimal deposit amount Fix the critical bittrex api issue that might lead to wrong calculations Add more validations for each step of payout process in order to mitigate wrong calculation risks Make payouts process more automated  Security/Redundancy  Both user security and platform security is of the utmost importance with the Whalesburg pool. We place extra emphasis on ensuring that our users can confidently trust our pool to protect both their information as well as their funds (before payout). We have added increased internal monitoring, Sentry reporting, failover options as well as an updated proxy. Whalesburg will continue to strive to set the precedent with a new standard of Platform IT security.  Smart Stratum Proxy  We have added various reporting tools and data aggregating components to our platform to ensure that we capture real time data in order to properly mitigate any potential downtime. These reporting tools include sentry reporting & alerting as well as basic grafana metrics which are implemented in order to insure constant data aggregation (for improvement & analytical purposes).  Reporting & Data Analytics Improvement Summary  Fix tcp buffer overflow. (Incorrect json) Added Sentry reporting Added Basic Grafana metric  Hash Power Distribution  Our fault tolerance has been updated in order to ensure guaranteed pool uptime. Fault tolerance improvements will also ensure more stable payouts for pool participants. Since our pool calculates mining profitability in real time and allocates hashing power to the most profitable coin, we have incorporated test distribution which continuously asks for this calculation and hash power allocation. Rest assured, we‚Äôve programmed our mining pool to ensure that it does all the heavy lifting‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääso you don‚Äôt have to.  Smart Distribution & Fault Tolerance Improvements Summary  Update dependencies Improve fault tolerance of the service Add a testing distribution  That‚Äôs all for now! Keep an eye on updates from us: we‚Äôre continually improving our product and to make your experience even better.

We are happy to report that more and more people are choosing Whalesburg‚Äôs all-in-one software solution and joining our mining pool.  Our sales team have been busy over the last few weeks, having meetings in several countries with some very large players. They‚Äôve closed deals with several big miners, cloud-mining companies, investment funds who have a crypto-mining division, and solo miners who invest in mining hardware. These signings include:  ‚õè Erman Fund and Aurorafund‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääboth are successful investment funds that are currently hosting mining operations with 8000 GPU and 500 ASICS S9 respectively.  ‚õè Orion‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa rapidly growing mining company providing containers with cooling equipment. Orion also has its own profit switching algorithm so our partnership may include knowledge sharing and even the possibility of partial integration of their algorithm.  ‚õè Golden-Beetle‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa mining company currently running 400 GPU operations.  ‚õè Igor and Tomic‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfast growing mining operations with 1500 GPU and 120 ASICS.  ‚õè CryptoCapitalMining‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa mining company hosting 10,000 GPU.  Overall we‚Äôve attracted hardware units representing more than 20,000 GPU cards so far.  Once we add ETH to the list of minable coins, the above miners will run about 2 weeks of testing using our suite of hardware monitoring tools and overclocking software. If they are happy with the stability and profitability of our solution‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand we are confident they will be‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey‚Äôll be gradually making the switch to our service over the coming weeks and months.  This is particularly good news for the Whalesburg community because our increasing total hashrate means that we will very soon be competitive on the biggest coins like ETH and ETC. Our developers have been focusing on building a solid architectural base to provide maximum stability so that we can ensure continuous, uninterrupted growth in the coming months. A full run-down of the improvements can be found here and here.  With the above improvements in place for tests with ETC over the last few weeks, the stability of our architectural base was proven so far, with no one reporting abnormalities and our algorithm showing expected profitability. Adding more overall hashrate over the next weeks and months as our partners make the switch will enable this recent proof of concept to move to real and increased profits with reliable stability for everyone in the pool.

While our main R&D team is busy developing version 0.3.0 of the Whalesburg Smart Mining Pool, our maintenance team has prepared security and stability update version 0.2.3. This update is a necessary step to meet the high security and stability standards we‚Äôve set for version 0.3.0, which is coming soon.  Security  In preparing this latest update, we had a comprehensive security audit conducted by Metascan. We passed the audit and implemented their recommended Disaster Recovery Plan. The plan consists of a set of predefined behaviors that are designed to stop a disaster ASAP while saving related data that can be used for further investigation to prevent future problems (kind of like an aircraft‚Äôs ‚Äúblack box‚Äù). The audit also uncovered a couple of issues that might have led to pool unavailability. Our maintenance team was able to fix those issues by changing the code and configurations. We additionally kicked-off the process of reorganizing the network in order to ensure maximum pool security.  Security Improvements Summary:  ‚õè Disaster Recovery Plan implemented. ‚õè Code and configuration changed to eliminate potential pool unavailability. ‚õè Reorganized network to ensure maximum pool security.  Stability  This update also made some significant stability improvements. Firstly, we‚Äôve added client-agnostic refactoring. This means that now both parity and geth are supported for seamless transition in the event of an emergency. Adding to that stability is the increased database performance and reliability included in this update.  We had been experiencing some Bittrex interaction stability issues. Thanks to the help of our community, the maintenance team were able to identify and fix them.  Stability Improvements Summary:  ‚õè Client-agnostic refactoring added. ‚õè Increased database performance and reliability. ‚õè Bittrex interaction improvement.  Additional Improvements to Stability:  ‚õè Update codebase to work with changes in API. ‚õè Increased limit for malformed packets.  Infrastructure  In addition to the security and stability improvements included in this update, we‚Äôve also added some hardware scalability improvements. First off, by adding more RAM for coin nodes we have reduced the chances of producing uncle blocks. This also means we have the ability to add five more coins to our quiver without any performance degradation. The second major hardware scalability improvement is the addition of a much more powerful CPU, which enables more miners to connect to our pool. This is great because, particularly in the last few weeks, we‚Äôve seen a lot of interest from miners looking to join our pool. This update is a crucial step in giving us the ability to safely take them on in the upcoming version 0.3.0.  Main Infrastructure Improvements Summary:  ‚õè More RAM for coin nodes ‚õè More powerful CPU  Additional Infrastructure Improvement:  ‚õè Multiple minor infrastructure configuration updates that add overall stability and scalability to the system.  User Interface  We also made some UI improvements. These include:  ‚õè BTC balance display fixed. ‚õè Bittrex transactions monitoring improved. ‚õè IE11 app crash issue fixed.  Policy  ‚õè Now possible to unban a miner almost instantly.  Payouts  ‚õè More transparent transactions reasons.  We want to thank the Whalesburg community for helping identify issues in need of improvement and for continuing to provide other useful feedback. We see this update as a significant milestone on the path to producing the most secure and stable mining pool in the business.  Stay tuned for the next update!

Joins Whalesburg as a lead Data Scientist  As the old saying goes, teamwork makes the dream work.  So with that said, Whalesburg is excited to announce a new addition to the team: Dana De Alasei.  A graduate of Harvard University, Dana is a data scientist with valuable experience in predictive modeling and game theory. Dana has a M.A. in Neurobiology and Behavior and is looking forward to receiving her MS in Data Science from Southern Methodist University, this Summer.    Dana is working with the Whalesburg team to develop a profit-switching algorithm based on the game theory mathematical model for our multi-currency mining pool. The main goal is to balance miners profitability inside the pool while achieving the best possible winning situation for the whole team in a ‚Äúbig game.‚Äù This game theoretic approach will allow multiple miners to optimize their payoff using Markov games and a derivative of the Nash equilibrium coupled with a deep learning model. This strategy will quickly select the best mining activity for profitability and is scalable as the mining pool grows.  With a wealth of expertise in investment research, Dana has plenty of hands-on experience constructing financial portfolios. Considering she has also worked on blockchain network development and cryptocurrency behavior, Dana is the perfect addition to our already solid team.  Her professional experience includes: Machine Learning, Game Theory, Bayesian Probabilistic Modeling and Regularization Methods, Probabilistic Models, Principal Component Analysis & Dimension Reduction, Blockchain Development, Portfolio Optimization, Volatility Forecasting, Historical Data Analysis, Volatility Modeling, Time Series Analysis, Stochastic Methods.  With such an impressive professional and academic background, we are more than excited to have Dana on board. As we continue on our mission to build the world‚Äôs first software bundle for crypto miners, we‚Äôre sure that Dana will help shape the way maximum profits are generated.  ‚ÄúI am excited to be working with great minds coupled with state of the art technology to make Whalesburg the premier cryptocurrency mining platform.‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäDana De Alasei  Welcome to the team, Dana!

While we crack on with the complete version of the product, our maintenance developers are happy to announce a new update to our MVP. After diving into v0.2.1 and hearing your thoughts, we‚Äôve addressed some minor glitches and added some promising new features.  The most exciting announcement of this release is the addition of 2 new coins. After monitoring WhatToMine for over week, we looked for coin options that had the greatest probability to be more profitable than ETH. We can‚Äôt wait to see how these 2 new coins perform!  Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what‚Äôs been added and amended to improve the MVP:  Added ETC Coin We‚Äôve added Ethereum Classic (ETC)! Born in July 2016, ETC is a continuation of the Ethereum blockchain, and is fully decentralized, immutable and unstoppable. The coin has reached new price heights in February, and continues to be one worth watching.  With much hype around the Callisto airdrop on March 5, the crypto world will be keeping a close eye on ETC.  Added UBQ Coin The Ubiq blockchain is a decentralized, peer-to-peer, open source coin built upon an improved Ethereum codebase. It is also a decentralized platform for making decentralized applications (√êApps).  Born in January 2017, Ubiq is a strong and competitive alternative to Ethereum.  With the addition of ETC and Ubiq, this new release gives miners a total of 5 coin options in the smart multicurrency mining pool. More options can only mean a greater probability of profit, so we‚Äôre eager to see how these 2 coins benefit miners.  Added Bittrex Integration For those familiar with our previous version, Cryptopia integration gave miners easier access to exchange coins to ETH. In this release, we are happy to announce that we have integrated Bittrex Exchange.  By adding Bittrex integration, Payout Manager will now automatically exchange ETC, Ubiq, and Expanse coins to ETH‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääother coins can be exchanged via Cryptopia.  While Cryptopia can take around 6‚Äì7 hours to process exchanges, Bittrex works much faster, and usually processes exchanges in less than an hour.  With the addition of an efficient and trustworthy exchange like Bittrex, we‚Äôre certain miners will have a better user experience.  Alpha Testing (Automated Tool) We‚Äôve got an exciting future release in the works‚Ä¶ but we want to keep it a secret for now!  We can reveal that we‚Äôve begun Alpha testing on this currently hidden new tool. Shortly, 10 Whalesburg miners will receive an invitation to participate in the Alpha test. The testers will adhere to a set of rules when using the module, and will report their feedback to us.  Comments and criticism from our community is invaluable, so we‚Äôre looking forward to seeing how we can improve this module prior to finalising it.  Fixed Bugs We‚Äôve kept our eyes and ears open for any glitches in the current MVP.  Here‚Äôs a rundown of the bugs we‚Äôve fixed: ¬∑ Race condition in Open Ethereum Pool when it tries to ban a miner ¬∑ Race condition in Smart Stratum Proxy when 50+ miners reconnect to it ¬∑ Miners Bounty: Fixed hashrate calculation when awarding WBT ¬∑ Added ‚Äìmode 1 to Claymore command to run it only in ETH mode ¬∑ Added MiningRigRentals instructions  ¬∑ Fixed a glitch where WBT balance was not updating despite a transaction being created  At Whalesburg, we‚Äôre big on improving functionality while also maintaining maximum security. Your feedback plays a crucial role in improving our product, so make sure you connect with us‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe‚Äôd love to hear from you.  Thanks for your support!

We are excited to announce the release of an update to our MVP. We‚Äôve made some significant improvements upon what was already a functional program. While the R&D team is busy with the full version of the product, our maintenance developers have released an update that improves stabilisation and provides bug fixes. We are additionally using this MVP to find out from our community what features are needed most.  With the being said, here‚Äôs a run-down of the improvements we‚Äôve made for this update:  Payouts  The payouts module has been completely redesigned! In working closely over the last few weeks with miners who have already adopted the first version of our product, we were able to dig much deeper into the payouts system. In this process we were able to identify 15 risks of failing payouts. We then developed and implemented strategies to mitigate these risks with auto-recovery mechanisms put in place, making the system significantly more secure and stable. The new module design follows a defensive programming approach. This means, for example, that it has distributed data backups in different subsystems of the pool. This forms the foundation of our recovery strategies.  We also made a great in-house Slack bot to notify our team if something goes wrong or very well. This will allow us to efficiently improve the product even more over the coming weeks and months.  Bonus: the new payouts module awards WBT automatically in conjunction with round 1 of our bounty campaign to deliver 600,000 WBT to users of our mining pool.  Shift to HTTPS  For this update we‚Äôve made the shift to running on HTTPS rather than HTTP in order to take advantage of the vastly increased security offered by the newer protocol.  DDoS firewall application  We‚Äôve implemented a distributed denial of service firewall so we are confident that our smart mining pool can defend against even a massive DdoS attack including an application level attack.  Cloud Mining Compatibility  Our community gave us excellent feedback and suggestions regarding cloud mining services to use with Whalesburg. We tested the most popular cloud mining solutions and we are excited to announce that you can safely use the service MiningRigRentals.com to mine ETH with Whalesburg and receive up to 70% bonus WBT during our bounty campaign. This is particularly useful for those who don‚Äôt have a mining rig and want to try out our product while taking advantage of our bounty campaign reward.  Staging environment  When we built the first version of our MVP, we were focused only on creating a functional product. Now that we have a little more time to work out the details, we‚Äôve added a decent staging environment using Docker containerization. Having this functional test server should make our software much more stable and increase the speed of the development  Frontend bugs fixed  We‚Äôve also had some time for fix up some frontend bugs so that the user experience is a little cleaner. Here‚Äôs a summary of the fixes:  ‚õè Better displaying data in tables ‚õè Fix row displaying ‚õè Add padding on footer for mobile ‚õè Add fees rounding ‚õè Change statistics page for using mobile scrollable feature ‚õè Apply to LowerCase for wallets in requests ‚õè Fix pagination of transactions ‚õè Upgrade dependencies ‚õè Fix polling data with slow networks ‚õè Rename workers -> miners on the main page. ‚õè Change mobile menu links ‚õè Remove scroll on ‚Äústart mining‚Äù page on mobile  At Whalesburg we are dedicated to bringing the best solutions for today‚Äôs miners so we are committed to working to improve the functionality and security of our platform. We look forward to more feedback from our community so that we can continue to improve our product.  Thanks for your support! Start mining with MVP 0.2.1 at https://pool.whalesburg.com  Stay tuned!

Whalesburg is happy to announce another great addition to our growing list of top-notch advisors: Nodari Kolmakhidze, Chief Investment Officer and The Head of Assets Management & Trading Division, at Cindicator.    As you may know, Cindicator is one of the most exciting projects in this space as it aims to merge artificial and human intelligence in order to improve trading strategy and asset management. Products like their Cryptometer bot‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich tracks limited-time market opportunities like arbitrage‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand the Cindicator bot‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich is the access point for a token based social-technological infrastructure that drives evolution of hybrid intelligence for financial markets‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähave already seen rapid adoption in the crypto-community and been met with widespread approval. Cindicator‚Äôs technology has the potential to have a huge impact on asset management not just in crypto-markets, but financial markets at large.  At Cindicator, Nodari has been involved in the development of these new products in addition to his role as head of the trading division and company assets management. With 8 years in finance and 5 years in trading and asset management, Nodari brings a wealth of knowledge that will be extremely useful for Whalesburg in the coming months.  While chaotic token sales are now commonplace, Cindicator set a new standard for organization and convenience of contribution with its widely praised token sale in September that raised the equivalent of $15M (now worth approx. $250M). Nodari‚Äôs knowledge of how to structure a token sale and how to fairly and conveniently bring the offering to the public will be instrumental for Whalesburg as we move towards our own token generation event in the coming months.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm super excited to be working with such a great team of professionals as they build what is sure to become the go-to solution for the next generation of cryptocurrency miners. Some of the technology being deployed by Whalesburg fits in perfectly with my vision, so I‚Äôm looking forward to advising Whalesburg‚Äôs development process.‚Äù  Welcome aboard Nodari!",False

A lot of questions have appeared lately asking what the difference is between Whalesburg and other well-known players in the space like NiceHash, ethOS, and Mining Pool Hub. The simple answer is that while other players each focus on a single aspect of miner‚Äôs needs, Whalesburg offers a one-stop solution for all of the complex needs today‚Äôs miners face. In the diagram below, each of the five leaves represents one component of what it takes for miner‚Äôs to be the most successful:    Whalesburg‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääat the center‚Ää‚Äî‚Äägives miners, for the first time, all five of these essential tools in one package that brings security, exceptional user experience, and out-of-the-box scalability for enterprise level miners. Let‚Äôs go through each of the five leaves and compare how Whalesburg stacks up to the competition:  1. Operating System Two popular providers in this space are nvOC and ethOS. Both of them force all users to be Linux experts‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälack of graphic interface without the functionality for large-scale operations. Whalesburg has a clear edge over the competition with a next generation OS that has the following advantages:  ‚õè Real-time integration with Whalesburg cloud. ‚õè Large-scale and remote monitoring, managing, and rebooting of your rigs. This is a must for a farm bigger than ten units. Whalesburg will let you babysit your hardware, even from the beach. ‚õè Detailed financial reports builder. We consider miners as investors; you invest in hardware, you calculate returns, you expect profits. Whalesburg OS will have a module for professional financial reporting, allowing you to include exactly the data you want. ‚õè Remotely edit the configuration. With comprehensive cloud functionality, Whalesburg lets you edit configuration without your physical presence. ‚õè Notifications. The very first step in troubleshooting is to know that the problem has occured. For miners this should be a must in every software solution, but sadly it‚Äôs not. Whalesburg is going to set a new standard by sending you notifications in case of failures or for predefined events.  2. Whalesburg Mining Pool The volatility of cryptocurrency markets and high costs of setup are the main reasons miners join pools. While today‚Äôs mining pools traditionally focus on a single coin, Whalesburg will constantly integrate multiple coins from multiple algorithms. Today it has three Proof-Of-Work cryptocurrencies based on EtHash algoritm‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäEllaism, Pirl, and Expanse. This has the effect of increasing stability of mining.  For example last month mining PIRL‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa relatively new coin‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwas up to 14% more profitable than mining Ethereum. Miners should follow the news to use such possibilities while Whalesburg lets you do it automatically.   The screenshot shows the process of comparing profitability of Ethereum against other coins. Pirl: 114 means that PIRL is 14% more profitable than ETH at that particular time.  In addition, Whalesburg Payouts Manager will offer the convenient option of automatically converting mined cryptocurrency to fiat currency or BTC. The current version of Whalesburg MVP converts all the mined coins into ETH.  3. Monitoring Tool By storing all the statistics about your hardware in the cloud in real-time, Whalesburg will enable a huge range of features including one-click large-scale overclocking, troubleshooting, push notifications, income reporting, and forecasting.  4. Profit-Switching Solution Whalesburg has a profit switching algorithm that automatically protects you from price drops. It analyzes every coin‚Äôs parameters to see the profitability reports tailored to your hardware setup. The decision is then made to instantly switch your hash rate, automatically!  Whalesburg‚Äôs Profit-Switching Solution Advantages Are:  ‚õè Transparent pool shares and fees, stored in a blockchain. ‚õè Financial reports using real-time data. ‚õè Better technology Whalesburg is coded using Go and Ruby languages. This grants more security and stability. ‚õè Smart profit-switching. Whalesburg OS and Whalesburg Smart Pool together will detect the most profitable algorithm and coin depending on your hardware. ‚õè Simple setup.  Whalesburg‚Äôs Profit Switching Solution is NOT a Crypto-Mining Marketplace  Beginner miners think of NiceHash as a mining pool with profit-switching algorithms. It is not. Regarding the profits, any other mining pool is much more profitable for miners to use than NiceNash. Since Whalesburg is a multicurrency mining pool with profit switching solution‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs miners will receive significantly more profits than with NiceHash. This is because buyers of hash rate have to make some profits when they buy your hash rate, so when you use NiceHash you receive less profit than you could be.  From Reddit:    Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/NiceHash/comments/6uefrh/how_is_buyingselling_on_nicehash_profitable/  Please, do your own research on this topic.  Whalesburg‚Äôs Overclocking Tools Advantages Are:  ‚õè Whalesburg is a database of configuration setups. It includes firmwares, driver versions for your setup, feedbacks of other miners, and recommendations. ‚õè Remote large-scale overclocking. ‚õè Linux GUI. There is no graphical interface for such operations by any player in the space thus far. ‚õè Remote one-click configuration. ‚õè Whalesburg will be a monitoring platform. All the other monitoring solutions cost additional money depending on your rig numbers. There are SaaS or Windows programs but they offer only a limited amount of supported devices.  Summary of Whalesburg‚Äôs Key Advantages:  ‚õè User-friendly graphical interface on Linux. ‚õè Uses Whalesburg cloud to store statistics. ‚õè Does not waste time switching between pools; uses one entry point all the time. ‚õè Enterprise-ready solution; has no limits to hardware numbers. ‚õè Forget about manual setup! Whalesburg detects hardware automatically.  Whalesburg is the next generation of cryptocurrency mining and we are happy to have you on board. If you have any questions‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääplease, ask them in our community chat: https://t.me/whalesburg. We will discuss them together and take suggestions for how to make our solution even better.  We hope this article provides an overview of what Whalesburg is. More detailed descriptions of each module will follow soon.

Miners‚Äô feedback led us to find and fix several bugs, improve our payouts module, and increase the stability of the pool. For example, we fixed a bug where our script was rounding values to 15 decimal places, which could lead to incorrect calculations.  Also, we have improvements for even faster payouts now.

We were dreaming it will come to reality as a successful company with satisfied clients.

A software that will make their lives easier (they just wanted to do nothing, LOL).   Now, we are thrilled to announce that our Pre-Alpha is ready and live!   ‚õèFunctionality We've launched a smart mining pool to mine three coins based on EtHash:  - Pirl - ELLA - EXP   To check if our concept works we have installed on our server three mining pools based on open source solution. Since they all use Stratum and built to mine Ethash coins you can use Autominer application to switch between them. Autominer helps to mine the most profitable coins by asking whattomine website statistics needed. You will be able to connect, mine and take payouts to your wallet. The reward method is RBPPS for now.   ‚õèGuidance To use it, you should have EthMiner installed, and you have set wallet addresses for these three coins. Put autominer and config.yml in the directory where EthMiner binary is located, then run autominer.  Launch it and check statistics online:  PIRL: https://pirl.pool.whalesburg.com/ EXP: https://exp.pool.whalesburg.com/ ELLA: https://ella.pool.whalesburg.com/   This is definitely not our endpoint - we are evolving every day!
