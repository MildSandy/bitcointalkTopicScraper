This will start for residents of the European Union and the United States after the ICO closes, and we will continue to gain licenses and create partnerships in order to offer our debit cards to residents of other people in the world. 3) The Vaultbank Exchange - a cryptocurrency trading exchange platform that will compete on fees, customer service, and wide usability with security token offerings as well as utility tokens.
