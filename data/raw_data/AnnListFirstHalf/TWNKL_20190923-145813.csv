Do your own due diligence and speak with your own experts before making any decisions, such as those relating to health, finances, taxes, and business, to name a few.  ---------------------------  As it has been discussed in recent and past Rainbow Currency webinars, SafeZone is in the process of integrating TWNKL payments for products and services within the SafeZone open network. Unicorn Network has committed to accepting TWNKL for payments for their entire network’s products and services.  The value that Unicorn Network brings to the table, as a global network with over 30 different projects, services, functions, and features, is huge. In addition, there is the value that Rainbow Currency brings to the table; backed by real value with SafeZone shares (once public), gold, the Unicorn Network and the SafeZone open network economies, founded and supported by the Power of “We”, designed with functionality and ease of use in mind for the masses, just to name a few. And, as we all know, the value seen in the public exchanges does not truly represent an honest value for TWNKL, since over 98% of all circulating coins are still being held by their owners. So with all of this in mind, Unicorn Network and SafeZone have made some decisions regarding how payments will be integrated into SafeZone for Rainbow Currency.  As the SafeZone is a project of Unicorn Network, Unicorn Network has decided to set a fixed rate for TWNKL payments made within the SafeZone open network through the service PernumPay, of 10 cents (US$0.10) per TWNKL to start. That means that any business selling products and services to be purchased with TWNKL through PernumPay (to be released soon), will also be accepting TWNKL at the same rate.  The rate has been calculated by taking the highest price seen thus far for TWNKL of just over 25 cents (US$0.25), (which still had not yet reached a true market valuation at the time this price was seen, as over 98% of Rainbow Currency holders were still holding their TWNKL at that time as well), compromising to arrive at the value of 10 cents (US$0.10) per TWNKL for payments made within SafeZone systems. The fixed price for TWNKL payments within the SafeZone systems and PernumPay will adjust as the market price increases over time.  This fixed starting price on accepting TWNKL for payments within the SafeZone, will allow for stable commerce to happen for participating businesses within the SafeZone open network. Additionally, the ability for businesses to use their TWNKL to purchase marketing products, packages, and services offered by SafeZone, such as those found on https://safezone.info, and Marketing Instruments to be purchased through Cashback Marketing (coming soon), businesses can utilize these TWNKL payments from customers paying for their products and services, as their marketing budgets each year. Those purchasing TWNKL for the first time on the exchanges, also now know their TWNKL will provide more buying power within the SafeZone open network for everyday purchases. This synergy encourages more businesses to accept TWNKL and more customers to make purchases with TWNKL within the SafeZone open network.  Understand that while, of course, it is in Unicorn Network and SafeZone’s best interests to encourage the use of Rainbow Currency within the SafeZone, the reality of how many payments will be made is really just a small fraction of total payments made to any business in their national currencies. This is simply due to the supply of Rainbow Currency compared to the supply of various national currencies around the world. Compared to USD for example, there are trillions and trillions of dollars in the world, however the total supply of Rainbow Currency is fixed at 100 billion coins; and only about 40 billion of those coins are the circulating supply at this time, of which about 98% are held in private wallets. So, while sales volumes may vary depending on the business and the offers that customers are buying with TWNKL, total average sales will predominantly be much lower than sales made with national currencies.  Businesses who wish to accept TWNKL through the standard blockchain processes outside the SafeZone open network, are free to do so; there is no obligation for any business to take part in the SafeZone open network in order to accept TWNKL for payments; nor is there any obligation for any business that is a SafeZone third-party participating business to accept TWNKL. This is a voluntary action for those who are interested, where not prohibited by law.  A public webinar will be scheduled soon to share many other exciting developments going on behind the scenes during this transition time.  Thank you all for your support, understanding, and pro-activity with the Power of “We”, WE appreciate all of you.

Following the recent shift of Twinkle assets, it would seem that some members are not clear about the responsibilities of the Board.  Therefore, let us give you some clarification, so that that you may better understand how the structure that comprises Unicorn, Safezone and Rainbow Currency Foundation works.  At the top is Dan who created many of the original concepts, engineered the construction of groups and brought the currency into being.  The group structure has many components, the most important being Unicorn Members, Member private wallets in Safezone and the currency.  Unicorn has its own CEO (Cate) and official officers who oversee the day to day activities. Within that group are sections that handle webpages, Safezone wallet activities, human resources, project initiation and many other activities. Their primary concern is activity on behalf of all members.  The Board of the Rainbow Currency Foundation was elected from members of Unicorn to specifically concentrate on finding avenues that would enhance and increase the value of the currency. They do not exist to handle every problem relating to individual member problems with Twinkle transactions. They do however keep a track of member comments relating to repetitive problems and seek out solutions where practical and possible.  The Board has been operative for exactly one month and has literally been working 7 days a week and due to differing time zones practically for 24 hours a day. RCF has 5 Billion Twinkles for its own budget. And is awaiting response from the company regarding the Twinkles not in circulation. The RCF intend not to interfere with volumes held by Unicorn Network for its operational requirements.   During that first month it has created its own rules & regulations known as a Constitution, elected within the Board by member vote its Executive Officers, held 3 Board meetings and meetings with Unicorn CEO and 2 with Dan. It has created 2 new Exchanges and is in dialog with several others.  Various members have created: a YouTube video explaining ForkDelta exchange operating systems; webinars in Spanish and German, an intro video for RCF webpage (not yet released), contacts with a legal attorney, the possibility of connection with Bitpay, a banking option in the USA and many more projects in the planning stage. The Board operates to an Agenda created by its own members.  We are constantly aware of our clear and simple Mission Statement: “To build the Twinkle into an internationally recognised form of exchange and monetary system that will become a household name and a leading component in the Cryptocurrency world.”  We have a major task ahead of us to achieve that ultimate objective and it cannot be achieved overnight. Please be assured that while you enjoy your rest, relaxation or work filled day, there will be at least one board member somewhere on this planet very busy pulling strings, slotting minor achievements into the larger plan, creating concepts, running a seminar in a foreign language or talking to someone about our currency.  In the end it is you the member and owner of Twinkles who will enjoy the greatest benefits of our labours and until such time, please have faith that we know what we have to do and give us the space and time to make things work.  Kind Regards RCF Board",False

Additionally the Board of Directors for the Rainbow Currency Foundation is voted on and selected by the Rainbow Currency owners (going through the first elections now), giving all currency owners a voice in the continued growth and development of the Rainbow Currency.  While Rainbow Currency is tied to the SafeZone open network as the official cryptocurrency, at the same time, it is it’s own project and has the flexibility to evolve and innovate to overcome whatever challenges may exist in the future. In fact the benefits of the Rainbow Currency are why the SafeZone has adopted the Rainbow Currency for it’s open network..  Additionally, as SafeZone is an open network, any business can join the open network, as well as individuals if they want to benefit from all the benefits SafeZone offers. Or all businesses and individual are free to accept/use/trade Rainbow Currency directly via the blockchain as with any other cryptocurrency. So as you can see the Rainbow Currency is more flexible for continued growth over the long-term.  Of course, Rainbow Currency will benefit from SafeZone’s success and vice versa just like any business or individual participating - the more WE all succeed, the more WE ALL SUCCEED TOGETHER.

So Safe.Zone is let's say the main webpage where you can connect to other webpages (platforms) from.  All platforms belong to Unicorn Network, you can check the video on unicorn.network. The SafeZone itself is from technical point of view - as the name itself prompts - the zone of safe all internet services provided to the clients (customers) - which includes all possible members - people as well as business partners.  The PerNum is not just related to the Rainbow Currency. PerNum was here a longer time before the Rainbow Currency came within its ICO in November 2017.  The PerNum has each member, each business partner - and it is simply the username for the whole Unicorn Network, for all the child webpages (platforms).  This PerNum is hiding each's personal data, like Name, Surname, e-mail address etc.  To login to each website is needed this PerNum, the password and then 3 random numbers from Master PIN, which is 6-numbers created by each member at the registration stage.  This Master PIN is also used every time when you are doing anything important - in regards with Rainbow Currency for example when you transfer coins from the internal wallet (visible on rainbowcurrency.com) to the public wallet (for example MEW). Probably you know - the TWINKLE is on Ethereum blockchain as the token. So it doesn't make sense to replace the recent PerNum by a Public Key - I believe you understand why from my explanation above.  And just to explain the different between the internal and the external wallet - as you very probably know (I would say everyone who deals with cryptocurrencies ingeneral) if you have wallet on MEW or on any other wallet, it is mainly your responsibility to safe your coins inside, noone will do it for you (I am speaking about the option when you use a ""pure"" wallet with a Private Key and Public Key, not a service which masks keys for you).  The internal wallet is - vice versa - respectively the coins inside are covered by the company and you are not only the person who cares about them.  Next important point - TWINKLEs are not intended only to be listed on crypto exchanges, but mainly to become everyday money for buying all the possible services, goods of the registered partners (business owners registered on the SafeZone).  Nowadays who are willing to buy TWINKLEs, can do so on two crypto exchanges - CryptoCoinStreet.com and SouthXchange.com, certainly these exchanges will not be the only ones, next will come too.  Or every new member of SafeZone will receive free coins too.  You could be also interested in where to find out more official information - so all registered people can join regular webinars scheduled sometimes once per week or once per couple of weeks/months (based on a given needs). There is also certainly a live support available on Skype, and thanks to the fact that members as well as support people are from more countries/continents you will reach someone any time during the daytime And I also must notice - what is the best source of the information directly from our CEO  (for all the people which are not registered yet) - it is the live stream on americamatters.us scheduled for 1 hour twice per week on Tuesdays and Thursdays. There are also podcasts available under the key word ""SafeZone"" (certainly ;-) ).  If you will have any additional questions, you can ask me too, what I will know, I will certainly reply.",False

Read second part of your answer, sorry.

I would like just to tell again about one detail which could explain further how you can manage your TWINKLE coins.  As I wrote there is the internal wallet as well as external wallet.  To access your internal wallet you need to know your PERNUM, your PASSWORD and your MASTER PIN (where you will be asked for 3 random numbers from). You will be also asked for your MASTER PIN for whatever transaction you will make.  And now what I feel it is important to say - it is everyone's decision where will store his/her TWINKLE coins - if it will be in the internal wallet (covered and secured by the company) or if it will be in the external wallet (any based on Ethereum blockchain). So if anyone will be scared to store coins on one place, he/she can simply transfer them to the other wallet. Transfers are possible certainly both ways.",False

Remember folks that YOU SET THE PRICE and you don’t have to undercut everyone by huge chunks simply to undercut everyone. As was seen previously, people will buy at much higher prices (and even higher than we have seen so far; all you have to do is ask for it and stick to your decision; people buying want to see the price rising). Also understand the people selling right now are just a small fraction compared with the bulk of circulating supply still being held by currency owners (about less than 50 MILLION being sold compared to 40 BILLION circulating), as well as some people had time invested, for example buying a marketing unit at US$30, putting it into the SMPs, and ending up with commissions, then converting commissions to Twinkles; so for them, (even though we all paid the same rates) they may think their initial costs were much less.  UNDERSTAND THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING - Don’t sell yourself SHORT! Most people LOSE on cryptocurrency by simply selling at the wrong time where they lose money, or getting scared by what the news says each day, and many other various factors, instead of holding and having patience. Also understand and do not feel bad about those few who are selling, everyone has their own strategies and that is cool. Remember with every situation that might seem negative, there is always a positive opportunity. The opportunity right now is to buy, so share Twinkles, Rainbow Currency, and SafeZone with your friends, family and neighbors; they can find many fantastic deals right now.

It is important to understand that Rainbow Currency is independent and non-profit. SafeZone selected Rainbow Currency as their main currency because of the many benefits Rainbow Currency provides and it can be accepted/used/traded by any other company as well.   Challenge #1 - While blockchain is secure and transparent, the public wallet system allows everyone to see every transaction done and gives no real privacy to the wallet holder if the identity is discovered, which when you share your details with the merchant you buy with, you don’t always know what they really do with your data.   Solutions: With the Rainbow Currency 2-Wallet System this solves this challenge and protects the privacy of the user and merchant at the same time. The 2-wallet system consists of both a public wallet (for traditional usage within current ETH blockchain systems) and the private PERNUM Wallet, which is connected to the PERNUM System to protect the privacy of the user, while still satisfying international Anti-money laundering, Anti-terrorism, and Know Your Customer laws without unnecessarily divulging unneeded info to 3rd Parties. The currency held within the private PERNUM Wallet is still within the blockchain, it stays on an external wallet protected by the SafeZone Military-grade security standards.   About the PERNUM System and how it protects privacy: This system is designed to give the user control over who has access to them and their data within the SafeZone open network. PERNUM stands for PERsonal NUMber, where your PerNum takes the place of your phone number, your email address, your physical address, and more. Within the PERNUM system, when you want to allow someone to contact you, you must actually allow them within PERNUM, if you don’t they are not able to connect with you. In the same fashion if you want to stop connecting with someone, simply un-allow them within PERNUM. Also the advantage is when you want or need to change any of your personal data (like your address, email, phone number, etc.) simply update it in PERNUM, no need to continuously spread your new data around; your contacts can still contact you simply knowing your PerNum because it doesn’t change… just the data or permissions it is connected to is updated.   Challenge #2 - Payments sent through the blockchain directly often take a long time (especially during peak times), can be expensive (sometimes 50%+ fees to transfer), can be unreliable (I.e. running out of gas, lost unprocessed transactions, etc.), and you are constantly exposing your private spending habits when sharing your public wallet address.   Solutions: When spending twinkles within SafeZone through the private PERNUM Wallet, transfers happen instantly, with no fees, and depending on transaction type, simply PerNum to PerNum is sufficient for data-sharing between merchant and customer. Therefore payments happen quickly, easy, and privately yet still comply with international laws, as every customer and merchant must verify their ID prior to making payments, yet this info is kept private within SafeZone and only shared when needed to complete a transaction or required by law.   Another advantage of SafeZone applies to the next challenge…  Challenge #3 - Companies worldwide are collecting, sharing, creating secret profiles about you, and selling your data in the guise of providing you more targeted advertising.   Solutions: The SafeZone open network and Unicorn Network (the company behind SafeZone) DO NOT PARTICIPATE OR IN ANY OTHER WAY DO ANY BEHAVIORAL OR OTHER INTRUSIVE SECRET PROFILES FORADVERTISING. The SafeZone and Unicorn Network give the power BACK TO THE CONSUMER by 1) not collecting unnecessary data in the first place and 2) providing consumers a method to choose the topics they are interested in for promotions. Thus customers see what they actually WANT TO SEE and can adjust their desires as they see fit easily and securely. Advertisers benefit because they are truly getting targeted traffic that WANTS TO SEE their products and services, thereby increasing customers and sales without the need of intrusive and privacy-violating methods currently available.   Since it’s inception the Unicorn Network and by extension SafeZone and Rainbow Currency have been created with the Power of WE in mind, meaning everyday people from all over the world, coming together to create what WE want to see. WE are innovators, risk-takers, pioneers, and those who simply want better, TOGETHER AS THE POWER OF WE, WE MAKE IT HAPPEN. Instead of spending millions on advertising for SafeZone, Unicorn Network, and Rainbow Currency, WE CARE AND WE SHARE by using a grassroots, word-of-mouth, invitation marketing method to spread the word and SHARE OUR SUCCESS with those who helped create it, directly through commissions, bonuses, free services, prizes, and more as our way of showing appreciation for the members who help make it all possible for everyone.Members invite others for free to join and based on the activity of those members joining they can see benefits up to 5-generations deep for the lifetime of their account. There is something for just about everyone.   The Unicorn Network follows 8 core values of more: respect, privacy, security, quality, benefits, influence, family, charity. WE consider and treat members as our global Family, no matter where they are from, what race, religion, creed, beliefs, etc. WE ARE A FAMILY TOGETHER.     There are many more benefits to SafeZone, Unicorn Network, and the Rainbow Currency together including a free affiliate program, free prize draws, free lottery entries, e-commerce with discounts up to 99%, socializing platforms, private searching, many other free services, an international talent contest (going into the 4th season)- as well as an unlimited number of 3rd party sites that are open to join and have already started. WE invite you to learn more by watching the videos on the following Unicorn Network sites, which are in the process of integrating into the SafeZone right now.
