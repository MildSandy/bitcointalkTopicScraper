Crypto Laboratory London’s team consist of individuals with a wide variety of backgrounds in IT, programming and development, finance, HR, marketing and politics. We are all cryptocurrency enthusiasts, investors, traders and miners that are fulltime and in the community. We are London based and have a network with presence around the city however we do have presence globally. We’re investors just like you but we also believe that Blockchain has the potential to transform societies and reorganise industry and sectors. A great opportunity is presented to us where we can be a part of a revolutionary space and investing at the same time. Giving us access to a closed community. Without decentralization we would not be here. We can financially and socially support great projects we believe will have lasting impacts.   Why did we form? We saw the astounding lack of attention to details and well-rounded organisation around Crypto trading and ICO investing from other ICO pools and syndicates. In cases, some groups had easy access to ICO teams and allocations because of their networks, however the quality of the ICO’s themselves were not consistent. Analysis and community support were often poor. Other groups had good analysis and attention to details but lacked the access to pre-sale allocation for early investors. There was a space for an organisation that took the best practices and amalgamated them into one project.    What do we do different? Our solution is that we have a great team that works to offer the best solution in each field when assessing an ICO.  We carry out a scrutiny process and due diligence on ICO’s before we personally invest. We also carry out our own tokenomics and analysis on the concept, team, advisors, prototypes and other important factors when initiating investment. We have a wide network across the crypto community and regularly attend conferences and meetings. Upcoming ICO projects approach Crypto Laboratory London because of the valued community that we have behind us, which VC firms and angel investors lack. Where possible we always like to have a close relationship to the projects we take interest in and represent the communities’ interests in ICO projects.  This means that when our community invests in a project; quick clarification and issues that arrive can be dealt with promptly.   How you can be involved We are opening participation up. This means you can join our community, benefit from the education, networking and personal analysis that we and others provide within our space, for free. There is no joining cost. We simply ask that keep an open mind to learning and contributing to discussions. From this, you will be given access to participate in syndicates which our Team secure through hard work and due diligence that we carry out.     •   We create due diligence reports on ICO's for our partners, carry out technical analysis tailored for our clients and are advising a number of ICO's privately. We also raise funds and acquire allocations and we are looking to build a network of groups who would be willing to share research/allocations and opportunities with each other. Due to current market conditions most groups are struggling to raise capital because investors are not liquid. •     Sample of our publications for our global partners: https://drive.google.com/open?id=10drfnnGFRisiudDM9IlVx48zST2uAEAK Cryptolaboratory featured on Neurochain.TV Youtube - https://youtu.be/grQKDGtykuM?t=38 https://medium.com/@cryptolaboratory/github-review-neurochain-ncc-6c4da3a4486a https://medium.com/@cryptolaboratory/hycon-github-review-698a903c553e https://medium.com/@cryptolaboratory/how-to-manage-risk-in-cryptocurrency-trading-by-arnie-j-cryptolaboratory-io-6809b13a34ac https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASrArkFieYE&t https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9O87DcMuAkI",False

Some of this might be because of the low quality of posts, and maybe the new merit system will help to curtail them.  Hopefully many will come back because I've always considered this forum to be the source for everything crypto related, for many years before my account registration date.  I just wasn't involved in crypto full-time until recently so was mostly a lurker.  I get how difficult it can be to market a project.  Everyone I've been able to converse about my organization with wants to get involved, but unfortunately it's hard to spread the message about the organization.  I'm trying multiple ways to do so, but the last thing I'd do is to cut off a place such as here with all of the accumulated knowledge as well as the most experienced people in the field.  I will be glad after we have passed the funding period, however, because I'd really like to devote more of my time to actually implementing instead of just marketing.  I guess some of this comes from my pre-crypto experience in the government contracting field, where marketing is completely different than marketing an ICO/ITO organization.  In any event, professional marketing expertise in this field should be worth top dollar and I know that's one of the first hires that BTRIC will be making for our projects that complete the incubator and are launched as separate businesses.  Same as with blockchain developers, ICO/ITO marketers that know their stuff and do a great job are real assets to any team and not easy to find.  Best regards, Ben",False

A share of equity is and remains the most obvious way of returning value to investors. The value of company equity is based on actual business performance, the value of developed technology, the strength of the team — and not on whims of a chaotic crypto marketplace. A week ago most blockchain project tokens lost over 50% of their token market cap in the past few days while remaining equally valuable as a company.  Innovative blockchain startups defined their tokens as equity back in 2016. However, the tightening regulation based around securities law forced all crowdfunded blockchain startups into developing methods of combining value return with actual token utility. This can work for blockchain startups building platforms and protocols, but is by no means universal. Most of the tokens described in the whitepapers of 2017 were “Franken-tokens” — an artificial combo of value return with pure utility that mostly failed in achieving either.  It is obvious we need a new asset class: securites tokens that enable separating equity investing from utility tokens. This equity must be available to all, not subject to draconian securities regulation that seems to exist to make the rich get richer while preventing the participation of everyone else. Some countries already accept this reality — the proposed Russian legislation that would allow anyone to participate up to a certain amount seems a solid step towards the goal of the democratization of investing.  As the securities element is separated from the utility, utility tokens can be designed specifically for the utility a blockchain startup needs — to facilitate payments, incentivize behaviour, help attract new users, make users committed to adding long term value to a product and other kinds of business magic. The fact that pure utility tokens do not include an explicit value return mechanism does not make them valueless. On the contrary, worth can now be more clearly and more easily correlated to a blockchain startup’s success in growing their network of customers and users.  In addition, if a blockchain startup receives equity investment, the pure utility tokens could be airdropped to project supporters for free. The resulting tokens would be compliant with all legacy securities regulation worldwide. Additional benefits could include much simpler listing on exchanges and access to supporters worldwide, as the pure utility tokens should be unaffected by any existing ICO bans.  As we go into 2018, the token economy space will continue to evolve quickly, as it has in the past. We believe that the equity/utility split is a good next step for many blockchain startups as we wait for the new asset class to develop. We’ve been working for months with our legal team and advisors to develop the idea and define the optimal legal token crowdsale framework that will give maximum value to blockchain startups, their supporters, and the Cofound.it CFI holder community while ensuring legal compliance worldwide. We’re finally close to finishing it and hope to announce the full details by the end of the month.  Your feedback is always welcome! Join our Telegram group and tell us what you think.

I have it in my personall wallet and never take any benefits. Stop lieing. Any airdrops ICO's started on CFI platfrom ? Any eth from profits maybe ? Nothing !!! So why you all shocked that price falling and falling from 10 k satoshi to 1000 s. I bought CFI on start after ICO and I pay 9000-10 000s half year ago. Now I have 10% satoshi. I dont care about $ price because its BTC win not CFI. And I cant sell it for usd/euro because I invest in altcoins and no need this $ payback and pay taxes I need reinvest it many times few years before withrawal $. So I bought for 10 000s and now price is under 1000s so I am lost 90% value on CFI. So if I want change CFI for other coin I have 10% satoshi to make thats deal so its madness and no sense. Other coins not droped in satoshi so hard even when BTC ATH. I want back price 10 000s and I sell and tell bye bye. Nobody want used CFI to buy ICO's by Priority Pass because to many ICOs and after enter on exchanges price droping so better is buy after ICO not in ICO. Last 6 seed presale 3 succes but 3 not collected enought eth and it was very small number eth. So CFI is almost nothing worth. Like Iconomi. the same sheme working platform not connected with profits and token almost useless. Almost because CFI have Priority Pass but not popular used. Nobody want buy each ico from CFI. Additionally I no have BTC to buy any ICO by Priority Pass so I no have any benefits from my 150 k CFI. So where this benefits ?

Only Priority Pass members are able to participate in Seed crowdsales and because these teams are at an earlier stage of development, all Seed supporters will receive a 100% bonus on their contributed funds (in ETH). And by crowdfunding a smaller round from the most engaged supporters, Cofound.it Seed teams will be able to quickly validate their business idea, raise enough funds to complete the team, and continue work on their product in preparation for a later, full crowdsale. Crowdsales for the first teams to go through the Seed program will be held on November 30 at the amazing Cofound.it Playoffs. We are making blockchain history — no one has ever done anything like this before and only Priority Pass members will be able to reap the full benefit and extra bonuses by participating in this event.  Cofound.it Seed bonuses for supporters The tokens the Seed supporters receive are non-transferrable and non-tradable vouchers for each projects’ full crowdsale — each project will issue its own Seed voucher token. The wallets with Seed tokens will then receive the corresponding project tokens during the full crowdsale. As a Seed supporter you will receive a 100% bonus on ETH sent: for each 1 ETH of Seed tokens you will be issued 2 ETH worth of tokens during the full crowdsale. And the teams must hold a full crowdsale using utility tokens by July 2018 (but most are expected to hold it in a few months). The Cofound.it Seed projects are typically raising between $100,000 and $300,000. The crowdsales will be structured as usual: Phase 1 with limited contributions and Phase 2 with unlimited contributions. There will be no public phase. Cofound.it Seed eligibility for Priority Pass members In the future, access to Seed crowdsales will be limited based on loyalty, taking both the CFI holding and previous crowdsale support into account. To celebrate our first Seed crowdsales, we have decided to open access to the first round of Seed crowdsales during the Cofound.it Playoffs to all Priority Pass members. If you hold more than 5,000 CFI tokens in your wallet in the days before the event, you will be able to fully participate in the Cofound.it Playoffs.

Its nice bonus but some useless. I preffer have airdrop each token which launch on Cofound.it. I mean when Cofound.it take 10% tokens (or X%) from launched ICO token holders CFI need take half so 5% tokens. And everybody will have many different ICO tokens and best give good profit better than price rise CFI token. Already CFI cost less and less I bought my around 10 000s and now is 1300s ... We need some profit from this started ICO's or never price go up. The same situation like Iconomi token - almost useless even buy-back and burning tokens but no have destination its uselles but platform (product) working great but no need ICN tokens to use platform.,False

Supporting our teams during their Seed stage crowdsale should be a clear sign to all of our community members; we fully believe in the validity of these startups. If we don’t support our teams, we can’t expect others to do the same. We will be contributing 50 ETH after the first hour of Phase 1 of the crowdsale to allow our community members to contribute first. At Cofound.it, we believe in the projects selected to participate in the Cofound.it Playoffs. They went through our rigorous selection process and were chosen to be part of our Seed program. Having already spent hours working on their businesses with our coaches, these teams are worthy of the support which comes through being members of our Seed program. Our innovative Cofound.it Seed program is tailored to early stage blockchain startups. Only Priority Pass™ members can participate in the Seed stage, and because these teams are at an earlier stage of development, all Seed supporters will receive a 100-percent bonus on their contributed funds (in ETH) at the time of the Main stage crowdsale. By crowdfunding a smaller round from the most engaged supporters, Cofound.it Seed teams can quickly validate their business idea, raise enough funds to complete the team, and continue work on their product in preparation for a later, Main stage crowdsale. Besides reinventing the crowdsale concept, which brings back the democratic potential of the crowdsale, the Seed program makes the team stronger in its early phase and raises the probability of delivering a product or executing an idea.  If you haven’t already, now is the time to make sure the wallet you linked with your Cofound.it account contains 5,000 or more CFI tokens so you are able to fully participate in the upcoming Cofound.it Playoffs! Wallets will be checked and whitelists created 24 hours before the start of Phase 1.  https://blog.cofound.it/50-eth-support-from-cofound-it-for-each-playoffs-team-95f02107654d    Should you Buy Cofound.it?

That will burst, of course. But we believe in the underlying value of the token crowdsale model.  https://blog.cofound.it/is-there-room-for-vcs-in-a-tokenised-world-712bf111a9b1   Is there room for VCs in a tokenised world? How blockchain is disrupting the startup ecosystem   “There are only two ways to make money in business: One is to bundle; the other is to unbundle.” — Jim Barksdale  The VC industry is one of the few that were not disrupted by the Internet. The opposite is true — levelling the startup playing field gave the VCs access to startups worldwide, increasing the competition among the startups and consolidating the VC position.  What the Internet couldn’t accomplish, the blockchain might. By enabling a direct connection between the startups and small investors who also serve as evangelists and early adopters, the distributed economy has in effect unbundled the VC industry — and the consequences might be revolutionary.  VC 1.0  The current startup ecosystem is composed of companies with ideas and VCs that select and fund those ideas. Both work together to create a product or service that can be sold. After a number of years, if the sales go well, the company is sold to the public in an IPO which allows the teams and VCs to make money. The key elements of the current system are:  selection that determines which companies receive funding coaching and leveraging the VC personal network to increase their chance of success funds that allow the company to function until it is profitable a liquidity event which allows the investors to recoup their investment, restarts the cycle and enables the public to buy shares in the company  In this system the key role of VCs is to act as arbiters and a bank (or a gatekeeper to the bank). It is a system that promotes centralisation — good VCs grow bigger and small ones find it ever harder to compete. The only way they can compete is by focusing on small investments — seed or pre-seed. That is the reason why it’s easier for startups to get seed funding or get accepted to an accelerator, and why it’s so hard to follow it up with a Series A.  Why crowdfunding startups doesn’t work  With the rise of Kickstarter, it seemed obvious that crowdfunding could be applied to VC investments as well. There are several platforms like Crowdfunder.com that allow a dispersion of investments, making it more approachable to smaller investors. Traditional startup crowdfunding can solve the “funds” part of the equation — but it does not solve the requirement to wait for the investment liquidity. This means that it can never really go mainstream and remains confined to larger investors who can afford to wait. Additionally, while crowdfunding can help a company raise funds, it cannot provide either the coaching expertise or a business network — both crucial elements in a company’s success.  The tokenised company  The hallmark of a true game-changing technology is that nobody can predict the effects it will have on both business and society. The introduction of blockchain and Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, in 2009 seemed like a nice new esoteric “internet currency” which could enable anonymise payments, often for shady services. However, additional benefits of blockchain technology soon became apparent. Some of the first commercial applications built upon the extremely low transaction costs to create alternatives to traditional money transfers. Later, the benefits of a network without a central arbiter of trust have been investigated — a potential game changer for industries like banking and insurance that depend on this role.  But the true revolution came recently, when companies realised that they could in effect “tokenise” their service or even the company itself and sell it to supporters before actually building the service, bypassing the need for VC funding. The supporters also serve as early adopters and evangelists, partially filling the “VC networking” role. And the nature of the tokens provided the answer to the key missing piece of the puzzle: waiting for liquidity. In a tokenised company model, the “shares” of the company are liquid from the get-go and can be traded immediately.  VCs in a tokenised world  What functions do the VC serve in a tokenised world? selection: still required liquidity event: immediate coaching and networking: still required funds: provided by the supporters  The VC of the future is focused on selection and coaching while leveraging the power of crowdfunding. Early adopters become early evangelists, filling the need for networking. The interactive engagement between projects and supporters in effect makes all of them cofounders.  But the true future lies in a distributed global platform that directly connects innovative projects with supporters while enabling experts worldwide to provide necessary support to teams. And by paying those experts in the very tokens the companies issue, the incentives for all the participants are truly aligned.",False

Yes - and no. I'll go into a bit more detail about our thinking on this - tell me what you think.  One of the functions of the token for the tokenised companies is the function of equity - regardless of how the token is actually defined. Although CFI is defined as a utility token,  for us it also represents equity. We will never sell off parts of the underlying company. The actual legal entity is like a janitor, nothing more - tokens are key.  Given that role we feel that most of the projects sell off too much tokens at the beginning of their journey. There is a reason startups do not sell 85% of their equity in the seed round. It's not about how much money they would receive for it. It's about retaining flexibility for the future. For regular startups that might include selling later, but more importantly it could serve the role of cementing the relationship with key partners. You simply cannot predict everything at the very start - it's wise to keep some sort of reserve for future flexibility.  When a company grows large enough it has to take its place in the value chain with the established players. They have two options - accept the new company or try and squish it out of existence. A share in the equity is typically used to make sure the other companies accept it - then, its success becomes their success.  Something similar holds true for tokenised companies - except that at the moment we're all so small and swimming in such a small pool that the big guys don't care about it. But what happens with Cofound.it in 2,3 years when we really grow? Our plan is to have a stash of tokens we can use to partner with the key players from the old and new economy. This reserve will be on a public address and constantly auditable by all so you can make sure we're not selling it or anything - we will communicate our plans for this transparently (but, again, not for at least 2 years).  And that is the main reason for the 25% of reserved tokens. We do not intend to use them to raise more money, but to ensure our place in the ecosystem.  20% go to purchase Cashila assets and know-how. Cofound.it is built upon the know-how and code developed by Cashila for the ICONOMI ICO and the core of the idea was developed by them, not me or Daniel. Plus, we want to make supporting Cofound.it crowdsales for people new to crypto economy as simple as possible - ideally one-click! For that we need the fiat-crypto gateway and Cashila already has one.  10% go to ICONOMI that supported Cofound.it (and still supports it) both financially and by providing guidance and access to their network.  5% are reserved for advisory team. You've seen our advisory bench and I think you have to agree that experts like those are worth it.  And 15% are reserved for the team, vested over 24 months with a 6 month cliff.  I think that Gnosis has showed that the actual % does not really impact token price. What matters is what happens to the rest - does it hit the market, causing the price to plummet, or not. Team is vested, ICONOMI considers this a long-term investment, and Cashila founders and VCs are experienced investors who realise what happens when you dump tokens so I have no fear of that.  We did not come to this decision lightly. It would be easiest for us to go the usual way and we would definitely have an easier task at communicating our crowdsale. But we are building Cofound.it for the decades ahead and have thought hard about what challenges might await us. Our token distribution strategy reflects that.  Welp, this got a bit too long - sorry  Jan",False

Adel is trying to solve a similar problem than we are, but we are approaching it from the other end. We believe that the key challenge right now is a business one, not a technical one. So we have started to solve the business problems in trying to establish a VC ecosystem: how to evaluate projects, how to find what value to add, how to find the optimal experts, how to coordinate the coaching, how to calculate added value, how to do marketing & PR and how to do a crowdsale. Once we find the best way to solve them we'll work on translating the processes into code.  That's also why we are already able to work with the projects already (our pipeline is full till October at this point), which will mean that we are cash-flow positive from the start. The main goal of our crowdsale are to: test the process - we are basically the guinnea pig testing it - we will find problems so the process for the projects will be smoother raise awareness - we are getting several project signups per day test cool new ideas like Cofound.it Priority Pass that allows engaged supporters access to the crowdsale before the general public and finally raise funds so we can expand quicker  Jan",False

From the point of view of the experts, Cofound.it is a platform where they can use their expertise to get dream jobs. There are 12M freelancers on Upwork. We are aiming for 1M experts.  From the POV of startups, Cofound.it is a one-stop-shop not only to help with the process but to reach out to the existing supporter community. We're already getting multiple applications per day. We expect hundreds of thousands of startups to use this service in the future.  And finally for the supporters, not only do we provide verified projects but also actively work on rewarding them for their engagement, like Cofound.it Priority Pass that allows engaged supporters early access to the crowdsale. In time, this group will become larger and larger.  So this is what you are getting by supporting the Cofound.it crowdsale. An exclusive ticket to the platform that literally wants to make current VCs obsolete. A distributed VC ecosystem for the distributed age. With all the platform features designed to encourage using and holding the tokens. More about token role and value return here: https://blog.cofound.it/cofound-it-token-role-and-value-returns-514a8aeface1, but tl;dr - as the Cofound.it platform will be designed to encourage token use and holding, this will fuel the rise of token value in proportion to platform use. Short-term, Cofound.it team will be purchasing tokens on open market to fuel platform features like rewarding project evaluators  Will we make it? I don't know. But we have a top-notch team, some of the best advisors in the world and support from some of the best and most engaged supporters ever, and will work our hearts out to succeed. We already have a pipeline of projects that will last us through October with some really amazing names. We're forecasting a total deal flow of 50+M for the second half of the year, which immediately makes Cofound.it one of the largest VCs in the world. And we're building our service to use all the best features blockchain tech can give us, and partner with some amazing companies both in the blockchain space and in the old economy. I kinda like our odds  Now, is this worth investing - that is of course a question for you. I can tell you that more than 1200 supporters already think so and have applied for the Cofound.it Priority Pass, which allows them to send the funds a few days before the rest - a crowdsale mechanic we're testing out to try and reward engaged supporters.

It seems really straightforward and obvious at first glance. However, I spent weeks in Excel trying to make it work, and failed. If the amount of project tokens was large enough to be noticeable for CFI token holders, there was not enough funds left for operations.  There was also a more subtle problem: directly returning a share of the profits (in the form of tokens or other) mis-aligns the incentives of the Cofound.it token holders and the platform itself.  The token holders wish to keep costs down to increase returned value, which is counter-productive to rapid platform development.

Okay this is right. ""Using the profits to speed up platform development, geographical and market penetration has the potential to bring multiples of value spent.""  But I don't get it why the holders would want keep costs down? If I had CFI I'd just hold it and then maybe use other projects tokens that I got from you and maybe keep them or use for another thing. The another thing could be buy more CFI. This is also buy pressure, right?  I just want to understand ",False

I'll do a short answer - my co-founder Daniel goes into more detail here: https://medium.com/cofoundit/coaching-blockchain-superstars-8ba4b1dfc9d4  First: we really do not have lots of successful ICOs if we look at the number of hopeful teams - but we tend to lose sight of all those projects that languish in the ""12 BTC raised in 3 weeks"" zone. If we plot the ICOs on two axis, technical ability and business ability, there are some that score great on both - the superstars. But there are not many of those.    We've spoken with over 30 projects in the past few months. Most of the teams we have engaged with fall somewhere in the middle part of the quadrant  —  typically (but not always) with a very solid technology background but lacking the more business-oriented pieces of the puzzle.  Cofound.it’s value proposition is simple — we bring the missing pieces of the puzzle and create dream teams! In essence, this is the “smart” part of the money a traditional VC investment brings but on steroids since we can leverage a much larger and global network of experts and services tailored to each project.  For teams that work with us, we: evaluate the team, find the best way we could add value and assign world-class experts to work with them assign a head coach to coordinate with the team and the experts cover the promotional costs up-front (20-50k$) help with communication strategy, copywriting.. help with optimal ICO parameters (so, ""no 50M cap"", ""no 150% bonus on this specific alt coin""  And - we are free! We take none of the funds received and only a share of the tokens.  Of course all of this is easy to type and harder to do.
