Often, the legal teams for an organization advise teams not to make promises about the future price of a token, or try to influence it. So while some might assume that the developers not influencing the price is due to arrogance or a similar unappealing trait, it's often due to a desire to comply with regulation.

Yet, unlike cryptocurrencies‚Äô utility tokens, the value of which is directly linked to the growth or decline in the use of the token, a stablecoin value is pegged to a stable real-world asset, from commodities to currencies. Another significant difference between cryptocurrencies and stable coins is that any stablecoin value has to be backed by assets held in reserve by the stablecoin issuer. This means that stablecoins are centralized by definition, as there has to be a central authority in charge of holding the backing assets, supervising the assets management and providing the documentation for audits."" https://ban.cr/stable  More on why Bancor's Head of Marketing, Anna Stone, is optimistic about using stablecoins to fight poverty: https://ban.cr/stable",False

This is one of my favorite interviews as well, as Galia has a true flair for breaking down concepts in a way that is easy to understand. This Q&A in particular is great:   Quote Can you elaborate on what you mean by ‚Äúthe trust is actually in the trustlessness?‚Äù  Meaning, we trust the system because we‚Äôve programmed it and designed it in a way that means we need not trust every user of the system in order to trust the system. And what does that mean? You don‚Äôt need to know every user of a dollar in order to trust that the dollar will buy a dollar‚Äôs worth of goods at the store, and the same with cryptocurrencies. You‚Äôre not going to know every person that uses BitCoin or Ether or Bancor or any other currency that you‚Äôre using. You can trust the system itself to behave in the way that it‚Äôs claimed to behave.",False

There was no insider trading. Tech savvy users may have noticed the breach before news was released. You can see the full remarks from the team below:  Quote Earlier today, at approximately 00:00 UTC, Bancor experienced a security breach. We take this incident very seriously. We are committing every resource to resolving it, getting the network back online and tracking down the criminals involved.  The details of the breach are still being investigated, but we wanted to update the community with the facts that we have so far.  A wallet used to upgrade some smart contracts was compromised. This compromised wallet was then used to withdraw ETH from the BNT smart contract in the amount of 24,984 ETH (~$12.5M). The same wallet also stole: 229,356,645 NPXS (~$1M) 3,200,000 BNT (~$10M)  Once the theft was identified, we were able to freeze the stolen BNT, limiting the damage to the Bancor ecosystem from the theft. The ability to freeze tokens was built into the Bancor Protocol to be used in an extreme situation to recover from a security breach, allowing Bancor to effectively stop the thief from running away with the stolen tokens.  It is not possible to freeze the ETH or any other stolen tokens. However, we are now working together with dozens of cryptocurrency exchanges to trace the stolen funds and make it more difficult for the thief to liquidate them.  We will continue to post updates as and when appropriate on our Telegram channel and on Twitter. We appreciate your patience as we resolve this matter.  If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to the team on the Official Telegram Group!",False

Without additional features such as convertibility, ETH reserves aren't necessary, meaning Bancor would hold no funds that could be stolen.  The safest way to store one's funds is to memorize a 42 digit private key and never access these funds.  Most of us know the safest way to do something, and then take another route for the sake of convenience. Bancor is connecting as many low volume tokens as possible; a great convenience that makes illiquid currencies liquid.  While BNT's ETH reserves are a target, they're also a tool that make low volume tokens available, convertible, and valuable. They increase wealth to those who have created the product or service for which these tokens pay, and those who pay benefit from the products and services desired.  There are foundations with tokens focused on absolute security, and that's great technology. Bancor is focused on absolute inclusion and community. While the team are learning from this unfortunate event, it's also worth pointing out that a far reaching community has been linked together, in a secure enough way that over $1 bn in transactions were made safely prior to the theft.  This technology is new, and expensive security holes will reveal and improve crypto and blockchain. In ten years we'll look back at a lot of mistakes that could've been prevented, had security been important above all else. In the meantime, we can do our best to manage the risks associated with new technology, and improve security, without abandoning our vision for the future. ",False

As a matter of fact, enhancing the liquidity of smaller cap tokens is in the primary focus of Bancor Protocol.

We must assume good faith unless we have actively reached out to those we levy claims against and have been met with none or uncooperative response.

Now you would also have been warned of slippage. The price at which the smart token is bought or sold for any of its reserve tokens is set by an algorithm which balances the current connector balance with the current smart token supply, at a predefined Weight, which is above 0 and up to 100%. The smart contract also recalculates its own price following each purchase (which causes price to increase) or liquidation (which causes price to decrease), in proportion to the transaction size. So, a larger purchase or liquidation will change the price more than a smaller one. This ensures that the connector cannot be drained and will always maintain their Weight of connector token balance in the contract. Thus, a smart token does not need to be listed in an exchange in order to be liquid and priced by the market. So in other words, the token price can vary through the transaction but this will be alerted in the slippage.",False

Smart Tokens‚Ñ¢ are the heart of the Bancor Protocol. They operate as regular tokens, in compliance with the ERC20 token standard used on the Ethereum blockchain, but include additional logic that allows users to always buy and sell them directly through their own smart contracts at prices that programmatically adjust to reflect supply and demand. Effectively, Smart Tokens come with a built-in liquidity mechanism that ensures they are continuously convertible for other tokens. To achieve this, each Smart Token connector holds a balance of the token it is connected to (for example, the BNT Smart Token has a single connector to ETH, which holds a balance in ETH). Buyers can use any of the connected tokens to purchase a Smart Token by sending them to the Smart Token‚Äôs contract, which then adds them to its connector balance and in return issues new Smart Tokens, which are automatically sent back to the buyer. In this case, both the connector balance of the Smart Token has increased, as has the Smart Token‚Äôs supply, since new units were issued. Similarly, a seller may send back a Smart Token to its contract, which will then remove these Smart Tokens from circulation and withdraw a corresponding amount of connected tokens from the connector balance, which will be automatically sent to the seller. In this case, both the connector balance and the Smart Token‚Äôs supply have decreased.  Read more: https://support.bancor.network/hc/en-us/articles/360000472072-How-does-a-Smart-Token-work-",False

Smart Tokens‚Ñ¢ feature built-in automated market makers. This means that their smart contracts will always buy the Smart Token from and sell the Smart Token to, any user, for any of its connector tokens (or any other token in the network.) The price at which these conversions take place is a function of the Bancor Formula, which balances supply and demand for the Smart Token while holding a constant ratio between a Smart Token‚Äôs total value (sometimes called market cap) and its connector token balances.  These ratios (called the connector weight) are configured by the Smart Token creator and may be adjusted to increase or decrease the token's liquidity level. The weight of a connector indicates a Smart Token‚Äôs price sensitivity, meaning the extent to which buys or sells affect its price movement. Every conversion affects the price of a Smart Token by altering its connector token balance and Smart Token supply - calibrating the price to maintain the constant weight. When Smart Token prices are out of sync with external prices on exchanges, arbitrageurs quickly act to balance these gaps  https://support.bancor.network/hc/en-us/articles/360000503372-How-does-automatic-pricing-work-",False

Right as you read this post many tokens are created. And it will increase each year. And this will create a situation where each organization/company/group of people have their own internal token. For example, if I launch a company and create some token, I do it:      To release an ICO so that people can fund this project.     To reward each member of this company for some results or accomplishments.   So, what is bancor: it is a protocol enables anyone to create a new type of crypto currency and these currencies will be called smart token. This smart token can hold and trade with other crypto currencies, which will allow it to serve as its own market maker, automatically discovering its own price and providing liquidity to other crypto currencies hence, removing the need for 3rd parties such as an exchange or a middleman in crypto currency trades. Every smart token is always liquid at some price.",False

At it‚Äôs core, Bancor is a set of formulas that solves the liquidity problems faced by most tokens. Bancor works by creating a token that is connected to shared liquidity pools on the blockchain. The way the math works, the formulas are essentially hard coded two way price elasticity of demand functions. If it sounds complex, it is because it is complex, but so are many algorithms.  There‚Äôs been a lot written about Bancor, most of which has been negative. The most notable negative story was Emin G√ºn Sirer‚Äôs ‚ÄúBancor is Flawed‚Äù, which was a 29 point takedown of Bancor. While Bancor Product Architect Eyal Hertzog penned a well written response to each of the Emion‚Äôs 29 points, I found it odd that not one of Emin‚Äôs 29 points directly addressed the set of formulas that power Bancor, which is really the only thing that matters (IMHO).  Now it appears that the tide of public sentiment for Bancor is turning, as the market focus shifts from hypotheticals, to what is actually happening. Last week, Coindesk featured the article ‚ÄúBancor Bounce Back?‚Äù which highlighted that Bancor‚Äôs volume rose from ‚Äú‚Ä¶$3 million per week in November to $37 million per week in January‚Äù.

Way back when bitcoin was called overpriced at $ 100 - I laughed and kept buying. Way back when Ripple was under $ .01 - Trashed with FUD yet I laughed and kept buying Way back when NAV was selling between $ .01 and $ .05 - This was a little tougher, but I kept buying.   My point is simple, if you do not see the real value of a project long-term this game may not be for you. Simply buy into whatever is trending today and be happy with whatever spare change you make. I will happily hold onto my 20k + Bancor and keep buying. Eventually I will be posting the above way back updates on another market reminding everyone that Bancor was once very cheap with all the potential for huge gains and still so many missed it. If you are closely watching the crypto markets, maybe you scratched your head like me at the Bitconnect fiasco and could not believe so many fell for the fast and easy profit way of investing. I truly believe in Bancor and will continue to support for numerous reasons, but if you do not see it, then by all means just walk away.

The Bancor team has indeed conducted a very good job by developing their partnerships and launching new features every month. However, I wanted to share my recent and unfortunate experience using the new Bancor Webapp.  On January 15th, I decided to jump on the opportunity of seeing the Binance Coin (BNB) joining the Bancor Network through a new Token Relay that connect BNB with BNT (Bancor‚Äôs token). I had previously bought 3 206.27 BNT (28 400 dollars based on the January 15th average exchange rate). That first transaction went very well through the Bancor Webapp. I indeed converted my ethers (ETH) into BNT in a simple click for only 8 dollars of gas price. At that time, my 23 ETH I had converted into BNT were still worthing 23 ETH once converted into 3206,27 BNT a few seconds after. Back on January 15th, I used the same process to have my total BNT balance converted into BNB. I was confident that the webapp would run perfectly well and the exchange rate announced on the Bancor webapp confirmation screen was matching the market based rate of the BNB/ETH on the Binance exchange website. I thought that it would be more efficient to use my BNT to buy BNB rather than going through an exchange. Indeed, it is the fundamental purpose of the Bancor Network to allow any smart Token to be converted into any other Token connected through Token Relays and the BNT connector. I proceeded the transaction after checking the advanced settings with a BNB default price limit of 5% which I confirmed.  Once the transaction confirmed on etherscan.io, I checked my new balance of 1 215.37 BNB in exchange for my 3 206.27 BNT. At that moment, I was really amazed by how fast and how easy it was to convert my BNT tokens into another Smart Token thanks to the ‚Äòmagic‚Äô of the Bancor Protocol. BUT I checked how much my 1215.37 BNB worthed based on the current market price‚Ä¶ only 23 830 dollars ! It took me like 30 seconds to accept that idea that my 28 400 dollars of BNT became 23 830 dollars once converted into BNB. I just lost 4 600 dollars in a single transaction (16,2% of the initial amount !) ‚Ä¶ I can tell you that was of course extremely painful. I am a student that invested a good part of his savings and I just lost 4600 dollars not on a market dump, but due to the Bancor Protocol.  Here is my transaction concerned on etherscan.io: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x81e18be561a076f392ec10bbd309ac6647f54df6a0a7636c3e4e180568a2e829  I spent hours understanding how I just ended up with that loss. My first thought was to check how it would cost me to have my 1 215.37 BNB converted back into BNT through the same Bancor webapp. I checked again the exchange rate proposed by the webapp. It seemed again OK to me compared to the Binance market price. But when I typed the amount of BNB I wanted to transfer, I then saw that the exchange rate changed a bit. However, that small price change was enough to lose another 3500 dollars in the transaction. If I had proceeded the second transaction, I would have lost a total amount of roughly 7 100 dollars (based on the January 15th market prices)‚Ä¶ The worst transaction cost you could ever imagine.  It took me a while to investigate on my own and understand how the Bancor Procotol made me lose 4 600 dollars and how I escaped from suffering another 3 500 dollars loss. Actually, the Bancor team is releasing every week new partnerships and Token Relays to develop the Bancor network. That is indeed a good thing to sustain the project on the long run. However, when a brand new Token Relay  is put online, the Bancor Protocol price discovery is not reacting in the same way that we can experience it when we trade BNT with the same Bancor Procotol. In the situation of a new Token Relay smart contract, the ‚Äúconnectors‚Äù, which means the Tokens balance backing the Token Relay is at a far lower level that the amount of ETH backing the BNT. When you proceed a transaction, the more token you send to the new Token Relay smart contract and the more the exchange rate is rising up sharply in one single transaction. The price volatility in one single transaction is barely seen when people are sending for example ETH to get BNT because the amount of ETH backing the BNT is huge (currently 45 000 ETH ). It would require a huge amount of BNT or ETH to have the same price volatility in one transaction.  Maybe all that mechanism is very familiar when you read the Bancor whitepaper and you thoroughly understood the deep implications of the Bancor Protocol. But even for an enlightened user who got the Big idea from the Bancor project, you can easily be fooled by the Bancor webapp.  My unfortunate experience made me remember a blog post from the Ethereum founder, Vitalik Buterin, tackling the token price discovery issue (https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/10/17/moe.html). According to him, if a token does not have any sinks, meaning a way to hold a part of the Token total balance in order to make it disappear, the Token value may be extremely unstable. The Bancor Protocol is using the connector (previously called Reserve Token) as a sink. However, the Bancor type of sink is much more pernicious than any other type of sinks. The Binance team is for example cash burning every quarter a part of the total BNB supply to keep the token value rising up. In the case of the Bancor Protocol, we can find the equivalent of the cash burn in its price discovery mechanism. If you send for example 3000 BNT to get BNB tokens, the Bancor Protocol will divide the 3000 BNT balance in an infinite quantity of transactions. It means that each of those transaction will be traded at a slightly different price. On the buyer side, it means that you will get in each transaction less BNB for 1 BNT. And the less the Token reserve balance of the smartcontract is important, the less you will get BNB for each BNT you are selling in my example. The Bancor sinks are the cost of a constant token liquidity. There is no magic solution. It is a just a way to deal with the Token valuation issue and the double coincidence of wants.  My main feedback on the Bancor Protocol and webapp :  -   The Bancor Protocol clearly disincentivizes people from trading big amounts of tokens relatively to the Token Reserve/connector balance. It also disincentivizes Bancor users from exchanging different tokens on a daily basis to limit their total loss due to the Bancor sinks taxing each of their transactions. It is maybe another explanation of the poor BNT performance since its last ICO in last June ? -   The Bancor webapp should CLEARLY warn the user when the exchange rate volatility is very high to avoid any huge loss compared to the current market price (specifically if the token is traded on a public exchange). -    The Bancor webapp user should be warned that the default settings for the price limit in the Bancor webapp is not the real one. The default price limit is 5% in the webapp. But the price considered for these settings is the final price, AFTER the Bancor Protocol impacted it. Indeed, the price computed by the Bancor Protocol is based on the amount of Token you want to trade, the Reserve Token balance or ""connector"" and the Token Relay balance. You cannot put a limit price on it by definition. The webapp only allow you to fix a price limit for the price already processed by the Bancor Protocol. It is indeed another way to be fooled by the webapp...And it made me lose 4600 dollars. Because if it was a real 5% limit price like on an exchange, I would not have lost all that money (16% of the initial amount !) -    The webapp is not transparent about all the different factors that can impact the exchange rate of your transaction. If a common user has to fight to get all the information needed (Reserve Token balance, Token Relay Balance etc.), have the ability to correctly understand it and not directly rely on the 5% default price limit in the webapp settings, all that is not in favor of the Bancor network democratization that the Bancor team is claiming to look for. -   The Bancor team should create a real typology of Tokens connected to the Bancor network. It is indeed important to differentiate the tokens that are already traded on crypto exchanges from the one which are only available using the Bancor Protocol. The Webapp users would see easily if they can accept to lose money from the Bancor sinks (the cost of the liquidity) because the tokens are not or rarely traded anywhere else. It would be like an arbitrage facilitator feature in the webapp. -   The Bancor project is aiming at emerging the long tail of the local currencies/tokens. In the white paper, they compare it with Youtube that enabled millions of people to share their video production to the rest of the world. The comparison is interesting but they seemed to forget that the Bancor sinks are actually another hidden cost that can be very painful for poorly funded smartcontract‚Äôs Tokens reserve. And the thousands of local tokens in the cryptoworld are by definition poorly funded, which implies a huge price volatility with inflated transactions costs if they are traded with the Bancor Protocol. The Bancor Protocol mastered the liquidity and the double coincidence of wants issues but not the transaction cost like Youtube did for its users. The entry barriers are still there. -   I contacted the Bancor team right after my unfortunate experience on January 15th. They answered me back the following day writing ‚ÄúFirst of all, thank you for your support! Let us look into this and we will get back to you as soon as possible.‚Äù It seems that they did not find it interesting because they never answered me back, even after I emailed them again multiple times on that issue‚Ä¶ I lost several months of intern compensation, I just desired at least to have their own opinion on these Bancor sinks to help them on their project. Very sad.   Sorry for the long post, I had a lot to share. I hope it will help the Bancor Project to really take off and scale.",False

The method smart tokens use to do this is by holding a balance of another token (let‚Äôs use ETH as an example) so that the smart token can be purchased by sending the connector token (ETH) to the smart contract (this ETH is then added to the connector balance, and smart tokens are issued to the buyer) or liquidated by sending smart tokens to the smart contract (the seller then receives ETH from the connector balance and the smart tokens are destroyed) all without needing a second party to trade with. The price at which the smart token is bought or sold for any of its reserve tokens is set by an algorithm which balances the current connector balance with the current smart token supply, at a predefined Weight, which is a above 0 and up to 100%. The smart contract also recalculates its own price following each purchase (which causes price to increase) or liquidation (which causes price to decrease), in proportion to the transaction size. So, a larger purchase or liquidation will change the price more than a smaller one. This ensures that the connector cannot be drained and will always maintain their Weight of connector token balance in the contract. Thus, a smart token does not need to be listed in an exchange in order to be liquid and priced by the market.  Bancor and Etherdelta are two separate services. There is no relationship",False

The method smart tokens use to do this is by holding a balance of another token (let‚Äôs use ETH as an example) so that the smart token can be purchased by sending the connector token (ETH) to the smart contract (this ETH is then added to the connector balance, and smart tokens are issued to the buyer) or liquidated by sending smart tokens to the smart contract (the seller then receives ETH from the connector balance and the smart tokens are destroyed) all without needing a second party to trade with. The price at which the smart token is bought or sold for any of its reserve tokens is set by an algorithm which balances the current connector balance with the current smart token supply, at a predefined Weight, which is a above 0 and up to 100%. The smart contract also recalculates its own price following each purchase (which causes price to increase) or liquidation (which causes price to decrease), in proportion to the transaction size. So, a larger purchase or liquidation will change the price more than a smaller one. This ensures that the connector cannot be drained and will always maintain their Weight of connector token balance in the contract. Thus, a smart token does not need to be listed in an exchange in order to be liquid and priced by the market.",False

This system uses the Bancor Protocol which contains a formula able to determine (""discover"") the price of the assets in any moment.

I looked into it deeper recently and read about the baskets of reserve tokens that could be bought and sold as one ""smart token"". This could be used as an ETF or index fund for any combination of cryptocurrencies allowing anyone to create their own fund. This reminds me of 1broker in that popular traders could create their own smart token in the Bancor Network and any user could buy into it.

It clarifies the role of Bancor in the crypto infrastructure, as a liquidity network rather than a blockchain. So, no need to spend time to develop and maintain a blockchain, rewarding masternodes/miners, etc. It makes sense.  However, on the technical side, we still have the BNT token as an ERC20, running on Ethereum. So, even if Bancor is a liquidity network, the token that stores all the network value (BNT) relies on Ethereum. I don't say Ethereum is bad, as I think it will just get better with time, but it still is dependant on Ethereum blockchain.  So, BNT token will always remain an ERC20 token, but Bancor devs will make it possible to trade it cross-chain using smart contracts.  Is that it?",False

BNT on the other hand has the benefit of potentially unlimited supply, in dependence of demand and connector weight. this is very important because the price formula would not make sense with a limited supply.  It would theoretically be feasable for ETH to work as connector for smart tokens within the Ethereum platform, but because the overall demand for BNT conditions its worth in terms of the bancor formula, which is programmed into the smart contract of BNT, without this intermediate layer it would bereave all coins within the Bancor network of a second power of appreciation.

It should be on your wallet.  I'd suggest the following - take your transaction id and run it on etherscan. See what comes up. If it cannot find the transaction id, that means there was an error broadcasting it, and the miners and nodes don't really know about your transaction. You can just recover your ETH locally. There's no 'stuck' status really - it is just about confirmed or unconfirmed transactions. If it is unconfirmed but seen by the nodes, it may just be a matter of time before it gets accepted into a block.  You should also check how much fees you sent the transaction with. Check out the current network suggested fees here: https://www.ethgasstation.info/ If you want to 'force' the transaction through, you should be able to just add more fees to your earlier transaction (don't know exactly how to do this for Parity, sorry, but I am sure you can Google that).",False

As is the case for any new coin on the Bancor protocol.  Because of the automatic buy and sell walls it it is impossible to pump and dump a coin like the way many coins rise. This leads to the fact that these coins rise very slowly, making them atypical cryptoinvestments.  The problem is that because the low potential of rapid big gains (because of the artificial sell walls) investors will lose patience and over the longer period they sell. The tendency of these coins is therefor to go down, just like Bancor. It has been slowly losing price in comparison to its reserve currency: ETH. This is because of the bancor network contract trading.  If you want stability and liquidity, invest in Bancor coins (or Lykke, they also peg their currency against the swiss frank and a little bit bitcoin and eth).  If you want big gains you gotta invest in coins on 'normal' exchanges, where investors do not have to buy up all these artificial sell-walls.",False

There is definitely a tail wind for Bitcoin though, in the form of CME futures. However, those would likely also take time - for example, it may take a year or so before the larger banks move in on those derivative products. Also, since they are derivatives, large banks can gain exposure to price both ways, i.e. it is now a good way to short Bitcoin. The effect on BTC price itself is very complex. It is even more complex on how this would affect the price of other cryptos.

Unfortunately we cannot win every time and we cannot expect every our decision to be instantly rewarded. Wait and hold.

Product Updates The STX (Stox) Smart Token‚Ñ¢ and the GNOBNT (Gnosis) Token Relay‚Ñ¢ have both been activated by the respective projects and are live in the Web App. Now anyone can convert ETH, BNT, STX and GNO at algorithmically calculated prices determined by the Bancor Formula, directly through our Web App, at any time. This is one small step for Bancor and one giant step for the industry, as the world‚Äôs first smart contract enabled autonomous conversion mechanism. You can read more in the dedicated post and check out the STX and GNO token community pages in the app. Expect many more projects to adopt the Bancor Protocol‚Ñ¢ shortly‚Ä¶ Smart Contract Upgrades  We pushed a great upgrade to the Bancor Smart Contracts, including the following features and enhancements: Gas limits to level the transaction playing field and prevent line jumping New terminology across many entities (read more on this below and expect to see rolling changes throughout our contracts and materials)  Further gas limit optimizations to reduce transaction costs even more Allowing the purchase of Token Relay‚Ñ¢ tokens with a single transaction Allowing sending of results of a transaction to another user Cleaner design, more separation between modules and less dependencies between converters, and more‚Ä¶ New Terminology  After a long and thorough process with the best minds in the business, we have finalized new terminology which more accurately describes the Bancor ecosystem and its various components. As is often the case with new inventions, we at first must use old words to describe new ideas. The lexicon below is adapted to reflect the autonomous and interconnected pieces that together create the Bancor decentralized liquidity network. The Bancor Protocol‚Ñ¢‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThis is the method described in our whitepaper by which a cryptographic token is related to another. The source token is a ‚ÄúSmart Token‚Ñ¢‚Äù and its related token is called a ‚ÄúConnector‚Äù (formerly known as reserve.) The Bancor Formula‚Ñ¢‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThis formula governs the price relationship between a Smart Token‚Ñ¢ and its Connector. The ratio balances buy and sell volumes while holding a token‚Äôs Connector ‚ÄúWeight‚Äù (see below) constant. The formula incorporates transaction size so each buy and sell affects the price as if it were executed in infinitely small increments. Weight‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThe weight of a Connector (formerly known as CRR) is the ratio between the Connector balance and the Smart Token‚Äôs Total Token Value (which is its supply x unit price.) This creator-configured parameter defines the sensitivity of a token to its Connector: A higher weight results in higher liquidity and greater stability, while a lower weight results in lower liquidity and lower stability. The weight of a Connector is held constant by the Bancor Formula while the Smart Token‚Äôs supply and Connector balance both rise with purchases and fall with sells, mandating that the price fluctuate accordingly. Smart Token‚Ñ¢‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäA Smart Token‚Ñ¢ can be purchased for any of its Connectors and sold for any of its Connectors, directly through the smart contract. Beyond its initial creator-configured supply, a Smart Token‚Ñ¢ is created when it is purchased and destroyed when it is sold. Because of the fraction in the Bancor Formula, Smart Tokens‚Ñ¢ with a total Connector weight of less than 100% increase in price as their supply increases (when purchased) and decrease in price as their supply decreases (when sold.) While demand still governs price, the supply of a Smart Token‚Ñ¢ is dynamic and adaptable, not finite. Token Relay‚Ñ¢‚Äî A Token Relay‚Ñ¢ is a unique kind of Smart Token‚Ñ¢ with two Connectors, with a combined total weight of 100%. This configuration allows for simple integration of existing ERC20 tokens into the Bancor Protocol, making them backwards compatible. The new Smart Token‚Ñ¢ created (for example, GNOBNT) is purchasable with either of its Connectors, and can be sold for either of its Connectors, making it a conduit for converting one to the other. Token Relays‚Ñ¢ in the Bancor Network‚Ñ¢ hold one Connector in BNT and the other in an existing ERC20 token, thus enabling the latter to convert into any token in the network, via BNT, which is itself a Smart Token‚Ñ¢ (with a 10% weight ETH Connector.) The Bancor Network‚Ñ¢‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäEvery token utilizing BNT as a Connector is part of what we call the Bancor Network‚Ñ¢ and thus convertible for any other in the network through a maximum 2 hop process via BNT. The Bancor Network‚Ñ¢ allows for autonomous, continuous, asynchronous convertibility between integrated tokens. This is the world‚Äôs first and only decentralized liquidity network.  The Bancor Web App‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThis front-end UX allows users to create a Smart Wallet‚Ñ¢ on the Bancor Network‚Ñ¢ which they can use to buy and sell any token in the network by interacting with the Smart Token‚Ñ¢ contract and convert between them at their formulaically calculated prices. This app will soon be widgetized and portable to any online or mobile destination for easy use throughout Bancor Network‚Ñ¢ members‚Äô ecosystems.  https://blog.bancor.network/bancor-progress-update-325c648dfb3a",False

So every new token that comes onto the Bancor network will likely come with an increase in the BNT token price, as the token has to purchase BNT to go live.  Should a smart token rise in value, it means there are more trades going through it and therefore more BNT being traded and likely a corresponding rise in the demand of BNT, so price will rise in this case too.  And, when someone buys a new BNT, the price they pay is added to the BNT smart token reserves. This increases the price of the next BNT (see formula in white paper). So as demand rises, both the amount of BNT and the value of a BNT increases with it.",False

Q:Yes, how many project partners is BNT talking to and how much in BNT are they purchasing approximately, within the next month?  A: We talk to about 3-4 new projects every day at this point. About ~50 are in various stages of the funnel, either considering using Bancor protocol or in some stage of implementation (of either smart tokens or token changers).  Many projects are using the protocol not just for the core token but to enable abilities they would not have without Bancor's smart contracts such as creating a 'short'.  Regarding purchasing of BNT, this depends on a number of factors including the desired amount of liquidity and size of the ICO. Beyond the initial purchase of BNT to seed smart tokens that provides short term bursts as each project activates, it's really the long-term enablement of buying and selling via the smart contract directly (resulting in the creation and liquidation) of BNT that is most exciting.",False

Moreover, speculation is typically a side element of a financial network, but when it becomes the main (if not the only) element in play, as it has been for years in cryptos, the whole sector ends up looking more like a ""ponzi gambling casino"" than anything else - which in the long term is not sustainable. The Bancor Protocol introduces for the first time a price discovery and stabilization mechanism, thus by reducing volatility and sheer speculation it is destined in the long term to attract the most serious investors, like for example hedge funds, pension funds etc. Useless to say how much the value would increat at that point.

Go to any high volume exchange and you will probably only see 4-5% of the available supply in the order book because most people don't actively trade their coins and/or are hodling. So it's easy to make the price spike or crash. With BNT, you need genuinely large volume to make the price move in either direction because most of the circulating supply is available in liquid form through the smart contract as BNT can be created or destroyed on demand.  It took me a while to figure this out but this can be both an advantage as well as disadvantage. It ensures the price doesn't fluctuate much but it also means you can't actively trade this coin or profit from it as easily. The only way to really profit is to keep holding BNT and hope that the demand rises steadily as more smart tokens use BNT as the reserve. It will be interesting to see how the price behaves once more tokens enter the scene and BNT is no longer pegged to ETH.",False

Luckily, I was accepted and two blog post were assigned to me for translating to Turkish. Unless most people around, i am aware of the gravity of this kind of translations. They are usually full of technical terms and complicated sentences which can make translation work very challenging. It is not like translating bunch of text messages between two people.  I have completed the first translation work and submitted it a few minutes ago. I wanted to check out the topic to see whether or not there were some comments about the price of this work, and i have to say that it did not surprise me to see the complains.  I am little perfectionist with my works so i usually use some more time on my works to make it as best as i can. Besides, considering the fact that i am new to Bancor project and i needed to read a few extra posts and articles to grab the whole idea i used some time to finish the work. It will probably get faster each time, but really, how many posts will be available for a single participant to translate in the end.  No body is really forcing us to do this job, and i enjoyed learning more about this project while translating the blog post. Nevertheless, i think the price of this work is a bit unfair and it might effect the quality of translations in the end.

With so much misinformation floating around, one might have missed that Bancor deployed on Ethereum, an actual live, innovative smart contract technology, being used everyday to help address an important problem that has profound implications not only for cryptocurrency but all asset exchange, liquidity!   Bancor protocol introduces the concept of smart tokens. These new tokens have special capabilities such as a built-in automated market maker that enables decentralized, onchain transactions without a counterparty. Bancor protocol can also be used to create network tokens, token changers, token baskets and with an accompanying consumer-Internet UX, a long-tail of local currencies.  We will be sharing a lot of material over the coming months to help educate a wider audience on these concepts, as we simultaneously work to release great software that brings more liquidity and freedom.

Dear Commissioners: Thank you for weighing in on the ICO market. I agree that some (light) regulation might be in order with regard to ICOs. But in the spirit of clarity, and encouraging innovation with this new vehicle that has so much potential, I recommend the following: If the purpose of a token is for investment, it must register with the SEC. If the purpose of a token is for societal transformation, and all proceeds go to the support and development of the token, it need not register. If the purpose of a token is to raise money for a company, and the money is used to support the company, it must register with the SEC. These clear definitions can help in two ways. They can make it clear that this is not a way for existing companies to raise money from the public without registering with the SEC, and it will allow the amazing innovations allowed by this new technology to flourish in our country unfettered. We will both protect the individual investor, and allow the U. S. to continue to lead as an innovator. I want the U.S. to be able to share in this bright future rather than giving all the benefits to countries like Switzerland, Singapore and Japan, who have taken leadership positions in the Crypto industry. Any tokens issued before October 30, 2017 should be grandfathered in. In the land of opportunity, the innovators should be celebrated. Please let me know if you think these guidelines make sense.

You never saw ads for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc.  The reason is that all growth for consumer internet apps always comes bottom up.  Everyone that tried to market by force a consumer internet app always failed 100% of the time.  Having said that we can divide our project in to a few verticals:  1) Token changers: once deployed, these should be marketed to the crypto community as its more comparable to a B2B product. It saves you money. Once deployed we will run an aggressive marketing campaign later this Summer.   2)End user long tail: Schedule for end of year. This is where marketing is less effective. Instead, what we will focus on is finding the relevant launch partners and early adopters who will be initiating their local tokens. We will support them with capital and HR resources.  Like blogs, subreddits, etc... The funnel to growth is from regular users experiencing the product themselves and then a percentage of them become superusers. For example, no one woke up in the morning and decided to become a blogger. Instead, they started our reading a blog... And then thought to themselves, ""I can do this too"", "" I have an idea"".  Our focus with the long tail is tuning the product to be organically viral.   3) Project Tokens (such as Stox). This isnt really marketing. Its biz dev. And we are doing it aggressively. We currently have over a dozen active discussions with upcoming high profile ICOs. I believe we'll see at least a dozen ICOs using the Smart token standard this year and 100+ next year.  4) High profile wins: We are in discussions with a number of major platforms (with millions of users, in one case tens of millions) to initiate platform level partnerships. This is in a way a combination of #2 and #3 via a 3rd party platform.  5) Index funds: Discussions have started with various financial institutions around launching token baskets. We are focusing on both crypto businesses as well as non crypto mainstream financial entities considering asset tokenization.",False

We recognize there was a lot of flippers early on. We also recognize that Bancor is not a trivial concept to communicate.  Our efforts beyond the above are focused on a few things whose fruit isnt picked overnight but requires a few months:  A. Redoing our messaging to more cleaely explain Bancor and the concept of the automated market maker  B. Relaunching Bounty programs: they were wildly successful and gives everyone of our supporters a tangible way to help the efforts. These will launch around the first week of August  C. Growing the team. This is key. We were 15 by the time of the ICO. We have growth target of 40 by end of year and 100 by end of 2018. We will be opening offices in Tokyo and Shanghai in early 2018.

Developers have been acting with care and responsability. As for the price, it didn't move much related to ETH, which is understandable since Bancor's infrastructure of apps is still under construction and they are not operative yet. BNT's value had tanked because Ether has tanked. Volumes of BNT trading have been quite big, on the other side, which means the tokens are smoothly moving in big quantities from weak hands to strong hands. At some point the sellers will have sold what they wanted to sell and a majority of buyers will be left. So if Ether's price will rise again - Bancor's price will rise. When Bancor will deliver its apps and people and communities will start to adopt it, new tokens will be created and - Bancor's price will rise. When weak hands will have sold all their tokens to strong hands, buyers will become the majority and - Bancor's price will rise.

Join the telegram because they sometimes answer question there, they only post important news on blog.  Its better than let say, Golem, after 7months? Today only they have release the alpha for brass.    Guy @ Bancor: Sure. The GNO-BNT token changer has finished the dev phase. It is undergoing rigorous testing.  Remember that once it works, it is basically copy/paste to do the others, requiring only changing the properties during creation (instead of GNO, using DGD for example, hint hint).  We expect this process to not take much longer. However there are additional considerations that might effect timing, namely:  1. UX. As you know, the front-end still needs more development (particularly the security related aspects of using HTML/browser). This raises the question about how to best release the token changer in the meantime using a more complex buying and selling process (as with BNT). This is our current direction although I can hear the complaints already... Bancor needs to make a dead simple interface for everyday people! Yes, we know  2. Legal. We must complete a legal review regarding the correct methodology of launching the token changer as unlike the BNT fundraiser, there is even more sensitivity around this deployment from a regulatory perspective. The good news again here is that when we get the green light it applies to all the token changers and likely the token baskets as well.  We will keep you all posted. We are moving on this as fast as possible as like you all, we are excited that these token changers will provide the first real world use case (utility) for the token, a rarity in the current crypto landscape.",False

Because a lot of people wish exactly that. Sorry for this bold statement, but this is exactly what people want to hear right now, that their investments are going to multiply overnight, 10 times, or 100 times. There are other people which think that by the of the year, or maybe in 5 years, Bancor token will be worth 10x, 100x, or 1000x.  The reality is that this market was already pumped up, showed by the huge capital that was already invested on the ICO, as well as other ICOs.  Sorry guys, but this is not how bitcoin, ethereum, or any other big crypto won the market, there weren't people wanting to become rich overnight, or in 5 years. There were people seeking to improve the ecosystem, with something new, fresh, and based only on the idea of helping the ecosystem.  I have invested in some ICOs, but what I don't like about this ICO craziness is the greed from the developers, I can understand the greed from traders, that the whole point, but from developers, wanting to raise as much money as they can to later see how to make sense for the investors as the money vanishes  Sorry for not sharing your thoughts, but this is definitively not how ethereum came to life, or bitcoin, or any other big crypto, this is how the greedy pump and dump 2.0 is coming to life. Do you remember how a lot of shitcoins, or scamcoins came to life after bitcoin success, back on 2011, 2012, 2013, just to get the money from investors. Well, right now it is the same, but multiplied by 10x, there are shitcoins coming everyday, and what they all have in common is an absurd cap, or even uncapped, ICOs. Please ask yourselves, do these projects really need that amount of money? Obviously not. Remember how all those shitcoins broke 5 years ago under that scammy pump and dump scheme. This is pump and dump 2.0, or if you like the smart word, this is the smart pump and dump.  Please, please, please, please, be very careful, and not too greedy, when investing on these ICOs, there are good ones, but be specially suspicious about uncapped or huge ICOs.  And please, don't go away crying, or whining, when shit happens, because it will happen, but please, don't do that. You knew the risks.  I'm worried for the repercussion that this pump and dump 2.0 scheme will brought to the crypto word, namely ethereum, because I truly believe on its potential, not for becoming rich, but for society, efficiency, transparency, and a fully democratized economic system.",False

So with all that said, if there is a system in place similar to Tether to ""balance the price quickly"" shall there be a sudden rush in purchasing, what criteria is use to finally let the free market rise up the value of each token where the investors can finally begin to see a Return On Investment?  EDIT:  In the other hand, if the price is balanced out in order to maintain an arbitrary fixed value per token regardless how the marketcap grows in overall $$$ invested value then this could make this token as a great store of value to hedge when bitcoin and most altcoins goes down in value to protect investors in value not going down dollar wise when the market ""dries up"" allowing to ""buy back"" later on at the same dollar value you existed  at regardless how low BTC ""crashed""",False

It basically becomes anyone's guess - spin the wheel and try to determine a fair value.  My biggest steady wins on these coins are based on low supply and low price vs. peers, as well as a team that continues moving forward and communicating with the public, bonus public interest steadily working on the project. Things work out. Have a decent market cap but not nuts. Market cap is, after all, just circulating supply * price.  My worst? Hype. Lack of community. Stanford pedigree garbage. Tons of promises with nothing to prove it. I've been suckered into 3 of them now and they're all in the gutter. Lesson learned.  This particular team has a lot of interest in this and I'm chalking it up to typical IPO over-hype.  Bottom line: wait 3, 4 weeks (and when price is stable) and buy it if you believe in it (I do - they're making something easy which was before, very complex, and they have the community behind it). Give some time for the kinks to work out. Right now the rubber isn't meeting the road, though, and you have profit taking across the board overall.

I am not the best person to provide an answer here, but let me give it a shot...  Let's assume I am the owner of a local restaurant - Restaurant X. I want to encourage more people to visit Restaurant X - both locals and people from other parts in the world. I decide to issue discount vouchers in the form of a smart token. In addition, I want the token to be liquid and of value even to those who might choose not to come and eat at my restaurant. So I decide to create and issue my own smart token within the Bancor network. I want to call it Restaurant X (REX). I need BNT tokens to create my smart token. Assuming that I don't own any BNT tokens, I buy some ETH and convert it into BNT tokens via smart contract. Alternatively, I have the option to buy BNT in the open market by paying in any currency or token that the seller will accept.  ""All smart tokens issued within the Bancor network will hold the BANCOR token as a reserve (though they may also hold additional reserve tokens. This means that an appreciation in the value of any of the network's smart tokens will appreciate the value of the BANCOR network token, benefiting all other smart tokens in the BANCOR network, since their reserve balance will increase. BANCOR will also be used a a reserve for the token changers that make up its decentralized exchange network. A BANCOR token changer is basically a smart token that holds a 50% CRR reserve in BANCOR, and 50% CRR reserve in an existing, standard ERC 20 token (e.g. REP, GNT, RLC) allowing end-users to easily convert between the two by buying with one reserve token and selling it for the other.""  In other words, those who hold REX smart tokens will not have to come to my restaurant to exchange it for a meal in order to realize the value. They will be able to exchange their REX tokens for other tokens anywhere in the world. E.g. let's assume Luigi, a restaurant owner in Italy, creates and issues a smart token for his restaurant within the Bancor network. He calls the token: Restaurant Italy (RIT). Now I will be able to exchange some of my REX tokens for RIT tokens in order to enjoy a meal at Luig's restaurant in Italy. Or in case I can't make it, I just take the RIT tokens and convert it back into the tokens of my liking (within the decentralized exchange network built by Bancor).  Or even better...  Let's assume someone in Italy received some RIT tokens from Luigi as part of a promotion. However, Sandra don't want to eat at Luigi's restaurant. She wants to buy a pair of designer shoes instead. So she orders a pair of shoes from Gustav in Germany and pays in RIT tokens - partially or in full. Gustav is happy, because he has the option to keep or exchange the RIT tokens for something else of value. Now Sandra goes around, telling her friends and everybody else how she bought shoes in Germany by using RIT tokens. Her friends are blown away. The news spread like a wild fire. Luigi's restaurant is getting a lot of attention!  Meanwhile in Germany, Gustav is telling his friends how he managed to sell more shoes because of his decision to accept RIT tokens. And so the Bancor story continues to spread like a wildfire. Those who sold their BNT tokens for next to nothing are now starting to regret it.    Thus, by creating my smart token or ""discount vouchers"" within the Bancor network, my token enjoys worldwide liquidity due to the reserve value held and people who make use of the Bancor network. Another benefit that I enjoy is that my restaurant is now getting worldwide exposure. This ""discount voucher"" keeps on giving!  ""My questions is, does Bancor still relies on ETH to create those new tokens? or is everything still based on ETH?? If Bancor can create its own tokens and be competitor to ETH then I can see the purpose, but if it relies on Ether then why even bother?"" - As far as I understand, Bancor's products are build on the ETH blockchain. However, while ETH was needed to buy BNT tokens initially, one is now able to buy BNT with any currency a seller will accept. This is because of the ETH reserve value of 0.01 per BNT. However, if I am not mistaken, if one sells BNT by sending instructions via smart contract, it will only return ETH at this stage. The BNT sold will be destroyed. In addition, if one wishes to buy BNT via smart contract, one can only do so by sending ETH via smart contract.  The above is my understanding of how it works (at least the token creation part of it). I am sure I am not 100% spot on, but it might give you a pretty good idea of what the idea is behind Bancor. This could be HUGE!",False

The Bancor protocol represents the first technological solution for the classic problem in economics known as the ‚ÄúDouble Coincidence of Wants Problem,‚Äù in the domain of asset exchange.  For barter, the coincidence of wants problem was solved through money, allowing people to transact asynchronously, over time and space. For money, the existing exchange model relies on the labor of market makers providing liquidity, as represented by an order book which creates market depth. This requirement for labor creates a barrier-to-liquidity, meaning that some threshold of trade activity level is required in order to retain high liquidity at the market price. This barrier-to-liquidity particularly affects small cap, custom, lightly traded currencies, such as community currencies or small business loyalty points, as examples.  The Bancor protocol proposes a new solution that removes the barrier-to-liquidity by employing an asynchronous price-discovery model enabled by asset-holding smart tokens. Smart tokens are always purchasable and sellable for the token(s) they hold in reserve. The continuous liquidity of smart tokens removes the barrier-to-liquidity and enables the emergence of the long tail of user-generated currencies. This could lead to a democratization of value creation, similarly to how blogs democratized publishing and YouTube democratized broadcasting.  Beyond enabling the long tail of cryptocurrencies, the Bancor protocol mechanism of intrinsic reserve currencies coupled with the ability of the smart contract to issue and liquidate smart tokens, also holds profound implications in use cases where the goal is not to create new credit (as is the case with most new cryptocurrencies) but rather to enable the exchange of existing currencies without a counterparty or orderbook (see ‚ÄúToken Changers‚Äù) or to enable the direct ownership of currency baskets, or index funds, without counterparty risk (see ‚ÄúDecentralized ETFs‚Äù).

But with the increase number of token, the value will go up along with it.  'Smart tokens are compatible with the ERC20 standard and can be used by any software that supports this standard, such as Ethereum wallets. However, smart tokens offer additional functionality not available to regular tokens. Each smart token holds a reserve balance in one or more other ERC20 tokens, thereby enabling anyone to exchange between itself and any of its reserve token(s). The smart token‚Äôs smart contract issues new tokens (expanding the supply) to anyone who purchases it with any of its reserve tokens, and withdraws tokens from the reserves (contracting supply) for anyone choosing to liquidate the smart token. The price of a smart token vis-a-vis any of its reserve tokens is calculated as a ratio between the current smart token‚Äôs supply and its reserve balance, at the pre-set CRR (Constant Reserve Ratio.) Please read our white paper available on the Bancor website for more detailed information about these formulas and their proofs. Essentially, a smart token‚Äôs price will always strive to balance supply and demand for the smart token, meaning that when it is being purchased the price is climbing, and when it is being sold, the price is dropping, in relative proportion to the respective transaction sizes.   Now the activation of smart contract is just the beginning. This smart contract just the basis of bancor.  Bancor network token (bnt) will be used as a default reserve when people want to create smart token in its platform.  The BANCOR network token is the Genesis smart token to be deployed, establishing the BANCOR network, functioning as its native currency. The BANCOR token will hold a reserve in ETH.  BANCOR tokens will be issued in a crowdsale. The crowdsale proceeds will be used to deploy and continuously evolve a user-friendly web/chatbot interface for issuing and using tokens in the BANCOR network, to support various efforts for growing the network such as investing in the reserves of new tokens, and to make the initial deposits required to set up a new type of high liquidity decentralized token exchange network based on the Bancor protocol, using 100% CRR token changers.  All smart tokens issued within the Bancor network will hold the BANCOR token as a reserve (though they may also hold additional reserve tokens.) This means that an appreciation in the value of any of the network‚Äôs smart tokens will appreciate the value of the BANCOR network token, benefiting all other smart tokens in the BANCOR network, since their reserve balance value will increase.  BANCOR will also be used as a reserve for the token changers that make up its decentralized exchange network. A BANCOR token changer is basically a smart token that holds a 50% CRR reserve in BANCOR, and 50% CRR reserve in an existing, standard ERC 20 token (e.g. REP, GNT, RLC) allowing end-users to easily convert between the two by buying the smart token with one reserve token and selling it for the other. In the future, Bancor plans to support additional tokens as well.",False

Otherwise people will arbitrage the hell out of it.  At the moment the rate is low because there is huge sell pressure at the exchanges. I don't know why people are selling but this is a golden opportunity to get some cheap tokens. I doubt we will ever see these prices again. I'm stocking up as much as possible.

Each smart token holds a reserve balance in one or more other ERC20 tokens, thereby enabling anyone to exchange between itself and any of its reserve token(s). The smart token‚Äôs smart contract issues new tokens (expanding the supply) to anyone who purchases it with any of its reserve tokens, and withdraws tokens from the reserves (contracting supply) for anyone choosing to liquidate the smart token. The price of a smart token vis-a-vis any of its reserve tokens is calculated as a ratio between the current smart token‚Äôs supply and its reserve balance, at the pre-set CRR (Constant Reserve Ratio.)

All smart tokens issued within the Bancor network will hold the BANCOR token as a reserve (though they may also hold additional reserve tokens.) This means that an appreciation in the value of any of the network‚Äôs smart tokens will appreciate the value of the BANCOR network token, benefiting all other smart tokens in the BANCOR network, since their reserve balance value will increase.  BANCOR will also be used as a reserve for the token changers that make up its decentralized exchange network. A BANCOR token changer is basically a smart token that holds a 50% CRR reserve in BANCOR, and 50% CRR reserve in an existing, standard ERC 20 token (e.g. REP, GNT, RLC) allowing end-users to easily convert between the two by buying the smart token with one reserve token and selling it for the other.

Then:  What is Min Return? This indicates the minimum amount of tokens you are willing to receive at the end of the change, basically setting a maximum price you are willing to pay for each token. We recommend using 90%-95% of the price visible on our site.  For example, you aim to change 5 ETH to BNT. If you set the value to 225 (you need to indicate this in wei which would be 225,000,000,000,000,000,000) this means the transaction will only be executed if the current price can return you 225 BNT or more. If it cannot, you will lose the gas fee that accompanies your transaction. This is why we recommend the slight buffer on your desired price.

Some background for those who want more info... We run extensive tests to identify systemic flaws, including various issues from front-running to other mechanisms that can be used in an attempt to manipulate the price of the smart token. Over the past weekend, together with our auditors we managed to find a very rare edge case in which under certain circumstances a trader could in theory exploit the formula. There are a number of band-aid solutions that would allow us to release today (from limiting transaction size to adding a very small fee to make the exploit unprofitable), however, we prefer to solve the issue at its source.

I think it would be awesome to start a Lafayette Dollar or whatever they want to call it.. that has other tokens in it as exchange.  I would then have them help me go around town and setup local buisnesses with their own tokens to use as customer rewards points that the customers could then exchange for rewards at any of the other local buisnesses that wanted in on the system..  just like bancor was intended to be used..

It's the perfect system for someone who isn't a day-trader (someone who doesn't need all the charts/graphs for trend analysis).  The only negative I can think of with Bancor is that it isn't decentralized (at least I don't think so?).

But I'm sure some coins would rise from the dust after.  If old coins die, and money shifts to new ones, no problem, but if each remain at the levels they reach than real backing is spread thin and falls short of catching it before it faceplants.  This is what most think will happen, but I don't see this scenario happening before either of the next ones.  5% of the coins being traded is what sets the price, and 5% immediately dumped tanks the market.  That being said, if an ICO raises enough, money is sucked off the market making support vulnerable, and given to one group who could decide to dump immediately to fiat and there goes the market.  Killing the entire market immediately in this manner would need 1 billion USD raised and dumped.  This is immediate - half of that could probably kill it by market momentum.  If an ICO that raises a lot of money and decides to only accept funds in a currency other than BTC or ETH right now, which would pump an investment on the side for them (very likely to happen), the major loss of funds from the big players would make the entire market vulnerable, and would fall like dominoes.",False

You not gonna get paid,(they pay automatically because its based on your sign up date) they pay when you complete one whole week before bounty end. They pay weekly, not daily.  Yes the bounty is over, but no it's not automatic. The Bounty Manager has to review your post and manually pay you. I actually have a friend who posted at the same time as me (seconds apart, long before the bounty window was closed) and ""Bounty Manager"" commented on both of our posts, but only one of us were paid. I'm going to assume they were just rushing and missed some people. It'll likely be taken care of once ""Bounty Manager"" returns (I think it's a bit unprofessional to just bail before resolving all the issues, but it is what it is). They're probably all off celebrating being multi-millionaires right about now. ",False

How this contract will work? How it can purchase BTN when price will be on 0.01ETH? i've came across 3 ideas but i'm not really sure witch one is correct.  1)I mean how is possible for the smartcontract buy back BNT at market price of 0.01ETH without passing through exchanges, buying through exchanges means this will be a smartcontract that can interact with Exchanges' API to work and make an automatic buy when that price is reached. 2)It will be a simply contract that interacts with the seller through wallets, meaning when BTN price on exchanges will hit 0.01ETH you just send your BTN from your wallet to the contract to recive back ETH. 3)The smartcontract will be in Bankor platform itself named like BTNETH contract, but that would mean each token sent back to the platform will be burned as ETH is sent back to the seller meaning less BTN in circulation could drive the BTN price up, cause offer and demand.

You pay, say $10,000 and you receive $10,000 worth of equity based on some agree valuation basis. 100% of the book value of your investment is accounted for.  However in the case of these ICO it's all fly by your pants stuff. You pay 100% book value funds and get something back that isn't 100%, 30%, maybe 70%. The balance of your investment - as I've stated earlier - goes towards jacking up the equity value of the ICO issuer.  Ok you could say that the investors valued the total asset at a premium over book value (happens all the time) but even then you're not getting it all going into your equity slice. The ICO issuers are not just executors of your money, they are now owners of it as well with not even a contract over what they are required to do with it. In fact the valuation wasn't even known until the ICO closed, it's a case of ""we'll take as much cash as you can throw at us"".  I'm not saying it won't necessarily work out for everyone in the end, but you're now at the mercy of markets to recover the loss on the book value of the investment.  I doubt people are going to be able to get away with this for very long with the amounts that are being thrown around in these ICOs now.",False

They intended to take in 250K ETH, they ended up with 397K ETH.  As you say, 20% of all ETH goes into reserve so we've got three pots now.  In rounded numbers, (a) 0.2 * 397 = 79K ETH for the reserve; (b) 0.8 * 250 = 200K that actually ""paid for"" 39M BNT distributed to the public; and (c) 0.8 * (397-250) = 118K ETH that goes into an unexpected ""post ex facto"" fund to buy back public tokens at ICO price and give them to Bancor Network.    So the proportion of your donation that actually bought BNT tokens for your own wallet was 200 / 397 = 50.4%.  The other 49.6% of your donation went to buy tokens for the Bancor Network - some now in the reserve pool, the rest over the next 2 years during buyback.    Final approximate  ICO cost for a single purchased BNT token assuming $400 per ETH is thus 200,000 *400 / 39,000,000 = $2.05 per BNT.  Bancor's loss of control on how and when to stop the ICO  resulted in the percent of your donation actually purchasing tokens FOR YOU slip from the promised 80% to an actual 50.4%.

The Bancor business model is pretty close to a scam. I am sure you will not take my word for it, because this is my first post. In fact, I made this account because I find it bizarre that no one is talking about this. Let's be honest, which one of you truly tried to comprehend their mathematical proof? Not a single person who invested at least, because otherwise they would not have wasted their money. I will try to explain a little.  They collected pretty close to 400k ether. Essentially what they do, is keep .8*400k ETH = 320k ETH to themselves, and call the remaining 80k reserves. They will express this 80k in a different coin, called BNT. They assign 100 BNT to 1ETH that they received. That means there is 500BNT for every 1ETH in the reserves. Essentially, if everyone would want to convert their BNT back to ETH, they would get 1/500 ETH per BNT. Wait you say, in the white paper it says that the starting price of 100BNT will equal 1 ETH! This is true, this is where the mathematics uses a trick to hide what is going on. Their pricing formula, P=R/(S*F) ensures that the first BNT sold will be sold at a 'fair' value, namely equal to the amount of ETH you spent to buy it in the first place. After the first sell, things get worse rather quickly. Let's illustrate this by a little example:  Lets say that 10% of people who own BNT sell it back to ETH via the smart contract. For the initial price we get: P = 80k/(40m*.2) = 0.01. All looks fair. Then after the sell we get 40m*10%*0.01 = 40k,  P = 80k-40k/((40m-4m)*0.20) = 0,00556. Ouch, the price almost dropped to half value from the 10% sell-off (this is different if there are many small transactions but I will get to that later).  If people buy the same amount of BNT, this is what happens: P = 120k/(44m*0.20) = 0.01364. The increase in price is not nearly as interesting for the next person. But again, this will be lower for many small transactions.  I created a plot assuming transactions are made in small batches of BNT coins. We find that the BNT value drop VERY quickly when people start selling, and does not rise nearly as fast. Essentially this just makes BNT an undesirable coin. Another weird thing about their system is that it does not consider convexity. This means that big transactions will get very different prices than many small ones. This just does not make sense, but they don't care as they simply took your money. http://imgur.com/a/f9yLy  If you are still not convinced, consider this. They literally admit to taking 80% of your money. All they give back is some mathematical trick based on 20% of the ether that you gave them. Do you really believe they just generated x5 value out of thin air? Sorry, but math does not work that way. I would recommend getting rid of your BNT asap, or you end up all the way on the left side of the graph. I am sorry that this news comes a bit late for some of you... I didn't read their methodology until last night Sad  Maybe now you can start to add up why the ICO was strange in various ways.  As final words, don't just believe whatever I say. Think about it for yourself. I gain nothing by convincing you of whatever I write here, I am simply sharing thoughts.",False

In any event, the Initial Creation Period will last for a minimum of 1 (one) hour‚Äù  In other words: The minimum duration is 1 hour and the maximum 14 days.    You falsely quote: ‚ÄúClause 15: Here it clearly states the minimal initial creation period is 1 hour long. Not more. Not less.‚Äù  It is clearly stated in the Terms and Explanatory note:  ‚ÄúMinimal Initial Creation Period: Independent of the Hidden Cap, the Initial Creation Period will in any event last for 1 (one) hour‚Äù  In other words: The initial creation period must at a minimum be 1 hour long. Common sense dictates, according to what‚Äôs stated, that they were well within their rights to go over 1 hour.  Furthermore, you state: ‚ÄúClause 16: ""After the Minimal Initial Creation Period, the Initial Creation Period automatically ends once the Hidden Cap as implemented in the SCS has been reached.""  ‚ÄúHidden Cap: After the Minimal Initial Creation Period, the Initial Creation Period automatically ends once the Hidden Cap as implemented in the SCS has been reached.

Please defend yourself how both these terms does not violate their own terms. Cap is reached, yet going for another 1 hour. That's right, nobody defends this. Bunch of pathetic clowns. Trying to steer attention away from the main issue. Why nobody of you 4 clowns are talking about this. You don't even have an opinion? Why you have an opinion of everything else? Fools these mortals be.  This is just critique and people (again, this shows enough who these 3-4 people are) think I'm attacking the project or bancor, which I'm not at all.

See my previous reply. Again, clearly violated their own t&c by continueing for another hour after cap has reached. You people are too stupid to see or acknowledge your faults. Does it hurt your ego? I just showed my critique of this kind of business practises and people started attacking me. I'm not even going to waste time consulting people here, I see it's a waste of time dealing with idiots. It's better to post it in private groups and own websites.  Also, I've never said that bancor is a scam and was in favor for this ico, but the terms just suck for serious investors and you know I'm right, because some serious investors agreed with me. The little fish who don't even know what the word investing means, are wanna be emotional cry babies here on the forum who bring ZERO value to the table. I've wasted many hours for nothing, but I learned a lesson. This place is infested with stupid people, hence dumb money. Great way for traders to capitalize on. That's all I'm going to say.  Nobody has ever countered my arguments on this forum, but trying hard to feed their ego by trying to be right by fabricating fantasies and using reverse logic. Nice try and only in this thread.

This is bancor thread of course ppl in here believe in bancor.  I written there 'even if the transaction not get clogged' What the team done after the clogged transaction happen, they extend the time limit to 3 hour( that not wrong at all for me becaus the cap not even reach yet at this time) and then they need to find a way to send stop order through the clogged transaction whic fail btw. So?  Any investor that dont like with that can liquidate after this. They have decided to allocate any proceeds collected in the minimum hour which exceed the hidden cap as follows:  20% will be allocated to the BNT Ether Reserve, to further improve the liquidity of BNT, which increases stability while reducing conversion costs (price slippage) for all.  80% will be locked for two years in a smart contract that will buy back BNT for 0.01 ETH (the initial price) whenever it is available, according to its calculated price. The purchased BNT will be added to the Foundation‚Äôs long-term budget, and after a 2-year period, any remaining ETH will be allocated pro-rata according to the ‚ÄúUse of Proceeds‚Äù chart in our Token Creation Terms.  Thats a 120k eth buy back wall at ico price. Idk why this guy so bitter bout this.  Proud with his reddit peers, but in the fud thread about bancor there all making stupid accusation, didnot even read whitepaper and grasp concept., just listen to hearsay. Lol    The team react according to situation. He salty this ico can get huge amount. Lol  That might not be wrong for you, but it is for pre-ico investors and investors < 1hour. Rules are rules. A buddy of a friend of mine has invested close to a million USD and he's not happy with this ico launch and we are not alone. If you broaden your horizon and google, you see a lot of people don't like such ico launch at all, especially extending the time and those are prominent players in the crypto scene.  If you don't know why this buyback contract is bad, I can't help you. It's financially not in your interest vs liquidity, nor in risk assessment. One of the first thing you learn in college and business school...  Yeah, exactly just what you've said you prove my point... you just follow what others say...

Clearly, you talk from out of your ass, once again. That's why this forum needs moderation like Reddit and Steem, to keep stupid people in their place. They just clutter meaningful discussions on purpose. You talk as if you know law, which clearly you don't. The plaintiff need to provide evidence, not the other way around. That's why bank accounts require your personal information to link and that's why governments, eu and un don't want privacy in the blockchain, because they cannot identify who the transaction holder is. Your question is rhetoric and I don't know if it's legit or just plain stupid. In either way, that doesn't bring legitimacy to your claim that others don't know the law, when in fact you don't know jackshit about contracts, but act like you do with plain lies.  It ceases to amaze me that people that are so wrong never admit they're and keeping going without any shame or guilt. Again, refering to a possible solution how to mitigate that in my first paragraph, possibly with a permanent rating system coupled to passports and passed history in work and education for in the next blockchain solution, that would be nice.

I was watching during fundraising and you have broken your own T&C, by extending 1 hour to 3 hours. People can sue you for this. I haven't heard anybody complain in this thread, unlike other places like Reddit, because most in this thread probably don't have the intellectual capabilities to understand contracts and laws, but act on emotion and claims without arguments, evidence and reason. You can't defend yourself to extend another 2 hours when there were a lot of transaction that went through. That's why you covered your asses by excluding US citizens/resident, because you know Europeans don't have the balls to do it.  You also claimed to be under attack, but your boasted auditer, expert blockchain- and related developers have claimed the opposite, namely the weakness of Ethereum blockchain, the workload. You have shown no proof for attacks, but repeatily Twittered your network was under attack. Where is the proof? The stupid sheeple believe everything you say and parrot in this thread, it's insane. Your ICO is no exception, it happened before, but unlike the other companies, you're the only one yelling you're under attack.  The unprofessional responses are a pretty sad consolidation of already performed due diligence. Good luck to any investors getting a decent roi out of this, if anything at all. I've pointed you out to the red flags, also in the contracts, you didn't listen. You believe in paperware for $160m. Welcome to reality. I can guarantee you that you'll get a wake up call when lose money some day when you keep doing what you're doing, because those business practises with ico is a heaven for any criminal/scammer to get insane amounts of money with minimal risk to get away with it, while putting minimal effort in to it. I don't have any sympathee for you in that case. Attacking people who tried to help you think critically for yourself, to think eclectically instead of a stupid fool who can't think further than one step and sees only one thing.  Why should we regret? You're holding the high risk low reward here. Good luck getting anything back after 2 years higher than even holding it in Eth or investing in low risk-high reward projects. I wish the team the best to implement real world solutions. Too bad that all economic crisises in the world (and the next one still to come) are based on Keynesian economics and that is exactly what Bancor is tanking on. The proof is the disaster that is called the Euro, so why would you be proud and boasting an Euro architect is beyond me. Learn Austrian economics and the see fallacies and pseudo intellectuals of mainstream Keynesians. It's also ironic that you also boasted having been invested by a billionaire, who is the the opposite of being a keynesian, who also invested in and got huge stakes in a company with alligned anarcho capitalist (which is based on Austrian economics) that has the opposite philosophy of yours, so he took his position in the two extremes.  I'll watch and enjoy this guaranteed shitshow, no regrets buddy. If I'd be that billionaire, I'd have done the same. Unlike the latter company who made public disclosure of his involvement and shares in the company, Bancor does not show any records for their investors. That's why you don't operate in the USA, because you have been under investigation immediatly by the SEC or being sued for (for breaking t&c, having raised this much money, 2 year shitty contract that would have been against the law in the stockmarket for ipos, no public disclosure of vc billionaire's involvement and shares in bancor for their investors, etc.).

Reading is hard, huh? And no arguments given, again, no surprise. The fact that you say it yourself that ""Coz at this point you clearly dont read properly"" means you don't understand anything what you read, which may be a sign of a mental attention disorder.  Quote: ""Clause 14: Initial creation period is either one hour or until the hidden cap has been reached. It must be at least one hour, but when the hidden cap has not been reached, it will be longer. Clause 15: Here it clearly states the minimal initial creation period is 1 hour long. Not more. Not less. Clause 16: ""After the Minimal Initial Creation Period, the Initial Creation Period automatically ends once the Hidden Cap as implemented in the SCS has been reached.""  So, the ""Minimal Initial Creation"" period is one hour long. After that time is up, we're into the Initial Creation Period, which terminates once the hidden cap has been reached. The hidden cap was 250k ETH. 250k ETH was reached at 2 hours, which is after the ""Minimal Creation Period"" that is very clearly stated to be 1 hour long. Because the hidden cap was reached after the ""Minimal Creation Period"", the hard cap ends the ICO.""  Clearly, you talk non-sense, because it went longer than 2 hours up to 3 hours. Again, where are your arguments? They're clearly in violation of their own T&C, yet you keep defending with ZERO arguments, pathetic!

I sure didnt sign any contract hahaha. I stopped reading there because i know that  See this intelligence of @ DigitalNinja. Contracts don't have to be signed in ""wet ink by all parties"". You must be blind that one of the other terms was that you're not a US citizen/resident and by contributing, you have given consensus to this case, which is enough to be used in court against you.

This is bancor thread of course ppl in here believe in bancor.  I written there 'even if the transaction not get clogged' What the team done after the clogged transaction happen, they extend the time limit to 3 hour( that not wrong at all for me becaus the cap not even reach yet at this time) and then they need to find a way to send stop order through the clogged transaction whic fail btw. So?  Any investor that dont like with that can liquidate after this. They have decided to allocate any proceeds collected in the minimum hour which exceed the hidden cap as follows:  20% will be allocated to the BNT Ether Reserve, to further improve the liquidity of BNT, which increases stability while reducing conversion costs (price slippage) for all.  80% will be locked for two years in a smart contract that will buy back BNT for 0.01 ETH (the initial price) whenever it is available, according to its calculated price. The purchased BNT will be added to the Foundation‚Äôs long-term budget, and after a 2-year period, any remaining ETH will be allocated pro-rata according to the ‚ÄúUse of Proceeds‚Äù chart in our Token Creation Terms.

We built lots of software at Appcoin. including front end marketplaces and currency governor dashboards, and piloted with dozens of communities which thrived for a time.

Over 40,000+ members Chalk: Second largest community currency in Israel, focused on middle and high school kids and operated by the National Student Assoisiation. Over 20,000+ members CampusCoin: A pilot at UC Berkeley, CA Group Market, a collection of many micro communities to create a ‚Äòfeed‚Äô of complementary currencies (still online in Israel)   Overall, we achieved nearly 1m transactions in complementary currency by ‚Äòregular‚Äô people buying actual products and services, not merely converting money for money.

I hope some people will read this.  Yehuda Levi - CTO - CoFounder Appcoin, 3years 9mo. When you go to Appcoins, it has no detail at all, not even a website, what did he do for almost 4 years ? Mati Levi - QA Engineer - 3 years at Appcoin. Same thing, what did he do ? Omry Rosenfeld - Frondend developer 1year 5mo, same question. Assaf Rachman - Full stack developer at Appcoin. same question Or Bachar - Web developer at Marketspulse for 2years 1mo. Here's the site. http://www.marketspulse.com/ It does not even have a single link in it. Could have been a bare picture with text. This was his work for 2 years ? Itay Dreyfus - UX/UI Designer for 5months at Appcoin but he links group.market app.  These are the devs. Now I'm really curious what did they do at appcoin, all I could find was https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=475160.0 It's a scamcoin from 2014 and https://www.appcoin.me/ UX/UI DESIGNER open position, no links.   Yes Appcoin seems to be scam/ project suspended. But Itay left that company. In most of the cases the UI/UX ,Developers dont even know if they are working for a scam project. But involvment of Yehuda as CTO is strange. I have no idea why nobody cares about the dev team.. I wanted to invest like 20-30 eth in this but there are just too many unanswered questions that makes the whole thing fishy. People's logic is something like this : every ICO will at least 2x and noody sells under ICO so let's invest. But they only see the winning ICOs, the majority fails. Now this will be bought in 1hour I'm sure of that so it might make profit anyway and that is pretty dangerous in the long run, it teaches people to lose their common sense/logic and throw money at everything new..(this is kinda happening all year with ICOs)",False

My issue is the amount of money going to the dev team. ~50% of funds(ETH) from ICO is going to the dev team while 10% coin to founders, team members, advisors and early contributors, is an issue for me. It shows BANCOR does not have a big economic stake in the coin, they have barely any coin when it is split amongst all those people. You would want the project you support to have the devs have a bigger stake in the coin and less in the ICO funding. They should take less money from the funding and have a bigger coin stake, due to this I will most likely not support this project. However I feel their ICO set up is not too bad, the 1 hour hype and all that marketing hype is still shill. Due to those issues I'd still put it in the ""Dev Shill Category""   In my opinion the best way to set up a project in todays' age so Whales don't buy it out and letting all participate is to set an unlimited cap over a month with proceeding less coin per round  EXAMPLE 1 ETH = 1000 BNT First Week, 1 ETH= 750 BNT Second Week, 1 ETH = 650 BNT Third Week, 1 BTH = 500 BNT Fourth Week",False

Why? If the project doesn't succeed and/or fades away over time - for any reason - then: a) 20% going to BNT Ether reserve is not a net benefit for me as an investor on the long term (2 year contract), other than pressure a price floor; b) I get 80% of tokens I can't do anything with, because if it was a success, it wouldn't issue BTN.  So in conclusion, I lose 20% + 80% of what I could have invested/traded/speculated in 2 years time of my overinvestment by said use case or worse, lose everything. By seeing the interest in this project, the possibility to fulfill the one hour term is realistic, all the while carrying the risk of 2 years without compensation and being in the dark what the status is of funding. Instead of cutting the losses on my own during this period, I've no choice but to see it all go in flames if the company is not operating anymore. Remember, this is an ICO, unlike IPO, it's unregulated without any insurance, you have no rights at all. It asks a lot of trust and what I've seen so far, is the most riskiest ico so far. To get at least the trust of investors, you have to show the cap and live update it as the funding goes from start to finish.  I've no problem to invest long term, but I want security in case something happens with the company when we're talking about large investments. That's what regulations are for. In my view, talking about large investments over 2 years time without any rights, you're out of your mind. This is the exact opposite of 'advantageous to you as an investor'. As for ICO investments: At least without this contract, you can short and cut your losses, not withstanding the lack of transparancy at the fundraising.  It's too bad, because the only crypto's I've seen so far with the greatest potential before they had manifested where Bitcoin, Ethereum, Stratis and now Bancor. The risk/reward is too high for me. Thanks again for clarifying my thoughts and feelings. It's clear as day now.",False

It will be locked for couple of days to prevent flipping.    - are any big exchanges involved?   No, the whole point of Bancor is that you do not need exchanges. You can buy (or sell) Bancor from the contract also after the ICO and not only during the ICO. The price during the ICO is one, but the price after the ICO will depend on the amount of people selling/buying. If more people want to buy than sell, the price will go up.

You misunderstand.. your BNT won't be locked up if you invest after the hidden cap is reached. They simply say that IF the hidden cap is breached within the first hour, the extra ETH capital (not your BNT) will be distributed as follows: - 20% to BNT Ether reserve - 80% will be locked in a smart contract for 2 years and used to buy BNT if the price falls below the ICO price.

Simply make an educated decision. Some people will be investing in ICO, because they simpla want to have the token already and keep it in the cold storage. Other people believe the price will go down and are planning to buy after the ICO. Others are buying half now and half after the ICO, taking the chance it will be lower after ICO and risking it might be higher. Simple as that. The devs will not change the terms at this stage.

Is the following correct? Ico lasting time = Minimum: 1 hour, Maximum: $250m / 14 days. 50% token release for early investors/contributors, 20% free as promotion and partnerships rewards, 10% for team, 20% team reserve (company). Max $250m. 1 Eth ~= $250 (let's assume and work with this value as of this example). 1 Eth => 100 Bancor (BNT) tokens. Thus: 1 BNT = $250/100 Eth = $2,50 $250m/Eth($250) = 100m Eth => 100m Eth * 100 BNT = 10b BNT. Circulating supply = 50% * 10b BNT = 5b Total supply = 10b Break-even profit point per BNT = > ($5 + total preceding costs).  If the break-even profit point is say $5,50, is it even worth to invest in this ico? I mean, 10 billion tokens is way too much for the given price of 1 BNT for 0,01 ETH. That's only 50% of the total supply, thus for 5b BNT. I don't think huge gains can be made when hit on the exchanges due to two forementioned points, while still carrying a high risk.

Stratis investors are die hard Hodl and that is the basic reason stratis is shooting up and achieveing such success. You cannot at the beginning of your ICO change the terms, because you already got enough VC backing or amazing presale. the image of the company, and the community support is what matters most in this crypto-space and not neccesarily the idea or technology.

No cap and the lemmings suffer (this will run well beyond its proper value due to the hype).  Spend time to cap it accurately and the whales and lemmings both get a piece of the pie without blowing past overvaluation.   Running 1 hour uncapped is a phenomenal move for Bancor, manageable for the whales, but BAD for the lemmings.  Whales aren't affected as much because they will hold volume nonetheless, but the real punch to the face here is going to be handed to the lemmings because they will need to chase higher yields in an already inflated market cap starting day 1.  Yeah there's the long-term investment mindset, but if the uncapped ICO goes nuts I don't see the point investing in something that will be its 5 year future value on day 1.  One thing is for certain and that's Bancor is about to get PAID. Quote from: buyethereumio on June 05, 2017, 07:06:08 PM RIP Bancor ICO Quote from: Bancorholder on June 06, 2017, 04:15:11 AM What I don't understand well is the price value of BNT when post ICO.  Right now, 1 BNT looks like it will be around $2.50 USD possibly closet to 3.00USD if ETH keep going up.  The part I don't understand is that if market cap reaches 500 million at ICO, hypothetically, then this will devalue my BNT? So 1 BNT could be worth a lot less than 2.50 USD after ICO due to more investors pumping more money? Someone explain this to me.

The name Bancor will be tarnished before it even starts. With such a high profile project, you have to know beforehand what you need to realize your product. Don't collect as much cash as possible, from with 20% or whatever goes to the devs and founders etc. And then the ""hidden"" cap... They take a large part of the reward away from the investors, heavily increase their risk, and give themselves heaps of spare cash for lamborghinis. Sometimes you have to be ""hard"" and set a cap, or find some other way. But the team saying ""we take as much money as possible"" instead of ""we need 30 mil for x, 50 mil for x+y"" is simply unprofessional.  If they don't provide a different solution, capped in one way or the other, I will sadly have to ask nicolai to return my funds.

Even though they hoarding 50% of all Bancor tokens it's not enough Quote from: idontcare on June 05, 2017, 08:28:09 PM It's a scam, stay away!!!! They have announced a price of 100 bancor / 1 eth ($2.47 @current rate) AND NO CAP. Apparently they have a ""hidden"" cap that they will stop at, letting us know when 80% is hit, but not displaying how much they have raised. This isn't an ICO it's a get rich fast scam by the bancor team. Galia said she doesn't want investors to make money and doesnt' want volatility..  Disgusting attitude and a huge let down. The investors will be lucky to get 50% of their investment back when it hits the markets. This isn't what an ICO is meant to be, as in a win-win scenario where the investors get ROI and the projects gets funding.   I was removed from the telegram group after Galia couldn't respond to my questions. This whole thing is set up so investors don't make any money and the bancor team are happy with it. Galia said it herself.  I see that on slack Eyal pasted a more refined version of the crap:  ""1. The most critical thing for us is to make sure that those who took the time to research and understand Bancor prior to the fundraiser will be able to participate. This is the reason behind the 1h minimum time.  2. This is not a fundraiser for quick-flip investors wanting to get in and make a quick profit. That is not the goal of the protocol, the foundation, the team, the product or the project.  3. A large fundraiser will mean a large reserve (more liquidity, less volatility) and more resources to make Bancor a success, which we have detailed plans to implement. More bounties, more community grants, more explanatory events, etc. We believe this is in the best interest of the contributors and the project, and we are the right team to execute this vision. For those looking to hold their tokens, which are the kind of contributors we are optimizing for, this seems to us the best configuration and we are doing careful planning for the spectrum of outcomes.  4. Re Bitcoin suisse, we created this option for those who wanted additional assistance or additional currencies with which to fund. As the terms structure was being delayed, we heard from many that they wanted to contribute no matter what, and were eager for an option to come online. There is no advantage to Bancor of having these funds come in early as they are held in escrow. There are no discounts or other contingencies. There was a preset amount allocated to this option which may or may not be filled, and has no material impact on the fundraiser nor it‚Äôs cap. It‚Äôs unfortunate to hear that some are frustrated with this option, as we truly set it up to be a helpful mechanism for those who wanted it, and to calm concerns about not getting in before we were able to share our minimum hour mechanism. This was also intended for those who knew they couldn‚Äôt be available later in the month regardless of a cap or no cap. That all said, If anyone feels slighted by the unfolding of events and would like to withdraw their ETH from bitcoin suisse, we have decided to cover the fee penalties ourselves.  5. Re Protocol in this group, we welcome all opinions. However, we insist on healthy and respectful dialogue, and will not tolerate unproductive behavior. Bancor is clearly not a scam. We can agree to disagree on points, and we can be convinced of points we‚Äôve overlooked, but we‚Äôd like to keep the discussion here constructive and not further feed the frenzy engine that has plagued so many projects before us, and prevents both us and you from getting value from this forum. We will be banning users who do not adhere to this protocol, and again we welcome respectful dialogue on all points.""  Now, let's analyse their bullshit.  1. EVERYONE is able to participate and has been able to participate for over a week via bitcoinsuisee.ch/bancor where people can pay in CFH, GBP, EUR, USD, DKK, SDG, Ether or Bitcoins, meaning the 1 hour un-limited cap is COMPLETE BS!  2. So this isn't a fund raiser the INVESTORS, the people who believe in you and want to help you secure funds so that you can get it off the ground and turn it into a viable project. The truth is this is purely for the greedy bancor team to get rich.  3. They believe that it is in the investors interest to have an UNCAPPED ICO, or as they put it with a ""hidden cap"" (LOLOLOLOLOLLOL), so that they don't make a ROI or maybe even their money back.  4. Here they are making out that investors are angry that we have bitsuisse as an option, this is BS, nobody said that. We are also told that the funds raised via bitsuisse, "" has no material impact on the fundraiser nor it‚Äôs cap"" - WTF? So regardless of how much is raised, it doesn't affect the cap? Off course it doesn't - because you don't have a cap, you will see how it goes and when the investments start slowing down you will say that you've reached 80% of your imaginary cap. IN A REGULATED MARKED THIS WOULD BE ILLEGAL.  5. If you question them or state that you are not happy with this shambles of an ICO scam they will eject you, what can I say.. disagree and you're out.. very classy.  Instead of using the ICO to raise funds to support the project, they are using it to get rich quick.   Quote from: Bancorholder on June 06, 2017, 04:24:19 PM If bancor is reading this: Just make it no cap for 15 minutes. Otherwise many will pull out. Quote from: TheMilkman on June 06, 2017, 03:49:36 PM Even Aragon decided to work with Bancor's main competitor (0x) instead of Bancor.  https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-partners-with-0x-3c8d0c9dcd84  Devs, change the ICO terms. It seems that only partnerships Bancor will be having is with those that were given free Bancor tokens. Quote from: Qiuyue201 on June 05, 2017, 04:56:08 PM Regarding ICO terms  What? Is this a joke?  Basically, we are getting an ICO that is not capped (technically during the first hour people can send 200 million or 300 million or 500 million USD which they will probably do, and the ICO will continue regardless). Aragon ICO collected 25 million in one minute, BAT even more, so Bancor can collect 900 million without a problem, good for developers and bounty hunters, not so good for investors.  Also initial CRR only 10%? With that amount collected (or any amount collected) you could definitely pick better CRR. Unless you are afraid that people will start dumping immediately. (Remember, that you can give your Bancor token back but for lower price if everyone starts selling and exchage is not required for that).  Also, why are you collecting only ETH? You should collect other ERC20 tokens too. What about collecting Wings tokens, you have partnership with them? And what about Aragon, which is one of the biggest crypto projects? Or any other ERC20 tokens? You are aiming to have token changers without those tokens?  Seriously, this is greed at it's finest. I really liked the project and now I am not cool with those terms. Change your mind and alter those terms:  - create hard cap at 100 million or lower - accept other tokens (perhaps 10 million USD in various tokens that will sum up to 100 million) - change the CRR  I think that most of us were expecting capping it high, at 100 million or even higher, but time capping the ICO is same as not capping it at all. Quote from: TheMilkman on June 05, 2017, 04:58:18 PM I have to agree. It's like accepting all the ETH that is sent your way. It is cool to get in but if everyone is getting in and there is no limit, the coin will not give investors profits. Quote from: Qiuyue201 on June 05, 2017, 05:39:21 PM Quote from: bitcircle on June 05, 2017, 05:33:52 PM When this secret will be revealed about that unspecific hard cap what is limit there if all coins sold out during 1st hours than we will able to know about that how many tokens will be created during sale round?  It is irrelevant beacuse everyone will send their money during the first hour and all that money will be accepted. This is why this ICO is badly constructed. It's like having uncapped ICO. They should add hard cap limit of 100 million or lower. Otherwise the contract can accept 100 million, 200 million, 300 million or any amount sent. This way one whale can buy huge percentage of coins, which is exactly opposite that we would like. The coin will be dominated by huge players. Quote from: Bought1.5MilXVG@60sat on June 05, 2017, 06:17:49 PM Not a fan of this uncapped ICO either... ...then again, maybe many people will stay passive and not send their ETH until just before the 1 hour limit to see if/when the cap gets revealed?  I am definitely mad that I paid the Bitcoin Suisse Fees for nothing Quote from: jayohby on June 05, 2017, 06:40:18 PM guys.. uncapped ICO?  come on..  not gonna send my ETH For that... but gonna get my bounties tho~ Quote from: Bancorholder on June 06, 2017, 03:51:02 PM I emailed Bitcoin Suisse to refund me all my ETH.

Quote from: topesis on June 08, 2017, 05:03:59 AM This is going to be over sold and a long term investment in my opinion and could dump when listed on the exchange because the price seems to be quite high around $2 per tokens. Quote from: lokojones on June 08, 2017, 02:13:41 PM I don't think Bancor is a good deal - 2.6$ per coin for ICO only with white paper? what if they screw up or delay project? DUMP, same happened to lisk and waves both ended up under ICO price.  Tonnes of n00bs here, read weak hands - plenty of them will exit under solid pressure when shit hit the fan:)  I will wait... exactly the same happened to golem and I got them for 30% below ICO  Secondly ETH is in parabolic mode, so most likely you will loose money from day 1 anyway and no cap mean lots of whales ready to dump on you when they realize they don't hold majority of coins and are not able to control the market - they will be force to short.  What you think? Quote from: sud on June 06, 2017, 10:38:33 AM I was waiting for this ICO with excitement, but know have mixed feelings. 2.5$ for a token is pretty high and in 1 hour millions ETH could be transferred.  I have to rethink if I should participate in ICO. Quote from: TheRedDevil on June 05, 2017, 07:21:01 PM Looking forward to the ICO very much. That minimum 1 hour time period is really tricky..

That is definitely interesting, and should ease some of the concerns around a mad rush for the ICO.  It seems there will be no way the price will drop below ICO price. That way it is more likely the ICO will be finished in an hour.  Interesting so it basically makes this a virtually risk free ICO. Thats bound to create a lot of pumping once the ICO is over. I wonder if they could also be the first ICO to generate over a hundred million dollars.  It would still be possible for the price to drop below 0.01 ETH.  For example, let's say the hidden cap is 250k ETH, and it raises 300k ETH in the first hour.  That's +50k ETH above the hidden cap.  (50k ETH)*0.80 = 40k ETH would go into a buyback pool.  The buyback pool would be big enough to absorb 400k BNT.  After that, the pool would be empty and price could drop below 0.01 ETH After reading those kind of messages, well, I think it's normal to have doubts about investing on this ICO. I would like to trust this ICO, but I see too many people talking about a potential post-ICO price drop, that's why I'm asking about it, to read what potential investors think.",False

I understand that price might dump abit because of some bounty dumps/whale pump/dumps etc, but its very natural and every coin go trough dump periods sometimes. If project delivers everything and It will make success in a short time then price will follow for sure because Investors will jump in and token grows in value!

It makes sense to analyze ethereum tokens using their ETH ratio as reference because they are stored in the same addresses and exposed to the same underlying risk of the Ethereum blockchain as an ETH holding.  Ethereum tokens also have ETH trading pairs on several exchanges.   Quote from: jakev on June 06, 2017, 05:05:11 PM I think it's important to understand how the Protocol will function before making rudimentary assessments of the crowdsale structure. If one actually reads and comprehends the whitepaper, it will be understood that the more value that goes into the protocol, the better. More capital to support projects and fund the initial token changers will allow for the initial Bancor network mesh to be much stronger.  A limited cap is essential when the main use of proceeds are for application development. If that is the case, there is no essential use for all of the other capital, which could be considered greedy. The app should be built. Revenue should be generated that should make the project sustainable without excess capital. This is not the case with Bancor, which is a protocol with a v1 that is essentially already built and is a tool that provides/creates liquidity.  Regarding CRR, keep in mind that all other tokens until this point have no CRR. That means that no matter what Bancor chose as their reserve, the instant liquidity is something no one else has ever provided.  I would totally agree with this, if it wasn't for the fact that only 30% of the ETH raised goes toward CRR and seeding token changers.  https://blog.bancor.network/bancor-network-token-bnt-contribution-token-creation-terms-48cc85a63812",False

The most critical thing for us is to make sure that those who took the time to research and understand Bancor prior to the fundraiser will be able to participate. This is the reason behind the 1h minimum time.  2. This is not a fundraiser for quick-flip investors wanting to get in and make a quick profit. That is not the goal of the protocol, the foundation, the team, the product or the project.  3. A large fundraiser will mean a large reserve (more liquidity, less volatility) and more resources to make Bancor a success, which we have detailed plans to implement. More bounties, more community grants, more explanatory events, etc. We believe this is in the best interest of the contributors and the project, and we are the right team to execute this vision. For those looking to hold their tokens, which are the kind of contributors we are optimizing for, this seems to us the best configuration and we are doing careful planning for the spectrum of outcomes.  4. Re Bitcoin suisse, we created this option for those who wanted additional assistance or additional currencies with which to fund. As the terms structure was being delayed, we heard from many that they wanted to contribute no matter what, and were eager for an option to come online. There is no advantage to Bancor of having these funds come in early as they are held in escrow. There are no discounts or other contingencies. There was a preset amount allocated to this option which may or may not be filled, and has no material impact on the fundraiser nor it‚Äôs cap. It‚Äôs unfortunate to hear that some are frustrated with this option, as we truly set it up to be a helpful mechanism for those who wanted it, and to calm concerns about not getting in before we were able to share our minimum hour mechanism. This was also intended for those who knew they couldn‚Äôt be available later in the month regardless of a cap or no cap. That all said, If anyone feels slighted by the unfolding of events and would like to withdraw their ETH from bitcoin suisse, we have decided to cover the fee penalties ourselves.  5. Re Protocol in this group, we welcome all opinions. However, we insist on healthy and respectful dialogue, and will not tolerate unproductive behavior. Bancor is clearly not a scam. We can agree to disagree on points, and we can be convinced of points we‚Äôve overlooked, but we‚Äôd like to keep the discussion here constructive and not further feed the frenzy engine that has plagued so many projects before us, and prevents both us and you from getting value from this forum. We will be banning users who do not adhere to this protocol, and again we welcome respectful dialogue on all points.""  Now, let's analyse their bullshit.  1. EVERYONE is able to participate and has been able to participate for over a week via bitcoinsuisee.ch/bancor where people can pay in CFH, GBP, EUR, USD, DKK, SDG, Ether or Bitcoins, meaning the 1 hour un-limited cap is COMPLETE BS!  2. So this isn't a fund raiser the INVESTORS, the people who believe in you and want to help you secure funds so that you can get it off the ground and turn it into a viable project. The truth is this is purely for the greedy bancor team to get rich.  3. They believe that it is in the investors interest to have an UNCAPPED ICO, or as they put it with a ""hidden cap"" (LOLOLOLOLOLLOL), so that they don't make a ROI or maybe even their money back. 4. Here they are making out that investors are angry that we have bitsuisse as an option, this is BS, nobody said that. We are also told that the funds raised via bitsuisse, "" has no material impact on the fundraiser nor it‚Äôs cap"" - WTF? So regardless of how much is raised, it doesn't affect the cap? Off course it doesn't - because you don't have a cap, you will see how it goes and when the investments start slowing down you will say that you've reached 80% of your imaginary cap. IN A REGULATED MARKED THIS WOULD BE ILLEGAL.  5. If you question them or state that you are not happy with this shambles of an ICO scam they will eject you, what can I say.. disagree and you're out.. very classy. Instead of using the ICO to raise funds to support the project, they are using it to get rich quick.  I've read in previous messages in this thread how some people were not happy about this ""hidden cap"" issue either. But at the same time I'm reading good things and many people are saying that they will invest on this (not just here, but also in other message boards), so I'm not sure what to think.    BTW, english is not my native language, so sorry if my english is not correct sometimes.  ",False

A limited cap is essential when the main use of proceeds are for application development. If that is the case, there is no essential use for all of the other capital, which could be considered greedy. The app should be built. Revenue should be generated that should make the project sustainable without excess capital. This is not the case with Bancor, which is a protocol with a v1 that is essentially already built and is a tool that provides/creates liquidity.  Regarding CRR, keep in mind that all other tokens until this point have no CRR. That means that no matter what Bancor chose as their reserve, the instant liquidity is something no one else has ever provided.      Quote from: Lankster on June 06, 2017, 04:51:51 PM So where exactly does the difference lie between 0x and Bancor?  Anyone? 0x is building something very different than Bancor. They serve different functions. 0x completely decentralized exchanges. Bancor removing exchanges completely. Aragon focused more on corporations, while Bancor is more communities. There is also a lot of room in the space right now for many projects to succeed even if they were ""competitors"". Aragon partnering with another project doesn't have a correlation here.",False

A small amount of the BNT is allocated to that pool so that there is an option for fiat investment.

From there, anyone will be able to liquidate/create new BNT, starting at the ICO price and changing with every transaction. Now, it is unlikely that many people will be liquidating the BNT they just bought, and any who missed the BNT ICO but still want in will be able to create new BNT (by increasing the ETH reserve and thereby the price of BNT for all who hold it). So the price is backed by the reserve and based on supply and demand, from day 1.  4) Yes, funds raised via btcsuisee don't effect cap, because we've already allocated a number of BNT for it.

They have announced a price of 100 bancor / 1 eth ($2.47 @current rate) AND NO CAP. Apparently they have a ""hidden"" cap that they will stop at, letting us know when 80% is hit, but not displaying how much they have raised. This isn't an ICO it's a get rich fast scam by the bancor team. Galia said she doesn't want investors to make money and doesnt' want volatility..  Disgusting attitude and a huge let down. The investors will be lucky to get 50% of their investment back when it hits the markets. This isn't what an ICO is meant to be, as in a win-win scenario where the investors get ROI and the projects gets funding.   I was removed from the telegram group after Galia couldn't respond to my questions. This whole thing is set up so investors don't make any money and the bancor team are happy with it. Galia said it herself.  I see that on slack Eyal pasted a more refined version of the crap:  ""1. The most critical thing for us is to make sure that those who took the time to research and understand Bancor prior to the fundraiser will be able to participate. This is the reason behind the 1h minimum time.  2. This is not a fundraiser for quick-flip investors wanting to get in and make a quick profit. That is not the goal of the protocol, the foundation, the team, the product or the project.  3. A large fundraiser will mean a large reserve (more liquidity, less volatility) and more resources to make Bancor a success, which we have detailed plans to implement. More bounties, more community grants, more explanatory events, etc. We believe this is in the best interest of the contributors and the project, and we are the right team to execute this vision. For those looking to hold their tokens, which are the kind of contributors we are optimizing for, this seems to us the best configuration and we are doing careful planning for the spectrum of outcomes.  4. Re Bitcoin suisse, we created this option for those who wanted additional assistance or additional currencies with which to fund. As the terms structure was being delayed, we heard from many that they wanted to contribute no matter what, and were eager for an option to come online. There is no advantage to Bancor of having these funds come in early as they are held in escrow. There are no discounts or other contingencies. There was a preset amount allocated to this option which may or may not be filled, and has no material impact on the fundraiser nor it‚Äôs cap. It‚Äôs unfortunate to hear that some are frustrated with this option, as we truly set it up to be a helpful mechanism for those who wanted it, and to calm concerns about not getting in before we were able to share our minimum hour mechanism. This was also intended for those who knew they couldn‚Äôt be available later in the month regardless of a cap or no cap. That all said, If anyone feels slighted by the unfolding of events and would like to withdraw their ETH from bitcoin suisse, we have decided to cover the fee penalties ourselves.  5. Re Protocol in this group, we welcome all opinions. However, we insist on healthy and respectful dialogue, and will not tolerate unproductive behavior. Bancor is clearly not a scam. We can agree to disagree on points, and we can be convinced of points we‚Äôve overlooked, but we‚Äôd like to keep the discussion here constructive and not further feed the frenzy engine that has plagued so many projects before us, and prevents both us and you from getting value from this forum. We will be banning users who do not adhere to this protocol, and again we welcome respectful dialogue on all points.""  Now, let's analyse their bullshit.  1. EVERYONE is able to participate and has been able to participate for over a week via bitcoinsuisee.ch/bancor where people can pay in CFH, GBP, EUR, USD, DKK, SDG, Ether or Bitcoins, meaning the 1 hour un-limited cap is COMPLETE BS!  2. So this isn't a fund raiser the INVESTORS, the people who believe in you and want to help you secure funds so that you can get it off the ground and turn it into a viable project. The truth is this is purely for the greedy bancor team to get rich.  3. They believe that it is in the investors interest to have an UNCAPPED ICO, or as they put it with a ""hidden cap"" (LOLOLOLOLOLLOL), so that they don't make a ROI or maybe even their money back.  4. Here they are making out that investors are angry that we have bitsuisse as an option, this is BS, nobody said that. We are also told that the funds raised via bitsuisse, "" has no material impact on the fundraiser nor it‚Äôs cap"" - WTF? So regardless of how much is raised, it doesn't affect the cap? Off course it doesn't - because you don't have a cap, you will see how it goes and when the investments start slowing down you will say that you've reached 80% of your imaginary cap. IN A REGULATED MARKED THIS WOULD BE ILLEGAL.  5. If you question them or state that you are not happy with this shambles of an ICO scam they will eject you, what can I say.. disagree and you're out.. very classy.  Instead of using the ICO to raise funds to support the project, they are using it to get rich quick.",False

Is this a joke?  Basically, we are getting an ICO that is not capped (technically during the first hour people can send 200 million or 300 million or 500 million USD which they will probably do, and the ICO will continue regardless). Aragon ICO collected 25 million in one minute, BAT even more, so Bancor can collect 900 million without a problem, good for developers and bounty hunters, not so good for investors.  Also initial CRR only 10%? With that amount collected (or any amount collected) you could definitely pick better CRR. Unless you are afraid that people will start dumping immediately. (Remember, that you can give your Bancor token back but for lower price if everyone starts selling and exchage is not required for that).  Also, why are you collecting only ETH? You should collect other ERC20 tokens too. What about collecting Wings tokens, you have partnership with them? And what about Aragon, which is one of the biggest crypto projects? Or any other ERC20 tokens? You are aiming to have token changers without those tokens?  Seriously, this is greed at it's finest. I really liked the project and now I am not cool with those terms. Change your mind and alter those terms:  - create hard cap at 100 million or lower - accept other tokens (perhaps 10 million USD in various tokens that will sum up to 100 million) - change the CRR  I think that most of us were expecting capping it high, at 100 million or even higher, but time capping the ICO is same as not capping it at all.",False

Bancor team is saying that they are getting rid of liquidity problem. But isn't any coin liquid at some point? If I have some not so popular asset, I could simply dump it on the market. Doesn't Bancor algoritm simply do something similar? Yes, every asset will be liquid now but probably not at the price that user would like it to be.

Ours will be much higher. Also, a 1% reserve is equivalent to a 1% market depth in an exchange (the use case is very similar), and with 1% market depth is a big exchange. Its not fractional reserve because the value of a smart token is not based on the value of its reserve tokens. They're just there so the smart token's contract can trade autonomously and therefore keep its token fully liquid.  Two, the reason that BNT will be the preferred reserve currency is network effects: The more smart tokens that use BNT tokens in reserve (which will be the default setting for smart token creation in any Bancor developed or financed software service), the more valuable and more in-demand the BNT token becomes. As the value of BANCOR rises, so too does the value of every smart token holding BNT in reserve. And, because we‚Äôre both the most knowledgeable about the technology behind the Bancor protocol and have first mover advantage in building on it (including over a year working with a large developer team on building the first Bancor software service UX, seeding token changers, high-potential community currencies, and popular token baskets with BNT tokens), anyone forking would need the economic incentive and the ability to surpass what we‚Äôve built, or else will have created an inferior network with little incentive for others to use it.  (This can be compared to Ethereum, where the success of any solution that uses ETH appreciates Ether value, benefiting the entire Ethereum network).",False

Their competitive aspect lies in the fact that both Bancor & Waves aim to be the creation medium behind a whole slew of new tokens representing countless new types of value.  Bancor has two major differences to Waves here:  The first is that Bancor tokens are fully liquid from day one. So even if its some tiny token that never aims to become worth millions or be traded on a large scale... it's still always immediately exchangeable for any other coin or token on the entire Bancor network (including ETH and every major ERC20 token)  Waves has their decentralized exchange, of course, but it still requires that you find a second party to trade with, which rules out small-market-cap tokens.  The second is that Bancor is build on Ethereum tech. At the moment, that means we're backed by a more developed & successful blockchain, and therefore have a larger set of currencies and of users to launch with.  However should Waves succeed and become a widely used blockchain of tokens, the two can indirectly collaborate. Tokens on both Ethereum and Waves blockchains can be 1:1 tokenized for each other. Waves Token backed ERC20 tokens could use the Bancor network for liquidity & as reserve tokens.",False

Bancor is different in that it provides a standard for building your own index funds which you hold directly with the smart token. Initially on the Ethereum blockchain but eventually across blockchains.   Our past companies had 50 million and 10 million active users respectively. Our mission is to bring cryptocurrencies to 100's of millions of consumers and help democratize credit creation. We have been working on Bancor with 7 developers and a battle tested team for approx 18 months. In that time, we‚Äôve built the infrastructure we need to address some of the toughest challenges in the mass market adoption of cryptocurrencies. You can get a sense of the platform with our bounty program (bounty.bancor.network), we will try to release a full alpha with user-generated currency bots on a private testnet in the next few days and our development roadmap (including recent accomplishments) is now available: LINK   We can't share specifics just yet, but we are currently integrating credit card payment processing solutions to make the process of getting into the space the simplest it can be from an end user perspective. In the end, our passion is in the creation of consumer end-user Internet applications that connect between technology and culture. We intend to apply the best practices we learned building internet scale startups in the past to our work today on Bancor.   Bancor will be available on every smart-contract blockchain platform with enough traction. It‚Äôs somehow similar to a consideration of building iPhone vs. Android versions native apps - it‚Äôs important to be available where the users (existing and potential) are. As long as assets from one blockchain can be moved and represented on another blockchain -- then Bancor can work between them.    1. You can take the smart token code (available on our website) and create smart tokens. We will provide a simple to use user interface to do it at app.bancor.network (not available now, but preview will be available soon) 2. we will cover the initial smart token creation transaction fee as it is all quite experimental at this point. I don‚Äôt have the exact gas cost for each type right now, but i‚Äôll look into that and get back to you.   Our goal is democratize credit creation and unlock the long tail of user generated currencies. We believe this can bring a paradigm shift in money creation and help end poverty :wink: to not sound to unreasonable and wishful. We also believe that an asynchronous autonomous exchange will be extremely competitive and offer an alternative to all the exchanges currently out there (including the new decentralized protocols)   The token will be released after the token sale however it will be a few more weeks until we release the Bancor protocol functionality and it will become intrinsically tradeable.

On the contrary. By holding a reserve balance which preserves a constant ratio to the market-cap, the price volatility of smart tokens is not subject to the current market depth since the reserve functions as a predictable and controlled alternative to the traditional order book which normally provides market depth. We‚Äôve seen that regular exchanges generally hold around 1% market depth, meaning that any smart token with a CRR above 1% could be relatively more  This is total BS! According to your own formula, at 1% fractional reserve, changing supply by 1% will change the price by 150%. Is not this volatile??? Yeah right, the formula for price change is deterministic, but a trade is a random event, and any function of random event is a random variable. With low fractional reserve your tokens are going to be as volatile as any low volume tokens on exchanges.",False

Their competitive aspect lies in the fact that both Bancor & Waves aim to be the creation medium behind a whole slew of new tokens representing countless new types of value. Bancor has two major differences to Waves here:   The first is that Bancor tokens are fully liquid from day one. So even if its some tiny token that never aims to become worth millions or be traded on a large scale... it's still always immediately exchangeable for any other coin or token on the entire Bancor network (including ETH and every major ERC20 token)   Waves has their decentralized exchange, of course, but it still requires that you find a second party to trade with, which rules out small-market-cap tokens.   The second is that Bancor is build on Ethereum tech. We don't compete with ETH at all, we are a use case of ETH-built technologies and coins. At the moment, that means we're backed by a more developed & successful blockchain, and therefore have a larger set of currencies and of users to launch with.   However should Waves succeed and become a widely used blockchain of tokens, the two can indirectly collaborate. Tokens on both Ethereum and Waves blockchains can be 1:1 tokenized for each other. Waves Token backed ERC20 tokens could use the Bancor network for liquidity & as reserve tokens.",False

The robot has two (or more) wallets. One wallet is full of an asset (let's choose ETH for this example). The other is a bottomless wallet of a new asset (IMC, in this case).   When you create the robot, you give it a CRR (Constant Reserve Ratio). This is the percentage of total value that the robot assigns the total-individual-value of each of its wallets. It will use this CRR (which is a % between >0 and 100) to determine the price IMC relative to ETH.  Here's how. Let's say the CRR for this Robot is 20% ETH and 80% IMC (of which there are currently 100 in existence out in the world). If it has 1000 ETH in its wallet, the cost of 1 IMC follows this equation: Price = Marketcap / supply   Market Cap = Reserve Balance / CRR = 1000 ETH / 0.2   So Market Cap is 5000 ETH   Price of IMC = Marketcap / Supply = 5000 / 100   1 IMC = 50 ETH   Now there is a larger reserve balance of ETH, thereby increasing the price of IMC for the next buyer.   The next NewCoin would cost (1050/0.2)/101 = 51.9802 ETH  Now all of this gives value to the coin in terms of price discovery... but IMC has to itself have value or else everyone will liquidate it for ETH and it will die. So the value is created by, just like any currency, some external source. But trading is created by the reserve currency.",False

Participating in an ICO merely involves transferring some cryptocurrency (mostly Bitcoin/Ethereum) to a specified address. You should be able to do this in Exodus. The ICO folks have a way to keep track of who invested with what amount (to that end, they may make you create a unique ICO account). They give you an amount of ICO cryptocurrency depending on your share of the total amount received by them (some ICOs have a cap on investment, while some are open).  2. Please make sure you do a lot of reading about the project. This site, ICO reviews on Youtube, discussions on Steemit, reddit; are a good starting point. Unfortunately, there is a lot of 'meaningless ranting/currency-bashing', but there are surely gems of advice hidden between them.  3. Bear in mind that altcoins are receiving a lot of new attention and everyone is looking to make a fortune. Please make sure you don't get carried away and invest with whatever you can afford to lose. If you've been following the action in the recent weeks, the price-action in cryptos is very volatile.  Hope you end up supporting some good ideas & end up rich too",False

There is a small (standard) fee involved, specified on the website. They are also able to hold your tokens for you until you want to receive possession of them. They are very reliable and have a great reputation in the industry and among other token sale teams.  We entered into this partnership with Bitcoin Suisse to make the token sale more accessible and allow those who wish to be involved to guarantee their place even before the start date.  The remainder of the details coming soon... and in the meantime here is the link for contributions:  https://www.bitcoinsuisse.ch/bancor/  Please note, regretfully, due to regulatory uncertainties, this service is currently available to NON US citizens only",False

While not a game changing cryptocurrency (it's just building on Etherium) it seems to solve an issue I've had with crypto for a while (having to deal with exchanges that can manipulate trading or disappear with all your coins, like MTGOX or Cryptsy).

Or that date also not a confirm one yet?  For all newcomers and interested ppl the official statement about ico-details:  Quote from: Orr on May 16, 2017, 05:58:24 AM Dear community!  It's been a busy day at Bancor with big developments and decisions.  We've decided to delay the announcement of the token launch event details, and maybe the token launch date itself by a few weeks, due to a few main considerations, that we hope you'll find exciting.  1. We have received interest from a few highly relevant advisors, world renowned experts in their fields, to join our team and advisory board in very significant capacities. We want to bring these agreements to conclusion and share them with you in order to complete the picture of the full scope of the project and its guidance counsel.  2. We hear you loud and clear regarding the need for more streamlined and digestible messaging and content to share with you, your networks and the world. We've heard this from all corners of the globe and are in process of creating the relevant materials. We agree that this would be very helpful in making sure as many people as possible understand and appreciate the innovation and opportunity in the Bancor protocol, token and product, and that this is an essential first step before then unpacking the token launch event details.  3. Because the BANCOR token is the Genesis smart token, it operates slightly differently (and with profound implications) than tokens that have launched before. This means we're taking extra time to onboard all the relevant service providers and stake holders to make sure everyone in the process deeply understands the new dynamics and can build the most appropriate structures for contributors and users accordingly. It also means we want to double and triple verify that the structures achieve the desired incentive alignment to ensure the maximum success of the model, including all edge cases, so that Bancor can achieve its goal of creating a sound liquidity solution for years to come. We want to give these processes a few more cycles to complete, and there has been much to learn from over recent weeks.  It is with tremendous respect that we thank you for all your great questions so far, as they've certainly helped us hone in and refine the solution. We hope we can reward you with tokens of our appreciation )  In the meantime we ask for your patience as we announce further updates this week, in regards to the new advisors, detail and launch timelines, and some really solid partnerships that have been in the works. We really can't wait to share.  With love and liquidity, The Bancor team  Also:  Galia recently ""We know everyone's awaiting on the big announcements and we're getting everything in order for a proper reveal later this week. Please stay tuned and in meantime any discussion about the protocol, use cases, questions, partners, ecosystem developments etc. are more than welcome...""",False

See, when you make a trade with a smart token contract, the price is calculated as if you made an infinite amount of very tiny trades. With each tiny trade, the price for the next goes up slightly. So, if you try to pump or dump, the price will rise with the size of your order & you'll wind up paying a price that takes into account the amount you've bought/sold.

It's been a busy day at Bancor with big developments and decisions.  We've decided to delay the announcement of the token launch event details, and maybe the token launch date itself by a few weeks, due to a few main considerations, that we hope you'll find exciting.  1. We have received interest from a few highly relevant advisors, world renowned experts in their fields, to join our team and advisory board in very significant capacities. We want to bring these agreements to conclusion and share them with you in order to complete the picture of the full scope of the project and its guidance counsel.  2. We hear you loud and clear regarding the need for more streamlined and digestible messaging and content to share with you, your networks and the world. We've heard this from all corners of the globe and are in process of creating the relevant materials. We agree that this would be very helpful in making sure as many people as possible understand and appreciate the innovation and opportunity in the Bancor protocol, token and product, and that this is an essential first step before then unpacking the token launch event details.  3. Because the BANCOR token is the Genesis smart token, it operates slightly differently (and with profound implications) than tokens that have launched before. This means we're taking extra time to onboard all the relevant service providers and stake holders to make sure everyone in the process deeply understands the new dynamics and can build the most appropriate structures for contributors and users accordingly. It also means we want to double and triple verify that the structures achieve the desired incentive alignment to ensure the maximum success of the model, including all edge cases, so that Bancor can achieve its goal of creating a sound liquidity solution for years to come. We want to give these processes a few more cycles to complete, and there has been much to learn from over recent weeks.  It is with tremendous respect that we thank you for all your great questions so far, as they've certainly helped us hone in and refine the solution. We hope we can reward you with tokens of our appreciation )  In the meantime we ask for your patience as we announce further updates this week, in regards to the new advisors, detail and launch timelines, and some really solid partnerships that have been in the works. We really can't wait to share.  With love and liquidity, The Bancor team",False

Also what is important, if they indeed make the ICO capped too high, simply less people will invest. For example, capping the ICO at 50 million and making it last couple weeks, will make them gather for example 10 million, but capping the ICO at 15 million, would make them gather 15 million. Great example is Wings. They gathered only 2 millions (now are worth much more), because their ICO last couple of weeks and was capped to high. If Wings was 10 million capped ICO they would easily gather that sum. Let's hope Bancor does not make the same mistake as Wings.

This means any Hodls holder will be able to instantly convert their Hodls to BANCOR. In the background, what happens is that the Hodls are send to its Smart Contract, which destroys the Hodls and pulls our BANCOR from the Hodls reserve according to the Hodl/BANCOR price.

Reserves are essentially common pools that provide liquidity to their smart token holders. The current solution for liquidity is based on market orders on the different exchanges (and in some cases, in different currencies pairs). If you measure the size of these current ""liquidity pools"" (aka as ""market depth""), relative to the market-cap of the currency, and compare the event where similar amounts are unloaded to the market through the exchanges vs. through a smart token with 10% reserve, you would probably find out that the market behaves in a much more stable way using the smart token, since there is a single common liquidity pool, which is growing relative to the market cap of the smart token.  It can be tricky to wrap the mind around it since this is a model for linking between currencies which is quite different than the one being used today and for a long time now, and I really hope my attempt to explain it was clear enough.

Like the BANCOR smart token contract, and countless possible community/company/project based currencies. Or tokens to be used to buy a specific thing, with the price increasing as demand does (like tickets to a show, or a freelancer's personal currency that goes up as demand does). - Make it possible exchange ANY currency for ANY other currency on the bancor, instantly, even if said currencies have such small trading volumes that you'd usually have trouble finding a buyer/seller (thereby enabling an explosion of small-market-cap cryptocurrencies alike to how Youtube enabled an explosion of video content). These are the Token Changer smart tokens. They can also take a fee which is added to their reserves (thereby increasing market depth and decreasing volatility for higher-volume trades) that increases the value of the Token Changer smart token itself (so that owning one of these is kind of like owning a share in a mini-exchange). - Make it possible to create a smart token that holds multiple other tokens in reserves at pre-set CRRs (so that it is always re-balancing it's holdings to keep the each reserve token's value at the % of total smart token value you desire). This is the ETF use case. These can be combined with Token Changers.  That's just a few of the cooler use cases. There's more in our whitepaper, our upcoming FAQ, and the future's store of innovative use case ideas no one has had yet (alike to how Bancor is an innovative use case of Ethereum).  - explain about exchanges between tokens, how the BANCOR smart token type is just one type (the type that creates a new currency)",False

The reason that smart tokens can still be liquid with tiny reserves is that, when you buy/sell a smart token (or its reserve tokens) the price is calculated as if you sold an infinitely large amount of micro transactions that equal the same total amount. For every micro transaction you do, the price for the next goes up (as with every supply/demand system). So if supply were to grow smaller, the price of each smart token would decrease proportionally. The token would stay liquid, it would just decrease in value.  If demand were such that the price is no longer 'reasonable' to enough people, demand would go down and said price would stop rising (or fall, if demand went low enough that there are now more people selling than buying).

The biggest reason that Bancor is better than exchanges is that EVERY conceivable currency in the world, even small ones like community currencies and loyalty points and in-game currencies, will be fully liquid. Exchanges only make currencies with high trading volumes liquid. With Bancor, the long-tail of currencies can be created (alike to how youtube enabled the long tail of videos, how Instagram enabled the long tail of photography, etc.).  There's also the fact that trading on Bancor will be cheaper than on exchanges (no/low fees), that you can create smart tokens that serve as token baskets (kind of like ETFs), and that it is decentralized and therefore cannot be DDoS'd or otherwise easily attacked.",False

It's been a busy day at Bancor with big developments and decisions.  We've decided to delay the announcement of the token launch event details, and maybe the token launch date itself by a few weeks, due to a few main considerations, that we hope you'll find exciting.  1. We have received interest from a few highly relevant advisors, world renowned experts in their fields, to join our team and advisory board in very significant capacities. We want to bring these agreements to conclusion and share them with you in order to complete the picture of the full scope of the project and its guidance counsel.  2. We hear you loud and clear regarding the need for more streamlined and digestible messaging and content to share with you, your networks and the world. We've heard this from all corners of the globe and are in process of creating the relevant materials. We agree that this would be very helpful in making sure as many people as possible understand and appreciate the innovation and opportunity in the Bancor protocol, token and product, and that this is an essential first step before then unpacking the token launch event details.  3. Because the BANCOR token is the Genesis smart token, it operates slightly differently (and with profound implications) than tokens that have launched before. This means we're taking extra time to onboard all the relevant service providers and stake holders to make sure everyone in the process deeply understands the new dynamics and can build the most appropriate structures for contributors and users accordingly. It also means we want to double and triple verify that the structures achieve the desired incentive alignment to ensure the maximum success of the model, including all edge cases, so that Bancor can achieve its goal of creating a sound liquidity solution for years to come. We want to give these processes a few more cycles to complete, and there has been much to learn from over recent weeks.  It is with tremendous respect that we thank you for all your great questions so far, as they've certainly helped us hone in and refine the solution. We hope we can reward you with tokens of our appreciation )  In the meantime we ask for your patience as we announce further updates this week, in regards to the new advisors, detail and launch timelines, and some really solid partnerships that have been in the works.

The ICO is not capped. Why would you do this? I understand you would like to have more funding and also to have bigger reserves for the tokens, but uncapped ICOs are not attractive for investors. For example Wings (which is a great project) gathered only 2000 BTC beacuse it was uncapped (despite the fact it was highly promoted) but other projects that were capped at 5 million or 6 million gathered way more than Wings. Cap the ICO at 5 million, 6 million or even 10 million but please do it, it will only benefit the project.  2. I looked at the bounties timeline and figured out that ICO will probably last from 30th May till 30th June, which is also too long. Most people back the project either in the first couple of days or last minute. Look at some great ethereum projects that lasted much shorter and were very successful. Inbetween launch of presale and the end of presale nothing happens. Of course capping the ICO would solve this problem since the goal would be reached quicker anyway.  My idea for the ICO is: make it last for 2 weeks or 6 million market cap, whichever comes first.",False

With Bancor's ability to generate community currencies and ""token baskets"" there will be many users who are not extremely cryptosavvy on the protocol. Thanks to the very clean UI presented through Bancor (and partnerships with Status) users will be able to operate effectively on the crypto side of things. Effective gateways back into fiat is kind of difficult (for the time being) and partnering with TokenCard is a great way to make that happen.  Also here are some questions that haven't yet been answered on here that I wanted to quickly address (with more detailed responses coming soon):  ""Will you be having a hard cap? That shows to me the team is confident with a set figure of funds."" Completely understand this perspective and in most cases, I would agree that a hard cap is a great model for funding these projects. With Bancor, it is important to realize that they have created (or at least executed) a unique model where the funds from the sale will partially be used to fund other projects on the Bancor protocol. This foundational support for other projects will be a large component of Bancor's value. The more that they are able to support, the better.  Will you be having escrow? And if so who will be doing escrow for you. There has not been an escrow agent designated at this time.  The company is a nonprofit? Bprotocol is the foundation in Switzerland. There may be a revenue model in the future that is essentially SaaS to deploy tokens on the protocol.    I would highly recommend testing out the UI on the website. It is a very cool experience!",False

For anyone not aware, there are several competing services in development that intent to offer decentralized exchanges, Shapeshift is rumored to be working on one as well  Bancor is well position by introducing a social platform (have a look at the demo guys ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFtA-oELm6w"") with a user friendly mobile/desktop application to issue tokens/assets. A roadmap is not available on the website or whitepaper, but they'll probably give more information within the coming days. Building an entire ecosystem around Bancor is great, offering an easy way to introduce tokens/currencies/assets to the long-tail might be just what will differentiates Bancor from other upcoming decentralized exchanges  Can't wait for the bounty announcement  PS 1: I'd love to assist with the campaign management of the project (please send me a PM) PS 2: Galia, marry me (please send me a PM)",False

As this is a new concept, it can sometimes be confusing, which is exactly why we appreciate feedback such as yours as it helps us to improve the system and our messaging.  Firstly, we are most certainly not trying give coins/tokens an artificial value by simply making them a derivative of something that has market value. Rather, we are leveraging the new reality of decentralized smart-contract enabled blockchains, in which for the first time in history, software agents can hold money in a trust-less environment. This enables us to address the ""Double Coincidence of Wants Problem"" in currency/asset exchange in a new and novel way. If a token created using the Bancor Protocol has no utility or value in and of itself, the reserve will not provide value, in fact it will very quickly be drained and the price of the token vis-a-vis the reserve currency will collapse to near zero.  As a background analogy, before the advent of writing, a Double Coincidence of Wants problem existed in the domain of information exchange between humans. You needed to be in the same place, at the same time, to share information. You could solve this problem with labor (passing information by word of mouth) but eventually writing provided a technological solution separating the moment information is produced and consumed. The same Double Coincidence of Wants exists in Barter, where the chances of finding someone with exact opposite wants in real-time is low. Money provided a technological solution, enabling the buying and selling to happen at different times with the money acting as a tool enabling barter over time and space.  However, in the domain of currency exchange, we still have a Double Coincidence of Wants, where a bid/ask is required. Exchanges/orderbooks/speculators providing matchmaking/liquidity have been the mechanism (""labor"") to address this issue for the past few hundred years. However, with the advent of the Computers -> Internet -> Blockchain -> Smart-Contracts, we can now for the first time, provide an alternative, technological, solution to the Double Coincidence of Wants in the domain of currency exchange. That is the purpose of the Bancor Protocol, which proposes an alternative mechanism for real-time matching of bids and asks, while preserving basic market fundamentals of supply and demand. Essentially, each token created with the Bancor Protocol has a built-in (intrinsic) automated market maker in the form of the Smart-Contract which operates in a transparent, predictable and immutable fashion.   Then you are trying to set price via a mathematical formula which is incorrect and not real price discovery.   The price is not simply set by a mathematical formula, rather, a mathematical formula is being utilized in order to adjust the price, based on the buying and selling activity of the token, reaching an equilibrium where the two are balanced. When a buy/sell order for the token is made, the formula performs a continuous calculation that is essentially like breaking up the order into infinitely small pieces, each resulting in a new price, similar to how continuously compounded interest is computed.",False

The point we are making is that this is not the only single possible mechanism, and definitely not the best one for every use-case.   If I want to buy a coin/token that has very few holders and doesn't trade on major exchanges I can do so, selling is difficult, but that is the nature of buying something that does not have much demand and is thinly traded.  This is incorrect. How can you buy a token which doesn't trade on major exchanges? Your ability to buy the token is a function of the ask orders in the exchanges, just as your ability to sell it is a functions of the bid orders. The asymmetry your describe here simply does not reflect the reality.   Your are trying to solve for illiquid assets, but are phrasing it in terms of coincidence of wants which is incorrect.  Illiquidity is a direct result of the double coincidence of wants problem. Just imagine a token, for which there is on average a single buyer and a single seller per week. The chances for the coincidence of matching the two are slim, and the only option would be for buyers/sellers to wait for days until a match is found, which would also result in a very poor price-discovery process. Using Bancor's reserve mechanism, the buyers and sellers would be able to instantly convert their token, and the price will be adjusted over time, by the contract, toward an equilibrium between buys and sells of the token.   And with altcoins/tokens it typically is not supply which is an issue as there are millions of coins issued in each instance.  The issue is purely demand.  This is also incorrect. The supply in the exchanges is not the same as the money-supply. Even if there are millions of coins which are issued, it does not automatically translate to ask orders in the exchanges. Additionally, Bancor-compatible tokens are self-issued according to their demand, so the arguments that ""millions of coins issues"" simply does not apply here.    You are trying to create demand via a derivative mechanism.  This will only be useful though to those coins/tokens that can't support demand on their own and as there is no real demand for the coins/tokens themselves you are creating a way for those who own them to extract some value out of the derivative portion (i.e. reserves) which almost everyone will do as the coins/tokens cannot stand on their own.  We are not ""trying to create demand"", as the demand is organically created by the market. The difference is that using the Bancor-protocol, a low demand (or lack there of) is reflected in the price, which may drop to near-zero for token with no intrinsic value, however, liquidity -- which is purely a function of the chances to match two ""bartering"" parties -- would cease be a challenge.",False

We're not trying to ""improve liquidity in altcoins"" as you stated. What we are doing is enabling the long-tail of tokens by providing a price-discovery and liquidity solution which does not require a critical-mass of trading activity in order to achieve liquidity. Our solution is not targeting these existing altcoins that can be purchased off market very easily as you say, rather, we see a world where every local community or business can create their own credit by issuing their own currency, as many already do - in the form of local currencies and loyalty points. However, using Bancor protocol, these currencies will be convertible to and from other crypto and fiat currencies, which would increase their usability and value (for example markets for airline miles). We believe that just like in user-generated-content (blogs/videos/etc.) - the long-tail has the potential to become bigger than whatever existed before it. The potential of the long-tail can only be realized when the barriers for its existence has been removed, and the critical-mass of trading that is required for high-liquidity is definitely a huge barrier for the long-tail of user-generated-currencies.

While in traditional exchanges the liquidity source is the market depth, and the price-discovery is based on the agreement between two independent parties -- with Bancor-tokens, the liquidity source is the reserve(s) and the price-discovery is based on the buy/sell history.  This means that whenever a Bancor-token is purchased from its contract (in exchange for a reserve token), new Bancor-tokens are issued and the unit price goes up relative to the reserve token. When a Bancor-token is sold (in exchange for a reserve token), the tokens are destroyed and reserve-token are transferred to the seller.  The price changes result from how the price is calculated, which is simply: UnitPrice=ReserveBalance / (TokenSupply * ReserveRatio). There are step-by-step examples in the whitepaper elaborating on this.  It's important to emphasize that this is how Bancor-tokens operate, however, reserve-tokens may be any ERC20 token, including Bancor-tokens, so the ""Bancor Network"" enable conversion between any two tokens (Bancor-tokens or reserve-tokens).  Bancor-tokens use this method of price discovery, in which the price is the result of the previous buys/sales of the Bancor-token. This creates a situation that when a token has high demand, the price will climb up until it reaches the point where sellers are encouraged to sell it, and buyers discouraged from buying it -- and the price will remain around that equilibrium point between buys and sales. This is very different from the way exchanges work, however, it has a similar behavior in which buying a token increases its price and vice-versa.     What/how/who/howmany of these reserve tokens will come into existance to fuel the exchange supply?  The reserve token can be ETH, or DGX, or any other ERC20 token. These reserve tokens cannot issue themselves, so they do not ""come into existence"" . The initial reserve can be collected in a crowdsale of using a direct deposit, and will grow due to a strong demand for the token. The market-cap of the token will grow in parallel simply since the market-cap is calculated as ReserveBalance / ReserveRatio.   Any investment opportunity?  We are planning the crowdsale of BGTs (temporary name), which is detailed in the whitepaper as the first ""genesis network token"" (a Bancor-token which is to be used primarily as a reserve of other, user-created Bancor-tokens - enabling conversion between all of them)  We will provide additional details on the crowdsale soon.
