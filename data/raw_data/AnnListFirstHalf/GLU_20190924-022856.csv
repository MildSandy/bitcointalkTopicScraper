We are doing something really intricate by linking up a Unity based game with the Ethereum blockchain -- to our knowledge this has never been done before and we are taking every precaution to ensure that the site will run smoothly and the product is completely in working order before we are willing to announce a final tokensale date. We do not want to delay again once we announce and we want to make sure that our product is completely usable from day 1! We'll do our very best to keep our community up to date with as many updates as we can offer.  We really want to thank each and every one of you for your support and patience.

It's true that we haven't had an aggressive marketing strategy just yet as I mentioned before in another post. We are still refining the product first and foremost because that is what will guarantee the success on the market. This will make us accomplish our long-term goals, so each and every one of our GZR and platform users can have a great experience and enjoy what we have created.  If you take a look on almost all the ICO review sites we are on, we are among the highest, and at times even the highest rated project. Most other ICO projects are just paying a lot of money to get ""positive"" reviews, even if that's not the case, and as we have all seen, many have failed to deliver on what they have promised, or even worse, didn't do anything.  This is not our case so you can be confident that Gizer is doing the right things, hence why we do things differently than what you might expect from the average project on the market.  Quote from: wojteks102 on January 25, 2018, 04:31:22 PM Hello Gizer team, Any information about when the main sale is going to start and how long it's going to take? Hi wojteks102, I can't tell you exactly the official starting date but we are aiming for keeping the sale open through the whole month of February. We want to do this to make sure we give everyone enough time to get the chance to buy GZR tokens since we believe this is a great opportunity for anyone who believes in the gaming industry and especially the growth of the eSports scene.",False

Even though our app is already live, we'll be expanding the development team to further build out the e-commerce marketplace, analytics platform for hosts and services, additional competitive formats (new brackets, new ways to play), advertising/feature options for hosts and services, artificial intelligence, and a full web platform to support non-mobile games as well as create a set of tools for Streamers. Additionally, we'll be moving the marketplace, tournament hosting system, and most importantly GGiD (our universal profile with stat tracking/reputation/avatar system) onto the blockchain. There are a lot more upgrades to come that you can check out on our roadmap, these are just a few. TL;DR -> We're going to use a significant portion of the budget to further develop our apps and create value for our user base to solidify multiple stable revenue streams.  Next, 15% will be allocated to marketing and live events. We have partnered with Tapjoy and Omnia Media and will be engaging in extremely aggressive user acquisition campaigns using popular YouTube influencers from the gaming community. Our team has a lot of experience with this type of user acquisition and we aim to acquire a million users by 2019. This also includes organizing live events and tournaments, we will partner with sponsor organizations like Tapjoy in order to offset costs for these events.    10% goes to compliance and legal. Being in the Blockchain space, this one needs no explanation.  General and Admin - 20% -> This accounts for general day-to-day operations for the company. Expanding our team means we'll need to expand our office. This also will help to cover salaries for support staff, travel, and conferences, among other operational expenses.

Quote from: defender77 on December 01, 2017, 10:20:27 AM I'm wondering, will it matter what language I'm playing in, or am I talking about? For example, I would like to host tournaments only for players from my country. Hello defender77, right now our app is only in English. We do have plans for translating it as per our roadmap though. If you want to host for users who would only talk your language you could use your language in the tournament's title and description, as a way of attracting only users from your country. We will keep this in mind for future updates of the app, to make it more convenient.",False

I'm always texted by the same people on Twitter, but I don’t want to involve them, our clan needs fresh blood. Hello MkrKing, you can definitely find a lot of Clash Royale players on our platform. We have a userbase that ranges from new players to competitive players, and the community is growing every day.  Quote from: californybit on November 30, 2017, 09:15:27 AM Will your platform implement an opportunity to sign up for team tournaments alone? I just don’t want to miss tournaments while liking for someone. Hello californybit, I don't think I understand your question. There is definitely a difference between a team tournament and individual tournaments. If you don't have a team you wouldn't be able to participate in a team tournament, but would be able to participate in individual tournaments. However, there is definitely a possibility of finding new friends on the platform and being able to participate in those kind of tournaments as well.

Nearly all deals are facilitated through channels like Twitter/Discord which makes them inefficient.

Hello DigiMig.   The PreSale didn't start yet, if you want to check the time left until it starts you can check the countdown timer on our Tokensale website, it will take place on Friday. https://tokensale.gizer.io/  We are closer and closer to start presale, but i think that @DigiMig want ask how much ETH was collected till this moment..?  Can you reveal this information? If no - why?  Anyway in the moment of starting presale you have to tell in public how many tokens left.. So I don't understand why you don't want reveal this information now? Is it really so big secret? As we speak there are some talks with new accredited investors so the number of tokens left will be changing often enough that we don't want to announce anything unless we have some concrete numbers, otherwise we'd just create more confusion for investors.",False

There are many different types of items and different rarities. The lower of which (common/rare) can be unlocked with fiat/Boost and the more sought after, rarer items (Which will be based on the market interests and popular eSports titles/partnerships) will be unlockable only via GZR  That's just day 1 though, it was very important to us that GZR be usuable before we distribute it.

At the same time there are many different variables that can be customized, as the name of the event, the image of the event, the location if there's any, adding a stream channel url, a website as well as having exact hour of the event and many other features.  Most of the events right now are created by our community. We do, however, help incentivize the community by creating some special events like the $50 Bazoo Blast event a couple of days ago.  Quote from: gliridian on October 30, 2017, 11:30:05 AM    I think this is a plus points to Gizer. Regardless whether the design is not that good yet (of the app) or it's too data heavy, at least they already have a working product. Stuff like this is a building block of a successful product launch. At least they will not start from the very beginning where they still have to develop their app!  But of course, the color, UX/UI design and the lightweightness of the app are also important. But having a working product already gave Gizer a plus points for me. We are listening to our community. We are solving bugs each day and with a full time designer and developers on both the iOS and Android side, the app is going to look better and improve constantly.

However, we took in more than our goal through the SAFT, and we decided to implement new tech into our smart contract that would allow users to transfer GZR without paying gas in ETH. Because of these two reasons we decided to push back the public presale and token generation event to November 10th, bonuses will be given to the first 500 contributors (15% to the first 100 and 10% to the next 400). The ICO itself will commence shortly after the presale and it will officially close when the $18M hard cap is met, or on December 20th. Whichever comes first.

But the fact is United States still is the large country and has most of the whales are living in this country. You can see total traffic of exchange and ICO website are most of the users from United States, therefore, I do not think Asian can compete to United States at now.  True. luckily not a lot of US citizens are discouraged by the new SEC regulations in the US so they still contribute to the scene.   We have taken all correct steps to comply with future SEC regulations. We've done our due diligence to ensure our project is sustainable.

So must be no problem for them that the ICO reviews are in English I guess 90% is too optimistic. Germany may have good education system but I seriously doubt if only 40% of Germans is able to speak in English at decent level   in the world of gamers, English are more understandable than the native language. I think that this language should be the basis .. and the translation for the rest, it's already a different thing There is one more point of view for this situation. There are many gamers who are perfectly capable of using english, but they like to be entertained in their native languages    I agree that English language will not be a problem for most players worldwide.    Yeah, if you a gamer you learned English not from school, from games. It won't be an issue.  Agreed, video games, cartoons, movies and music. Better that any school teacher that being the case it would still be good to have multiple languages available. Many people are not able to understand English properly especially Asians and Russians more languages would increase userbase tremendously.  Can just agree. More languages would open the project to many more people. It's hard to believe but there are a lot of people who don't want to use English every time or just be able to. you are right more language will be for the ico better will be,so that project can reach a higher number of users/persons especially those who do not speak English...

While in its current form it serves for only tournaments, it will also be used for purchasing GGID items, as well as other transactions where we will not be able to initially use GZR. If you take a look at our item distribution here: https://imgur.com/B71Q8v9 you'll notice that there are common, rare, legendary, insane and unfathomable items. Common items, as well as rare items, will also be purchasable with boost, whereas GZR items represent significantly more impactful, collectible and sought after items. We will transition over from the boost system to a blockchain based system which fully utilizes the potential of GZR down the line. This is the best move from a legal standpoint, but we also believe that it will help widespread adoption of GZR items as more players begin surfacing with the incredible items they unlock from GZR and many players will want to emulate this.  About the items you can get: What use do the avatars and items have in the platform? Is it just an avatar or can you do more with it and theses items?  I want to expand that question: Is it possible to cash your Boost balance out to fiat money or physical products? Or is it restricted to virtual items and services? Yes, Boost can be exchanged for gift cards right now and soon you will be able to cash out via Paypal. We will consider other type of cash outs at a later stage.

Will they be able to connect to the Gizer and join the community also?  dude, if there is heartstone and overwatch and even player unknowns battleground mentioned, you can bet that there will be the community for pc gamers inside too. yeah, right and this one will go big time considering their concepts and how big is the gaming community, this one is a sure win. That is correct. At the moment you can see a focus on mobile games like Clash Royale because we wanted to start and dominate a specific niche and then expand into all the other different platform games.",False

Our goal is not to ask for a huge amount of money ""just because we can"", we carefully calculated the presale and sale amount based on what we feel we need to achieve the business goals and vision we have for Gizer.

Going to do my best to answer every question I've seen in the thread, if I missed anyone call me out and I'll make sure to get to your question.     Tournaments: Gizer provides automated bracket technology that allows hosts to create, seed, score and manage brackets as well as tournaments which use the specific in game features of games like Clash Royale which have actual 'in game tournaments'. It also has strong location based services meant to facilitate local/live events as well!  Services: Gizer allows any gamer with a marketable skill like graphic design, coaching, casting, promoting, etc to turn those skills into paying gigs by listing them on the Gizer Marketplace . The Gizer Marketplace will be a PayPal Partnered Marketplace where businesses and individual service providers can list goods and sell them directly to gamers. Listings have ratings, comments, social links and more and in the future will be able to directly sponsor specific tournaments or hosts in order to further gain access to their target markets.

Here are just a few of the games that will be supported on the Gizer Network: https://imgur.com/Gv86f2F  To clarify though, GZR will not be used to purchase in game items like CS:GO skins, the GGID items will be served through the Gizer network and the GGID itself will represent an eSports fan as they compete in various games and watch live or online events, following them on their eSports journey. Items will be unique and customized, and we will create more and more partnerships with top eSports brands and game developers to create more and more desirable items for Gamers. We see further gamification of this system through advances in AR/VR. In our vision, Gamers can take their GGID Avatars with them to live events, compete with other Gamers, and earn achievements not only for competing, but watching and participating in all sorts of different eSports events and activities.   Quote from: Mystic90 on October 09, 2017, 02:16:05 PM Interesting ICO, i have to do some research on how this is different from MobileGo or Gamecredits to see if the value for GIZER higher is or not. Def caught my attention !  To start, our product is already developed and growing every day, and our platform is meant to fuel the entire eSports economy by connecting gamers, hosts, services, businesses and venues all together as opposed to the platforms you mentioned which are more targeted towards developer monetization, app store downloads, and the specific relationship between Gamers and Developers. While we are already partnering with mobile game developers to create more competitive offerings, and will surely aid eSports enthusiasts in discovering new and exciting competitive games, Gizer is by no means ""an app store""",False

I'm going to answer both of these at the same time since they are quite similar.  Boost is our in app currency, it is used to enter tournaments and is won from tournaments. Boost can be used to redeem rewards which currently are in the form of gift cards to all major platforms, and will soon include direct paypal rewards as well. 1 Boost won = 1 dollar. Boost is not an ERC20 token, and it is not currently related to GZR. In the future we hope to see a cross over between the two, and eventually we would like to see GZR become a universally accepted currency on the platform. However, there exist many legislative restrictions which hold us back from allowing it be used to compete, or allowing us to sell GZR directly to you from within the app. Our legal and technical teams are working diligently to find a solution to this and we are exploring many different ways that we can facilitate this kind of thing in the future.  As for Services, the services marketplace will be payable in several different fiat currencies through fiat. We are currently exploring partnerships with several different companies to facilitate purchases through various cryptopayment methods. This is definitely something you will see on Gizer in the future!  The strongest case for Boost at the moment is prize pools for tournaments. Boost can be purchased by hosts to offer prizes for the tournaments they are hosting",False

Gizer’s score, https://icobench.com/ico/gizer on ICO Bench shot up to 4.9 out of 5, easily tops in the Entertainment and Platform categories. The ICO Bench algorithm is clearly picking up on the company’s momentum ahead of the Oct. 20 public crowdsale. Gizer’s presale is currently open using a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT), which is the most secure crowdfunding model available. The presale is backed by New York-based SAFTLaunch, a platform that connects investors with vetted token sales.  ICO Bench rates initial coin offerings through a special algorithm that weighs more than 20 criteria. The methodology, which was developed by independent experts, allocates a score out of 5 based on team, product, business strategy and resilience. ICO scores are dynamic, which means they are subject to change based on new information captured by the algorithm.  The Gizer ICO will raise $18 million through a combined SAFT presale and public crowdsale. A total of 100 million tokens will be issued, each valued at 0.27 USD. The Gizer token, also known as GZR, leverages the latest advances in blockchain technology for seamless integration across multiple gaming platforms.    Gizer is a real-time global gaming network that connects gamers, hosts, services, venues and businesses. It provides the gaming community the opportunity to connect through tournament hosting, service and product listings and brand sponsorships all found directly on the platform.  GZR is an ERC20 token created on the public Ethereum blockchain, which is the world’s No. 2 cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Ethereum is up more than 3,000% this year thanks to features like smart contracts, are blockchain applications for contract negotiation and facilitation.  The GZR token essentially represents a profile that can be unlocked only by attaching to a user’s wallet, also known as the Gizer Global Identity. When a token is unlocked, it creates a randomized profile that is applied to the gamer’s avatar. By unlocking more tokens, users gain prestige within the gaming community and are rewarded exclusive items, rank boosts and badges.  Unlocked tokens are sent from the user’s wallet to the Gizer project for further reuse. GZR tokens can also be used to pay commissions or other fees on the platform.  The growth and widespread adoption of mobile gaming makes Gizer a timely addition to the global eSports economy. It represents the first viable network that links the billion-strong mobile gaming community to the eSports phenomenon. Its economic footprint extends far beyond gamers themselves to include hosts, small businesses, freelancers and other venues.  To learn more about Gizer, visit https://gizer.io/",False

Yet, there is no network to fuel the competitive gaming and eSports economy. Gizer is the solution…  Gizer is a peer-to-peer network, driven by interactions between different parties to create economic opportunity in the global gaming community. The Gizer network will connect gamers, hosts, small businesses, freelancing services, and venues to create opportunity for all members of the global gaming economy.   ICO details    Crowdsale Terms   Gizer’s presale is currently open using a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT). Contact support@gizer.io for information about the SAFT discount. The public presale will open on October 20.   * Note: The 15,000,000 GZR held in reserve will also serve as an incentive plan for adoption. Gizer is also working with game developers for item licensing agreements.   What is GZR?  GZR represents an unlockable profile item in an “unknown” state. The user can unlock tokens at any time, resulting in a randomized profile item being unlocked that can be applied to a gamer’s avatar. The rarity and type of the item unlocked is completely random and decided only after the user decides to unlock it.Users can collect items to rank up and customize their avatars to gain prestige within the gaming community. Once certain sets of items are collected, the user is rewarded with exclusive items, rank boosts, and badges specific to their accolades.    Users who have linked an Ethereum account to their Gizer profile will be able to redeem GZR tokens and exchange them for Gizer profile items. They will do this simply by sending GZR tokens from their Ethereum wallet to a “Gizer redemption account”. Gizer will monitor that account in near real-time for incoming GZR tokens. When an incoming token transfer is confirmed, Gizer will look up the Gizer profile that corresponds to the sending Ethereum wallet. Based on the pseudo-random transaction hash of the token transfer, Gizer items will be added to the Gizer user’s profile. These Gizer items will be assigned a unique hash on the Gizer backend, which can be unlocked by the user at any time, or transferred to another user.   Bounties  Our early adopters and the community at large are extremely important to us. In order to thank those who are supporting our platform and our crowdsale - we will be offering a bounty campaign for all to participate in.

I'm the Gizer ceo and will be posting updates on this account.  Here's a quick summary of where we stand:  We have a very innovative team and we're doing things quite differently than some existing esport/gaming applications. Several small esport/gaming startups have raised in the 7-10m range from institutional $ over the past few months. Like most others, we're super bullish on the growth of esports. We believe esports is in its adolescence and mobile esports is truly in its infancy. As the highest level of esports grows in popularity, the demand to reach that level grows in tandem. At Gizer, we're building the infrastructure to support the esports economy at the general/amateur level.   The gamer demographic is typically technologically adept. They not only have gaming skills but editing, hosting, design, coaching, promoting, and moderating skills. There is a space on Gizer for gamers to play and offer their craft to the community. Small business has a place in the Gizer ecosystem as well- they can sponsor events to advertise their service/product to the perfect audience. Gizer currently also offers location-based services (optional of course) if hosts or venues want to have a live event. Gizer will be an effective medium to host a physical event...unless you want to rely on getting a facebook event invite ha!  We will have an update on the Android beta release soon. We have a few thousand users on our ios app. Unfortunately, Apple is giving us some trouble with our latest update (regarding payout) and it's causing a lot of trouble on ios11 . We're getting this resolved asap.  We have a very clear vision on where we're heading and we appreciate the support so far!",False
