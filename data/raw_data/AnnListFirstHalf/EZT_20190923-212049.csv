But WHY Cryptopia?  #1, Cryptopia is a trusted exchange with millions of users. Being listed on Cryptopia opens up opportunities for EZToken to access more investors in the Australian region and broadens our reach in the New Zealand market, which is a key target market for EZToken Rewards to expand into, after launching in Australia.  #2, Cryptopia will soon release cryptocurrency to fiat trading pairs and are currently working with banks to achieve it. This means that investors will be able to buy EZToken for $NZD, making trading much easier. EZToken‚Äôs goal is to ensure long-term stability of its currency and a good way to achieve that is by pairing it with fiat.  #3, Cryptopia has high website traffic with 48M visits to the site over the last three months alone and a solid volume of trading so we‚Äôre confident that this is a robust exchange for EZToken to be a part of.  #4, Cryptopia is a favourite of crypto day traders who love the access it provides to alt-coins such as EZToken. We‚Äôre confident this will help EZToken attract more investors around the world.  Haven‚Äôt started depositing or trading EZToken on Cryptopia?

They would then perform transfers between the internal exchange and the Qryptos exchange in order to gain the margin by abusing the protected price mechanism.  By doing this these abusive traders are attempting to make benefit via buying low and selling at the protected price.

However, we have received numerous  feedbacks about the poor performance as well as the unwelcome support from Coinbene exchange. Besides, the low liquidity and small volume of transaction has negative effects on EZT price and even on investors' faith on EZT.   As a result, we have decided to unlist EZT on Coinbene exchange. We recommend investors to withdraw EZT from Coinbene to their personal ERC20 wallet or his/her wallet in internal exchange or Qryptos exchange.   We are really regretful that the first public exchange doesn't meet your expectations and we seek for your sympathy for any inconvenience.  We are still working hard for the next exchange as promised on our roadmap.   Thank you so much for your support and wish you successful investment.  ‚û°Ô∏èTwitter:https://twitter.com/eztoken/status/982139234260692992 ‚û°Ô∏èFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/eztoken.io/photos/a.150173452273341.1073741828.149932162297470/179472962676723/?type=3",False

Moreover, blockchain technology removes the need of a third party as a trusted entity for all transactions and thus significantly removes overhead costs. Each participating merchant contributes to the performance of the system by running an autonomous component of the blockchain network and obtains benefits through very low transaction-fees. Loyalty Points on our platform increase in value and become an exchangeable currency deployed as a unit of exchange for gifts or rewards. Furthermore, our system is extendable for any future payment services in any country that allows the option.",False

I do not know who you are. If you join Tele support channel, tenths of questions repeat your idea. We contribute smart-contract source code depends on planning and our responsibility to commit to ICO ranking listing. Not related to you.  Ok, let I back to your questions:  Quote 1/ In your whitepaper, you said that you used ERC20 for your EZToken https://ibb.co/d5XtZ6  But where is your EZToken come from ? You haven't deployed any smartcontract to ethereum network, so how could you sell something you dont own mate ?  You do ICO (Initial Coin Offering) but you don't have any coin, so what do you offer for your investor ?  You should learn how to do ICO before trying to scam, you could read it here (https://ethereum.org/crowdsale)  Okie, and now what should I call you Mate ?  2/ Also in your whitepaper, you said that you will have wallet Here: https://ibb.co/cc1Fgm  I see your wallet here on appstore (and you announce to everyone that you release it earlier than your roadmap because your hard work blah blah blah) Here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.ezpos.ezwallet  So one again, you are trying to attract user to put BTC/ETH to your address and sell them a number on your database.  3/ Also in your news, you tweet that you are going to release internal exchange at this 22nd Jan. (you just deleted it after I post, but I swear you couldn't delete all from the internet, scammer never win mate)  Let I ask you one question, how could you release an internal exchange if you still in trouble with your real product ?   You could say these things to any standard ICOs, not only to us. Please read carefully our roadmap timeline and product development here:  https://ico.ezpos.io/#road-map  My ezwallet anticipate in 1st March, and we try to launch MVP soon just because it might follow new schedule, it could help investors can see balance in mobile version, we will stay focus on product development as announcing in Roadmap. See again!  We didnt delete anything, please see all our channels to know that internal exchange will starts on 22nd Jan.  And for the last question, EZPos commit product will run smoothly in time.

You are the first one talk about this after more than 3000 investors join with us You have 3000 investors (I assume it's right number), it doesn't mean you are not scammer, let answer my questions.  Quote We probably update smart-contract source code on Github recently and announce progress for all ICO ratings its progress. All these matters has transparency, and nobody claims us about it.  Where is your smartcontract ? The one here right : https://github.com/ezpos/eztoken-contract/blob/master/contracts/EzToken.sol  You just try to commit something, and try to update after I reported in your facebook channel.  Ok, let I back to my question:  1/ In your whitepaper, you said that you used ERC20 for your EZToken https://ibb.co/d5XtZ6  But where is your EZToken come from ? You haven't deployed any smartcontract to ethereum network, so how could you sell something you dont own mate ?  You do ICO (Initial Coin Offering) but you don't have any coin, so what do you offer for your investor ?  You should learn how to do ICO before trying to scam, you could read it here (https://ethereum.org/crowdsale)  Okie, and now what should I call you Mate ?  2/ Also in your whitepaper, you said that you will have wallet Here: https://ibb.co/cc1Fgm  I see your wallet here on appstore (and you announce to everyone that you release it earlier than your roadmap because your hard work blah blah blah) Here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.ezpos.ezwallet  So one again, you are trying to attract user to put BTC/ETH to your address and sell them a number on your database.  3/ Also in your news, you tweet that you are going to release internal exchange at this 22nd Jan. (you just deleted it after I post, but I swear you couldn't delete all from the internet, scammer never win mate)  Let I ask you one question, how could you release an internal exchange if you still in trouble with your real product ?   Let I guess Mate:  1/ You dont sell token, you sell a number in your database (mysql i guess) 2/ You dont go to exchange, you dont even think about smartcontract (until I asked you in your facebook). Your site totally don't show your github. And some popular sites like icobench.com, icomatch.com do get your BTC and help you to scam by review you a high score. 3/ you are building an exchange, and using media to attract more people who are so interested about ICO  and think it could make them rick faster, you make a FOMO effect and then you sell as much as possible EZTOKEN. Because you don't have total supply at all.   It just a number (double) I guess, and your real total supply are 2^53 not 10.000.000 right ?  Okie, i know you are trying to submit your smartcontract and try to pretend you are do the right thing. But mate, If I don't talk, you will go that way.  Earning money is good, but target to stupid, greedy people to sell them the number in your db is quite a fucking bad thing in the world.    #Team Note:  Hoa Nguyen CEO of EZ Solution  Tuan Hua Product Manager of EZ Solution  Laurent Nguyen Dr. CSO of EZ Solution  Duong Doan CTO of EZ Solution  Ly Na Head of PR of EZ Solution  Vu Trinh Lead Backend Developer  Nam Nguyen Lead Mobile Developer  Thang Ngo Quality Assurance Manager",False
