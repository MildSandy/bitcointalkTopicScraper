Our team has a big announcement today: the start date of the token crowdsale has been changed!  The start date of the token crowdsale has been changed from August 16th, 2017 to August 28th, 2017.  The new dates of the crowdsale are August 28th, 2017 12:00 noon GMT to September 25th, 2017 11:59 AM GMT.  Thank you for your patience and understanding. We have decided to delay the start of the public token crowdsale to August 28th to allow for ample time to audit our smart contracts for the crowdsale, secure our website, and run the presale.  All bounty tokens will be distributed after the end of the token crowdsale (September 25, 2017).

I just wanted to address a couple points that are coming up a lot. I will also be replying to messages received both on this thread and directly as soon as possible to answer any questions. Thank you for your understanding!  Update Regarding Translation Bounty  We have received many translation requests, thank you for your interest! We have currently closed all translation bounties and are currently contacting all translators who emailed us regarding participating, and decided on positions now. If any positions end up unfilled or open up again we will be sure to notify the community and other applicants as soon as possible.  Update Regarding Payment  There have been multiple questions about when bounty participants will receive their SynchroCoin token bounty. SynchroLife is preparing for a token crowdsale, currently scheduled for August 3, 2017 to September 3, 2017. All SynchroCoin bounty payments will be made after the end of the SynchroCoin token crowdsale, when all tokens are distributed. Check the SynchroLife website and official social media and tuned for more information about when you will receive your SynchroCoin tokens!  This applies to the tokens for all bounties (social, translation, signature, blog, etc).  Update Regarding Social Media Shares  There have been several questions regarding the social media bounty and how many times one person can participate. Please read the original post for all details, but in general it is only ONE Facebook post and ONE Twitter post per user. Of course you are welcome to share more than that and we would love if you did but we will only be paying bounty for one post per user. There is no retweet or ""likes"" bounty. This has been in the bounty description both here on Bitcointalk and on our Medium blog since the beginning of the bounty, we apologize if there has been any confusion.  We may offer more social media bounties in the future, so stay tuned!",False

Like any team, of course we cannot guarantee 100% that we will keep to an exact timeline, but just like our supporters and participants in the upcoming crowdsale of course we want to move alone the road map as quickly as possible to allow the token economy in the service to properly grow! We have been working on SynchroLife for several years and are dedicated to making the platform a success.  Our team is active now and we are continuously updating the current app. For reference, our last update for the Android app was this past Wednesday, July 12th as you can see in Google Play (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.synchrolife), and our most recent iOS update was July 6th (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id557532449?mt=8). Our server engineer is working on some bugs this Friday evening as we speak  We still have a lot of work to do improving the current app, and we are excited to start development to move the platform's restaurant database to the blockchain and to incorporate the SynchroCoin tokens as soon as possible this upcoming fall and winter. We already have a user base of over 30,000 users and we want to bring them the best service possible ASAP.  Here is our road map from our white paper for your reference:  August 3, 2017 – September 3, 2017 SynchroCoin Token Crowdsale   January – March 2018 Release of the decentralized restaurant recommendation platform. Including: - SynchroCoin token usability within the app - Synchro Wallet within the app (available to hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, and SynchroCoin) - The start of a monthly subscription based premium membership service   June – August 2018 “Participating Restaurant” services released. A new mobile app and website just for restaurant managers, including: - Ability to create and publish digital coupons and gift cards - Ability to mark when users come to their restaurant - Ability to buy SynchroCoin tokens - Ability to offer bonus SynchroCoin tokens as rewards   November 2018 – January 2019 Release full customer relation management (CRM) tool suite for participating restaurants   January – March 2019 Release cryptocurrency payment service for participating restaurants, including: - Ability to exchange cryptocurrenies - Ability for restaurants to process payments in the participating restaurant app   March – April 2019 Release of the “Synchro” debit card (allowing users to make purchases with Bitcoin, Ethereum, or SynchroCoin).   And here's some pictures from offline meetups we have done with users of the beta version of SynchroLife in Japan, just in case you were curious about our team and beta community!

Blog: Original blog post or article  What is a “bounty” or “bounty campaign”? A bounty campaign is a PR event where supporters and fans of a project help to spread the news, increase awareness, and generally assist in publicizing the project. These campaigns are frequently used by token crowdsale projects. Supports and fans can join earn tokens for their participation. SynchroLife is offering 1% of SynchroCoin tokens (1,000,000) for this bounty campaign.  Regarding SynchroCoin Payment All SynchroCoin bounty payments will be made after the end of the SynchroCoin token crowdsale. The crowdsale is currently scheduled to end on October 20, 2017. Check the SynchroLife website and official social media and tuned for more information about when you will receive your SynchroCoin tokens!  Regarding the value of 1 SynchroCoin Token The SynchroLife token crowdsale does not have a preset price for the value of one SynchroCoin (SYC) token. The total sold 55,000,000 SynchroCoin tokens will be distributed amongst token crowdsale participants based on the amount of ETH each individual participant contributed during the token crowdsale (including any relevant bonuses) and the total amount raised during the crowdsale.  Please see our blog for more information and examples on how the price of SynchroCoin tokens will be calculated and how they will be distributed to participants of the SynchroLife token crowdsale.

For the Facebook county campaign you only need to make one post. Currently it is a one post per person, one time system. Make one post on your Facebook account with a link to the SynchroLife crowdsale site (https://synchrolife.org/), and then send us a Facebook message at our Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/synchrocoin) with a link to your post and the ETH address at with you would like to receive your SynchroCoin tokens.  So the order is: 1. Make a post on your Facebook account with a link to the SynchroLife crowdsale site (for example: ""Check out SynchroLife, the world's first blockchain based restaurant recommendation platform! https://synchrolife.org/""). 2. Send a private Facebook message to our page (https://www.facebook.com/synchrocoin) from your account (so we know it's you!) with a link to your post and the ETH address at with you would like to receive your SynchroCoin tokens.  I hope that is easier to understand, let me know if you're still confused!",False

Thank you for your interest in SynchroLife, I'm sorry we weren't clear about the pool! I added a bit to the bounty post and I will also share that here.  Regarding the Pool Size: Of the total 100,000,000 SynchroCoin tokens, 1% will be used for bounty. So a total of up to 1,000,000 SynchroCoin tokens will be used for bounty. Unused bounty tokens will be moved to the SynchroLife business pool (9,500,000 (9.5%)) and used for other efforts to grow the platform.  Regarding the price of the token: The exact details of SynchroLife’s SynchroCoin token crowdsale will be announced soon, however during the crowdsale 55,000,000 tokens will be sold. If our crowdsale raises $10,000,000, 1 SynchroCoin will be worth approximately $0.18 (USD). Please understand the exact value amount will change based on the total funds raised during the crowdsale. We cannot guarantee the value of 1 SynchroCoin.  The crowdsale starts August 3, 2017 at 12:00 noon GMT   For more details regarding the SynchroCoin and the SynchroLife token crowdsale, please refer to our official website (http://synchrolife.org) and white paper (http://synchrolife.org/whitepaper.html).",False
