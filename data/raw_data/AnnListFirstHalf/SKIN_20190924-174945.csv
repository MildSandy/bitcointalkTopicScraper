They just have been over taken by a bunch of development teams that actually make progress.   The team is very immature and unprofessional.  A couple of things that stood out in my mind recently.  1)  They posted about a new version of https://skincoin.trade/ on twitter and for about 3 weeks every button on the left side was giving an error message.  It took them 3 weeks to fix the site!  This should all be happening on a development site not a production site.  Sounds like me when I tried to make some websites with wordpress.  Unprofessional.  2)  On the whole liqui exchange debacle.   What professional mature company takes to twitter to start calling out liqui as scammers, etc.   All that should not be out in the public even if they did get scammed.  That just looks HORRIBLE that a company that is supposed to offer a secure gateway for skins...gets scammed into a fake listing?  Just sounds really bad.  We can all hope this coin gets pumped.  The developers really should think about making a big move of burning 200 million coins or airdropping them.  Something needs to happen for this to go anywhere.

I came across waxtoken which promises to be a decentralized exchange (DEX) platform for skins. I read the white paper and the project is very complicated and i think it is just an imitation of skincoin except from the aspect that it is going to use a DEX instead of a centralized exchange for skins supported by skincoin like steam.trade  There is also a new development of a DPoS system called EOS (eos.io) which has the potential for someone to build on it decentralized apps. So, taking into consideration the developments around skincoin that have already been achieved, why not try to build the apps that support skincoin in a decentralized way by using EOS technology?  A big effort may be requested by the skincoin developers for this though but it will probably worth the try because you can make unstoppable dapps and the EOS platform does not charge for transactions which is way more better than using ethereum network which charges you a lot of fees.  In case that dapps like skincoin.trade can be build in EOS then the next step is to transfer the skincoin tokens from the ethereum network to the EOS network. This could may be done by making a smart contract in ethereum that locks/burns skincoin tokens and then by taking advantage of interchain communication of EOS using an EOS smart contract, issue new skincoin tokens on EOS blockchain.",False

Considering @diogoc,  We are glad to see him finally becoming active on the company's account. He has worked for us for about 2 weeks in total; unfortunately, throughout this time we have not been graced with an opportunity to hear him out during the conference calls he failed to join at every given occasion. That being said, he preferred working solo on the project concept without even notifying us about his agreements with some mysterious acquaintances.  We came to a conclusion that we should part our ways when Diogo started giving us pricing for some youtubers and streamers that were much higher than actual pricing (we made an effort to contact them personally to proof-check these facts). Whether it was intentional or not, the fact that he was not able to bargain a lower price made us come to this hard decision. We are not keen on employing a person who is not capable of pulling a marketing campaign, and who tries to request more money than the company is able to give (such as, requesting a most recent game PC worth 4000$).  While Diogo was straight away requesting to make him a Marketing Director, he never displayed qualities or even proofs of his competency. As he was on a test period (2 weeks, no contract yet), we paid him money for the time he spent 'working' for us. Surprisingly, once he received the money, he started threatening us in various ways, and, finally, came to this thread.  We hope you will understand our concerns and opinion, and you can see what to expect from him.",False

They hired me ~1month ago to be their only marketing guy (imagine this, only one marketing guy for a huge project with side projects) and I didn't even know that they only had like 10 people in the company (which is ridiculous) and most of them are devs and support.  They promised me X and Y, including salary, SKIN bonus and a 1-year contract plus another depending on performance - that was a really good offer, it turns out, it was too good to be true!  Not only that but one of their owners asked me if SkinCoin was my only concern and if I was going to dedicate my time to it - I said yes and I would quit my current local job in order to do this full time. I mean, I shouldn't have done this without signing the contract, I know that now but you must understand that you only have so many chances working full time here for a project that you ""believe"" or you see a great potential, so I hope you guys understand my now ""dumb decision"". Either way, I started working there and I noticed right away that I was the only one working, the owners were always offline or away, doing absolutely nothing (believe me) the devs were really slow fixing the websites and adding new stuff, as soon as I started there I asked them how long would it take to put everything online and they kept saying next week, next week etc...  I also told them that I would need a couple of marketing tools and access to social media, websites etc, to measure traffic and whatnot, they told me that they wouldn't do that because they didn't trust me, fine. Then after a couple of days, one of the owners finally created an account on ""agora pulse"" and he gave me access to Facebook and Twitter, funny thing, it was a trial. Imagine that, a company or a guy that has millions, he decided to not spend $100 there, ridiculous.  They also didn't give me any budget (I was working completely blind) - I had more than 35 meetings with possible partners (professional teams, professional players, streamers, YouTubers, tournament organizers, media sites, online shops, game developers etc...) and I closed a couple of deals - I also needed a confirmation from at least one of the owners before closing anything, that's not how a company works. Not to mention that this sick method takes hours if not days to complete, considering that we had different time zones and they were always either offline or away, and they don't work on weekends, they have a family they said. This is a startup, you have millions of dollars and you have been having vacations for the past 5 months, what are you talking about?  I was also really concerned about this and the Slack channel and I even tried to calm you guys and give as many updates as possible, do you know what they told me? ""No need for that, they are toxic and they didn't have to invest their own money if they didn't want to."" I mean, no comments there. In the end, they have perhaps 1 or 2 good people there, people that are also working completely blind with no info what so ever and when they have some questions the owners take days if not weeks to answer, yes, it's true.  What it bothers me is this - They raised over $3,000,000 from you guys, correct? Do you know how much have they invested? Close to ~$50,000. I'm telling you this because it sounds like a scam when you are inside of that company because they refused a couple of great deals with partners that would've helped us with promotion and they said no because it was ""too expensive"" - we are talking about $150,000 or so! And I had close to 10 YouTubers waiting for the products to be ready, which never happened.  I am really sorry for all of you who decided to invest here, believe me when I say this - with the right ownership and management this would be completely different. I still see a great potential here even after everything but they just don't know what to do and they don't understand that they need to 1) burn some coins 2) invest, invest and invest 3) hire at least +10 people  To wrap things up, I'm not talking without evidence, screenshots and other people behind me, people that know I was putting more than 10 hours per day, having daily meetings, working like a dog and I actually negotiated great deals. If you want to see the +30 screenshots that I have, please just private message me and I will do that, only if you are a current investor but I will tell you this right now: Get out while you still can, yes, you will lose some money and I am truly sorry for you but it is the right thing to do, they are scamming, you people, it's bad.",False

Our old version can be found here - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1944508.0    Good day, all Bitcointalk members! My name Igor Solomatin and I’m Co-Founder and CEO of SKINCOIN project. I am pleased to present our project to you!   WHITEPAPER﻿ | WEBSITE﻿ | TWITTER﻿ | SLACK﻿ | TELEGRAM﻿ | FACEBOOK   WHO WE ARE       Our team has been creating, developing, and supporting trading platformsand gambling services within the game items (skins) market for the most popular games: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Dota 2, Team Fortress 2 since 2013.       Today, gamers use CS:GO and Dota 2 skins (virtual weapons and ammunition) as the currency for betting on gambling and betting sites. Players make bets on a team victory or use skins for betting on roulette, jackpot and other gambling sites accepting skins. The market share exceeded $7 billion in 2016.   WHAT WE GOING TO LAUNCH       We going to launch SKINCOIN token (SKIN) – Universal Cryptocurrency based on Ethereum for instant trading CS:GO, Dota 2 skins, and making bets on eSports events.   WHAT IS SKINCOIN       Tokens SKINCOIN (SKIN) are to be released based on the Ethereum blockchain platform. Tokens will be used for trading with game sites, buying/selling skins, making bets on gambling and betting platforms.     WHAT ARE SKINS       Skins are virtual items that can be used in games like Counter-Strike:Global Offensive (CS:GO). The term “skin” is derived from the typical function of these virtual items: changing the appearance of a player’s in-game avatar, weapons, or equipment.       Skins are items that generally can range in value from a few cents to thousands of dollars. Game developers don’t allow skins to be exchanged for cash (only game credit), but secondary markets do allow players to convert skins to cash.          Like a casino chip, a CS:GO skin canbe traded between the player and the house. That basic functionality allows skins to serve as a de facto currency that can power basically any type of gambling product you can imagine.  Here’s how it works:      • Players “deposit” a skin at a skin betting site (popular types of sites include sportsbooks, lotteries, roulette, and coinflips) by transferring the skin to the skin betting site.      • They gamble using their deposited skins (or in some sort of internal currency that the player receives in exchange for their skin).      • If they win, they’re paid in additional skins, which they “cash out” by requesting that the skin betting site transfer skins back to the player.  Once players have skins in their Steam account, they can:      • Leave the skins dormant in their inventory.      • Use the skins to change the appearance of their weapons.      • Trade skins with other players.      • Sell skins on the Steam marketplace for Steam credit (not cash) that can be used to buy other skins and games via Steam.      • Exchange skins for cash on third-party sites outside of Steam and get real cash.          According to Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, a research firm, more than 3 million people wagered $2.3 billion worth of skins on the outcome of e-sport matches in 2015. In 2016, this figure grew by two-fold and reached $5 billion.       As per analytics of Eilers & Krejcik Gaming and Narus Advisors, about 40% of the total 5 billion market in 2016 were betting on the results of cybersport matches and tournaments. Player wagers his skins on winning his team.   Press about skins market:              Steady growth for already-significant skin gambling products mixed with a series of small booms on the cash betting side will combine to vault esports betting toward the upper tier of online gambling verticals by 2020.       Notably, all cases call for relatively modest penetration of gambling products into the broader esports fan base, and all call for an average spend per esports bettor that is far below the average spend of a typical online sportsbook customer.       Note that these numbers are total amount wagered (i.e., handle or turnover) and not revenue.          SKINCOIN token (SKIN) will be accepted as means of exchange for gaming and betting services (betting sites for e-sports events, jackpot sites, roulettes, casinos, etc).       In July 2017, we are launching an exchange platform where you can instantly exchange skins for SKINCOIN and back. At the start of the project, there will be no commission to stimulate the market for the transition to a new payment unit.       By issuing SKINCOIN (SKIN) tokens, we solve the problem of using skins whenbetting on betting/gambling platforms and buying/selling skins on trading sites.       In August 2017, an API shall be developed for receiving and convertingskins in SKINCOINS (SKIN) on all sites of the game theme CS:GO, Dota 2, Team Fortress 2. To pay or make skins, users will be redirected to the exchange platform where they will be able to exchange their skins and refill the balance on the website with SKINCOIN tokens.       Gambling and betting sites will not need to store a huge amount of thingson their bots under the threat of blocking by Steam, they will be able to conduct all settlements with users of SKINCOIN tokens. Players, in their turn, can always exchange SKINCOIN on the platform-exchanger, or exchange them for Bitcoins on exchange platforms.       SKINCOIN token (SKIN) will be accepted as means of exchange for gaming andbetting services (betting sites for e-sports events, jackpot sites, roulettes, casinos, etc.). SKINCOIN (SKIN) will be immediately integrated into the business model of own existing and future projects and will be used to accept payment for services and make bids on projects:  https://steamtrade.net/ - a trading platform for the game items' purchase/sale from Steam. Supported games - CS:GO/Dota2/Team Fortress https://case.club/  - one of the most popular jackpot service for CS:GO and Dota 2 skins. The winner is chosen by independent random number generator Random.org https://csgodep.com/ - store of random items from CS:GO.

We have an experienced, well-organized team.
