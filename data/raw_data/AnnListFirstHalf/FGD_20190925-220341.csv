Token holders will receive 100% of the profits Fairgrounds will hold roughly 23% of the total tokens at the end of the sale, assuming the entire 50M tokens available are sold.  Unsold tokens will be burned. Let's say you participate in the token sale (or play a few games and are rewarded).  Either way you hold 1 million FGD tokens prior to the end of the token sale.  For simplicity we'll assume that 25million of the 50million tokens are unsold.  We will burn the remaining 25 million tokens, leaving the total supply at 75 million (originally 100 million).  Instead of 1% of the tokens, you now hold 1/75 = 1.33%",False

We are already live with our first game, and on track to release the profit sharing contract this month have already released the profit sharing contract so that even during the token sale, investors can realize the potential of this site.  https://i.imgur.com/XoBI7VQ.png  Games We've launched with a single winner-take-all game called Raffle.  There are multiple raffles at different ticket prices.  When the target number of tickets is reached, the smart contract utilizes Oraclize to fetch a random number and choose a winner.  10% of each Raffle jackpot feeds into a single progressive raffle.  The progressive raffle occurs every 10 days with entry only available to Fairgrounds Rewards (FGR) token holders  Profit Sharing A smart contract offers a unique continuous, uninterrupted distribution of profits with monthly distribution periods.  Faigrounds (FGD) token owners can withdraw their share of the total supply. There's no single week to withdraw, and no token transfer lock.  A withdraw can occur anytime during the distribution period.  Currently 2% of all raffle entries is transferred to the smart contract.  All future games with house advantage will similarly flow to the smart contract.  Referrals Players can earn extra bonus FGR rewards by referring friends to the network. When their friends play, both the referrer and the player will receive a 10% bonus.  During the token sale, this bonus will also apply to any FGD as well.  See the token sale section below for more details.  TOKEN SALE https://i.imgur.com/wk95jNW.png Week 01 (Feb 07, 2018): 1 ETH - 10000 FGD Week 02 (Feb 14, 2018): 1 ETH - 9000 FGD Week 03 (Feb 21, 2018): 1 ETH - 8000 FGD Week 04 (Feb 28, 2018): 1 ETH - 7000 FGD Week 05 (Mar 07, 2018): 1 ETH - 6000 FGD Week 07 (Mar 14, 2018): 1 ETH - 5000 FGD Week 08 (Mar 21, 2018): 1 ETH - 4000 FGD Week 09 (Mar 28, 2018): 1 ETH - 3000 FGD Week 10 (Apr 04, 2018): 1 ETH - 2000 FGD  Earn FGD for Playing 25% of the total supply of tokens is available just by playing the games.  Rewards will be offered at 10000 FGD for every 1 ETH bet.  This bonus reward will be available until all 25M FGD tokens are rewarded.  Unsold Tokens 50% of the total supply of tokens (50M) will be available via the token sale. Any unsold tokens will be burned, reducing the total supply of tokens, and increasing each FGD owners' share of profits.  USAGE OF FUNDS https://i.imgur.com/xJ0LVmi.png The majority of the funds will be used to build the bankroll for future games.  The bankroll will allow us to offer larger bet sizes and more games sooner.    ROADMAP https://i.imgur.com/tPqB8po.png We are currently slightly ahead of schedule with the profit sharing ux interactions coming soon just released.  We're excited to launch an experience that will have a lot less friction than others that currently exist.  FGD owners can withdraw their share even if their tokens are in cold storage.  Here's a sneak preview of the roulette game currently slated to hit testnet in early March https://i.imgur.com/sU1xG6a.png  TEAM As Etheroll and vDice have similarily done, we are choosing not to list the identities of our team members.  Fairgrounds is already live and working.  All contracts have been audited, and verified on etherscan.  Given the way the token sale is structured, we are incentivized to continue to grow traffic on the site, which will be through more games and offerings.",False
