First of all and most importantly, we are still serious about the project and the team is still working together. As stated in our original whitepaper, the core team has a strong background in performance marketing and is very well connected in that industry. What we currently hear from clients and partners is, that most challenges we predicted (fraudulent transaction in particular) are now starting to really have an negative impact on all parties involved. So we are more convinced than ever, that CROM must happen.  As the ICO was not successful, we spend a lot of time in the last 3 month to evaluate alternative offers to support our project. We had many valuable meetings and talks with companies, evangelists and people from the industry. Maybe this is the right way to go for us. Stay tuned for more information.  However, no matter how the final business setup will look like, technically CROM bases on blockchain. And the CROM token is an important part of how CROMhub works. Since the token is out there, we've been busy to finally make the CROM token tradable. We aimed to make an announcement about tradeability in March, but due to long approval process this will still take a bit. But its not forgotten! Join our Telegram group if you want to get in touch with the team or discuss with other CROMhub members: https://t.me/CROMhub   Thanks Matthias",False

Most of them have not realized, that the tokens might be useful for them in the future. So demand will grow a lot once they do.  CROMhub will use unsold tokens carefully to grow adoption of the platform (= a big new client gets some tokens in the beginning to understand the functionality and then, hopefully, buy more tokens on the open market).",False

On the discussion of token value, we thought long and hard. Sudden changes in value of the underlying ETH is not uncommon in ICOs, it's rather the norm. We anticipated a ""return from BTC to ETH after the hard fork on Nov 17"" and figured it would strengthen ETH. The BTC hard fork didn't come but the returning investor interest in ETH certainly did. As the pre-sale is underway, we can't change the token price anymore.

I would like to find out the answer to that too. If the devs/team could help out.  One interpretation could be that CROM are referring to a POS or Masternode style coin where you can earn extra tokens for holding them in a CROM token wallet.  Another interpretation is that the token earns a dividend or you get paid for holding coins and helping in a transaction.  Or it could mean that you get discounted fees for transactions by holding more tokens. So if you're regularly using CROM tokens for paying out for digital advertising services then it works out better to hold a larger amount initially.  It could mean something else entirely,False

At the time it seemed a bit too high to me, don't get me wrong it was great getting all the extra tokens for free, but I didn't really feel like I earned that bonus.  They were also offering up to 35% for the pre-ICO and it did work incredibly well for them, they raised around $17.5M USD in total and they ran the token sale for about a month.  It would be amazing if CROM could reach a similar level, I think with a bit more input from the marketing/advertising team with regard to facebook/twitter/youtube adverts and posts we could potentially reach it.

I hope you have a nice weekend. Again, thank you for your questions and the nice words. As promised I want to answer more questions.     Quote from: Moore787 on November 04, 2017, 09:35:25 AM Will it be possible to sell tokens immediately after .ico?  Realistically just after Christmas. As the ICO ends Dec 15, we might run into the Christmas break for some exchanges‘ tech teams.  Quote from: Asalar on November 03, 2017, 03:52:44 PM Will there be a separate partner network on Youtube?  CROMhub runs independent from the places were advertising is shown. If a future business partner of CROMhub choses to run Youtube ads, it will work just fine.  Quote from: P.Krymov on November 03, 2017, 03:56:47 PM Will there be personal partnership offers for owners of large portals?  Owners of large portals are invited to join the pre-sale. We look forward to hearing from them, discuss their needs and requirements and make CROMhub even more fit for their business.  Quote from: derverss on November 03, 2017, 06:59:05 PM Do you negotiate with Poloniex about the listing of the tokens?  Yes, we do. But we can’t tell you yet, whether they will decide to list us.

Quote from: ZellaAnders on November 04, 2017, 10:34:30 AM What are the payment methods for tokens?  Currently we don't have plans to accept any other currency but ETHER during the ICO.  Quote from: culvert.1986 on November 03, 2017, 09:17:15 PM Have you got  a bounty company for bloggers who write articles  At this time we do not plan to roll out blogger bounties. We are looking into adding more options though and this might be one.

It is also interesting in which languages you can make a presentation about the project.  If you plan on covering CROM we are able to present in EN and DE.  Quote from: oficman on November 04, 2017, 10:45:58 AM For the use of your service, customers can only pay tokens or other currencies, too?  The token will not be used to pay the platform fees but represend an irrevocable fee advantage when using the platform.  Quote from: farland7 on November 04, 2017, 10:43:33 AM How many subscribers on facebook do we need for  participation in the bonus company?

Since my account is still limited to one post every 360 seconds I will answer a couple of questions at the same time.     Excellent question. Blockchain has two big advantages: it’s a transparent and fake-proof ledger; and (in form of Ethereum and comparable newer manifestations) it can host and execute smart contracts. This makes it the perfect choice for tracking (which needs to be proven, transparent, fault-proof – nobody wants to get cheated) and settlement (initializing payment from A to B, once certain criteria are met). Not all processes in the marketing industry are suited for blockchain adaptation. RTB requires to much processing power, banners just dont need to be there… but tracking and settlement fit perfectly. That’s why we are concentrating on bringing these two crusical processes to the blockchain.

Registration for pre-sale is now open. Hurry to grab a 25% bonus on CROM tokens.  The CROM bounties are announced! Check them out!  We are an international team of experienced people working in the digital marketing space. We are based in Berlin, Germany. In our 15+ years journey in the industry, we were always faced with the challenges and flaws the established processes and business setups in that industry have. There are recurring problems with payments, trust and liquidity. We visualized some of this ""mess"" on our CROM website.  While constantly looking for ways to improve this situation, we turned our attention to blockchain based transaction handling about 15 months ago. We started to model a modern payment implementation based on the growing acceptance of crypto currencies and its efficient payment mechanics. Ethereum-based smart contracts are the foundation from which to build. And from here it really started.   This is how we imagine an efficient transaction handling should work. This is CROM.  We started shaping and proving our plan by getting valuable information from industry leaders both from the advertiser and publisher side, and we gathered a lot of valuable inputs and interest from blockchain enthusiasts. Then the ICO train came along and provided a great way to accelerate our progress. So, we decided to jump on this opportunity and here we are.   Watch the video!  This our ICO ANN thread at bitcointalk. Obviously, our company related accounts on this board are a little too young to have reached a junior account here that allows us to insert pictures (for now) in our post, but trust us – we are old guys when it comes to industry experience. And yes, we do have visuals, please visit our website https://cromhub.com  Of course we are not only here to present the project, but we will be available to discuss our project with you. Feel free to ask us anything in this thread or join the discussion in our Telegram group at  Telegram: https://t.me/joinchat/ANhBikDwg9pQ6EEepGDJ2Q   THE MISSION  The market:  The overall digital advertising market turns over $500B/year. This can eventually be addressed by CROM. Initially, we will work within the $6.8B/year performance marketing ecosystem.  How we are going to do it:  CROM is the first real-world application of blockchain technology for the performance advertising industry. We build a service that takes event tracking into the blockchain, connects tracked events to payouts and forwards payouts along the value chain.  CROM is designed to work alongside existing processes and can easily be linked to existing platforms. Everything is geared towards low barriers for adoption. Our team of advisors is carefully chosen to give us deep roots in the digital advertising industry. This allows us to develop the platform in close cooperation with the future clients.  CROM grants access to a complete new set of methods that will fundamentally change the way settlements are processed in the digital advertising value chain. Now that blockchain technology has reached a more mature state, CROM takes advantage of the solutions available and combines smart contracts with cryptocurrency based payment.
