Apparently they are able to lock the tokens. I have been thinking about experimenting by sending some to another myetherwallet. But that will only cost me gas and I'm affraid that somehow some ICX will get lost. Besides that I don't mind the KYC too much. If any one of you wish to experiment; go ahead and inform us about the outcome. ,False
