Quote Dear PolicyPal Network community,  We love our community and have been acting on your feedback such as airdrop and bounty delay as well as logo revision. We also heard your feedback on unlocking the tokens asap, despite the fact that we are going through a bear market now, as many of you are aware of.  As the CEO of PolicyPal Network, I have been working on revamping the insurance industry for the past 2 years and I am truly passionate to solve the issues in this industry. I strongly believe in my team and we are on track with our product development.  Apart from Qryptos which has been the first to support our token listing, we have also submitted listing applications to several other preferred exchanges which are still reviewing our applications. We are planning a dual listing of PAL tokens. Until we have secured a 2nd exchange to list PAL, we will hold off on listing on a single platform. As mentioned, unlocking of tokens will happen 3 days before the first listing.  Yours Sincerely, Val Yap (Founder and CEO of PolicyPal Network)",True

From this model it comes that only people involved in crypto will buy policies on their platform using tokens. People who are not familiar with crypto will use fiat. If they want to make real value to their product, they should make their token THE ONLY way of purchasing policies. And for comfort of people not involved in crypto, who want to use fiat, they should make internal exchange. For example some Bob wants to buy policy on their platform, and the only way to do this is to pay with token, but Bob doesn’t know how to go to exchange and buy token, Bob was using fiat money all his life. And specially for people like Bob there is option in the PP app to pay with fiat, but when fiat comes in app it is automatically exchanging for token, and token is used to buy policy for Bob. And company is buying back token from exchanges from token holders. Everybody happy, and then tokenomics work right way, and token gets value based on the amount of policies sold. But there is not a single word about this token economy model in whitepaper. It is just me, random noob from internet writing about it on forum. Not Super Puper developers, chosen by PayPal, and many other venture investing companies, who still don’t have enough money for the project and coming here to the community to take our money. nd unfortunatelly there is so much hype around ICOs now, and so many stupid people just giving money to all projects, who are new to crypto and economics. They spending their last money hoping to make big profits. And projects like this get their money, because PayPal logo is written on their website.  If team will show any REAL model, driving up token value, I will take my words back. But not before. And not because they are saying that “you will see real token use and value, when we launch mainnet” . And before mainnet we should buy lottery token? Nice position.   Edit: and when they banned me, they even forbiddened me to watch discussion in group, not just puting silence on me. And admin reported me like spamer in telegram. He just answered my questions and to prevent further reasoned questiones, he didn’t have answers, he just quietly banned me, so all people in group wouldn’t panic about this. After I pmed him, he just baned and reported me, not answering, like 15 yo girl",True

It should be convenient for users. But I think they will do this of course. They are professionals, and I think they know how to do better.  As for Paypal, read this article:  http://fintechnews.sg/11127/insurtech/policypal-becomes-first-start-graduate-mas-fintech-regulatory-sandbox/  Quote Founded in April 2016, PolicyPal employs the use of algorithms to analyze current insurance coverage received funding from 500 Startups and angel investors and is presently working with global insurance companies to help them go digital. PolicyPal Pte. Ltd. is a company under the incubation of PayPal. The PayPal incubation program is an APAC Fintech focused incubation program run by PayPal.  Quote It has also partnered with global insurance companies in Singapore – AIG, Aviva, AXA, Etiqa and NTUC Income. PolicyPal’s regional expansion strategy includes scaling their existing platform and operations beyond Singapore to include Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Thailand.  Just for example:  Aviva - Market capitalization: 19,83 billions dollars AIG - Market capitalization: 53,46 billions dollars  AXA - Market capitalization: 61,39 billions dollars  If PolicyPal will take its niche, can you imagine what marketcap will be in policyPal? At last few billons dollars from primary 25 millions... And how much can be cost tokens (coins in future)?  Policypal Network will be tapping on the unbank community mainly in Asia. They are not as policy maker but they are linking the unbank people to the necessary insurance agency. So in this way, they are not try to have a cut in the insurance agency, but they are working together with them so that both can gain even more from tapping on the unbank. On the other hand, as Policypal Network is not covering the insured sum, Policypal Network is not exposed to risk whenever there are massive destruction.  Like what Val say during the meet up, the risk that Policypal Network has is about not able to reach out and help as many unbank people out there.",True
