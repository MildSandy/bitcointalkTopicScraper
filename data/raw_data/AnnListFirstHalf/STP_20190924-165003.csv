Stash Core Javascript library provides the base foundation for the explorer insight API as well as future light wallets. The Stash Core Javascript library is a building block for third parties to integrate into Stash Core.  Integrating Stash into third party light wallets will allow users to send and receive Stash easily without the need to run a full node. Users will be able to send and receive Stash from a mobile wallet in addition to the desktop wallet.  Additionally were also happy to announce the release of the Stash trello board which you can find here: https://trello.com/b/lLDiBvDe/stash-bounties The Stash trello board consists of a number of bounties which community members can take on in return for Stash.  The idea for Stash was to develop a cryptocurrency that was fast, private and decentralised. In order to achieve decentralisation we are looking to grow the Stash eco system of individuals that can help with specific parts of the project. We are looking for individuals that can contribute to Stash development, project management and marketing.  If you are passionate about crypto and are interested in helping with the Stash project then take a look at the Stash trello board and let us know if you think you have some of the skills required to complete any of the bounties. In return you will earn some Stash and also be listed as a team member on the Stash website. In order to continue with the privacy direction of Stash all new team members that will be listed on the Stash website will be listed under an avatar name and avatar picture and as a result wilt stay anonymous.  So if you are interested in becoming more involved in the progress of Stash email bounties@stashpay.io and tell us about your skills and the bounty number you would like to work on.

We have completed the final tests of the software and will be releasing the final version of STASHPAY.IO on the 26-03-2019 5:30pm PDT. Once launched anyone wishing to download STASHPAY.IO will be able to do so here: https://stashpay.io/wallet/ It will be possible to run STASHPAY.IO on Windows, Linux and MacOS. We will provide guides on how to import your private keys, back up your wallet, setup and run master-nodes and run your own mining pool on the day of the release. Additionally, we will also be making the STASHPAY.IO source code public for all to view on the Stash Github and will release the StashPay.io explorer which anyone can use to view Stash transactions. We are pleased that STASHPAY.IO is now complete and fully tested. As a crypto project it implements zk-snarks technology by integrating the upgraded zk-snarks library built in Rust. This means that STASH owners not only have the ability to use the Stash features such as instantaneous transactions and Stash Master-Nodes but can also send truly anonymous “shielded” transactions using zero knowledge cryptography. Unlike coin mixing which both the Stash team and academic researchers have shown to be a weak form of transaction privacy STASHPAY.IO shielded transactions use zk-snarks to mask the origin, destination and amount being transferred.  The final release of STASHPAY.IO has the following specifications.  Consensus: Proof-of-work Hash Algorithm: X11 Block Time: 60 Seconds Block Reward: 67.6 Miner Reward: 30.42 Masternode Reward: 30.42 Deflation rate: 7.1% per year Maximum Supply:  684 million   STAHSPAY.IO Stash Core will allow users to make  •  instantaneous transactions •  transparent transactions •  shielded to transparent transaction using zk-snarks (via command line) •  shielded to shielded transaction using zk-snarks (via command line) •  setup and run masternodes •  vote on proposals (once proposal system is enabled via spork)  In Addition the Stash testnet is a fully functional test network that will be open for connection and will match the same technical specifications as mainnet . This network will be used to test any future solutions before they are implemented into mainnet. With that said, make sure to follow us on Twitter https://twitter.com/stashpay?lang=en and Facebook https://www.facebook.com/stashpay.io/ as we will be making further announcements shortly.

STASHPAY.IO is essentially ready for release in its current format. However, after a meeting with all the developers the consensus among the team is that we should implement the latest snarks library update in order to improve the efficiency of Stash shielded transactions.  Right now, shielded transactions take around 80-300 seconds to generate depending on the user’s machine processing power. Implementing the new library should allow us to reduce this to around 15 seconds once again depending on the user’s machine processing power.  This update will make shielded transactions much more usable for everyday transfers. It will also eliminate the need to have two types of shielded transactions and for all Stash owners to have to upgrade or risk losing their Stash at some point in the future when we would have to update the library anyway.  For these reasons we believe the right move for Stash is to complete the upgrade now before the full release of STASHPAY.IO. We estimate this should take us around 2-3 weeks of work. This means we should have the work finalized by the end of the year and be ready to launch STASHPAY.IO in early January.  Regards  Stash Team",False

Code Particle is a software development company located Los Angeles that is focussed on distributed technology, web and mobile apps as well as UI/UX design.  Code Particle has both blockchain development and zk-snarks experience and has been involved with the development of the ZenCash cryptocurrency (now Horizon) new wallet. Code Particle has been testing the STASHPAY.IO software and is in the process of completing the Stash source code audit.  The Code Particle team has the capability to design and develop client/server/cloud models to handle companywide workloads and peer-to-peer experiences. From extensive financial transactions to building applications that channel data and provide analytics for well-known endpoint security companies, to custom server applications and online gaming experiences.  Specifically, the Stash team is pleased to be working with Franck De Girolami who has over 25 years of experience in high performance software application development including extensive work in video games for PC, console and mobile platforms. As software architect and lead programmer, Franck was directly responsible for a number of ground-breaking video games including Alone in the Dark, Cyberia and Tron 2.0: Killer App.  Additionally, Stash is pleased to be collaborating on the Stash source code audit with Pier Stabilini who has 20+ years of experience in software architecture and development with a strong Java, J2EE, C, GoLang, Python, data grid and networking expertise. Pier has designed and developed real time networking frameworks and high-performance stacks used in financial applications, audio and video conference and in the automotive industry. To see the full bio of Franck and Pier visit the stashpay.io website and navigate to the team section.  Were also excited to announce that we are getting very close to completing the Stash RPC calls, unit testing and source code audit. While we would have liked to complete the testing and source code audit a bit earlier we felt it was important to not rush this critical part of development. A solid and extensive testing process has allowed us to find several issues which the team has now addressed and as a result has also managed to implement a number of improvements to the software.  We appreciate all the support of the community and we look forward to updating you all very shortly about the November release of the STASHPAY.IO software.  Regards  STASH Team",False

DON'T FORGET TO REGISTER BEFORE 27-09-2018, 23:00UTC  REGISTRATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR STP TOKENS   WATCH THIS SHORT INSTRUCTIONS VIDEO ON HOW TO REGISTER YOUR STASH PUBLIC KEY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY0RJyNEkbY   For all STP token holders it is very important that you follow these instructions before the 27-09-2018, 23:00UTC or you will lose your STP tokens forever. There will be no way to recover your STP tokens if you do not follow these instructions and register your STASH Public Key.   Within forty-eight (48) hours after the 27-09-2018 23:00UTC, all STP Tokens will become fixed (ie. frozen) and non-transferrable on the Ethereum blockchain.   At this point it will be possible to launch a public blockchain platform adopting the open source STASHPAY.IO Software (an “STASHPAY Platform”) by generating a file or “snapshot” showing the fixed balances of the STP Tokens from the state of the Ethereum blockchain (the “Snapshot”).   In order for the balance of your STP Tokens to be included in any Snapshot, you must register your STASH Public Key against your Ethereum address.   It is very important that if you hold STP tokens you follow these instructions before the 27-09-2018, 23:00UTC or you will lose your STP tokens forever.

We suggest you not wait until the last minute to register your Ethereum address with a STASH private and public key pair. •   If you hold STP tokens in multiple Ethereum address, you need to register STASH keys for each one. •   If you wish to transfer your STP tokens to another Ethereum address, you can generate a new pair of STASH public and private keys and register them with your new Ethereum address. •   You can always generate a new pair of STASH public and private keys and register them with your Ethereum address. Every time you do this, the existing keys will be replaced with the new STASH public and private keys. •   If you move your STP tokens to a new Ethereum address after you have registered your STASH public key, you will need to re-register your STASH public key from the new Ethereum address   Please watch the instructions video or see the register instructions below for further details on how to register your STASH Public Key.

This means all users of STASHPAY.IO will be able to send shielded transactions that will allow for the amount, origin and destination to be kept private while still verifying transfers on the blockchain.   This is a huge milestone for the STASH project as the integration of Zk-Snarks is very complex, time consuming and required solving numerous, challenging technical problems.   Stash is only one of a handful of projects that have managed to integrate ZkSnarks into a separate code base.   Some of you may be wondering what is Zk-Snarks?   Zk-Snarks stands for Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge. It is a form zero knowledge cryptography. Zk-Snarks essentially works on what is known as zero-knowledge proofs. The idea of zero-knowledge proofs originally comes from several MIT researchers back in the 1980s.   Zero-knowledge proofs means that between two parties of a transaction, each party can verify to the other that they have a specific set of information but without revealing what that information is. This is very different than other proof systems where at least one party needs to know all the information.   STASHPAY.IO uses Zk-SNARKs to prove that the conditions for a valid transaction have been satisfied without revealing any critical information about the values or addresses involved.   While the team is very pleased with the result there is still further work to be done. STASH developers are now moving to full testing on the STASH testnet including further testing of shielded transaction as well as incentivized nodes (iNdodes).   We are also in discussions with third parties about reviewing and testing STASHPAY.IO before it's release. We're excited about what's been achieved and will keep you all updated on further progress.   Regards🙏🙏🙏   STASH Team",False

REGISTRATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR STP TOKENS   WATCH THIS SHORT INSTRUCTIONS VIDEO ON HOW TO REGISTER YOUR STASH PUBLIC KEY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY0RJyNEkbY   For all STP token holders it is very important that you follow these instructions before the 27-09-2018, 23:00UTC or you will lose your STP tokens forever. There will be no way to recover your STP tokens if you do not follow these instructions and register your STASH Public Key.   Within forty-eight (48) hours after the 27-09-2018 23:00UTC, all STP Tokens will become fixed (ie. frozen) and non-transferrable on the Ethereum blockchain.   At this point it will be possible to launch a public blockchain platform adopting the open source STASHPAY.IO Software (an “STASHPAY Platform”) by generating a file or “snapshot” showing the fixed balances of the STP Tokens from the state of the Ethereum blockchain (the “Snapshot”).   In order for the balance of your STP Tokens to be included in any Snapshot, you must register your STASH Public Key against your Ethereum address.   It is very important that if you hold STP tokens you follow these instructions before the 27-09-2018, 23:00UTC or you will lose your STP tokens forever.

We suggest you not wait until the last minute to register your Ethereum address with a STASH private and public key pair. •   If you hold STP tokens in multiple Ethereum address, you need to register STASH keys for each one. •   If you wish to transfer your STP tokens to another Ethereum address, you can generate a new pair of STASH public and private keys and register them with your new Ethereum address. •   You can always generate a new pair of STASH public and private keys and register them with your Ethereum address. Every time you do this, the existing keys will be replaced with the new STASH public and private keys. •   If you move your STP tokens to a new Ethereum address after you have registered your STASH public key, you will need to re-register your STASH public key from the new Ethereum address   Please watch the instructions video or see the register instructions below for further details on how to register your STASH Public Key.

This means all users of STASHPAY.IO will be able to send shielded transactions that will allow for the amount, origin and destination to be kept private while still verifying transfers on the blockchain.   This is a huge milestone for the STASH project as the integration of Zk-Snarks is very complex, time consuming and required solving numerous, challenging technical problems.   Stash is only one of a handful of projects that have managed to integrate ZkSnarks into a separate code base.   Some of you may be wondering what is Zk-Snarks?   Zk-Snarks stands for Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge. It is a form zero knowledge cryptography. Zk-Snarks essentially works on what is known as zero-knowledge proofs. The idea of zero-knowledge proofs originally comes from several MIT researchers back in the 1980s.   Zero-knowledge proofs means that between two parties of a transaction, each party can verify to the other that they have a specific set of information but without revealing what that information is. This is very different than other proof systems where at least one party needs to know all the information.   STASHPAY.IO uses Zk-SNARKs to prove that the conditions for a valid transaction have been satisfied without revealing any critical information about the values or addresses involved.   While the team is very pleased with the result there is still further work to be done. STASH developers are now moving to full testing on the STASH testnet including further testing of shielded transaction as well as incentivized nodes (iNdodes).   We are also in discussions with third parties about reviewing and testing STASHPAY.IO before it's release. We're excited about what's been achieved and will keep you all updated on further progress.   Regards   STASH Team  ",False

You can join the Nebula Telegram channel to stay updated at https://t.me/nebulaexchange  Exciting times are on the horizon as our launch quickly approaches! If you haven't already, now is the perfect time to announce our launch and partnership to your followers and ask them to create accounts, it's almost time for them to start trading as we hopefully enter another bull market!  Important information to share with your followers:  •   Nebula is officially launching April 30th! •   Deposits will begin April 23rd •   User account registration is now available •   Please ask your followers to join our Telegram at https://t.me/nebulaexchange to stay posted on updates   Unfortunately we have some bad news as well. We are not yet registered with the SEC and we do not have the required infrastructure to track and report cryptocurrency holdings of American Residents and Citizens for tax purposes. Because of this we will have to bar American IP addresses from using the exchange for the time being. It could take as long as a year before we can allow US users to trade.  Nebula plans to host all sorts of promotions, airdrops, bounties, and contests. One idea we have is to have partnered projects provide us with an airdrop pool, everyone who is entered into this pool will receive an equal share. To enter the pool a user must trade ($500?) worth of your currency or our house tokens NESC/PIT on the exchange. We could have this pool scale/increase in size according to the number of entered users, with the current share prize always visible in our promotion section of the exchange. The distribution can happen when the pool reaches the maximum amount or the event expires.",False

If you cannot see your tokens in your address, make sure you save the following parameters in your wallet:  Token Contract Address: 0xecd570bBf74761b960Fa04Cc10fe2c4e86FfDA36  Token Symbol: STP  Decimals: 8  During StashPay token sale 7,144,523 STP Tokens were purchased for a total of 15.548 BTC and 651.79 ETH.  There was also 1,108,150 STP Tokens distributed for bounties and there are 300,000 STP Tokens that will be sent out for the StashPay Draw shortly.  This means there is a total of 8,552,673 STP Tokens in circulating supply. These are the only STP tokens that can be freely bought and sold.  The remaining unsold tokens of 352,555,477 have been placed in the Stash Vault. The Stash Vault has now been frozen and hence these tokens cannot be transferred on the Ethereum blockchain.  The frozen STP tokens in the Stash Vault are an important resource and the intention is to use them for the benefit of the StashPay project. This may include allocating tokens to partnerships, burning tokens to reduce supply or adding them back to the mining pool for the benefit of miners and Inodes. However, it is important to understand that these frozen STP tokens cannot be transferred on the Ethereum blockchain and are out of circulation until the StashPay.IO software is finalized.  Additionally, all team and advisor tokens are also frozen and cannot be transferred until the StashPay.IO software is finished.  Lastly there is 36,291,850 in STP tokens that are being held in the Development and Advisor pool. The team may use these tokens over the next 9 months as an additional resource to help with the project development as well as to attract new talented team members and quality advisors to the project.  So to summaries there is only 8,252,673 STP Tokens in circulation these are the only tokens that can be freely bought and sold. The Stash Vault and all team member and advisor tokens have been frozen until the StashPay.IO software is finalized. These STP tokens cannot be transferred on the Ethereum Blockchain.  The StashPay team has moved to research and development mode. We are exploring various exciting possible partnerships and are looking to add more talent to the team. We will keep you all posted on any developments as they happen.  Regards  StashPay Team",False

Mining is a PoW/PoS hybrid. And no, tokens will not be mined, it's the coin that will be mined. The STP tokens issued was for funding the development of STP blockchain.

Surely might look like it but as long as the team is developing the blockchain the token is supposed to migrate to, while taking care of other technical development issues, I think this token will be fine. There's no active exchange other than IDEX (https://idex.market/eth/stp) for the token at the moment so I would consider it more inactive than dead. Nebula already confirmed it will list STP once the exchange goes live, but not sure when is that going to be.  I payed 2.40 ETH at current prices (0.20 BTC at the time of ICO) for 10,000 STP. And that was with the best discount in the ICO. I don't think I am encourage to sell at this ridiculous prices. I prefer to already think my money is lost because that's how it is with ICOs. First ICO I ever participated. First and last lol. There's really extremely few ICOs that you can't grab at the exchanges for less of ICO or Pre-sale prices. All I want from the team is to be actively supporting the project and develop as best as they can. It would be really really nice if the team could provide a transparent progress of what has been done with the ICO funds, any spending, investing, etc. That's the very minimum they could do. Just by holding our investments, they already could've tripled the value in USD and that should be reflected in the price. I do have to say that there's no need of expensive marketing to just keep the community updated here. As long as nothing of this is happening, I wouldn't advice any newcomer to invest in this project. The cost of opportunity of holding this token has been very high to me and if you aren't ready to face high risks/high rewards then is better to look at other more stable tokens/coins.",False

One thing should be taken into is the Masternodes functionality. If you know dash, holding a huge sum amount of DASH will generate you passive income. This is also for STASH. I've only invested a few but incase this one blows, i'm going to get a decent return. If this dies, idk because i invested only money what i can afford to lose.",False

But it's a mistake to fall for these discounts because, if BTC appreciates just a tiny bit, your BTC value in the ICO drastically drops, and imagine this ICO was prior BTC last year's final pump, so I thought the 60% off (or so?) I got from the ICO pre-sale was going to protect my investment but it really didn't at all. Also I've been falling more out of love with the idea of masternodes the more I see how projects are using them: No real intrinsic value other than holding the coins. I don't want a masternode to just give me a certain amount of coins over time, I want a functional masternode that brings utility to the whole network. Time is more important than price, and masternode ROI usually is less than the actual cost of opportunity you have from holding one. Specially if you FOMO'ed buying one. Of course, the masternode premise is the, security, obfuscation that brings to transactions, but that can be done in a different way. The zs-Snarks protocol was also one very strong thing that brought me to STP.",False

Hi Everyone,  We would like to provide you all with an update of the final numbers for the STASHPAY (STP) Token distribution.  All STP Tokens have now been distributed and the Stash Vault has been frozen.  If you cannot see your tokens in your address, make sure you save the following parameters in your wallet:  Token Contract Address: 0xecd570bBf74761b960Fa04Cc10fe2c4e86FfDA36  Token Symbol: STP  Decimals: 8  During StashPay token sale 7,144,523 STP Tokens were purchased for a total of 15.548 BTC and 651.79 ETH.  There was also 1,108,150 STP Tokens distributed for bounties and there are 300,000 STP Tokens that will be sent out for the StashPay Draw shortly.  This means there is a total of 8,552,673 STP Tokens in circulating supply. These are the only STP tokens that can be freely bought and sold.  The remaining unsold tokens of 352,555,477 have been placed in the Stash Vault. The Stash Vault has now been frozen and hence these tokens cannot be transferred on the Ethereum blockchain.  The frozen STP tokens in the Stash Vault are an important resource and the intention is to use them for the benefit of the StashPay project. This may include allocating tokens to partnerships, burning tokens to reduce supply or adding them back to the mining pool for the benefit of miners and Inodes. However, it is important to understand that these frozen STP tokens cannot be transferred on the Ethereum blockchain and are out of circulation until the StashPay.IO software is finalized.  Additionally, all team and advisor tokens are also frozen and cannot be transferred until the StashPay.IO software is finished.  Lastly there is 36,291,850 in STP tokens that are being held in the Development and Advisor pool. The team may use these tokens over the next 9 months as an additional resource to help with the project development as well as to attract new talented team members and quality advisors to the project.  So to summaries there is only 8,252,673 STP Tokens in circulation these are the only tokens that can be freely bought and sold. The Stash Vault and all team member and advisor tokens have been frozen until the StashPay.IO software is finalized. These STP tokens cannot be transferred on the Ethereum Blockchain.  The StashPay team has moved to research and development mode. We are exploring various exciting possible partnerships and are looking to add more talent to the team. We will keep you all posted on any developments as they happen.  Regards  StashPay Team",False

Nebula Newsletter February 12th 2018  Greetings everyone!  I hope this recent crash hasn’t affected your portfolios too much! Even if you took a heavy hit like me I am very confident 2018 will be the year we surpass 1 Trillion total market cap so hold strong, we have only just begun!  The Nebula has some great announcements about our new upcoming features! First let’s talk about our launch date. As this is our first exchange it was to be expected that we might run into a few delays, and we have. Nothing major but our private beta will have to be pushed later into the month and we are now shooting for an early March launch of the live public beta.  Nebula aims to be a top exchange and we hope to achieve that through innovation. Here are our current ideas for the future of the exchange:       The 5-Star Review System Think about how the process of researching a cryptocurrency is. Where do you go to ask questions and get opinions? If you go to the currency’s main social channels then you’ll be talking to a room full of people who will say anything to get you to buy it because they are already heavily invested. If you go to a public forum/chat you could run into the complete opposite, people who are invested in the competition and want to turn you away from that coin. Then there are professional reviewers, celebrities, and Youtubers but can you really trust their words when you have no idea how much of their portfolio they have loaded or if their pockets have been lined to promote it? Our solution to this? Public reviews!  The Nebula is going to let the whole world share their opinions by letting all registered users write 5-star reviews on any cryptocurrency they want, a system similar to Amazon. This is perfect because there is a huge influx of new investors that have no idea what they are looking for and need guidance. This system will be a familiar way for both new and old traders to browse and shop for their next investment. On top of that the reviews will benefits the entire crypto space by strengthening real projects and diminishing the effects of scam coins and PumpNDump schemes. The combined scores of these reviews will be shown for each currency and the most thumbed review will get top placement, setting a new standard for researching cryptocurrencies.      The Reputation System Now how do we protect this review system from trolls, bots, and throw-away accounts? With our new Reputation System every registered user will have an always visible “Reputation Level”. You go up in levels by gaining points that are awarded by helping the community. Here is a rough draft of how those points can be earned: •   10 RP a day just for logging in/being logged in •   1 RP for getting a thumb up for a review (no penalty for downvotes to encourage users to write reviews and users can only vote once on a review to leave a permanent thumb) •   5-15 RP rewarded by moderators for good behavior such as answering user questions and being funny/helpful. (This helps prevent our moderators from being spammed with common questions and encourages a friendly environment) •   Users can gift each other as much RP as they want •   25 RP for referring a new user with a referral link (Both users get 25RP) •   25 RP bonus to people who are holding $100 or more of a coin when it goes “Supernova” to get the Trollbox really excited (can't trigger more than once a day) So with this system each reviewers level will clearly show how much they have contributed to the community so far. Would you trust a 5-star review from someone who is level 3 over a user who is level 35 and gave it 2.5 stars? Additionally to combat spam and PumpNDump groups you won’t be able write reviews OR rate reviews until you have reached a minimum level. Gaining levels will reward users with different name colors and random emojis of differing rarity to use on the trollbox/reviews or trade with each other, adding another layer of fun to the exchange with the collectible aspect! If you have any emojis you would like to donate to the prize pool send them to Nathan@nebula.exchange       Shining Stars Want everyone to know about your project? For a nominal fee you can take the place of our Shining Star which will appear as a pop-up when users login to the exchange. You can write anything here such as  a detailed explanation of the coin or you can use it to promote announcements/events. We are still discussing pricing and how long the shining stars stay up but I imagine this will be an extremely viable option for promoting your product in the future.      An Interactive Nebula Experience Our final idea is purely for entertainment value and will be the last to be implemented. We hope to turn our front page into a beautiful sprawling animated Nebula cluster with 20 unique/varying stars. The logos of the current top 20 volume coins will appear over these stars and compete for their place among them. The #1 volume is the coveted Supernova and when someone takes this spot it will be cause for celebration as it is announced across the exchange and everyone who owns $100 or more of that currency gets a big RP bonus. You can imagine how excited the community could get rooting for their favorite investments to go Supernova!  With these new features we hope to fill multiple roles with the Nebula. Become a top trading exchange, a haven for projects that can't find affordable listing, and a community with a focus on trust, fairness, and fun.  See you among the stars!  -The Nebula Team",False

I'm slowly looking around the crypto environment to see what more established coins have done in their past development lineage, so we can learn from their successes & roadblocks as they progressed. There's no use our community making similar mistakes when we can learn from more developed communities.  Looking through Dash, Pivx (and many other developed/larger coins)etc. discussions (from their early days) to see how their milestone success stories  have unfolded and how their communities came to consensus on governance issues as they moved forward.  I know at our early stages we will need to discuss several key issues that will affect how we (as a community) move forward, develop and engage a broader user base (be they coin end-users or inode investors or merchants willing to use an ERC-20 compliant coin).  I'm particularly interested in successful:  - Wallet UI developments (continuous improvements in user interface, inclusion of pockets & timelocks, utilizing social media to send funds between friends, sending funds via username vs encryption addresses) etc. - Masternode UI developments (allowing easy adoption/hosting for everyday coin investors, to improve a broader acceptance to improve the coins [Suspicious link removed]munity Engagement / Social Media successes (i.e. well developed webpage UI. Weekly video updates from the devs (just a couple of minutes, unscripted), informative media engagement (e.g. providing an overview of the coin functionality, explaining our inode functions and rewards as well as the coins privacy functions) & other social medial engagement success strategies, there are many examples the community can adopt moving forward. As well as community engagement for investors in inodes or mining & how they can best be serviced within the community) - Governance Priorities (as a staged roll-out) for communities. Such as, how to best allocate funding at each stage of the coin/communities development to fit a longer-term adoption structure - Development team strength success stories. Talent attraction & development success stories that may help prioritize governance funding spend as a total of funding allocation, moving forward.  I'm happy to acknowledge what I like in other coins and see if it's a fit for our project, so it can be discussed and possibly adopted in future developments.  I know I've missed many other area's, so I'm happy to have other area's added from the community. Best thing is, I do believe that the success of the coin is in our hands (as a community) and if we can work cohesively towards a common goal that benefits the end-user experience, developers and investors will be rewarded.  So it looks like the devs aren't the only ones who are busy! We've got alot of work to do too!",False

I know the Stash Dev Team have been hard at it for the rollout of the project.  My understanding is that excess unsold coins were to be burnt (from the whitepaper?). A circulation of under 10M would greatly increase the overall value longer-term. With our voting rights, one of the first things we may wish to propose is the fate of the unsold tokens.  A small part for future talent attraction, small part of promotion & a burn of the majority left would possibly be a consideration. This would allow the Dev Team to attract further talent from a thinly stretched talent pool, with a coin that has a greatly increased value due to a low circulation.  Just a thought, oh and nice to meet you all.",False

As the launch of the StashPay ICO coincided with the whole Asian restriction on ICO participation a lot of potential investors were missed.  Those of us that did participate could now vote on a burn of the unsold coins. This would lower the overall circulation and increase the potential value of each token. I'm not sure what the overall final total in circulation would be, but it would be greatly reduced from the proposed levels outlined in the whitepaper. (500,000,000 in ICO with 997,800,000 total)  Further, with an increase in token value, each masternode becomes more valuable to the holders. To those wishing to seek profitable masternodes within the crypto community it may help in putting StashPay on their radar.  For the dev team, the increase in token value should allow them to successfully attract dev talent to the project also.  This would then allow the team to continue ongoing development of the project and improvements that are appearing across the community to wallet integration and ease of use for 'non-crypto' individuals.  I'd be interested to see what the community think on something along these lines.",False

From where I stand I wouldn't even risk a dime and usually I don't mind giving a couple hundred into a small project here and there. But this thing has scam written all over it. If I'm wrong I'm open to be educated here by the devs. So let's start:  1. No Github activity. no-no 2. No real exchange listings. Not much of a surprise since the ICO didn't raise that much and exchange listings are expensive nowadays. 3. 2 devs on the team and several bankers. So at the moment over half of the team can't really contribute with regard to R&D. The videos on the Facebook page of one of those guys are just ridicolous. Which Asset Manager who wants to be taken seriously makes a promotional video with his phone on a balcony? You wonder why nobody underwrote the ICO? 3. Website registered to a PO box in Panama. Are you for real? lol see yourself  https://www.whois.com/whois/stashpay.io   My guess is the devs will dump what they can at the first pump since the ICO didn't really pan out. These are just my 2c though. I don't have to be right but lots of red flags here.  One more thing. I know a lot of people are saying they are working on a product. But to be honest there are other projects out there where people worked for years and are still working before even considering issuing tokens.  Here no work was done at all except for a little bit marketing on the website. You can get this stuff done on upwork for a couple of hundred bucks. I mean I can also market an ICO an hire people afterwards to do the heavy lifting. Anyone can do this.,False

We want to make sure the community is fully informed with the facts. Hence in regards to the points made above our responses are as follows:  1.   Yes it is true that right now the StashPay Github only has the STP contract code. However the team also uses a private depositary which will progressively be made public once parts of the code our tested and ready to be released. We encourage everyone to keep an eye on the StashPay Github, we will provide an update to the community once we start to make code public so everyone can review.   2.   The STP tokens is currently listed on Ether Delta and Idex to which you can find the links below.     https://etherdelta.com/#0xecd570bbf74761b960fa04cc10fe2c4e86ffda36-ETH     https://idex.market/eth/stp  Yes these are smaller exchanges but as mentioned exchanges these days can charge very high fees to list. The team's core focus at this stage is development not day to day    fluctuations in the token price. Ultimately the product development will dictate the value of    the project and will open up the door for the token to be traded on larger exchanges once StashPay.io is launched.  3.   We view  having finance professionals on the team as an advantage for the project. For a Cryptocurrency to be successful it is important to understand the economics  and incentives of the project in addition to having a good development team. Over time we plan to attract additional developers to the project and partner with external development companies to leverage our in house team.  4.   The link provided to the website registration and address is for Whois Guard. It was provided automatically by our hosting provider when the StashPay website was set up. Anyone today can register a website anywhere in the world we don't see how this is an issue.   In terms of the team dumping their tokens on first ""pump"" this is simply not true. As those that have knowledge of the project would know that all team and advisor tokens are frozen and cannot be traded on the Ethereum blockchain.  Everyone can read the STP smart contract to check this.  In order for the team tokens to have any worth the StashPay team must deliver a project of value. Clearly this aligns the team's interests with all StashPay (STP) owners. Lastly we understand and expect that some people will call StashPay a scam as we have seen Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash and may other great projects get called a scam also. It's unfortunate that some people have been and will be misled by such false claims.  Ultimately the value of the StashPay project will be based on the quality of final blockchain developed. The StashPay team is committed and will continue to work hard to deliver the best project we can. We believe StashPay will have many attractive features such incentivised nodes, high transaction capacity, instant transactions and low transaction fees that once fully implemented will appeal to the crypto community.  Regards  StashPay Team",False

All STP Tokens have now been distributed and the Stash Vault has been frozen.  If you cannot see your tokens in your address, make sure you save the following parameters in your wallet:  Token Contract Address: 0xecd570bBf74761b960Fa04Cc10fe2c4e86FfDA36  Token Symbol: STP  Decimals: 8  During StashPay token sale 7,144,523 STP Tokens were purchased for a total of 15.548 BTC and 651.79 ETH.  There was also 1,108,150 STP Tokens distributed for bounties and there are 300,000 STP Tokens that will be sent out for the StashPay Draw shortly.  This means there is a total of 8,552,673 STP Tokens in circulating supply. These are the only STP tokens that can be freely bought and sold.  The remaining unsold tokens of 352,555,477 have been placed in the Stash Vault. The Stash Vault has now been frozen and hence these tokens cannot be transferred on the Ethereum blockchain.  The frozen STP tokens in the Stash Vault are an important resource and the intention is to use them for the benefit of the StashPay project. This may include allocating tokens to partnerships, burning tokens to reduce supply or adding them back to the mining pool for the benefit of miners and Inodes. However, it is important to understand that these frozen STP tokens cannot be transferred on the Ethereum blockchain and are out of circulation until the StashPay.IO software is finalized.  Additionally, all team and advisor tokens are also frozen and cannot be transferred until the StashPay.IO software is finished.  Lastly there is 36,291,850 in STP tokens that are being held in the Development and Advisor pool. The team may use these tokens over the next 9 months as an additional resource to help with the project development as well as to attract new talented team members and quality advisors to the project.  So to summaries there is only 8,252,673 STP Tokens in circulation these are the only tokens that can be freely bought and sold. The Stash Vault and all team member and advisor tokens have been frozen until the StashPay.IO software is finalized. These STP tokens cannot be transferred on the Ethereum Blockchain.  The StashPay team has moved to research and development mode. We are exploring various exciting possible partnerships and are looking to add more talent to the team. We will keep you all posted on any developments as they happen.  Regards  StashPay Team",False

I just want to see this coin at least at ICO value so speculation could start above there considering we trusted the team our BTC and ETH so with the appreciation of this coins, the team therefore has more capital in terms of fiat value. So that should already help pushing the price already making a floor above 10 cents and what sell orders  are like at 1 cent? That's a joke. if we would've invested fiat, then price should stay at 10 cents, but we didn't invested fiat  we invested digital assets that didn't depreciated in value, in fact, they did the complete opposite, so this token should reflect that too if the team is just not playing with our money and actually are working to make stashpay stand out. ICO are meant to slaughter investors because 1/100 ICOs is not a scam, ICOs are risky for the investor, and competitive for the devs because there's so many other projects out there, that stashpay can't just sit on the money and do nothing.

All coins and tokens are trying to benefit from btc price: trading at a dirt cheap price. People seem to want more % of stash because of being afraid of devs dumping tokens so they just want their holdings to be stronger also in relation to the team's holdings. If tokens aren't going to be burnt, the initial investor should not be worried because it's because of him that the project's funding started in the first place so the initial investor should have kind of a priority due to being such a small percentage. If people investing in the ICO were less than 5% then I don't see why those unsold tokens couldn't potentially benefit initial investors that kept long term holdings in the future.  But is true, only true development and community engagement can make this token grow. I think trading will go well after stabilising a strong community.

In terms of the Token-Sale while we would have liked to have sold more tokens we are reasonably pleased with the sale especially given the timing around the fork. Were also very happy with the large STASH community (4,000 +) that has been built as a result of the sale.  As we have always said we will continue to develop the project irrespective of the amount of tokens sold and soon plan to add new developers to our team.  Additionally, as it is clearly outlined on the stashpay website any tokens not sold during the sale will be allocated to the Company and will be sent to the STASH Vault and locked until 27-09-2018.  Our overwhelming goal is to use these tokens to increase the value of the project for the benefit of all tokens holders and the community as a whole. We plan to do this by using company tokens to attract retain and remunerate additional developers, for marketing purposes and to increase the rewards to the miners and Incentivizednodes by increasing the block reward in the STASHPAY.IO software.  This means that a large proportion of the company tokens will be used to incentivize long term holders of tokens by reducing initial circulating supply and increasing future rewards for STASHPAY.IO miners and Incentivizednodes.  It’s taken a lot of hard work to organize the token-sale and going forward we plan to continue to work hard to develop the best product we can.   Were excited about moving the project forward and we apricate all the support from the community.",False

The majority of participants have done so and we have had no issues.  However it appears that some individuals don't understand the mechanics of the STASHPAY Token and as a result of being uniformed, some have started to spread false rumours. Therefore we have taken the time to write this message in order to clear up any misconceptions.  Granted the STAHSPAY project is not straight forward and the following should be understood by anyone trying to evaluate the project based on facts.  STASHPAY Tokens are ERC-20 compatible tokens distributed on the Ethereum blockchain.  STAHSPAY Tokens which are based on the Ethereum blockchain will be fixed and non transferable within 48 hours of 27-09-2018.  To reiterate that's 27-09-2018. Which means that for around 10 months once the STASHPAY Tokens are distributed, after the sale is over, owners of STASHPAY Tokens will be able to, if they wish, transfer and trade their tokens.  STASHPAY tokens can be transferred to any compatible wallet until 27-09-2018.  Also it is important to understand that were building open source STASHPAY.IO Software which is designed for an independent blockchain separate to Ethereum. However we will not configure and/or launch any public blockchain adopting the open source STASHPAY.IO Software. Any launch of a blockchain that adopts the STASHPAY.IO software will occur by members of the community.  It is also important to understand that prior to 27-09-2018 STASHPAY Token owners will need to map a public key to their account in order for their STASHPAY Token balances on the Ethereum blockchain to be recognised on any blockchain that may be launched based on the STASHPAY.IO software.  Instructions on mapping  public keys to STAHSPAY Token balances will be provided once the Token sale is over.  STASHPAY Token owners that do not map a public key to their Ethereum address before 27-09-2018 will not have their STASHPAY Token balance recognised on any blockchain that adopts the STAHSPAY.IO software.  After the 27-09-2018 once the STASHPAY.IO open source software is released any member of the community will be able to generate a JSON file containing the mapped balances of STASHPAY Tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and launch a STASHPAY blockchain using the STASHPAY.IO open source software.  Like with any new project there are risks involved. The STASHPAY.IO Software is complex and has its own specific risks. Including no guarantees that the STASHPAY.IO Software will ever be adopted, the STASHPAY.IO Software will be adopted as developed by us and not in a different or modified form, a blockchain utilizing or adopting the STASHPAY.IO Software will ever be launched and a blockchain will ever be launched with or without changes to the STASHPAY.IO Software and with or without a distribution matching the fixed, non-transferable STASHPAY Tokens balances.  Having said all that, the STASHPAY team will continue to work hard to develop the STASHPAY.IO software and ultimately it will be up to the community to launch and adopt the STASHPAY.IO software on any blockchain. So far we have had a lot of support from a lot of great individuals that have joined the STASHPAY community. We hope the community will continue to grow as the project evolves.  We welcome any questions.",False

Stash cryptocurrency owners will be able to set up Incentivizednodes and in return for providing resources to the network will get paid Stash Cryptocurrency from part of the block reward.  STASH GOVERNANCE AND FUNDING SYSTEM Q3 2018  Stash will be opened to the community for funding and governance proposals which will allow Stash to start implementing any new features that are voted for by the Incentivizednodes. The Stash Governance and Funding System will help the Stash Open Decentralized Autonomous Network (ODAN) to function efficiently and evolve organically while utilizing the collective intelligence of the Stash community.  STASH MOBILE APP Q3, 2018  Stash will develop a mobile app that will allow Stash users to store and anonymously send and receive Stash cryptocurrency to anyone. The Stash mobile app will allow you to easily use your phone for everyday transactions. In addition, you will be able to monitor your Stash cryptocurrency reward payments from running Incentivizednodes.  PRIVATE MESSAGING Q4, 2018  Integrate a peer to peer private messaging system (StashChat) that allows all Stash users to send shielded messages using zero knowledge cryptography. StashChat will be a completely anonymous communication network with no third-party intermediaries that will allow users to communicate privately both individually and in groups.  DECENTRALIZED API Q1, 2019  Stash will launch a Decentralized API that will utilize random groups of Incentivizednodes which will eliminate the need for software developers to store, validate and download the entire Stash blockchain while still proving them with the security and privacy of an Incentivizednode.  STASH DEBIT CARD Q2 2019  Create a STASH debit card that will allow Stash owners to securely pay with their Stash in person, online or over the phone with any merchant that accepts Fiat currencies. As a result, this will allow Stash owners to purchase virtually any product or service they wish with their STASH and will increase the utility of the Stash Cryptocurrency.  DIRECT STASH TO FIAT CURRENCY CONVERSION Q3 2019  Create a direct payment facility that allows users to directly exchange their STASH for Fiat currency and vis versa. The STASH Conversation Gateway will be integrated into the STASH wallet and mobile app. It will allow users to seamlessly and directly transfer between USD, EUR, CNY, AUD and STASH rather than having to go through exchanges or third-party providers.",False

However Zcash has a centralized governance structure where as STASH will have a decentralized decision making framework which will allow the community to have a say in terms of how STASH should evolve. Additionally STASHPAY.IO will provide a feature that allows owners to run inodes where they can generate additional tokens. Any tokens that are tied up as collateral can reduce the circulating supply as well as volatility.  So the main difference is that STASH is bringing together a number or proven block-chain features into one digital currency. Please see our whitepaper for further details. Thanks.",False

The competition is growing every day so it's hard to keep up and stay at the top. Devs should check Monero it has some similar points as STASH. I have few questions: 1. 20mb blocks accepted every 150 sec. This is about 570 blocks a day. And this is 11gb of data every day. Are you offering solution like dynamic size of blocks or does even ''empty'' block takes 20mb of space? 2. So if you want to start earning STT with full node you must send 10k of STT to an address, where it must be sitting untill you are actively involved in earning STT with full node. Is reward sent to this address or other? 3. Is reward 45% 45% fair? Full node has a lot less ''work'' to do (electricity cost). 4. Tell me more about self governance. It's like voting system right? What are expected duration of this votes(few days,weeks, hours?). For example: BCC-BTC fork, some nodes implemented new rules some didn't. Wouldn't still be the same with Stash? Even if majority will agree of something, minority can take it's path? How would Stash solve this problem? (I'm still learning about blockchain technology, so I may be understanding something wrong) 5. About debit/credit card, what does it make it so special? In my opinion soon there will be lot of different cards which will be supporting cryptos. Probably big problem for now is that you must give ''owner''(issuer of card) money first then they take x€ worth of crypto from your money every time you buy something.",False
