Download Now!  We have got news — Velix.ID MVP is out on Play Store!  The MVP, acronym for minimum viable product,  is a prototype on which the product is expected to expand further. The current Velix.ID MVP allows users to create a profile and update their basic PII details on it, along with uploading a photograph. These details are stored on the user’s own device or on their cloud, but no information is stored with Velix.ID.  The app will be expanded further to include authentication log of the details, support further levels of PII, and allow attestation of information through blockchain. Some of these changes will be announced in the coming days, and the rest will occur post the token sale.  Here’s an introduction to the existing MVP for you.  You download the MVP from the Google Play Store here.  https://blog.velix.id/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screenshot_20180416_223125-576x1024.jpg  When you open the Velix.ID app, you get the following screen allowing you to either generate a new Velix ID or logging in with an existing Velix ID by using the ‘Restore Velix.ID’ option.  Technically, it is possible to create multiple Velix IDs with the same email address, since the data is never stored with Velix.ID and there’s no way to tell if an email address is attached to an existing Velix ID.  https://blog.velix.id/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screenshot_20180416_214339-576x1024.jpg  To create a new Velix ID, users are simply required to enter their name and email address.  https://blog.velix.id/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screenshot_20180416_214428-576x1024.jpg  Ta-da!

From the settings, you can choose to backup your data on Google cloud, in case you end up erasing your phone’s data. If you want to later restore this data, you can do so using the restore button in the settings as well:  https://blog.velix.id/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screenshot_20180416_214638-576x1024.jpg  The Velix.ID crowdsale begins April 17.

While some ICOs are full of gimmicks, some are really profitable. It is imperative to do proper researches before investing in ICOs. Here are some Dos and Don’ts with regards to investing in ICOs:  Do’s  Study the Whitepaper: Before the release of an ICO, the company usually releases a whitepaper first, and this whitepaper contains elaborate details about the whole project, including the idea, and process to achieve the idea. Here are some things to look out for when going through the whitepaper: What the idea is and it is being made for. The details of the team members and advisors, including what they’ve achieved prior to starting this ICO. Availability of a market for the service/product, including their competitors. Technical low down of the project’s execution. The distribution of the token or coin, including its usage. Roadmap of the project’s future. ICO details, including the number of tokens, hard cap, distribution, crowdfunding etc. If you check the whitepaper and it has detailed explanation about the list above, the ICO just might be credible.  Check the Team: It is important that you check the team out, to ascertain if they are really capable of handling the project. Check each member out via their social profiles, with that you are able to get some information about them and their past achievements. Check popular Cryptocurrency Forums: org is a very popular forum that usually has announcements of ICOs, search for the particular ICO you are looking for, then go through questions and answers between forum members and the ICO team, and it is also important to check for words like pre-mine, mlm, scam, etc. Social Presence: Check their different social media accounts and check how active they have been, no new age company that wants to thrive can do so without a great deal of help from the social media, if they have a social media account with low number of followers, and low activity, then there may be a problem.  Don’ts  Don’t Risk Everything: Like the proverbial saying of not putting all your eggs in one basket, the same principle applies to ICOs, it is not advisable to invest all you have in one ICO. Do not Sell at the First Opportunity: Be patient, the prices of these cryptocurrencies keep increasing, hence do not jump at the first opportunity to sell. Do not Invest what You cannot Afford to Lose: This is the ultimate don’ts of all, and it is self-explanatory.    If you have some doubts about the “dos”, that may just be a clear indication of an absolute “don’t”.  Our Crowdsale is LIVE!! To participate visit Velix.ID.

On Joining Velix.ID,  he said:  As an investor in some of the major crypto exchanges in India, I think Identity is a major problem for the sector. While there have been blockchain identity startups that have done well, it is appreciable that Velix.ID has chosen a target market that is completely devoid of any blockchain identity startups, and that they have their own idea and implementation of the technology. I figure that India as an emerging global economy has a lot of potential that can be further explored with blockchain technology, and it will be thrilling to see the decentralization of Identity for a 1.3 billion strong population. I believe that Velix.ID has a strong team and that is why I am glad to be an advisor for this project!  Simon has been one of the earliest supporters of Bitcoin and has been involved in the industry pretty much since the beginning. His experience in the industry — having already raised a highly successful token sale — makes him a vital value addition to the team.  Velix.ID team gives Simon a warm welcome!

Terrorists are using your Identity  A new kind of Identity fraud has been recently discovered which has created ripples in the U.S Government. This a new kind of fraud which typically uses an existing person’s identity to apply for credit or government benefits.  How do they do it?  Criminals randomly choose a SSN that wasn’t issued prior to 2011, when the [Social Security Administration] changed the rules on how SSNs were issued,By choosing a number from this range, they can have reasonable confidence that there won’t already be a history of another person using that SSN. Many sites on the internet provide guidance on how to do this.  Once the synthetic ID is established via the generated credit profile (or credit file), the criminal again applies for credit, gets credit established, and then applies for multiple credit cards. The criminal in the final “bust out” stage waits until the credit score is high enough to yield a large payout, then charges the maximum on the card, as spelled out in a report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO).  This kind of fraud has given a new lease to terrorists and criminals to infiltrate in the government systems and reap its benefits to fund their major terrorists operations. This kind of fraud has forced the securities agencies to work day and night to find out loops in the current system and also detect if there is anyone helping from inside the government system .

As the world has started to adapt blockchain technology, it is being used to scale government services. The technology allows the government to create records of data with significant level of security, speed and transparency. The blockchain accessible ledger is useful to keep a track of birth certificates, business license and land registry. The technology eliminates the dependency on notary, lawyers and government officials.  Later on, the government can create algorithms and rules that allow individuals to automatically share their data with a third party, once the third party fulfills the rules of the smart contract.

The cryptocurrency industry is making huge strides in becoming part and parcel of mainstream life. Trading in the digital assets is becoming bigger and bigger by the day, with the market currently commanding hundreds of billion in worth.  Despite its giant strides in becoming a fixed part of the mainstream psyche, the debate still rages on, on the viability of cryptocurrencies and whether they will last the marathon. Opponents of the crypto industry say that this is an industry with very little for users to rely on in terms of accountability, or insurance, as there is still little or no legal framework as far as the industry is concerned.  On the other side of this epic debate are those who firmly believe in the future and everlasting viability of the cryptocurrency industry, they point to many convincing facts about the cryptocurrency revolution some of which include:  1) Tranparency  2) Decentralization  3) Incorruptibility  The debate about the cryptocurrency world’s viability going into the future might be far from over, but if the previous year is anything to go by, this industry will soon convince most if not all of its detractors. This is because the fact that blockchains once created cannot be stopped coupled with the huge value and real life solutions the industry is giving the world in many spheres of life, the fact is that this is an industry that is here to stay with us for the foreseeable future, and will be one of the great sources of change in the way things are done in the world this century.

But this is no ordinary billionaire, as he is not worth in any ordinary currency. Satoshi Nakamoto the creator of Bitcoin has eluded all efforts to pinpoint his whereabouts or identity for that matter. Much like the cryptographically stable currency he authored which has so far created an over half a trillion dollar industry within the last 9 years, Nakamoto still remains a subject of mystery and fascination as there is still no definitive proof he has ever been identified.  Theories and Conspiracies  There are those that believe that Satoshi is not a person but a pseudonym for a group that worked together to give birth to Bitcoin, while others are more inclined to theories where certain individuals were singled out to be potentially the Nakamoto the world is in awe of. Some of these individuals include:  Dorian Nakamoto: When you share a surname with the most elusive celebrity on earth, there is always a fair chance you will be mistaken for them at one time or the other. Dorian Nakamoto a Japanese American living in California was among the most celebrated “findings” of who the Bitcoin creator was. With a background as a physicist and with previous work experience on classified government defense projects, Dorian Nakamoto was chased up and down by journalists who believed he was the true Nakamoto that created the first stable decentralized currency in the world. However Dorian Nakamoto consistently denied that he was indeed the creator of Bitcoin, and had never heard of it before the media frenzy began. Dorian’s claim was later backed up by one of Satoshi Nakamoto’s online accounts where he posted “I am not Dorian Nakamoto”  Hal Finney: If there was anyone that categorically knows the actual identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, then it is the man with whom the first ever Bitcoin transaction was made. Hal Finney a developer and a cryptography enthusiast was the man Satoshi Nakamoto made the first transfer of Bitcoins to. Finney like Dorian denied any attempts to label him as Satoshi, but Dorian Nakamoto’s defense was not helped by the fact that Finney happened to live a few blocks from him.  Craig Wright Steven: While others a denying any link to Bitcoin and being Satoshi Nakamoto, Craig Steven Wright is one that covers the role and has consistently claimed to be the man. Wright is an Australian developer and businessman who has given interviews to BBC, the Economist and other high profile publications claiming he has conclusive proof to the world that he is indeed Nakamoto. But his claims have been largely refuted as Wright who covets the limelight so much could not have been able to hide under billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin without splashing some out to prove he is the man.  As of present the search for Nakamoto is no closer to being concluded, and there is little hope that it will ever reach a fruitful end. Satoshi Nakamoto like the industry he created is one that covets his privacy, and it does help being the creator of one of the most advanced cryptography infrastructures ever created, to keep his identify away from everyone.

It can be harnessed to do a great deal of good, and it can also be used for more sinister things that can bring much harm to humanity as a whole. Information which was the exclusive forte of a few elites around the world with a vast pool of resources suddenly became free to access by an average citizen of this planet.  But with the rise of the internet, a lot of other problems also came up, as online transactions in every shape or form came under the threat of a new form of identity theft. This growing menace is not just a stuff of fiction or a matter of criminals gaining access to sensitive private info about our lives, it is about hard cold cash too. Identity theft cost billions and billions of dollars every year, and increasingly it’s not just people like you and me that are bearing costs alone, it is the multi-national companies as well.  Every international business that deals with the internet (which practically means all of them) lives under the perpetual fear of online hackings of their systems. From Microsoft to Dell and IBM there is the increasing awareness among Multi-National Cos for a drastic solution for these nefarious activities that cost them billions of dollars in compensation, security upgrade and even more in the trust of their customers.  For IBM and Microsoft for example, the Blockchain technology is what looks like the perfect solution to that will not only solve the identity theft crisis, it will also be able to achieve that under the most cost-effective, and with the permanency that is required for this sector.  IBM which is among the biggest companies to have seen the potential of the blockchain technology for quite some time now has a whole blockchain department. The giant tech company hopes to be among the first to hit this new fertile green filed, and one of its grand projects which is now well underway is in partnership with another Multi-National, in the form of Maersk.  The partnership seeks to provide shippers with an all-convenience platform that will provide incorruptible shipping data as well as replace all present paperwork with a completely digital system that everyone can trust.  Companies like Microsoft have also taken up this call, and one of the most cutting-edge identity verification solution companies out there has been Velix.ID. This is a company that will provide everyone with the ultimate online ID wherever they might go without the hassle or security concerns with present paper-based systems. There is no problem that defies having a solution, and Velix.ID proves this one more time with the identity verification problem that has previously defied all solutions.

When we talk about this revolutionary technology, a lot of people understandably bring Bitcoin, Litecoin as well as other crypto coins to mind. Now, this is true only for the early days of his burgeoning industry as it has since grown to be applied in virtually every single sphere of business and life as a whole. Utility tokens are now the way to go, as platforms offering actual services in certain niches, now offer their users the chance to pay for the access of such services without needing to go through banks and their middlemen, or even standalone cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for that matter.  It is every expert’s belief that 2018 will be the year of the tokens, as a result of a number of reasons some of which include:  Maturation of the Industry: The year 2017 saw an explosion of the number of ICOs all around the world, largely thanks to the accessibility of the Ethereum blockchain which made the creation of DApps easy. A lot of these ICOs have a timeline of a year or so to become fully operational and ranging from the provision of smart electricity grids, to the tracing of goods through their supply chain, the industry is growing at a breakneck speed and fast reaching maturity. Even the banking industry giants such as JP Morgan are diluting their harsh rhetoric against cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology as a whole, as some of the promises made by these new startups are beginning to shape up.  New Titans In The Making: One of the other reasons why we are most likely to see the explosion in the value of utility tokens around the world much more than we might see in coins, is the fact that with the maturity of ICO startups comes the possibility that they will turn out to be shapers of industry in the times ahead. Who would not love to buy a stock of the next Amazon or Apple while it is still trading for a little over a dollar? Astute investors knowing that the blockchain technology is going nowhere and as such are on the lookout for the next big thing that is built on it, Utility tokens will see a boom in demand and an equal appreciation in their prices.  Ease of Access to Services: Buying a phone through a centralized marketplace often requires a bit of wait, steep charges and highly inefficient payment modes, The blockchain technology with the aid of utility tokens is ridding users of all the problems that plague their transactions, and make their buying and selling activities as seamless and hassle-free as possible. All one needs is access to the utility tokens of a certain platform which are traded freely on the markets. With greater acceptance of these tokens and a wider use, their value seems sure to go only one way, which is up.

In search of solutions, companies such as Velix.ID have settled on the blockchain technology as the silver bullet that will rid us of the scourge of unsafe online identities. So what makes the blockchain technology such a perfect weapon for this industry? Here are some very important reasons:  Security: The whole essence of any industry that will come up to tackle online identity theft is to ensure maximum security. Since the beginning of invention, there has been no single technology that is manmade which defies being hacked or sabotaged by a fellow human being, well, that is until the creation of the blockchain technology. This revolutionary tech which was debuted by Bitcoin has so far proved beyond the capacity of any hacker, group of hackers or even governments to sabotage, or shut down. This all-powerful technology with its legendary incorruptibility is the best chance we all have of bringing sanity to our online identities, a solution that ensures maximum control without invoking fear or stress in us as we go about our daily transactions with businesses around the world.  Accessibility: No matter how good a technology or solution to a problem is, all is for-naught unless it is made accessible to the average human being. The blockchain technology is the ultimate solution when it comes to accessibility. The decentralization of services which the blockchain technology is built with (on its replicated incorruptible public ledger), will ensure that users have constant and instant access to their data whenever they wish. With no single point of failure, the blockchain technology in simple terms will never go offline, which is important for any store of sensitive data.  Affordability: When it comes to providing solutions that are ahead of time and extremely affordable, the blockchain technology with its cryptocurrency applications prove beyond what any centralized systems can offer users. Online identity verification problem is a crisis that affects every single internet user and as such, making its solution universally affordable is very vital. The blockchain technology is the first tech to make an international transfer of money in micro amounts both efficient and affordable. And with the likes of Velix ID in the field of identity verification, the same affordability looks certain t be achieved in this industry as well.  The blockchain technology is one of the most versatile creations of mankind. From the Internet of Things (IoT) to Artificial Intelligence, this century looks set to be defined by a greater standard of accountability and security for internet users, spurred-on by this intriguing (blockchain) technology.

The cryptocurrency world is one of the spheres of business that is among the hardest to grasp, even for the so-called experts in the industry. As at the time of writing this piece there are over 1500 distinct products, coins and tokens, each with its peculiar features and backing technology, and each purporting to solve one problem or the other.  Among the biggest sources of mystery for the general public is what makes a cryptocurrency the likes of Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dash and what makes a utility token, this is what we will be covering in this piece.  Difference between a Coin and a Utility Token  A typical cryptocurrency, which Bitcoin is the first among, is a decentralized digital currency that is built to specifically serve the purpose of being an alternative means of exchange for goods and services that does not require the service of a bank or any other kind of middleman. A crypto coin is a dedicated currency that serves no other purpose and which does not represent shares of any kind of entity.  A Utility Token on the other side is a digital asset that is often also misconceived as a typical cryptocurrency. A utility token serves as an access asset with which an individual can enjoy the services of a particular platform that is also built on the blockchain technology. Unlike coins, utility tokens differ widely in their purpose and usage, as the different platforms offer different services and different modes with which their tokens operate. From paying for energy bills to accessing dental care, utility tokens have a more limited scope of use as they operate mostly within a specific niche, unlike coins like Bitcoin which are universally accepted across the cryptocurrency industry, and the mainstream businesses that accept the digital assets for payment.  What Makes Utility Tokens Valuable  Niche of Operation: A utility token as earlier explained works within a certain niche, in order to pay for the services within such a field. Utility tokens usually gain value as a sub-currency in the cryptocurrency market depending on the size of the niche they cater for. Blockchain platforms that operate in decentralized marketplaces the likes of Amazon, for example, have a huge potential, as customers can get discounts by using their tokens to pay for services or charges instead of using the mainstay coins like Bitcoin  Exchangeability: Another important factor that determines the rise in the value of a utility ten is the ability of its holders to exchange it for another cryptocurrency or sell it off entirely for fiat currency. The more fluid a utility token, the more likely it is that its value appreciates with time.  Scarcity: This is an important principle that has a big effect on the rise in the value of any utility token. The general trend is that the scarcer a token is, the more likely it is that it will gain in value. Tokens that come in inordinate numbers often get any appreciation in their value mostly diluted, while those that are relatively scarce and are finite in their nature often gain value faster and have a greater chance of retaining such value.

The token sale will last a total of 4 weeks, and end on May 15, 2018, or when the 50 Million tokens allotted to the initial token sale are sold out — whichever is earlier.  The token sale had to be paused earlier —after raising 1.4 Million USD— as we needed our time to ensure the security & integrity of our platform and the protect the interests of our investors & community. During the time that we took, a lot of things were thought over, and rampant changes were made to our methodology and structure.  The major change made to the token sale structure is the omission of keeping any minimum slabs for the investments. Instead of keeping different rounds of sales, we have decided to conduct the rest of our token sale in one single phase with varying bonus rates depending upon the amount the investor wants to invest.  The bonus slabs for the Velix.ID token sale are as follows: Amount Invested           Bonus Tokens <0.1 ETH                                0% 0.1 ETH-0.5 ETH                      5% 0.5 ETH-1 ETH                        10% 1 ETH-5 ETH                           20% 5 ETH-10 ETH                         30% 10 ETH-50 ETH                       40%   Other than the standard bonuses offered on the investments, there’re also two special discounts that will exist:  PowerUp: During the first 24 hours of the token sale, there will be an added bonus of 5% VXD tokens on all purchases made within this timeframe, for all Users on the Velix.ID platform. The PowerUp bonus will also be available for the first 24 hours of a new User signing up on the Velix.ID token sale platform.  PowerHour: Velix.ID will announce 2 power hours per week for the entire period of the token sale. There will be an added bonus of 5%  VXD tokens for these periods that will each last 60 minutes. The exact time at which these power hours start will be decided by voting through the community members, and will be announced 24 hours in advance before the Power Hour starts.  The method of participating in the token sale remains the same. The users can sign up on account.velix.id, and create an account — either by entering their information, or using Google or Facebook to sign up.  The Users will have an option to pay in a Cryptocurrency of their choice out of multiple options available. The Users will have to ensure that they are entering a correct ERC-20 compatible Ethereum Wallet Address, where the tokens equivalent to the purchase made will be sent within 24 hours.

Velix.ID is a platform that represents all the unanswered prayers of internet users and is set to provide a sweeping solution t the problems therein. The platform comes with a plethora of cutting-edge solutions which set to make it the dominant company worldwide in this niche. Some of the very practical reasons why Velix.ID will definitely set standards includes:  Convenience: One of the key reasons why our online identity is almost impossible to control and not lose is the fact that we are required to make fresh registrations and fresh entries whenever we interact with a new company on any transaction. This continues repetition is not only exposing us and our data to risks, it is also extremely tedious and unbefitting of tech-savvy users in this century. Velix.ID aims to make all the hassles of proving who you are a thing of the past. As instead of making multiple registrations with every new platform you interact with, Velix.ID offers all companies that wish to do business with you, with a single, seamless and incontrovertible source of your ID info. No more multiple registrations mean less difficulty, giving you and me the ultimate convenience as well rot the globe through cyberspace.  Control: When we drive our brand new Lamborghini on that highway, we feel the thrill of the experience and appreciate the finer things of life, but one thing that sticks to the back of our mind is the fear of losing control of the steering wheel even for a split of a second. This applies to our online identities, as are always conscious of the fact that even years after transacting with a company, we remain vulnerable to attacks and hijacks by hackers all over. Velix.ID is a platform that gives its users an absolute control over their identity. No more depending on your vendor to keep you safe. You choose if and who sees your identity, and you can be absolutely sure that it will not be counterfeited to be used maliciously anywhere in the world.  Incentive: The human being is always receptive to incentive, and this is one of the key drivers of the Velix.ID platform which will ensure the continued thriving of its platform. Unlike present systems where the user gives up control of their identity to companies without any form of payback, the Velix.ID puts you in charge of not just the consent-giving when it comes to your info, it also makes sure that the company you are transacting with pays you something in return for the privilege.
