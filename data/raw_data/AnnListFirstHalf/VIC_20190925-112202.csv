VICoin-cryptocurrency based on VIRTual econOMICS,"'Mining' and 'Digging': critical overview.  What is mining? It is a complex computational process under a special algorithm for the formation of new crypto-currency blocks. Its main disadvantage is the fact that one can hardly earn something on his/her even using the most advanced computers. That is why connecting pools are employed performing joint mining. Upon block production completion, the reward is distributed proportionally according to the enclosed capacity. Thus, the process becomes much easier if renting power through special farms. Mining presumes large and difficult calculations, heavily burdening your computer. At the same time, Internet traffic is minimized during the process, but a large amount of electricity is required. Aforementioned fact raises a big question even in the trivial recoupment of electricity. The whole process of mining is performed by the computer in the automatic mode without your participation. Looking attractive, the process takes on the role of passive income as needing only an Internet-connected computer with special drivers and software. However, for high return you need serious investment.  Are there any other ways of cryptocurrency earning? Yes, there are, but they are very new to the market, thus yet unreliable. Our project, Virtonomics, is already operating on the market for more than 10 years. As known, it is a multiplayer online business simulation game, developing an alternative virtual global economy. Recently announced starting the ICO, we have prolonged the Pre-Sale stage, what makes it more profitable to join the project at the very moment. VICoin is easily converted into game points and back.  In the game, cryptocurrency extraction occurs during the realistic business simulation game process where users set up and develop their virtual companies, trade and compete with each other, expand business ecosystem in a virtual economic space. This way, you do not need to act jointly with people you do not know, as you work for the business you create on your own. More than that, the game itself is an interesting strategic and communicative process, where you are immersed entirely. It depends not on the electricity power of your computer, but on your own success! That is why you can manage your business efficiency and control the process yourself! Accordingly, no special investment is needed, as you can initially buy a product, which pays off in 6 months, and if efficiently managed, brings you up more than 200%!  If going into details, tools and resources for generation and extraction of cryptocurrency ‘fuel’ are special game entities purchased for VIC tokens (e.g., virtual mines, mining farms, power plants, etc.). Cryptocurrency fuel extraction volumes depend on the player’s virtual business success and competitiveness, his/her number and quality of owned virtual mining assets and only that. Every 100 Virts (game points) earned in economic simulator can be converted into 1 VICoin (VIC) and withdrawn from the game to the external market. All in all, Virtonomics provide us with a new, easier way of cryptocurrency generation, available and clear for mass audience.  Join Virtonomics and make sure that cryptocurrency generation can perform as an interesting and educational process, as well as a tool for earning money.

However, the realization of the idea requires huge time and financial investments. Virtonomics has every chance to become a working and interesting project and could easily gain attention from a large audience. After all, to ensure the platform in the network, hundreds of thousands of users would be required on a daily basis.

VICoin-cryptocurrency based on VIRTual econOMICS,"It seems like Bitcoin is getting its head out of the clouds. According to coinmarketcap, its price lost of about 29% during the week and equals now of about $14.000. Capitalization exponential growth turns out to be not quite coherent with the Bitcoin degree of integration into the real life. Undoubtedly, this fact is considered to be one of distinguishing peculiarities of so-called ‘bubble’. According to the majority of analytical forecasts, Bitcoin is to fall three times in 2018-2019, what thus will approximate its capitalization value to a more reasonable one.  Possible reasons of Bitcoin’s decline can be accumulated risks, connected with Bitcoin data storage difficulties in some systems as well as with increase in time and cost of its transactions. Investing in Bitcoin can rightly be called ‘extreme’, and cryptocurrency exchange infrastructure at first sight is struggling with recently established overload. From the other hand, such high volatility is generally very representative for cryptocurrency market, where the significant role is given to political game of main holders.  In addition to the ongoing informational attack towards Bitcoin in terms of Ministry of Finance of Japan and Monetary Authority of Singapore statements concerning its unreliability, there were other events contributing to the fall. Emil Oldenburg, co-founder of Bitcoin.com, declared that Bitcoin has no perspective as a trading currency and sold his holdings. Getting rid of Bitcoin, agents usually invest in its direct rivals, such as BCH. Simultaneously with Bitcoin decline, one can see rapid growth of most altcoins’ rates. Index of dominance has dropped to approximately 50%. More technologically and informatively loaded, altcoins definitely can have a higher potential. What they really lack is mass accessibility. In order to become a mass instrument, altcoin is to provide an easier and clearer way of its generation.  VICoin is based on Ethereum technological platform, which has time and again updated its positions in TOP-10 cryptocurrencies recently, what emphasizes transparent advantages of the system. Moreover, with ‘digging’ (as compared to ‘mining’) being more apprehensible and easier to manage, Virtonomic$ turns VICoin into a massively available alternative cryptocurrency. Analyzing and forecasting cryptocurrency market motion, Virtonomic$ is to meet the basic needs of participants along with highest possible technological standards.  Virtonomic$ is defenitely worth ICO. Make it to the Pre-Sale and purchase VICoin at most favorable terms. For more details visit https://virtonomics.io",False

VICoin-cryptocurrency based on VIRTual econOMICS,"VIRTONOMICS is a fundamentally new paradigm and platform for creation of a mainstream cryptocurrency VICoin (VIC), based on alternative virtual economy development in MMO business simulation    “US pilots started to hone their skills on flight simulators as early as in the 1970s. It proved to be cheaper and in some cases more effective than training sorties. Today, anyone interested can learn the basics of driving using auto simulators or how to build a business in VIRTONOMICS multiplayer game.”  Pavel Durov Founder of Telegram   Virtonomics ICO started on 01 march 2018. 1-st round during 15 march (40% discount) To learn more about the project and to participate in the pre-sale, please visit https://virtonomics.io   VIRTONOMICS (short video) CORE IDEA:  VIRTONOMICS global multiuser business simulator creates its proprietary cryptocurrency, VICoin (VIC), V and an ecosystem for earning the cryptocurrency in an online economic game emulating the formation and development of an alternative global virtual economy. The cryptocurrency is gained during the game in a realistic business simulation where users build and expand their virtual companies, trade and compete with each other, and develop the business ecosystem in the virtual economic environment. The resources and tools for generation and digging of the “fuel” are special game entities purchased for VIC tokens (such as virtual mines extracting natural resources, virtual mining farms, virtual power plants etc). The volumes of “fuel” production for Virts cryptocurrency depend on the success and competitive position of a player’s virtual business, and on the quality and amount of mining assets owned by the user. The user can convert each 100 Virts earned in the economic simulator into one VICoin (VIC) and spin it off the game to the outer market.  A VIRTONOMICS player can act in two ways depending on his ambitions, experience and investment capabilities. 1.   As an investor, owner and CEO of a virtual company who can hire other VIRTONOMICS players as managers; 2.   As a hired manager running certain units (division director) or a functional manager supervising key business functions and processes (marketing, sales, production director). The employer pays for the employee’s work in cryptocurrency. Labor contracts and associated settlements are realized in the blockchain based on Ethereum smart contracts.  VICoin (VIC) cryptocurrency circulates freely, is listed on exchanges and has naturalization channels. The cryptocurrency can buy not only game entities and assets in the virtual economy but also outside real services and goods.  VIRTONOMICS FACTS:  v   VIRTONOMICS.COM is an active and long-standing trust project v   VIRTONOMICS is a massively multiplayer online economic game, being one of the most popular and forward-looking MMO business simulators worldwide v   VIRTONOMICS client base exceeds 2 million registered users v   VIRTONOMICS hits top positions in Google global search by relevant queries such as “online business simulation” and “online business game” with huge organic traffic v   VIRTONOMICS is available in English, Russian and Spanish; German, French and Portuguese versions are under development v   VIRTONOMICS engine is widely used by universities in different countries for teaching the basics of macro- and microeconomics and management as well as by many big corporations for managers’ corporate training    PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED  Tall financial, technological and intellectual hurdles of mining as a means of earning cryptocurrency on the mass market.  Mining as a way of cryptocurrency earning is still very much the preserve of advanced technology geeks. Today, by far the overwhelming majority of people lacking specialized knowledge in both blockchain technologies and cryptocurrency economy is barred from the mining market. The big volume of fairly specific expertise required for understanding blockchain technologies along with the nature of the cryptocurrency market and the ways of gaining from it sets insuperable intellectual and technological obstacles preventing the cryptocurrency from turning to a truly mass instrument based on activities understood by and familiar to that overwhelming majority of people.    We leave block mining to professional and industrial miners and use the produced Ethereum cryptographic blocks as the technological foundation for creation of VICoin cryptocurrency while enabling the bulk of users earning cryptocurrency by purposeful and meaningful actions that are by far more familiar to them. In the context of our project, we refer to such activities as “digging”. What makes us consider the implementation of this principle to be important for the active and large-scale development of the cryptocurrency market? For instance, the total number of people with even superfluous knowledge of blockchain technologies, mining, cryptocurrencies and their mode of operation accounts for no more than 0.01% of the global population, while the share of people having at least a general idea of economy, business, management and entrepreneurship stands at 20%. To make blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies truly large-scale, one needs to give people mechanisms of earning cryptocurrencies by means of a process that is much more familiar and understandable.  SO A TRULY MASSIVE-SCALE CRYPTOCURRENCY IS THE COOPERATION OF MINERS AND DIGGERS!  We build an ecosystem that will enable anyone with basic knowledge of economy, management and entrepreneurship to become a digger who applying and capitalizing on own expertise and skills in order to earn cryptocurrency in a multiuser global business simulator that emulates macro- and micro economical processes along with the interaction of economic agents.  v   We develop an ecosystem of a virtual economy where one can get a return on his investments in the virtual company assets, generating the “fuel” for the cryptocurrency without burning away megawatts of electricity, buying tons of expensive hardware and video cards, or renting space for mining farms. More than that, it will allow direct capitalization on one’s intellectual capabilities, management skills,  labor and time spent on the creation and development of a virtual economy. v   In such ecosystem of a virtual economy, everyone can create and run his own company, invest all available capital in its development and gain convertible cryptocurrency from the investments. v   We create an ecosystem of an alternative economy where the owner and head of a large virtual company generating a sufficient amount of cryptocurrency can hire other people, regardless of their location in order to help managing and scaling up the enterprise, and pay them in cryptocurrency.   BLOCKCHAIN  Using specially realized smart contracts, the Ethereum blockchain will store the data on:  •   the total number of VICoin in circulation; •   the balance of VICoin on player’s account and fund flows; •   purchase and ownership of digging units; •   conversion of Virts game bonuses into VICoin tokens; •   labor contracts between players.  Additionally, the smart contract will implement the functionality of settlements between owners of virtual companies and hired managers according to labor contracts.

Besides the growing but still compact [Suspicious link removed]munity, the project aims at the wide business community and the people looking for tools of operation and earning on the Internet that are clear and available for all.  3.   The project team is one of the strongest in the world in its core field, that of creation of multiuser business simulations and complex virtual economies.  4.   Earning VICoin requires neither expensive mining equipment nor the use of megawatts of electricity. In order to develop a virtual business in an exciting multiuser economic gain one needs little time (starting at 30 minutes a day) and small upfront investments (starting at USD 50).  5.   Actions and decisions of users impact the performance of their virtual companies and, consequently, the amount of cryptocurrency they dig.  6.   VICoin tokens have the status of AppCoins, and being application coins they are free from regulatory risks.  7.   From the moment of issuance VICoin tokens gave a ready-made naturalization channel: external services accept VIC at more favorable terms than fiat money. For example, from the very moment of issuance one can pay in VIC for a wide range of educational services by Simformer at a steep discount of up to 50%. The user can utilize these services himself or resale them to anyone at his own discretion. The number of partner resources will be increased actively.  8.   Unlike the great majority of multiple self-replicating cryptocurrencies, VICoin is based on the creation of a true added value and on the activity of users aimed at building an ecosystem with applied value for the real economy. The true value of creation and expansion of a virtual economy in a global multiuser business simulation lies in the following:  a.   It builds an alternative labor market with guarantees for fulfillment of mutual obligations by employers and employees. To continue expanding and scaling up, owners of large and growing virtual corporations can hire people to manage select units or business functions. Physical location of employees is of absolutely no importance. The employer pays his employees in VICoin directly by using Etherium-based smart contracts. b.   It enables creation of a new generation marketplace to bring together suppliers and customers from the real world in a game environment with minimized communication distance. c.   It lets employers from the real economy select future talented managers from successful players running virtual enterprises. d.   It provides the platform for teaching managers and entrepreneurs of applied skills of business management in a realistic business simulation with no risk for their real-life business. e.   A realistic virtual economy synchronized with OpenData and a market environment formed by the activity of hundreds of thousands players is an invaluable tool and testing ground for modeling and testing market strategies for real businesses ranging from startups to multinational corporations as well as for governments in their economic efforts.

The gameplay is focused on satisfying two basic needs of two main parts of the audiences (in some cases overlapping): 1.   Possibility of obtaining a competitive predictable return on investment in production of liquid crypto currency with a low, accessible entry threshold 2.   Possibility of remote earning without investment, correlated with entrepreneurial, analytical, organizational efforts expended in order to create surplus value of ""generating"" companies that produce liquid crypto currency in the game ecosystem of Virtonomic$  What is Virtonomic$ ecosystem: Gamified alternative virtual economic space with a high degree of authenticity and reasonable simplifications emulating principal macro- and microeconomic processes peculiar for the real world. Virtonomic$ ecosystem aims at utilization and development of mass unclaimed intellectual and time resources of people willing but for various reasons at the moment having no opportunity for self-realization in managing a business or being a top manager.

VICoin-cryptocurrency based on VIRTual econOMICS,"Michael Novogratz was one of the first to predict cryptocurrency rapid growth a few years ago, what was definitely no mistake. In June this year Novogratz was already not so optimistic, explaining that cryptocurrency market experiences the largest bubble ever seen. Besides, the second most popular cryptocurrency (Ethereum) is reaching its maximum.  To the best of our knowledge, bubbles occur in sectors fundamentally changing the world. Undoubtedly, despite being the largest possible bubble, cryptocurrency will continue growing in terms of its price and market value.  There is no use denying advantages of Blockchain technology. If storing information and money using Blockchain, there is no possibility of these data having been lost or forged, so any market participant is able to make sure of your financial solvency.  The number of users with the latest mining equipment is expanding each day, while it is becoming more and more difficult to mine cryptocurrency. Our world is hungry for new ways of earning, accessible for mass audience. According to main market needs, new Virtonomic$ project aims at creation of a new way of cryptocurrency extraction. The project aforementioned is worth while paying attention to, as it is not just a new coin, but an ICO based on the final project, already existing for 10 years. Shortly speaking, Virtonomic$ is a well-known virtual business simulator game.  Expanding the Virtonomic$ project according to existing competences and skills is inevitable on this concrete stage of project realization, as ‘digging’ is easy to understand for mass audience, particularly for people familiar with the basics of business. It is not just a way of fund-raising as for usual ICO, but rather a way of enhancement of a final product.Successful ICO in such case aids in creating a better and more convenient and understandable infrastructure based on the existing and reliable Ethereum technological platform. Additional way of cryptocurrency generation, so-called ‘digging’, occurs during the realistic business simulation game process where users set up and develop their virtual companies, trade and compete with each other, expand business ecosystem in a virtual economic space.  https://innmind.com/articles/1000",False
