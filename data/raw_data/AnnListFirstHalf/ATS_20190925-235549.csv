The issue here is not of a sweepstakes nature or FTC regulations. The issue is that Authorship advertised that they would provide people with a good (ATS tokens) in exchange for a service (promotion of the ICO). Petre and the Authorship team later decided that they didn't want to pay out and simply declared the whole event over. Unfortunately for them, they had already sent out e-mails confirming that some people had completed the advertising service and were going to be paid a certain amount of ATS. To be clear, I am not referring to the e-mails that were received along the way, but rather the withdrawal confirmation e-mails that they sent out after people filled out the form on Sept 14.  Anyone who matches that specific description would potentially have a valid lawsuit against them. No scammer would have a valid lawsuit because Authorship disclosed up front that they would have a zero tolerance policy for fraudulent referrals. Petre and Authorship might have really gotten themselves in some legal troubles though with the decision to not pay out to the people who they had already sent the confirmation e-mails to.",True

Everyone received their ATS tokens if there were no more than 3 registrations from the IP they registered with. We believe that multiple registrations from the same IP is a sign of fraudulent leads and suspended all such accounts.  There are 8158 token holders: https://etherscan.io/token/0x2dAEE1AA61D60A252DC80564499A69802853583A     We would like to apologize for the delay in sorting things out and take the time to address some of your concerns.  Our major issue with the bounty campaign was the fraudulent registrations.  Thousands of such registrations were entered into the system despite our best efforts to prevent this.  Steps we took during our bounty campaign to prevent such registrations:  -Enforced double opt-in on registrations  -Kept track of registration IP/confirmation IP, if they don’t match suspend the account.  -Kept track of the number of visitors each referral link accessed and disabled account where there were no visitors through the referral link but were showing an increasing number of referrals  -suspended accounts were the ETH address used by cheaters was the same, even if accounts had different IP addresses  -suspended account where name/email contained easily identifiable random data  -suspended account registration once a certain number of registrations happened from the same IP address  Despite our best efforts to filter through fake referrals, a high number of them still managed to get through and that was clear to us when the withdrawals form was completed. As a result, we’ve decided to suspend all accounts where there are more than 3 registrations from the same IP.  All payments to qualifying accounts have been completed.... ...",True

View online version   Hi everyone,  The tokens distribution for our bounty campaign has officially ended.  Everyone received their ATS tokens if there were no more than 3 registrations from the IP they registered with. We believe that multiple registrations from the same IP is a sign of fraudulent leads and suspended all such accounts.  There are 8158 token holders: https://etherscan.io/token/0x2dAEE1AA61D60A252DC80564499A69802853583A     We would like to apologize for the delay in sorting things out and take the time to address some of your concerns.  Our major issue with the bounty campaign was the fraudulent registrations.  Thousands of such registrations were entered into the system despite our best efforts to prevent this.  Steps we took during our bounty campaign to prevent such registrations:  -Enforced double opt-in on registrations  -Kept track of registration IP/confirmation IP, if they don’t match suspend the account.  -Kept track of the number of visitors each referral link accessed and disabled account where there were no visitors through the referral link but were showing an increasing number of referrals  -suspended accounts were the ETH address used by cheaters was the same, even if accounts had different IP addresses  -suspended account where name/email contained easily identifiable random data  -suspended account registration once a certain number of registrations happened from the same IP address  Despite our best efforts to filter through fake referrals, a high number of them still managed to get through and that was clear to us when the withdrawals form was completed. As a result, we’ve decided to suspend all accounts where there are more than 3 registrations from the same IP.  All payments to qualifying accounts have been completed.  If you did not receive any tokens, we apologize but your account was suspended and the decision is final. Please do not contact us about, such requests will remain unanswered. We checked the list 3 times to ensure we don’t miss anyone.  If you don’t know how to check if you received the ATS tokens or not, enter your ETH wallet address in etherscan.io and it will show you the tokens, if you received them (many of you used wallets that don’t show tokens by default).  Double and pending payments  Because of the increased amount of payments, some payments have been processed twice by the ETH network (don’t ask us why, theoretically this is supposed not to happen, yet it happened to some payments). To cover the number of tokens needed 1M tokens have been pulled from the authors reserved fund of 20M.  At the same time, some payments have been stuck in “processing” for hours and even days. We went on and checked the transactions log and resent all the failed payments.  User reviews  It has come to our attention that some users are upset about this situation and threatened with leaving bad reviews, calling us all sorts. We understand some people’s frustration and realize it’s nothing more we can do about. We did our best. We also received numerous extortion emails (from people who didn’t even participated in the bounty campaign) threatening to leave bad reviews if we don’t pay specific amounts of tokens. Needless to say, we ignored them all. Bad reviews are a natural thing and everyone is free to spend their time the way they feel appropriate.  Project develoment  Our project development continues regardless and a $4M marketing budget plus thousands of authors already waiting to join the upcoming platform are more than enough to ensure a successful launch and a bright future. This is where a project values stands in: the final product. We value the opinion of the 1% bounty participants, but at the end of the day pumping or dumping the ATS tokens (which we cannot control) has no impact on the successful development of the Authorship platform.  Exchange listing  We’d also like to announce our investors that this entire bounty situation has been discussed with several exchanges, and been told this is a general thing that happens with all ICOs bounties: you can never please everyone and cheaters are a nightmare to deal with messing things up. We are happy to have pleased 8158 token holders. Once things settle and everyone realizes that the distribution is over we’ll be submitting our listing requests as requested by several of you.  80% of the token holders are mostly authors and publishing industry members who look forward to our next year official launch. We would like to thank them all for their vote of confidence as they are an important part of the upcoming platform.  Free time  The Authorship team is going to take a week for free as it’s been a very busy past month. We’ll be returning Monday 25th with news about the exchange listings. Investors can reach us this week at investors@authorship.com for investment related questions.  Once again, we would like to thank everyone who put their trust in our project. We look forward to seeing the project one year from now!

I'll give it another 24hrs, but then I am ramping up the volume as well.

It does not matter how big or small the amount was, fraud is fraud.  If a company like Wirex cheated me out of my Bitcoin Cash during the fork - I will not rest until their business has lost several customers and way more revenue than they took from me.  If Authorship withholds tokens from us for totally arbitrary reasons that were made up AFTER we joined the bounty program - well, make sure that for every person you referred they lose at least 3 potential authors/customers. For every token they owe you, post a friendly review, a glorious tweet, a totally unbiased steemit article...  'Keep the bastards honest' - or make them pick up the soap, if they don't like honest.

It is fully noted.  In the future we'll probably use private funding as we initially intended for this project. This is how we always worked before, with private funding. This was our first meeting with ICOs and the community here, so you can say it was a trial and error and we used to rely on a lot of advice we received here. Not trying to find excuses, just pointing that there are always 2 sides of a story. I realize our mistakes and once again I apologize for this.  Our project development continues as this was our reason of raising funds. I'm positive that this entire situation will be long forgotten once everyone sees us and running and with thousands of authors selling the books through our platform.  Thank you",True

So, dear Authorship, for your next ICO (you will need it after this disaster) a few hints, if you want to run a bounty program:  use a professional referral/affiliate software or 3rd party provider. People have been weeding out fake sign-ups for over a decade. They know how to do it. You obviously did not. Make up your mind. Do not keep changing the rules. Pisses people off, and rightfully so. If you want to discriminate against whole countries, VPN users, the TOR community, etc. -  say so, upfront. Be aware that you would kick Kim Dotcom, Julian Assange, Ed Snowden and probably every digital nomad living in Bali (or Paraguay, like me) as well. Dumb. If you want to work for the world, learn how the world works... E.g. there are whole countries where 90% of users are behind forced proxies. As I wrote in my earlier endorsement for this ICO: the biggest challenge will be to make blockchain usable and painless for people outside the blockchain nerd community. We do not need another nerd circle jerk. You allegedly wanted readers and authors from the real world. But now you scold, blame and insult every 'normal' person who just thought 10 bucks for an email address would be interesting. How many potential users and publishers were among them?  I still think that the basic idea behind Authorship.com is great. Re-gaining trust and countering all the bad press all over the web will be hard.

For those idiots quoting me wrongly, I will be the one who will laugh last when u find out you are holding useless AssToShit Coin when peter will in some days give you the shock of your lives with the most disappoiting update. I believe bittrex and poloniex will not want to list already scam tagged coin and they will send signal to others. And if they want to, they will take advantage of the tide and dictate the worst and ridiculous price for it.

I filled my form successfully on DAY 1 but today is 17th September. No ATS in my address. I am heavily disappointed. I tried to promote ATS but I wasn't able to convince people that's why ended up with basic 75 ATS of sign-up. I thought that at-least I'll get paid for sign-up. But was I wrong?

If one used thor or a vpn service: Screwed. Ip pool is very limited, so the chance of 3+ registrations with the same IP is very possible. If your Internet provider does give you a new ip after reconnect (dsl/mobile) same thing. IP pool limited, next connect, someone else has the IP you had before. You use things (in germany) like ""freifunk"" you are out of the game, limited IP pool. Working in a company and sharing the IP with your co-workers.. very bad thing. Using a Hot-spot : Bye bye.  I picked up, that there are 650.000 tokens left AFTER cleaning out the so called cheaters. Are you really telling me, that 65% of the accounts are fake accounts?? C'mon, that just can't be true! Again: Hooking the account to a IP is the most stupid thing to do! You CAN NOT identify a person by IP address! That's not how the internet is working! This ""3+ from the same IP"" rule is just BS. There are so many other ways to handle this, like cookies, flash cookies and some other things (experts know, won't mention his now) But just filtering by IP address is a thing for novices, you'll end up with exactly that, what's going on now: Shitstorm.  To make a statement here: Me and 6 colleagues did promotion for Authorship. We sent mailings (with pictured instructions for the crypto newbies)  how to participate, how to set up a Wallet, how to register and so on.  All together we, 7 people, should have around 400-420 referrals. Yesterday we asked our refs in another mail if they received any Tokens yet. Most stated: Account suspended (at the time the withdraw form was up) or for now, NOTHING received yet. So what's going on? German IP's all got banned? Telekom, Vodafon, O2? There's only 1 (ONE!) account from the 400+ (until now) that has been payed out.  Again, the 3 Ip rule is major BS, you also could do a ""first letter of email is a V"" rule. I just feel sorry for the time we spent in supporting our list members, I know many of them also invested in the ICO (for that i have to say that the tokens arrived for everyone!)  Hint: Next time make the rules clear and precise before you start doing a campaign like this. Changing rules afterwards, when things have ended, is the much worst thing to do.",True

We should have had 45 days to collect if I remember correctly. I see autorship has in the meantime decided to make some reparations but i admit i have not had the time to read trough all that pages of fud. It would be helpful if there was some summary at the op.  Anyway, I will wait patiently for some more time to see how this will evolve. But if every single honest person who earned 75 tokens doesn't receive them in 45 days from ICO, end it damages autorship credibility in my eyes and I don't intend do be part of such project. I didn't have many referrals but almost all of them are my good friends and I'll pay them all from my pocket if necessary since this was their first venture in crypto world and I don't want it to end with disappointment.

The initial ETH address is correct. If you don't need to change the address, you don't have to submit the form again, so let's just wait for a while?  I hope you cherish their reputation, because before this, more than 90% of the people are very optimistic about the project, will not easily sell their tokens, wait for the exchange, I believe will be very satisfactory results, but this thing yesterday let you doubt, do not want to continue to deteriorate.  Hope everyone can receive the token, and only 75ATS, which represents your integrity! So, we and as always support!",True

I worked hard for this campaign bounty and did everything on the up and up.  My reason was to support my family and I was never given the ats token as promised.  I sent messages on fb and through my email.  I will say this as I don't know much.  My family needs all the help we can get but I won't ask for handouts.  I can do the work but when a company or a coin does not keep their word and blames people for filling out the form more than 3 times or worse things then why would anyone buy this token or coin.  A campaign's word should be bond.  I worked and gave my part but you failed me and probably others and made excuses.  I want this seen by others so they will know at the beginning if some of us small people will be treated in this fashion how can you expect to be successful.  You will get your karma but I will pray for your success any way.  since other avenues have not worked if you still want to do the right thing here it is easy.  Here is my info I really hope you will take the time to do the right thing and not push me off to send a message to Peter or someone else that won't send the tokens as promised.

I believe some users same as me, and i believe some scammers already got payment.   Users who didn’t receive their free ATS yet, I am sorry to inform you that all distributions have been suspended.       View online version    Hi, We would like to update everyone regarding the Bounty Campaign status.   As you are probably already aware, since yesterday we have started to process bounty campaign withdrawals. This gave birth to a cascade of disappointed messages (thousands of them) from users who noticed their accounts got suspended. We apologize for not being able to get back to everyone, it’s just not humanly possible given the volume of messages we received.   We would like to clarify why an account get suspended in the first place: the #1 reason is that from the same IP as yours there’s been over 20+ other registrations. This is in 99% of the cases a clear sign of fraudulent registrations (people create multiple accounts to earn more ATS tokens).   In the remaining 1% of the cases, everyone claims a fair usage (their entire 100+ work colleagues registered too, they live in a campus and everyone else shares the same IP, 200+ friends came by his home, etc.).   While these, could in theory be valid reasons, it turns out most of the time it’s just an excuse, as such as a rule any such duplicate registrations have been suspended.    The second reason why people get suspended is for fraudulent referrals. They use services like TOR or VPN to change their IP and create multiple accounts (usually hundreds of them). These are easily to spot as most of the time the names and emails are random numbers/fake names/emails. Turns out many people claim to be using TOR or VPN for genuine reasons, thus they shouldn’t be suspended either. If that is correct or not, it’s something one can’t really affirm with 100% certainty.   People tried to cheat the referral system through other methods as well, but we won’t get into more details; you got the overall idea.   We tried our best, did all that was humanly possible to discern between the genuine and fraudulent registrations considering that about 90% of the people who registered to our bounty campaign still doesn’t know what Ether is, not even today. We realize everyone jumps of joy when they hear about $10 free, but we’d have personally hoped for a different kind of results.   Having the final filtered list of users which we can make the payment to, our tech team prepared an automated way of processing the payments. Since there have been close to 10,000 participants to be offered ATS tokens, a manual processing payment was not humanly possible.   And here another set of problems started:   Around 15% of the users emailed us after submitting the form that they sent us a wrong address, that they want to change it, for various reasons. As clearly indicated, that it impossible as once a payment was introduced into the automated processing system, nothing can be changed about it.   Around 20% of the users who requested a withdrawal entered an invalid address (they either entered their BTC address, their ETC instead of ETH address, or some non-valid address).   Around 40% of the users who requested a withdrawal used a non ERC-20 compatible address despite our best efforts of explaining this and forcing everyone to mark a checkbox confirming this.   Because of all of these, it turns out we ended up to choke the ETH network with transaction and errors to the point where the few peers that were still accepting our transactions for distribution through the network rejected all connections.  We hardly managed to make the investors payments as a result, manually, one by one, as the automated way was out of the question now. There are still around 60 investors out of the 1900 total whose payments are still being stuck, somewhere in “processing”. If you are one of the unlucky few, please contact us a.s.a.p. and we’ll make sure to retry the payment until it gets through.   We ended up with only 20% of all the withdrawal requests processed, the rest were rejected for various reasons and all retry attempts failed. Some transactions been stuck jumping from peer to peer for almost 24 hours before failing.   Given the current circumstances where we are making payments to wrong/not valid addresses, makes little sense to continue this never-ending struggle. This forced us to take the following decision:   Users who already received their ATS tokens, congrats: your transaction went through successfully, you can use your ATS tokens.   Users who didn’t receive their free ATS yet, I am sorry to inform you that all distributions have been suspended.  Considering that most of the users only earned 75 ATS, it’s been decided that a fair compensation will be granted to everyone who participated in our bounty campaign in exchange.   ALL USERS, including the initially suspended ones, will receive, as a sign of our appreciation for your interest in our upcoming project a COUPON valid for the purchase of 3 BOOKS for FREE. You will not have to pay anything. The 3 books cost can be, in total, up to $100.   Once the Authoship platform is up and running, you can use the coupon to order 3 books, of your choice, absolutely for free. This, for most of the people who participated on our bounty campaign has a bigger value than the 75 ATS they received.   Your coupon code is : XXXXXXXXX   You can use this coupon as soon our platform is available to receive 3 books for free. Please remember your email address (the one you received this email to, as the coupon is connected to your email address).  You don't need to complete any form, the coupon was already applied to this email address.   We apologize for the entire situation and thank you for your support. You’ve all been incredible.   Help us make this promising idea of a book friendly future a reality!   PS: the remaining ~650,000 ATS tokens left from the distribution will be offered, through lottery to 25 investors who contributed to our token sale by ETH. The 25 random winners will be picked Wednesday 20th and announced on our blog.   Sincerely, Authorship.com Team  ",True

Hi. I'm Jan Harold Fermo email: jan18harold@gmail.com ERC20 compliant address: 0x7Bad210f1a642c037F256ee947eaEafDfD784cA6  I would like to express my disappointment for your decision of giving books instead of the promised ATS tokens but when I read you will send the tokens to those who got the minimum of 1000 ATS tokens, it put some hope to me.  First of all, I know few people who you sent ATS tokens made fraudulent sign ups and they RECEIVED their ATS tokens. They said in a forum that they made referrals by registering using a different ETH address using different IP than what they originally have that's why they are able to get 3000 or 4000 tokens.  I tried very hard to refer honestly in facebook and forums with a total of 1880 ATS tokens but I did not receive mine. Where is justice? I'm planning to spend the money I will get from the tokens to a more important things than books so I'm requesting it humbly from your company to send the tokens to me. It's worth around $300 which is 3 times the value that you are offering from the books. I'm hoping that you will be able to send the tokens to me. Thank you.  Regards, Jan Harold",True

In the beginning, when the bounty campaign was up you and your ""Crew"" stated that everyone would receive their 75 ATS by signing up. Now you claim that only people who earned more than 1000 ATS Tokens can receive their tokens.. That's just unfair right? I'm not saying that your punishment against Cheaters is bad, no peter.. i'm pretty sure 90% of loyal campaigners appreciate that kind of decision, But what about us? Who worked smoothly? Me, myself earned somewhere close to 1000 ATS Tokens and i'm pretty sure most of the campaigners earned below 1000 ATS Tokens somewhere like 60-70% of us. So by stating your new decision means that these 60-70% of campaigners are automatically excluded from the campaign just because they're below 1000 ATS Tokens? Come on Peter.. just think more logical, you're going in a wrong way and in my opinion this won't give you further trust.. Just stating my opinion, the rest is on you.. But my personal advice is to reward those people whoever earned below than 1000 ATS Tokens Smoothly.

I have not referred this to anyone else and could not care less whether I receive the 75 ATS or not. And still I have a few comments / suggestions.  1.   I did not invest into this ICO because of the business model or cutting edge tech. I saw something that I rarely see in crypto - the developers were actively engaging with the community and building trust. As I believe that emotions and psychology play a major role in crypto, this factor convinced me to put my money in. All this trust can #poof# disappear instantly if wrong decisions are made. Right now, I feel not very optimistic about my investment 2.   I was celebrating when you started unmasking the scammers (x sign ups from same IP, y referrals into the same ETH wallet) and was impressed that you guys knew your stuff. But then you suddenly stopped working through it. I think no one here can really understand the complex task you are facing right now, but I still think there is a way:  A)   Stick to your banning principles. There may be single innocent folks that are hit by the ban hammer, but overall the rules are fine B)   Work through the bounty withdrawals. It may take weeks or even months and be painful, but you gotta stick to your rules. If users mess up their ETH addresses, bad luck for them (you may think about a FAQ for first time crypto users or consider the ERC20 compatibility query that has been posted here before). C)   Don’t exclude folks (e.g. less than 1000 ATS), don’t reduce the 45 days - you gotta stick to your rules  Just look at all the anger here   ",True

Not following through on your promises, however, will slash the reputation of your company and severely hurt the value of ATS.

In theory, you've received money from investors who would otherwise not have known about the campaign if not for those of us working for your ""free"" ATS.  Your claims that you feel it didn't work out and that you now regret your bounty campaign are unacceptable this late into the process.  You may have made a poor business decision but at this point it's far more important that you simply follow through with it.  Also, those who receive ATS tokens will have less value because people will not be buying ATS as much when they are aware of the way you are retracting your company's promises like this.  You are not doing any favors to your investors.  You are in fact lowering the value of the coin by slashing the reputation of your company.    Do you see that this action really has no upside?  Doing so will lower the value of ATS to investors after ICO.

As you are probably already aware, since yesterday we have started to process bounty campaign withdrawals. This gave birth to a cascade of disappointed messages (thousands of them) from users who noticed their accounts got suspended. We apologize for not being able to get back to everyone, it’s just not humanly possible given the volume of messages we received.  We would like to clarify why an account get suspended in the first place: the #1 reason is that from the same IP as yours there’s been over 20+ other registrations. This is in 99% of the cases a clear sign of fraudulent registrations (people create multiple accounts to earn more ATS tokens).  In the remaining 1% of the cases, everyone claims a fair usage (their entire 100+ work colleagues registered too, they live in a campus and everyone else shares the same IP, 200+ friends came by his home, etc.). While these, could in theory be valid reasons, it turns out most of the time it’s just an excuse, as such as a rule any such duplicate registrations have been suspended.  The second reason why people get suspended is for fraudulent referrals. They use services like TOR or VPN to change their IP and create multiple accounts (usually hundreds of them). These are easily to spot as most of the time the names and emails are random numbers/fake names/emails. Turns out many people claim to be using TOR or VPN for genuine reasons, thus they shouldn’t be suspended either. If that is correct or not, it’s something one can’t really affirm with 100% certainty.  People tried to cheat the referral system through other methods as well, but we won’t get into more details; you got the overall idea.  We tried our best, did all that was humanly possible to discern between the genuine and fraudulent registrations considering that about 90% of the people who registered to our bounty campaign still doesn’t know what Ether is, not even today. We realize everyone jumps of joy when they hear about $10 free, but we’d have personally hoped for a different kind of results.  Having the final filtered list of users which we can make the payment to, our tech team prepared an automated way of processing the payments. Since there have been close to 10,000 participants to be offered ATS tokens, a manual processing payment was not humanly possible.  And here another set of problems started:  Around 15% of the users emailed us after submitting the form that they sent us a wrong address, that they want to change it, for various reasons. As clearly indicated, that it impossible as once a payment was introduced into the automated processing system, nothing can be changed about it.  Around 20% of the users who requested a withdrawal entered an invalid address (they either entered their BTC address, their ETC instead of ETH address, or some non-valid address).  Around 40% of the users who requested a withdrawal used a non ERC-20 compatible address despite our best efforts of explaining this and forcing everyone to mark a checkbox confirming this.  Because of all of these, it turns out we ended up to choke the ETH network with transaction and errors to the point where the few peers that were still accepting our transactions for distribution through the network rejected all connections.  We hardly managed to make the investors payments as a result, manually, one by one, as the automated way was out of the question now. There are still around 60 investors out of the 1900 total whose payments are still being stuck, somewhere in “processing”. If you are one of the unlucky few, please contact us a.s.a.p. and we’ll make sure to retry the payment until it gets through.  We ended up with only 20% of all the withdrawal requests processed, the rest were rejected for various reasons and all retry attempts failed. Some transactions been stuck jumping from peer to peer for almost 24 hours before failing.  Given the current circumstances where we are making payments to wrong/not valid addresses, makes little sense to continue this never-ending struggle. This forced us to take the following decision:  Users who already received their ATS tokens, congrats: your transaction went through successfully, you can use your ATS tokens.  Users who didn’t receive their free ATS yet, I am sorry to inform you that all distributions have been suspended.  Considering that most of the users only earned 75 ATS, it’s been decided that a fair compensation will be granted to everyone who participated in our bounty campaign in exchange.  ALL USERS, including the initially suspended ones, will receive, as a sign of our appreciation for your interest in our upcoming project a COUPON valid for the purchase of 3 BOOKS for FREE. You will not have to pay anything. The 3 books cost can be, in total, up to $100.  Once the Authoship platform is up and running, you can use the coupon to order 3 books, of your choice, absolutely for free. This, for most of the people who participated on our bounty campaign has a bigger value than the 75 ATS they received.  Your coupon code is : BOUNTY3FREE  You can use this coupon as soon our platform is available to receive 3 books for free. Please remember your email address (the one you registered with, as the coupon is connected to your email address).  You don’t need to complete any form, the coupon was already applied to the email addresses on file.  We apologize for the entire situation and thank you for your support. You’ve all been incredible.  Help us make this promising idea of a book friendly future a reality!  PS: the remaining ~650,000 ATS tokens left from the distribution will be offered, through lottery to 25 investors who contributed to our token sale by ETH. The 25 random winners will be picked Wednesday 20th and announced on our blog.  Sincerely, Authorship.com Team  http://authorship.com/2017/09/16/update-authorship-bounty-campaign/",True

If the price actually turn out to be ridiculously low, then bounty reapers with heavy ats tokens have nothing to lose as they can decided to dump it immediately and for something else.

Looks like it does!  Coinomi now natively supports 200 tokens.  Please consult this article for more information and screenshots: https://coinomi.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/29000013330-how-do-i-add-a-supported-eth-token-in-coinomi-  If the token you're holding is not in our list of 200 natively supported tokens, you can still always add it manually. Here's how. Go to https://etherscan.io/tokens Find and click on the token you wish to add from the list. From your ETH wallet main page, swipe twice to the left to get to dApps page. Click the ""+"" icon on the top right of the screen. On the ""Add Contract"" page, enter the following: Name: The name of the token. Description: Any description you would like or leave blank Website: From the token's etherscan.io page, copy the ""Official Site"" url Contract Address: From the token's etherscan.io page, copy the ""Contract Address"". Contract-Suit: Select token-template for ERC20 contracts. Contract-ABI: From the token's etherscan.io page, click on the Contract Address. In the address page, click on the Contract Source tab, and scroll down to the ABI text. Copy paste the entire text to the Contract-ABI line of Coinomi. Another way to easily fetch an ABI is to use etherscans api like this example, replacing the ETH address in the link with the official contract address of your token, as seen on the token's etherscan.io page. Please contact us if you require help with this step. Click on ""ADD CONTRACT"" on the bottom of your device's page.  Please note that the numbers in the token-template are currently unscaled. The non-supported tokens do not get a coin-like interface and wallet.

How much are ATS tokens worth? The recommended price is $0.15  When will I get my tokens? Investors are expected to get theirs in 24 hours, bounty could be 2-3 days.  When will ATS be on an exchange? Once the tokens have been distributed to everyone, then there might be a couple of days wait.  It depends on the exchanges themselves.  How do I claim my bounty? http://authorship.com/withdraw/  How do I see my tokens in a ERC-20 wallet like MyEtherWallet? Click on 'Add Custom token' and fill out the following information  The ATS token contract address is : “0x2dAEE1AA61D60A252DC80564499A69802853583A” Token Symbol: ATS Token Name: Authorship Token Token decimals: 4  My brothers uncles dads mum referred themselves 500 times using my IP and ETH wallet, where are my tokens? You are banned, nice try.  Multiple accounts with the same IP / ETH wallet etc are banned from the bounty",True

Why?  Banning (as it seems) everyone coming through VPN/Thor, even the upliner who gave reflink. It's not ""my"" fault if a downline starts cheating or uses Thor. Many in other people in this world use Thor for reasons which are _not_ cheating related. Banning multiple IP is harsh. There's no 1 person = 1 ip! F.e. here in germany you don't get a static ip as a costumer. IP changes often so the chance that someone has the same ip as you had is very close. IP pools of telekom providers are limited. This also kicks out : University campus, Schools, companies and so on. What about the people who do not have access to their reflink?   That should have been mentioned in the first place to KEEP that! Also the withdraw form is a big ****, sorry to say that. To me it seems very unsafe. What if someone knows mailadress and reflink? He could put any name and Wallet address into the form and gets the tokens! No confirmation needed except for a useless captcha.  I get calls from friends who i certainly know are _not_ cheating that their account seems to be suspended. I know that some of them use thor, many of them use email account (which my company provides), some use other mail accounts. We did huge promotion in our Media and crypto related communities and now everything gone down the drain.  Sure you have to clean out the cheaters, no doubt. But in my opinion there is to much collateral damage in the wrong direction. Id rather give some tokens to a cheater instead of kicking 50% of the honest peoples out.",True

Question : Which Wallet we can use to get ATS Tokens?       Answer : ATS is an Ethereum ERC-20 Token and can be accessed by any Ethereum wallet supporting tokens. If you need a recommendation, most users prefer to use myetherwallet.com (if you want a mobile wallet, imToken (token.im) is fully compatible too, we got in contact with their team and our ATS tokens have been included in their default supported tokens as well). For myetherwallet.com , you need to add ATS as a custom token to be able to see your balance. Please see this post for the info you need to add: http://authorship.com/2017/08/01/how-do-i-view-ats-tokens-in-my-wallet/ DO NOT enter an Ethereum address from an exchange (ex: poloniex, bittrex, coinbase, etc.) or you will lose your ATS tokens. Once the tokens are sent, this can’t be undone.  2. Question : How we can withdraw out bounty campaign free ATS if didn't get any email from Authorship ?     Answer : you can withdraw you Bounty campaign ATS token from this link http://authorship.com/withdraw/  3. Question : I get this email when i withdraw for my bounty campaign ATS ""var amount = 0;""     Answer : Don't worry about this , Ignore it.  4. Question : I have a question , where i can ask it to team of Authorship ?     Answer : Ask here or contact them at contact@authorship.com  All the best. Thank you",True

It may take a couple days to receive a reply.  Please keep in mind:  -IF you entered a wrong ETH address on the withdrawal form, you CANNOT change it anymore. You've been offered numerous occasions to make sure you enter the correct one and unfortunately, you agreed to the final ETH address by submitting the form.  -We cannot tell you what your name/email/referral/eth or any other info you need to know about your account. Please search for your welcome email if you need the referral link, check your friends or places you shared with if you cannot find it.  -Please do not send us stories about why your 50 identical IP registrations are legit. (we heard it all , starting from knocking door to door with your laptop in your hand asking people if they want free tokens; or that you work as a nurse at the hospital and you asked 200 patients to give you their email addresses as a way of raising funds for a noble cause; or that you asked your 600 friends to gather at your house, at a big round table), you'll be suspended.  -If you strongly believe your account was suspended and you are 100% sure you did nothing wrong, please send us an email describing how you promoted your link, with proof (please no stories). Please understand however, that if we check the situation and see the suspension was the right thing to do, we won't even bother to reply back. We don't have the time to argue nor the desire.  However, if we mistakenly got your account suspended we will reinstate it and send you all the earned ATS plus a 5% bonus for the situation. So far, we encountered no case where we've been wrong; but we are not excluding the possibility.  -Do not email us to ask ""when I'll receive the tokens/where are my tokens/why I didn't received the tokens"".

Who is going to sell for 4 cents and why? If investors would sell for 4 cents, they will get a little profit, doubt they are interested in a 20% profit. Bounty hunters, again, are interested to sell for as high as possible; after all they only got 75 ATS, if they sell for 4 cents they make $3, not really worth it.

With all the information I got here I guess I and my referrals are screwed then.

The attack will end at some point and everyone will receive it's share of ATS tokens (bought or earned). This is a guarantee.  While we initially wanted to postpone the end of the ICO we have decided not to as we cannot know for how long the attack will continue, we'll take the ""hit"" and apologize to the investors unable to get into as planned.  There are at this point exactly 12 hours left until the ICO will officially end.  If you believe in our project and want to invest, you have 12 hours left to do it. The investors ATS tokens will begin to be processed, automatically and without any confirmation needed from their side 2 hours after the ICO ended. We expect all investors to receive their ATS tokens within 24 hours from the end of the ICO, assuming we can access the website in a decent time manner. A maximum of 48 hours delay is possible.  The withdrawal form for the free bounty campaign will be published (assuming we have access at the server at that time; if not at the first time possible) 2 hours after the ICO is over as well. Please be advised, that because the attack is still running, the website may be unavailable at times and can slow down the processing of the withdrawals.  I've seen a couple referring to us as a ""scam"" already. Please DON'T. Probably this is what whoever is behind the attack intention was, considering the perfect image our ICO had from day 1 'till the very end.  Thank you, Peter",True

Will he have to add the ATS token to his wallet before he can see his tokens or will myetherwallet bring his token if he later add it?  (2).

On our T&C that refers to the price you are paying for 1 ATS, not the value of 1 ATS. This is why it's saying that the minimum number of ATS you can receive for 1 ETH is 2000. Tho that should have been updated to ~4500 as we changed the maximum amount we would raise to $7M, so the minimum amount increased as well.  How many ATS you receive when the ICO is over can be calculated by dividing the 100M tokens to the amount we raise.  If we raise $7M (~21,000 ETH) , for 1 ETH invested you will receive 5,000 ATS (100M / 21000 =~5000 ATS) If we raise $5M (~15,000 ETH) , for 1 ETH invested you will receive 6,600 ATS (100M / 15000 = 6600 ATS) If we raise $3M (~9,000 ETH) , for 1 ETH invested you will receive 11,000 ATS If we raise $2M (~6,000 ETH) , for 1 ETH invested you will receive 16,600 ATS  Regarding the project roadmap, it is expected to be officially launched on June 1st 2018.

I myself fond of reading and having one space for all the worldwide events in book industry is really awesome)  If you wouldn't mind I have some questions to be solid clear with. Well some points may already been asked here so I apologize if it was so.   I talked to Dave recently and he said that it's everything settled with the bittrex exchange and token trading launch would be in no time there. And what about Poloniex? Do you plan to start on both platforms at one time?  Have one confusing contradiction. Well, as an investor, I want to be clear with ATS tokens primal trading price. On your website I found this statement: ""...1 ATS will have a recommended starting trading price, through exchanges of $0.15 (15 cents), no matter what amount we raise..."" But while reading Terms and Conditions of your ICO I noted absolutely different statement to one I mentioned above: ""...ATS Price 1 ETH will purchase a minimum of 2000 ATS. The exact price will be determined when the sale ends using the formula: 1 ATS = Total Amount Raised / 100.000.000 tokens...""  I wonder what is true and which investor can take as a reference?  Q about the roadmap. I wanted to see it on the website, but it seems to be down now. Just want to know When Exactly The Athorship Platform Starts To Work as a ... just like retail version?  Last one - you said that upon the end of ICO campaign 100 mln ATS tokens would be divided to the whole contributed sum in eth equivalent. But on the website it is stated that 80% of the 100 mln ATS would be delivered to investors. So, according to this I understand that not 100 mln must be divided but 80 mln? Or am I wrong? And how fiat funds would be converted to eth and at what rate?  Thank you for your time and for making all these clear for me.  I wish your platform stable growth in the future.",True

About half of legitimate hits seem to be also blocked, me included.  Depending on the duration of the attack we may extend the duration of the ICO with another 24-48 hours, depending on the time we are offline as lots of investors seems to have wanted to invest in the last day and now they can't. We received lots of messages on Facebook about this as our emails are not working at this moment.  It's quite unfortunate that this is happening, and I apologize for the situation.

Q: When will we receive our ATS tokens? A: Starting Sep 14 once you fill out the final form.     In addition, you'll have 45 days to complete the withdrawal.     You'll receive the ATS 2-3 days upon completing the form.  Q: Can I still change my eth address used? A: Yes, you'll have your last chance starting Sep 14.  Q: Will there be any fee? A: Yes, sending tokens by default will require around 0.0004 Ether.  Q: Will we still receive the form if we unsubscribed to the mailing list? A: Authorship was aware of that, so they will also put out the form on their website.  Q: When will we see ATS on exchanges? A: Every exchange has it's own listing timeline: some list them within 3-4 days while some take several weeks. One thing is for sure: they will be available through exchanges by the end of the month. -Peter   -Nikko Acaya",True

The earned ATS tokens will be distributed once the token sale is over (14th Sept). We will publish an update about this on 14th Sept after the token sale ended.  If you believe you entered a wrong ETH address or want to change your receiving ETH address there is no need to contact us about. You’ll have the opportunity to do it on 14th Sept, as you’ll be asked to complete an withdrawal form as a final confirmation. A newsletter will be sent on 14th Sept, but in case you miss it, please check our blog as you’ll find a copy here as well.  ATS is an Ethereum ERC-20 Token and can be accessed by any Ethereum wallet supporting tokens. If you need a recommendation, most users prefer to use myetherwallet.com (if you want a mobile wallet, imToken (token.im) is fully compatible too, we got in contact with their team and our ATS tokens have been included in their default supported tokens as well). For myetherwallet.com , you need to add ATS as a custom token to be able to see your balance. Please see this post for the info you need to add: http://authorship.com/2017/08/01/how-do-i-view-ats-tokens-in-my-wallet/  DO NOT enter an Ethereum address from an exchange (ex: poloniex, bittrex, coinbase, etc.) or you will lose your ATS tokens. Once the tokens are sent, this can’t be undone.  We would like to thank everyone for the participation and especially to our top promoters below!  If you enjoyed the free ATS tokens and want to benefit from having more of them, we’d be happy to see you among our investors as well.

This will not get you banned. It can get your account flagged for inspection, but once it's inspected and we see it's nothing but genuine registrations, nothing will happen. Also, if we have doubts, we'll email you about to inquire about the promotion methods you used.  Accounts get suspended only after a human review, there's nothing automated that suspends accounts as automation could sometimes go wrong. So, there is nothing to worry about.  Also, the free ATS tokens and the investments are different, there's no connection between the two in terms of receiving them. So, assuming that by some unknown mistake (which didn't happened to date and surely won't happen) an account will get suspended and it loses the free ATS, it doesn't influence the receiving of the ATS from investing as these are separate. To buy ATS tokens one deposits ETH to our ETH address and in exchange we send the ATS to the address we received the investment from. We do not know or check if that person has or not a free ATS account also.  Hope this clears your questions. For anything else please let me know.  Thank you, Peter",True

Here's an analogy: an Ethereum address is like a real physical wallet. In a real wallet you can hold USD, EUR, GBP etc..  Same goes for an Ethereum address. It can hold Ether, but as the same time it can also hold any number of Ethereum tokens like ATS is.  When you check your Ethereum address you can see that you have 10 Ether in there but also have 500 ATS. They are totally different things. You cannot convert them one to another just with some math, or by moving some decimal as you mentioned. Even tho it can be some sort of relation between them (the same way there's a price connection between real USD and EUR), you cannot turn one into another without going through an exchange. If you want to exchange USD into EUR how do you do? You use an exchange (like your bank). Same goes for converting tokens like ATS is to anything else like ETH/BTC. You need to use an exchange like Bittrex for example.  Hope this clear it for you. For any questions, please let me know.  Regards, Peter",True

Once the platform will be launched it will be made available in several languages, that won't be a problem.  Regarding the books quality, every book will go through an initial inspection before being listed. And once it got listed, readers reviews and ratings will determine if a book remains or not listed on the platform. This way we can eliminate the bad ones. As far as translations go, every translator will earn up reputation points based on the quality he provides. Te higher the reputation, the more trusted a translator becomes and more sales he will attract. Readers will be able to rate the translators. Also, several pages of the book will be provided as a preview before one gets to buy the book to get a sense of the quality.",True

Surely not the CEO does all the coding or website design, and I believe everyone understands this. Our team has many members, but for various privacy reasons we won't list them.

Let me offer you just a quick explanation, as to how easy it is for ATS to have a minimum value of $0.15  There are a total of 100M ATS tokens. At a price of $0.15 per token, it results a total Market Cap value of $15M.  Do you know how many coins have a market cap above $15M? (over 200 coins!). Out of the total of ~1000 coins in existence, 200 of them have a market cap of over $15M.  This means that we only need to be one of the top 200 coins to have a minimum value of $0.15. If we make it into the top 100 coins, the value will be 3 times higher.  Taking in consideration that our platform is completely unique, I don't know of a single coin out there who competes with us, as such I dare to say, without a doubt, that it's impossible we are not better than 80% of the coins out there (excuse my lack of modesty, but we truly believe in the platform we are building).

In the picture it says 1ETH = 16,600ATS if $2M raised, then it says 1ETH = 3,300ATS if $10M raised. Does this mean that the price of ATS per 1ETH will depend on the amount raised after the ICO is over? Or if I donate before you reach the $2M raised mark I will get 16,600ATS per 1ETH and if I donate after $10M raised I will only get 3,300ATS per 1ETH?

It doesn't matter when you invest, all that matters is the total amount raised at the end of the ICO. That determines how many ATS you will receive for 1 ETH. All investors will receive the same price. We only offered a 20% bonus in the first 5 days of the ICO.  The idea behind this is to stop overselling (a common issue of ICOs). This way, people will stop investing more money into the ICO after a certain point (say after we reach $5M) since they would not receive the same level of ROI if they do.  Our aim is to raise only an amount that allows us to build the platform; not 20 times more cash than we need. When one raises too much money, it does it on investors expense (the tokens will be overvalued, so you'll see them go down in price instead of going up). By making sure we have that middle limit, we can be sure that both parties win (We, Authorship can build the platform with the funds we received, and investors earn as well as the tokens can only increase in price thanks to the limited supply).  Hope this clears it.  Regards, Peter",True

We probably aren't running a company for 3 years either and all the 1000+ author interviews from our website are fake too (http://seriousreading.com/category/author-interviews).  Probably DotWriter, the other company we built, wasn't on adtech either (curious cause there are even photos available online as proof). Here's just one for you:    Here's also the proof that DotWriter got acquired by a Global Ad Network as well: https://dotwriter.com/blog/15467/dotwriter-com-gets-acquired-global-ad-network-mediastinct/  Feel free to buy our ATS AFTER you'll see us on exchanges in a month's time then. At the end of the day we can't convince everyone and don't plan to either.  Regards, Peter",True

The reasons are various, but for our particular case:  -unlike ICOs that have an infinite supply of issued tokens, we don't. We have a fixed supply volume of 100M tokens.  -some ICOs have a predetermined token price. We don't. 1 ETH = 2000 ATS minimum, but it can get higher than this based on the total amount raised. (please look on out page to see how it gets calculated)  -besides ETH, we also accept credit card and wire deposits. A contract could not handle that.  -a smart contract could have not handled our referral bounty campaign. The free ATS tokens have to be distributed manually.  -right about the time when we were deciding if we should go with a contract or an address and how things should be, there were a few instance of exploited contracts and we wanted to make sure we don't risk it. An address poses no such security risks.  PS: Our ATS tokens contract source code is verified on etherscain.io as well.  Regards, Peter",True

Example: If we raise $1M which is roughly 3030 ETH, it means 1 ETH invested will give an investor 100,000,000 / 3030 = ~30.000 ATS  Based on our projections and on discussions with investors going to invest (there are many who wait to invest in the last days before the ICO closing date, in order to not have their money stuck doing nothing for long), we expect a raise in the $3-$5 M range. This will mean that an investor will receive between 6000-10000 ATS for 1 ETH.  Our minimum advertised price on the website (1ETH=2000 ATS) is for the situation where we would reach the maximum amount of $15M.

Let's start from here, since I believe this is why you registered, to call us a scam.  Have you done some basic research about us and our company before?  Our parent company is Serious Reading (http://seriousreading.com), we are in the book marketing business for several years, have thousands of authors who use monthly our services, have thousands of authors who already used our services for years, you can find our Company name on dozens of books.  Here's just about 1000 author interviews our company did: http://seriousreading.com/category/author-interviews , proof we weren't born yesterday.  Here's our Facebook page with over 100,000 followers as well: http://facebook.com/seriousReadingBooks/  Going forward: On our Authorship About Us page (http://authorship.com/about-us/) you can find both our address and a video with the CEO. (From what I remember, scams usually have no address, no team, no past background, no nothing). If you are from Maryland area, you could even meet him in person, in case you may reply ""how do I know who that guy is"".  About the ICO address, yes, it's not a contract address and this is something many ICOs use instead of a contract. The reason are various, but for our particular case: -unlike ICOs that have an infinite supply of issued tokens, we don't. We have a fixed supply volume. -some ICOs have a predetermined token price. We don't. 1 ETH = 2000 ATS minimum, but it can get higher than this based on the total amount raised. -besides ETH, we also accept credit card and wire deposits. A contract could not handle that. (PS: from what I am aware, scams don't have bank accounts, or credit card merchant accounts either; the idea is that they want to stay as hidden as possible) -a smart contract could have not handled our referral bounty campaign. The free ATS tokens have to be distributed manually. -right about the time when we were deciding if we should go with a contract or an address and how things should be, there were a few instance of exploited contracts and we wanted to make sure we don't risk it.  Now, regarding your other post below about why we don't use Slack, or Reddit.  Why should I? Last time I checked only 3 million people from all around the world used Slack. If we have no need for their project management platform, why should we be forced to use something we currently don't need. Our management system we currently use is just fine, so we won't change our behavior just because someone thinks that platform is better.  As far as Reddit goes, neither me or my team members are active Reddit users, meaning we wouldn't even be allowed to create a subreddit (these are the rules). I admit, reddit has it's uses, but it's not something you see too often in the publishing world. How would having a reddit channel helped our credibility? We are already using this forum, as a public meeting place, for everyone to see and share their thoughts. There are hundreds of posts all over reddit about our company, should anyone really want to find us there anyway.  I understand many ICOs rely on all these free advertising methods to attract investors. Many probably don't have any other option. We personally used our inhouse $250K advertising budget to advertise through Facebook/Adwords , and I dare to say, the results are much better. Most forum members here saw our ads way earlier than this thread (who for most of the time gets buries through the hundred others here).  As such, people who believe in us and our company, are free to join our ICO. Anyone having doubts can wait until the ICO is over and buy our ATS tokens from third party exchanges later.

Most of them didn't even know what crypto-currencies are before we announced the Authorship platform) and they prefer/have no alternative to buy ETH (given that in order to buy ETH you'd have to signup with an exchange, then wait for quite a lot of time to get your account verified). Rest assured, we will be providing digitally signed statements, for complete transparency.  Regarding the social account, Serious Reading is our parent company, where we have over 100,000 followers, where authors and readers follow us daily; we used that mostly to market the upcoming Authorship platform. We do also have https://www.facebook.com/authorshipcom/ but weren't that active there (it was used mostly for Facebook Ads) as we focused on what we already had through Serious Reading.

Once registered, each participant is offered an unique referral link to be shared through social accounts, forum posts/signatures, blog posts, or any other marketing method available to the participant.  For every referral that signups after accessing your link, you will receive 75 ATS tokens, both you and the visitor you referred. Shortly put: the more people you refer to our ICO, the more ATS tokens you will earn. There are no limits to the number of referrals you can send (when/if we reach the 1M tokens limits, the campaign will end and we will announce this public).  The beauty of things: all your have to do is to hand others 75 ATS tokens for Free, in order to receive back 75 ATS tokens yourself!  You are able to see live stats of the amount of tokens you earned, and you’ll receive an email notification immediately after someone registers using your link. Full transparency is extremely important to us!  All earned tokens will be distributed to all participants the moment the crowdsale is over.

First off: yes, the first 100,000 authors will receive a guaranteed monthly income. This is planned for the first 24 months out of the 20M tokens reserved for this.  At the first stage, it will be the first 100,000 authors who join the platform. At the second stage it will be the first 100,000 authors based on their number of sales, and there are several tiers for the guaranteed earnings received.  Regarding your remark ""author even you write bad work nobody like, you still get pay""; yes it's entirely possible. Each author will have the option to feature in his book other books. So, if a reader ends up purchasing another book, by reading that ""bad word"" as you prefer to refer to, he will end up receiving a small commission. We believe each author can improve on his work, if granted the right motivational tools. And remuneration is the best one.  Now, regarding your ""Alexander Hamilton"" remark, not sure it's worth commenting. It's clear you never attended a book festival, authors meeting or book launch. You probably would have never even recognized Alexander Hamilton either, if I didn't mention about.  If you have any genuine questions, we'd be happy to discuss, but if you'll keep on acting childish, we'll just ignore you from now on.  Thank you, Peter CDO Authorship.com",True

It would be pretty much impossible as there would be terrabytes of data given that each book will have several MB. These will be stored on our servers.  On the blockchain will be stored the book information (ex: book title, author, translator, publisher etc. Basically all the important information about the book and the connections between the third parties) and it's primary usage is for the distribution of royalties among the parties involved. That's where trust issues usually arrive and this is what the smart contract will solve. Ex: When a book is sold, the smart contract shares earnings between the author, publisher, translator, print facility and everyone else involved in the book's chain.  Regarding your other question: ""how do you make sure only paying readers get the book?"" , we will have both desktop and mobile reading apps with a proprietary file format which ensures the book can't be shared outside the app.  Regards, Peter CDO Authorship.com",True

The way I understand it, the main innovation here is that the remuneration chain is made transparent, ensuring fair royalties for authors and translators. Other than that you're basically Amazon/Kindle?  OK, this might work, but I still find your royalty promises of 90% for e-books rather optimistic. Being a publisher/editor is hard work, especially if you don't want to get spammed to death (even Amazon had trouble with spam ""authors"" gaming the system to get royalties). Will you be editing the works at all before publication?",True

We want to end monopoly by creating a competing market for publishers and print companies too.  Right now, if you are an author who's using a publisher, you are forced to comply with the publisher's prices and printing options. Through the platform this will change. When someone orders a book, all the registered print companies can outbid themselves to print and ship the book to the reader. This would allow the ones who charge less and are closer to the reader's shipping location to win the print, thus ensuring an overall decreased cost of production. The smart contract will then ensure everyone involved in the chain receives it's fair share of royalties. That's especially important when shipping international; right now the costs to ship a book internationally are higher than the book price itself.  Regarding the 90% for e-books goes, this is mostly true for self-published authors. For authors who use a publisher, they can share royalties based on their own agreement saved into the blockchain.  As far as editing goes, this is not something we plan to do; however, we'll have quality inspection steps before the book gets listed on the platform. Also, once listed, user reviews are something the platform will rely on to spot less wanted books. Should they fall under market standards, they will get removed.

I work in the industry and 50% is far from enough to pay publishers, transporters,  and retailers at once. There is a reason why author rights are capped to 15%. Even people like Rowling don't get much more. Care to explain what is your plan on this? This little detail makes the business model crumble like crumpets in my opinion.",True

You brought up a very interesting point, something we thought about from the very beginning.  We'll manage to do this by making everyone work together, by creating a market where services like printing and delivery can compete.  Ex: When a reader will order a book, that book doesn't have to be printed and delivered from the publisher's in-house print who may be 1000 miles away from the reader, but, from a local print facility who can be 20 miles away from the reader.  When you start cutting down the transport fees and the monopoly prints, you can start offering the kind of earnings we advertise.  Sincerely, Peter",True
