This will include Express Delivery and Package collecting main functionality and management. - Credit Concept: To allow people to purchase with PayPal (gateways will be definied soon) and other payment gateways, we've decided to introduce the concept of the ""Bundle Credit"": Bundle credit will be just a definition, you can always compare 1$ to 1 Bundle Credit, when you'll create an offer or you're going to purchase one services the price will be always in Bundle Credit. When you make a deposit of any type (caution or deposit to purchase a service), cryptocurrencies used or fiat used will be always converted in Bundle Credit (remember 1$ = Bundle Credit). This will allow us to manage fiat payment avoiding to exclude 99% of our potential customer. In the first version of the APP the withdrawal in FIAT won't be allowed (can be done only in BTC\LWF even if the deposit can be made with third parties gateways). -Marketing:  We are currently evaluating various Marketing Agencies to ascertain who are best suited to promoting in the Real World Market (not only in the cryptoverse).  This may be a lengthy process due to our doing due diligence and careful selection of this important part of helping the business succeed. Team Update: Fabio Legrenzi has left the project for personal reasons.  We wish all the best for future projects and plans.  Good luck in all your future endeavours. - Blockchain Development: We are starting the process of moving over to TypeScript core for the project, this will not require a hardfork.  The work will be undertaken by Andrea (Vekexasia) concurrently with the delevopment of the Logistics fuctions.  We are extremely confident that the change of core coding will improve the quality and performence of the blockchain.

Is LWF a courier? LWF is not a courier. LWF acts as an intermediary. LWF Direct Logistics will have a branch that arranges courier services if forwarding is not yet available in some regions. LWF will not only coordinate the needs between forwarders and receivers but will also incorporate tools like escrow, bureaucratic modules, and ancillary insurance to both receivers and forwarders. Our business is a Person to Person Model, as Uber does. We are not focusing to make the supply chain better, we dont work to organize cargo or float or to make the process of the logistics companies easier to be done, so we are happy that exist a lot of projects like shipchain, We work to provide a solution to remove walls created by third parties that maximize costs and make slower the procedure to make a freight forwarding spedition, also we will offer the express delivery and package collecting product that our forwarders can offer through us.",False

This system represents an evolution from the PoS (Proof of Stake) developed in order to reduce costs and inefficiencies associated with energy consumption, typical of the PoW (Proof of Work) systems used by Bitcoin. The DPoS system, first used with Bitshares by developer Dan Larimer, differs from the original PoS systems. DPoS, a delegated proof of stake system, requires a smaller decentralised network which consumes considerably less energy to secure its blockchain. Delegates, elected by the whole network with a democratic voting system, validate every single transaction on the LWF network. Within this DPoS system each delegate receives five LWF coins for forging a new block. If within that block a delegate processes a number of transactions,  he or she also receives a transaction fee.

Change the concept of logistics with P2P and decentralization As Uber did for shipping  When someone thinks about logistics, the first thing that comes to mind is: DHL, UPS and, why not, Amazon or other major service providers involved in the global delivery system. More than 88% of the world's packages are managed by a third party company. They take the package forwarding it through one of these large companies. All this to get a profit from the final customer.  When Uber started they asked themselves: ""why should transport be so expensive for people?"" and: ""how can we make a profit for us and for the citizen?"" so Uber was born.  Well, for LWF it’s the same. We have noticed that in many countries in the world retail products are very difficult to find on time and at a good price against Europe / US's main market; this due to a lot of reasons: protectionism, fear to ship in some countries, control of the price around the world by the big companies and of course the poor logistics services in the growing-up countries.  LWF will let users have a decentralized, clear and profitable environment where to safely build the first P2P-logistic-network.  https://coinidol.com/lwf-changes-the-concept-of-logistics/",False
