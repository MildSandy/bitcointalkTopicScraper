That could settle the Ethereum dilemma: last spring, the token was rumoured to be classified as a security.

Let me explain, I have been watching another interesting project such as Payfair that is very similar to this one. The idea is great, but after some weeks in Payfair escrow platform, the system is simply inefficient. Individual transactions without automated IT exchange solutions depends heavily on people being using their accounts, what could delay for some days just a single transaction.  Devs have to ensure updated info on exchange transactions in order to gain attention from market. I would like to listen from them how they will solve this situation. An exchange without any information on bid/ask simply wont be trusted and that’s something they should ensure.  If they offer an escrow ecosystem working similar to Binance or Coinbase platform I will invest heavily, but relying on people will always lack of volume to make the project profitable.

These airdrops are automatically distributed through the same mechanism as the dividend and voting tokens. The specific requirements for new ICO tokens to list on the LocalCoinSwap platform will be decided through the proof-of-stake voting system.

Exchanging value with other individuals was a critical milestone in the human evolution and the way our ancestors first began to interact with each other.  Collaborating with groups in the earliest tribes meant specializing roles and social contracts – some people hunted and gathered whilst others nurtured new generations.  The mutual benefit was implicit and enforced by social norms.  But what if you wanted to interact with someone outside your regular group? Some kind of exchange of value was needed: “you give us half that elk carcass, and we’ll share our cave through the coming storm. Win-win”. No central authority mediated the exchange, the benefits were clear and immediate, and nothing else was needed. No AML, trusted transactions, or records being kept – although some of the earliest written communications in history do appear to have been ledgers of some kind, maybe writing evolved to support P2P exchanges.  In fact, it’s not just humans who understand this, many species can also understand the value of P2P transacting – learning to perform tasks for researchers in exchange for rewards like food.  Higher primates can be taught to use tokens of exchange too, to understand ‘money’ – from which they rapidly progress to depressingly human-like behaviors from hoarding and theft to protection rackets and prostitution. Currencies and centralization may lead inevitably to corruption – but we must never forget that P2P came first.  And if the cryptocurrency movement is to recover its original intentions of trustlessness, this what we need to get back to.  LocalCoinSwap understands this, and have built their platform around the P2P experience:  “P2P platforms started to disrupt the financial sector over a decade ago”, explains Thomas Underwood, LocalCoinSwap Chief Technical Officer, “with the emergency of lending tools like Zopa and Affirm, enabling investors to connect directly with potential borrowers.  In the dawn of the ‘sharing economy’, people who cared about P2P talked a lot about their ability to cut out banks as middlemen, for the brokerage of credit. Nowadays we have similar services like Transferwise for the exchange of fiat currencies, matching buyers and sellers in different markets.”  “But in reality, these services are still highly centralized, because they depend on third party maintenance of a central ledger, and need to be underpinned by huge amounts of escrow funding.  As such, the main players in each market tended to quickly apply for banking licenses – modeling themselves on the very industries they were supposed to be disrupting”.  By exploiting fundamental qualities of blockchain technology, however, LocalCoinSwap has been able to create a true P2P trading platform without the need for centralized control:  “What the immutable blockchain ledger brings to accounting is truly a revolution on a par with the invention of double-entry bookkeeping. This is the 21st Century Renaissance!” Thomas continues enthusiastically. “Instead of needing a third party to reconcile the separate records based on each party’s transaction receipts, buyers and sellers can write their transactions directly into a joint blockchain register, immediately creating an incorruptible system of enduring accounting record.”  “And using ERC20-based smart contracts to fix the deal up-front, that means funds can be disbursed accurately and immediately according to fixed contractual rules, creating a genuinely peer-to-peer environment for buying and selling cryptocurrencies. “  “But because the peers interacting on the platform are more than just a bunch of private keys, we’re providing a comprehensive set of human community building tools as well – profiles, ratings, and reviews, will all help establish both trust and interactivity, and create a true marketplace, of individuals, trading with each other directly without hierarchy or third party control – that’s what P2P is all about at its heart”.  Of course, P2P exchanges already exist in crypto, but one of the stand-out unique selling points for LocalCoinSwap is the sheer scope. P2P at scale, accepting any fiat currency as a point of entry and planning to launch with the top 10 cryptos on-board for immediate exchange, and a growing number of new launches to be added.  “We extend the P2P philosophy beyond that of our community of traders, it includes those innovating in the space to offer ICOs and new products”, Thomas concludes. “We’ll invite carefully-vetted new token launches to trade on our platform, where they can incentivize our traders – who are platform shareholders in any case – by offering them airdrops of their tokens. That way we’ll support emergent startups, reward our LCS Cryptoshare investors, and continue to encourage new ideas and participants into the marketplace. We’re taking P2P to a whole new level”.

But then, LocalCoinSwap isn’t about business as usual...  Some might say the cryptocurrency industry is pretty innovative and forward-thinking already, but we felt it was time for some specific additional disruption. Despite the newness of the industry some structures are definitely ripe for an overhaul, and as the innovation cycle escalates in speed, it’s amazing how quickly institutions and power become entrenched, even in the most forward-looking of sectors - and in our opinion, that’s exactly what the problem is with most cryptocurrency exchanges.  Being truly decentralised means distributing the governance as well. So that’s what led us to our unique LocalCoinSwap Cryptoshares model for decision-making.  Of course it’s quite a departure from typical practice, to put the future of the enterprise into the hands of the community in this way, even before we’ve launched. But we believe in our users, in the integrity and collective wisdom of those already engaging with our project - especially our active Telegram users, who are continually challenging us to refine our thinking and make our product better and better. This ongoing conversation has made LocalCoinSwap what it is today, and is part of our agile process for updating and developing over the lifetime of our roadmap. Whilst our team are naturally brilliant, they are necessarily limited in number. Our users however scale that insight, and by leveraging their input and power of selection we can continue to iterate towards the perfect set of tools for everyone.  https://blog.localcoinswap.com/ultimate-democracy-how-owning-part-of-the-exchange-empowers-every-user-and-might-one-day-change-the-way-the-world-is-run/",False

Is it a service that allows users to exchange money between each other or what?  We are allowing users of the LocalCoinSwap platform to safely and securely buy and sell cryptocurrencies from each other. We provide an escrow service and traders may use any payment method they wish.

I think it meant exactly the preparation for the beginning of the token sale, the promotion of the project and advertising to attract the attention of future investors.  The pre-ICO is a private funding round designed for pooling groups and larger investors.

Hi Dixon98,  We are the first exchange to decentralize 100% of the profits, not just the platform itself. We look forward to working together with the community to change the crypto-economy.  The goal is to only decentralize profits or are you also going to build your exchange based on decentralized technology?  In currencies where it is possible we are implementing multi-signature transactions to decentralise the trading. However this is not possible with all cryptocurrencies.

Many projects seek to disrupt traditional industries, and this is a positive step. However, we believe that cryptocurrency itself is also in need of disruption.  It is antithetical to the concept of decentralization to have so much wealth congregating in the hands of a small number of exchange owners.  We want to break this model and decentralize the profits of the exchange itself, delivering them back to the community.  I hope you will join us on this journey and look forward to exciting developments to come!  Thanks.",False

These massive exchanges are run by small groups of rich elites who take all of the profits. They don’t let any of us share in the success, or decide how they should be run. They make fortunes from our trades and all we get in return are invasive verification procedures, delayed signups, and restricted withdrawals.  To make matters worse, existing peer-to-peer marketplaces are even more exclusive than centralized exchanges. They typically trade only a single cryptocurrency, have badly designed interfaces, and are not community-friendly with helpful support.  We are going to change that! LocalCoinSwap is the world’s most inclusive cryptocurrency marketplace, which decentralizes the most important part of the exchange: the profits. We will support more cryptocurrencies than any other peer-to-peer exchange, and we will support more payment methods than any other peer-to-peer exchange. We will allow traders in any location, to directly trade any cryptocurrency, using any method of payment.  But most importantly: the LocalCoinSwap user base receives 100% of the profits from the marketplace, and votes together in a proof-of-stake system to decide how the exchange should operate.  LocalCoinSwap is an exchange created for the community, owned by the community. Join the revolution!      “Not just another exchange. Not just another ICO.”  Community-focused - Dedicated support team, integrated social media features  Community-owned - 100% of profits distributed to users through the blockchain  Democratically operated - Exchange run through voting in a proof-of-stake system  World’s most inclusive exchange - Instant signup, no verification & no restrictions  Complete transparency - Public financial announcements, open-source contract code  Extensive coin coverage - More cryptocurrencies than any other peer-to-peer exchange  Cutting-edge security - Multi-signature transactions. 95% of funds in cold-storage  Intrinsic token utility - Dividend profits in multiple currencies.

Instead of a vague promise of possible future returns or idealistic visions which may never eventuate into product, Cryptoshares entitle the holders to guaranteed rights to 100% of the total profits from the Localcoinswap exchange, through cryptocurrency dividends.  Portfolio income stream  Cryptocurrency profits are paid to holders in the same cryptocurrencies in which they are made, allowing the investor to receive a regular stream of portfolio income. By holding a single Cryptoshare asset, the investor is entitled to a wide variety of cryptocurrency profits across the entire spectrum of the digital economy.  Free participation in new ICOs  Cryptoshare holders are also entitled to receive airdrops of new tokens when ICO’s are listed on the LocalCoinSwap platform.  Voting rights  Cryptoshares entitle the holder to voting rights in the platform’s decision making process, such as the listing of new tokens on the exchange, the direction of new business ventures and design considerations or functionalities for the platform. Cryptoshares in LocalCoinSwap are more than just a stream of dividends, by joining us you become an integral part of the future of the exchange itself.   Read our whitepaper for detailed information on the LocalCoinSwap project!  Update:  Hello everybody! LocalCoinSwap stays in touch! As you all know our ICO is already going on and very successfully. We have already collected more than 2.9 million dollars and while this is a good result, we want to achieve greater heights to create the best p2p-exchange on the market. Therefore, we want to launch a marketing campaign in markets where we are not available yet - Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Spanish and Chinese. Therefore, we are looking for people who will develop our project in these markets and grow with the company.
