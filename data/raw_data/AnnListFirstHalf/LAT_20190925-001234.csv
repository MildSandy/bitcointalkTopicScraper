Our weekly Dev Update is ready. A lot of internal updates were done, and a lot of new functions are coming.  1. C++ high-performant matching engine. We started process of integration matching engine capable to process 2 000 000 of transactions per seconds. It will replace our current solution and give us ability to scale up to 5-6 millions of active users on our platform.  2. Kubernates-based microservices architecture. We are in the process of migration from our current architecture to the new one, which will give amazing speed for LA Platform. Each part of the system such as auth engine, assets listing, market data, etc. will become from 20 to 170 times faster.  3. Lightning-based network for processing trades. We are in the process of researching Lighting Network as a possible solution for decentralized exchange. First controlled transactions are done, so the next steps is to integrate Lightning Payment channels to the current matching engine. It will give us ability to process traded in peer-to-peer mode, without any deposits or withdrawals to the centralized exchange.  Stay tuned!",True

I do think these will make it easier to own weird assets worldwide. LAtoken might even be the one that takes off and gets adopted by the mainstream and hedge funds in order to diversify. Now people can diversify into assets they could not touch previously. I think art is a great example. How do you invest in a $50 million painting if you can't afford it. The only way currently is to invest in a hedge fund that will buy that painting and try to resell it eventually. Only qualified investors can invest in such funds and the fees are usually very steep. If LAtoken can fix these problems it will be much easier to diversify outside of the normal stock and bond markets. I can't wait for the opportunity to invest in something that is not correlated to either the stock or bonds markets. That way I have some safety if their is a market collapse.

So US residents participated. Now there's an issue where this is not the case and that the LAT token may be considered as a security which can cause problems with the SEC regulations. That's why for most ICOs US residents cannot participate in ICOs. I think they also stopped allowing US residents to participate for the time being.

They say there are too much scammers. Quite a rational decision, it can't be moderated in a proper way. Can't be moderated by the LAT team? Its purpose is being a comfortable place for a few trusted friends/colleagues to discuss their projects. That is hardly an excuse.  It's not an excuse indeed. It's a platform drawback, so the team has to select something which is moderated in easy way. Discord! Discord is not an ideal too. There's a dilemma: to counter scammers a moderator should know what is being PMed, but to secure the privacy one can't allow moderators to see PMs. And you can't just turn off the PMs, because you need sometimes to discuss something with your fellow Indonesian and it's not approved by the team. Discord allows to turn off PMs actually. But not all the PMs. ""Friends"" still can PM, and we sometimes feel so lonely and need a friend so much... Social engineering may be used in every situation. And there are people who believe everyone too easily. It's strange though. Why do you enter the cruel and beautiful world of cryptocurrency if you're so confiding and gullible? It's a free market, anarcho-capitalism. Homo homini lupus est. Not everyone knows what the darkness is. Please stop ignoring me.",True

They say there are too much scammers. Quite a rational decision, it can't be moderated in a proper way. Can't be moderated by the LAT team? Its purpose is being a comfortable place for a few trusted friends/colleagues to discuss their projects. That is hardly an excuse.  It's not an excuse indeed. It's a platform drawback, so the team has to select something which is moderated in easy way. Discord! Discord is not an ideal too. There's a dilemma: to counter scammers a moderator should know what is being PMed, but to secure the privacy one can't allow moderators to see PMs. And you can't just turn off the PMs, because you need sometimes to discuss something with your fellow Indonesian and it's not approved by the team.

Valentin Preobrazhenskiy, CEO at LAToken, explains that his company has responded to the development by putting all of its activities related to China on hold: “We were about to participate in Blockchain conferences and meetups there, but cancelled our roadshow in mainland China. We also don’t accept contributions from Chinese citizens and residents at the moment. However, the Chinese ban doesn’t affect our activities in other countries, and we still proceed with our token sale as scheduled.” Preobrazhenskiy acknowledges the negative sentiment created by the development in China as is evident in the market behaviour. Bitcoin price quickly bounced, while Ethereum, the most popular currency for ICOs, is still in a holding pattern as markets worry that other operations with cryptocurrencies may be banned by Chinese regulators as well.

Yes. - Is there an expectation of profits from the investment? ICO buyers are buying LAT knowing that the token is backed by real assets, not purchasing for anything other than a financial gain. - Is the investment of money in a common enterprise? Yes, per the broad vertical definition of a common enterprise. ""The investors are dependent upon the expertise or efforts of the investment promoter for their returns."" - Are profits coming from the efforts of a promoter or third party? Bounty program, staged discounts, etc. can fit into this category - when the end-user buys at a 15% discount from the efforts of a third party (BTT signature), they're going to be able to profit easier/differently than the market. Not quite kosher.  Other red flags: - In practice, does this idea make any sense? The ""how it works"" section seems to indicate that I, an asset owner, could effectively take out a mortgage on my asset (trading part of it/all of it on the exchange for $) and then effectively ""buy it back"" later. But with the likely shift in value of the token, how do I know what it'll cost to buy it back? It's possible that I sell half of my $500k USD house for 1000 LAT (round number for the sake of simplicity), then watch the value of 1000 LAT go from $250k USD to $1m USD. That's what I have to pay, or the custodian will auction it off? Just seems like a reckless thing to do as an asset owner. What makes this better than working with a traditional bank? - The token sale distribution seems staged for serious market manipulation. 20% for the vague ""network growth"" doesn't give me confidence that the organization will allow the markets to behave normally. If I put up an asset, seems like it will be easy for the organization to pump or deflate the price to influence my ability to buy it back, while they are able to auction it off for fiat. - Heavy time-based incentives mean that people's cost-basis for LAT is low (and all over the map), meaning that those who actually participate in the system are subject to likely downward market activity. Short term, I would expect manipulation to the downside while the organization collects real-life, hard assets. - The Inc. press link is broken. - The HuffPost link is to the contributor network, isn't actually a real HuffPo post.

Step 2. Asset appraisal Prior to artwork tokenization, it is subject to tests for authenticity, appraisal, and insurance by LAT-certified vendors. Step 3. Custodial agreement The LAT-certified custodian and the applicant sign a binding agreement for mandatory future open fiat auction by the settlement date. Step 4. Asset tokenization and sale When all legal issues are settled, LABT backed by the artwork are issued on the LAT exchange and become available for investors. All raised funds are transferred to the seller. Step 5. Asset buy back By the settlement date, the applicant must sell his artwork at a fiat auction and distribute the proceeds among the LABT holders.

EQUITY (global asset value - 65 trillion$) - Listing equity on a stock exchange is a very costly process. Underwriters and bookrunners syndicate fees are ranging from 2% to over 6%1 of gross proceeds from the offering, application and filing fees fee average around $25k. DEBT (g.a.v - 215 trillion$) - Issuing debt on a leading stock exchange incurs initial listing fees of ~$20,000 and an annual fee of ~$20,0004 . Underwriting fees generally amount over 1% of total gross proceeds from debt issuance. REAL ESTATE (g.a.v - 217 trillion$) - On average home sellers pay their listing agent a commission of about 6% of the price. Other transaction costs amount to ~5% and include escrow costs and recording costs upon sale, title insurance costs. The sale process takes on average not less than 65 days. The proceeds from the real estate sale are taxed at the rate of up to 20% . ART WORKS (g.a.v - 3 trillion$) - As per example below seller fees associated with an artwork sale are 20-25% of the sale price (hummer price) while buyer’s premium charged up to 25% (according to Sotheby’s commission structure).
