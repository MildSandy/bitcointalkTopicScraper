Having received the invitation by Blockchain Leadership Summit, we’ve headed for Zurich, Switzerland, on Friday, March the 9th. Our leading advisor, Ruben Godfree, was one of the speakers on the list that was topped by Prince Michael of Liechtenstein and Sergey Glazyev, advisor to the president of the Russian Federation.  The event focused on how blockchain-based projects and investments in them influence social and economic spheres. It’s these topics that the speeches revolved around.  Our project has been mentioned quite often at the summit. Some of the speakers stated StopTheFakes should be considered a role model, in particular, they talked about high social responsibility and its potential influence on economics. Experts noted that our model allows not only to solve computer piracy and counterfeit problems, but makes it easier to deal with certain social implications. Implementing the system is of immediate necessity for developing countries where labor market has accumulated a lot of free resources which resulted in many unresolved issues in the social sphere.  In his speech, our representative Ruben Godfree has focused on the need to implement control in the blockchain sphere. The regulation is positively needed in order to improve the market’s efficiency. Unfortunately, the present level of the bureaucratic system, even in EU countries, is not ready to meet this change. Ruben also discussed another current topic — that of industry associations. This issue has spurred many worries as blockchain projects tend to avoid joining their efforts because of the spirit of rivalry. Such lack of coordination makes them easy to target for critics and opponents. The audience has agreed on the main points of Ruben’s report and so he was heartily welcomed by long ovation. It makes us so proud to know that such people as Godfree are a part of our team. This brings the team together, solidifies its spirit and makes us push even harder towards our goals.  The event turned out to be very beneficial for our networking and also has brought some food for speculation. A set of methods and practices we’ve learned about during workshops and panels has blown our mind both because of their simplicity and innovative nature. We are going to implement many of those aspects in our own products.  https://medium.com/@stopthefakes/stopthefakes-team-took-part-in-blockchain-leadership-summit-db928c5f9b54",False

Such networks are decentralized and the participants with equal rights can freely share pirated content or its pieces. But the majority of these users can find content on so called torrent trackers. Therefore, blocking torrent tracker sites partially or completely is considered enough when tackling the copyright issue on peer-to-peer networks.  Major websites of this sort are willing to cooperate with the right holders and are quite approachable when it comes to blocking pirating links. But they do so only after filing an official request.  We’ll apply the same framework to torrent trackers as to regular pirating sites.  https://medium.com/@stopthefakes/how-stopthefakes-io-will-help-copyright-holders-to-counteract-violations-f65ffc846830",False

The doer will get $10 to $40, which is a fair amount of money for the common consumer, all the more so because this activity does not require effort and is time-efficient.

If a consumer ordered a fake Swiss watch in China, it is expected to cross the border where the customs authorities may intercept it. Pirated content is a more complicated story. An Internet user downloads a torrent or watches a pirated movie at home. Attempts of the regulatory bodies to block access to pirate websites look pathetic, because basic computer skills are all a user needs to get a VPN connection and bypass any bans.  This is why it is extremely hard to estimate, if approximately, the extent of the piracy market. MUSO, a London-based tech company, has been the most successful of all in this respect so far. Their research focused on the pirate website traffic in 2016. The results are listed below:  Total number of Internet users’ visits to piracy websites: 191 billion Total number of one user’s visits to piracy websites throughout 2016: 53.33 times throughout 2016 Number of Internet users around the world: 3.37 billion Global population: 7.38 billion  The development of network technologies has only aggravated the situation. In the past, pirates used to steal only ready content (movies, musical compositions and software), but now they are stealing Internet broadcasts of various events and channels too. It is difficult to estimate the amount of money lost by a right holder who organized, suppose, a pay-per-view broadcast of the World Cup Final. Immediate reaction –in an online mode, literally — is required to detect and put a stop to this infringement.  https://medium.com/@stopthefakes/global-counterfeit-market-facts-and-figures-b1872b7398b7",False

Blockchain technology has been implemented by using the open source license. The project has its own token, which is the only method of payment within its framework.  Our basic idea is to build a completely transparent and reliable system that could transfer data from users to right holders. We assume responsibility for providing the necessary infrastructure and bringing together those who want to learn about any infringement of their rights and those who can provide this information due to their geographic location or other factors. We assume responsibility for ensuring that customers remunerate providers and retain part of the remuneration as a commission fee.  Tokens issued by us will be the only means of payment that customers will purchase for remuneration purposes. Their quantity is limited, and Blockchain technology principles guarantee protection against forgery. Ethereum’s smart contracts ensure the fulfillment of the commitments undertaken.  The operating principles and technical specificities of the system, the total quantity of tokens, timelines for their issuance and conditions for their acquisition are described below.",False

Even though this statutory instrument applies to the US only, it allows to counteract violations globally. Because the most part of website traffic comes from the search engines. The most popular of them are under the US jurisdiction. They have already developed a fully functional automatic blocking order submission procedure.  With the help of our service one will be able to use these systems. Submitting a request for pirated content detection is the only thing required from the Requestor. We’ll take care of the rest, including the result monitoring. The right holder will receive a stage-by-stage report specifying the details of the detection, complaint filing and blocking of the site by search engines, domain registrators and hosting providers.  Combating real-world violations  Even though offline regulations have their limitations they can help bring down violations nonetheless. A market outlet owner cannot change his address and relocate as quickly as e-store owner. That’s why filing a justified complaint is enough in the vast majority of the cases.  We estimate this approach to be 92–93 % efficient in the countries with highly developed law enforcement. However, when applied to the developing countries, this account would sound a little bit too optimistic. But we hope to improve this by working hard on this issue, developing ties with enforcement agencies and bringing in the best legal practices.  https://medium.com/@stopthefakes/how-stopthefakes-io-will-help-copyright-holders-to-counteract-violations-f65ffc846830",False

Most of the processes are computerized and don’t require taking even the smallest efforts on our part.  In the vast majority of cases one can make offender change his mind by filing a substantiated complaint, by far this is the easiest and most effective method. If the offenders also operate within the legal framework it’s in their best interest to settle a lawsuit amicably and refrain from criminal activity altogether. Most of the offenders are not street venders but rather regular stores, some of them are even chain stores.  For the most part, the goods they sell quite legally.  What complicates the situation on the market even further is that the number of offenders is quite large, yet the scale of each offence is relatively insignificant. Thus, detecting infringements and filing complaints about each of these cases would amount to some immoderately high figure. So it was too impractical for the right holders to wrestle with this problem.  Our service has come up with a solution. With optimized service tools now it takes very little time to detect an infringement and respond to it. And the process of generating and filing complaints based on the collected data gets computerized.  We turned the situation around. Economically speaking, we put the offenders at disadvantage by radically minimizing violation detection costs.   check it https://medium.com/@stopthefakes/how-stopthefakes-io-will-help-copyright-holders-to-counteract-violations-f65ffc846830",False

Thanks for your question  Global reach. We are going to address copyright offenses worldwide, regardless of the jurisdiction they belong to. Large-scale participation. We invite a great number of Doers such as regular Internet users and consumers. Geographic location and language, as well as goods consumed, are virtually of no difference. Everyone is welcome to detect offenses and register these findings with the right holders. Transparency. We operate within the legal framework and have nothing to hide. All of our information will be accessible to the public, except for confidential data. Speed. The earlier an infringement is detected the less will the right holders lose. We always have to be one step ahead of the offender. Affordability. We want to offer our service not only to big brands, but also small business owners and private parties. Cooperation. We bring together trade associations, public organizations and everyone who is willing to take action and support the copyright protection agenda. Dependability. Not only do we detect infringements but we also ensure data security and inalterability of the evidence collected. It was impossible to realize these principles before the emergence of Blockchain technology and cryptocurrency market formation. Our project is first to bring innovation into copyright protection.  Blockchain The technology was created to guarantee the reliability of the system with any number of participants. The algorithm ensures information security and inalterability because the same dataset is stored by every participant. Any unauthorized alteration would result in the chain breakage.  Blockchain in StopTheFakes.io Infringement detection Alerts sent by Doers have to be recorded in an unmodifiable way. The Alert contains the following data:  Unique identifier assigned by the system Date and time of the recording Geodata and page address Date and time when the information was sent to the system Unique information on the device used for the recording Pictures, videos, screenshots The Doer’s text comment This data is then formed into a unique block inscribed in the Ethereum blockchain. It contains checksum of every file that’s been enclosed in the Alert as well as every Alert’s checksum. Modifying even one byte of information would change the checksums. The entry will not correspond to the block from the Ethereum chain.  Once the Alert is taken up by the Requestor acceptance information is also added to Blockchain. This serves as a guarantee for the Doer.  Requestor The right holder who takes on a role of an ordering customer makes a decision as to whether or not accept given Alert based on how well it meets the requirements. By applying Blockchain technology we are able to guarantee that the Alert is rendered absolutely unmodifiable once it had been accepted. The Requestor therefore is assured that neither service, nor the Doer or anybody else for that matter can modify this data.  The service will offer him to automatically produce a well-grounded complaint or to use collected information in his discretion. In any case he is guaranteed the complete security of the information collected.  Doer The Doer is absolutely certain he’d get remunerated. He has no doubts as to the system’s integrity since the factor of human error is completely ruled out. The result of his work is recorded in Blockchain and no one can change this information, not now, not in a hundred years.  Offender A person who broke the law now knows for a fact that the evidence of his criminal activity will stay on record forever. Any possibility of bribery is completely ruled out. No matter how much money the offenders would offer they won’t be physically able to remove the data from Blockchain. As criminal science tells us, unavoidability of punishment is what motivates us most to abide with the law.  Service There’s no need to prove our honesty, integrity and incorruptibility. Having applied Blockchain technology in our project, we are able to guarantee its transparency and reliability. The usual business practice of background checks has no point in this case since the subjective factor is absolutely ruled out. All activity history is stored in Blockchain, it can be reviewed at any given moment and no one can modify, remove or tamper with information in any other way.  It makes it possible for us to compile a unified global register of copyright offences. Any Internet user would be able to run a background check on the business partner in a matter of seconds and obtain information on his involvement in IPR violations, repeated offences, as well as when and where these instances have occurred.  Token The absolute certainty with which we guarantee the Blockchain system participants’ integrity has lead to the emergence of cryptocurrency, a universal payment means that doesn’t require any additional assurances from banks, governments and other organizations. Thus, cryptocurrency:  Is not limited by state boundaries Allows significantly minimize transaction costs Provides complete anonymity Makes payment transaction processing faster. The rise of Ethereum platform and its spread made it possible to create one’s own cryptocurrency, that is, tokens. However, there’s no need to build one’s own infrastructure, attract miner pools and spend money on developing additional software.  STFcoin tokens in StopTheFakes.io system The service will become a unified global system that facilitates the dialogue between people and companies from different parts of the world. Such a system was impossible to create before the emergence of fully functioning cryptocurrency market. Transaction costs and payment systems commission fees would simply constitute a larger part of the original cost of copyright infringement detection services. Yet, the efficacy of such measures would be next to none due to the difference in domestic legislation and slow payment processing.  Where does it get us? Having our own token gives us the edge over offenders since now we can act faster. And this is a major game-changer. In earlier days abusers took advantage of the fact that the cost and efforts spent on detecting IPR infringement-related crimes in many cases could have even surpassed the losses sustained by the right holders.  More often than not, a large-scale business owner would turn the blind eye to counterfeit sales than to wage a full-blown war. The right holder would have to spend a quite significant amount of money on high-cost detection services and on top of that incur some additional expenses associated with currency rate difference and international payment commission fees if there was a need to detect counterfeiting in several countries.  With our own cryptocurrency the whole world becomes one working area. The right holders now deal with offenders far more effectively as they can reach both domestically and globally.  Requestor Criminals’ financial gain now outweighs offence detection costs. The rules of the game have changed. It’s easier to work with token than with any fiat currency.  The client can buy tokens in the system itself by way of paying for the services and deem them in their bookkeeping records as expenses. Another option is to exchange tokens for other cryptocurrency at any well-known cryptocurrency exchange.  As cryptocurrency popularity rises, more and more large-scale companies are willing to sell their  goods and services for digital cash. Before this they converted their proceeds into fiat currencies. Now they’ll be able to use it to pay for copyright protection services.  The Requestor remunerates the Doer directly without incurring other expenses such as commission fees. He can engage Doers from all over the world without going through trouble of arranging all of the payments himself. The system will take care of that automatically. What is more, the transaction is now processed in a matter of seconds.  Doer Using our own token allows us to guarantee Doers complete anonymity. It’s this issue that concerns people the most when it comes to tackling crimes. Even with a complete payment history one wouldn’t be able to detect a person the cryptocurrency payment was transferred to.  A rule of thumb states that the higher the anonymity level the more people are willing to report criminal activity. Highly developed legal systems such as that of the USA and Great Britain facilitate anti-organized crime and anti-corruption activity by securing the anonymity of witnesses. It is only due to the so called Witness Protection Program that the US government managed to bring down the mafia who had been in cahoots with bribable public officials during the Prohibition era.  The fast payment processing is as big an incentive as its amount. Through the use of token the Doers get the amount of remuneration due to them almost instantly after finishing the task. This motivates them to work harder and better. Instant remuneration system and the absence of commission will draw a sufficient amount of potential Doers from all over the world. That’s the only way we can build global, fast and effective system.  Service By using our own token we can operate globally without having to adapt our system to a specific  jurisdiction. This allows us to minimize the expenditures and offer our services at affordable prices. That’s the only way we can ensure affordability for any right holder, ranging from freelance artists and small-sized businesses to big brands and megacorporations.  By using the reserve token fund we’ll be able to prevent the stockjobbing of the token. This would in turn let us keep the actual cost at a low level so as to make it affordable for the right holders.  By token sales we’ll be able to attract the funds from all over the world. Running an ICO has already proven to be effective. Hundreds of projects offering unique goods and services have emerged throughout the world. Their wouldn’t exist in the first place if it hadn’t been for cryptocurrency market. Investors can closely monitor our activity for all of the transactions are inscripted in Blockchain and the number of tokens is initially limited.",False

We are going to address copyright offenses worldwide, regardless of the jurisdiction they belong to. - Large-scale participation. We invite a great number of Doers such as regular Internet users and consumers. Geographic location and language, as well as goods consumed,  are virtually of no difference. - Everyone is welcome to detect offenses and register these findings with the right holders. - Transparency. We operate within a legal framework and have nothing to hide. All of our information will be accessible to the public, except for confidential data.   - Speed. The earlier an infringement is detected the less will the right holders lose. We always have to be one step ahead of the offender. - Affordability. We want to offer our service not only to big brands, but also small business owners and private parties. - Cooperation. We bring together trade associations, public organizations and everyone who is willing to take action and support the copyright protection agenda. - Dependability. Not only do we detect infringements but we also ensure data security and inalterability of the evidence collected. It was impossible to realize these principles before the emergence of Blockchain technology and cryptocurrency market formation. Our project is first to bring innovation to copyright protection.  Blockchain in StopTheFakes.io  Infringement detection Alerts sent by Doers have to be recorded in an unmodifiable way. The Alert contains the following data: Unique identifier assigned by the system Date and time of the recording Geodata and page address Date and time when the information was sent to the system Unique information on the device used for the recording Pictures, videos, screenshots The Doer's text comment This data is then formed into a unique block inscribed in the Ethereum blockchain. It contains a checksum of every file that's been enclosed in the Alert as well as every Alert's checksum. Modifying even one byte of information would change the checksums. The entry will not correspond to the block from the Ethereum chain. Once the Alert is taken up by the Requestor acceptance information is also added to Blockchain. This serves as a guarantee for the Doer.  Token  The absolute certainty with which we guarantee the Blockchain system participants' integrity has to lead to the emergence of cryptocurrency, a universal payment means that doesn't require any additional assurances from banks, governments, and other organizations. Thus, cryptocurrency: Is not limited by state boundaries Allows significantly minimize transaction costs Provides complete anonymity Makes payment transaction processing faster. The rise of Ethereum platform and its spread made it possible to create one's own cryptocurrency, that is, tokens. However, there's no need to build one's own infrastructure, attract miner pools and spend money on developing additional software.  STFcoin tokens in StopTheFakes.io system  The service will become a unified global system that facilitates the dialogue between people and companies from different parts of the world. Such a system was impossible to create before the emergence of fully functioning cryptocurrency market. Transaction costs and payment systems commission fees would simply constitute a larger part of the original cost of copyright infringement detection services. Yet, the efficacy of such measures would be next to none due to the difference in domestic legislation and slow payment processing.  On the second question: maybe you are right and maybe not. This is a hard question which only serious research of the market and consumer behavior can answer. At the moment, large companies lose about 20% of the market on counterfeit. About 20% of the budget is allocated on fighting against counterfeiters. So we have already 40%, which must be included in the cost of the goods. Accordingly, the question arises: what is more interesting for you, to buy a cheap counterfeit, which you will throw out in a couple of months or buy a quality product 40% more affordable, which will serve you for many years?",False

Thank you for your questions.  The core principles of StopTheFakes.io project: - Global reach. We are going to address copyright offenses worldwide, regardless of the jurisdiction they belong to. - Large-scale participation. We invite a great number of Doers such as regular Internet users and consumers. Geographic location and language, as well as goods consumed,  are virtually of no difference. - Everyone is welcome to detect offenses and register these findings with the right holders. - Transparency. We operate within a legal framework and have nothing to hide. All of our information will be accessible to the public, except for confidential data.  - Speed. The earlier an infringement is detected the less will the right holders lose. We always have to be one step ahead of the offender. - Affordability. We want to offer our service not only to big brands, but also small business owners and private parties. - Cooperation. We bring together trade associations, public organizations and everyone who is willing to take action and support the copyright protection agenda. - Dependability. Not only do we detect infringements but we also ensure data security and inalterability of the evidence collected. It was impossible to realize these principles before the emergence of Blockchain technology and cryptocurrency market formation. Our project is first to bring innovation to copyright protection.  Blockchain in StopTheFakes.io  Infringement detection Alerts sent by Doers have to be recorded in an unmodifiable way. The Alert contains the following data: Unique identifier assigned by the system Date and time of the recording Geodata and page address Date and time when the information was sent to the system Unique information on the device used for the recording Pictures, videos, screenshots The Doer's text comment This data is then formed into a unique block inscribed in the Ethereum blockchain. It contains a checksum of every file that's been enclosed in the Alert as well as every Alert's checksum. Modifying even one byte of information would change the checksums. The entry will not correspond to the block from the Ethereum chain. Once the Alert is taken up by the Requestor acceptance information is also added to Blockchain. This serves as a guarantee for the Doer.  Token  The absolute certainty with which we guarantee the Blockchain system participants' integrity has to lead to the emergence of cryptocurrency, a universal payment means that doesn't require any additional assurances from banks, governments, and other organizations. Thus, cryptocurrency: Is not limited by state boundaries Allows significantly minimize transaction costs Provides complete anonymity Makes payment transaction processing faster. The rise of Ethereum platform and its spread made it possible to create one's own cryptocurrency, that is, tokens. However, there's no need to build one's own infrastructure, attract miner pools and spend money on developing additional software.  STFcoin tokens in StopTheFakes.io system  The service will become a unified global system that facilitates the dialogue between people and companies from different parts of the world. Such a system was impossible to create before the emergence of fully functioning cryptocurrency market. Transaction costs and payment systems commission fees would simply constitute a larger part of the original cost of copyright infringement detection services. Yet, the efficacy of such measures would be next to none due to the difference in domestic legislation and slow payment processing.  On the second question: maybe you are right and maybe not. This is a hard question which only serious research of the market and consumer behavior can answer. At the moment, large companies lose about 20% of the market on counterfeit. About 20% of the budget is allocated on fighting against counterfeiters. So we have already 40%, which must be included in the cost of the goods. Accordingly, the question arises: what is more interesting for you, to buy a cheap counterfeit, which you will throw out in a couple of months or buy a quality product 40% more affordable, which will serve you for many years?",False

Thank you for your question.  Mode of operation  STAGE 1  The Requestor creates a Request by specifying his search query which may include a logo, a brand, signature style elements, etc. The Doer’s task is to find this information. The Requestor adds as much information as possible (what kind of infringements are of interest to him, countries, cities, etc.) The submitted Request goes to Reviewing (if necessary, the moderator asks and/or recommends to provide clarifications or to fill out other fields). The moderator’s work is done in the background and remains invisible to other users. When ready, the Request goes immediately to the Requests catalogue and is made viewable for Doers. The Requestor can indicate the desired number of Alerts by transferring the appropriate amount to the account.  ... you can find more information in WP (pages 19-25) here: https://stopthefakes.io/docs/WP_En.pdf  STAGE 3  The received Alert is redirected to the preliminary reviewing to check if it contains any prohibited material, such as pornography or graphic violence. When the reviewing stage is over, the Doer’s Alert goes to ‘Request with alerts’. Alerts containing all the details are added to the Request on this page. The Requestor receives an email inviting him or her to consider the new Alert. The Requestor decides on the Alert within a specific time limit. Based on the Requestor’s decision the signal is then assigned one of the three statuses:  1. The Alert is accepted. In this case, the Doer gets remuneration. 2. The Alert is being checked. 3. The Alert has been canceled. In this case, the Doer is not remunerated, and the Requestor must state the reason for declining the Alert by selecting one of the options from the menu and specifying in a text file why the Alert has not been accepted.  Rating system  In our opinion, our main challenge is to deal with low-quality or irrelevant data provided by Doers. Therefore, we are introducing a rating system to minimize Reviewing expenses and to improve the quality of Alerts.  Data processing is a costly and arduous process, so we intend to maximize Doers' involvement. Ratings will not only influence the level of earnings, but they also gamify the whole process. Introducing a game element incites competitive spirit and motivates Doers to work more productively.  General principles  The Service keeps track of the Doer’ rating and updates it in the online mode The rating system applies to Doers only Doers receive or lose points for specific actions The more points a user has, the higher his position and earnings Both Doers and Requestors can view the rating of any Doer, the number of points he earned and the latest modifications.   ...",False

The counterfeit market is huge. That's why the work will last for several decades. For investors, this is a good indicator.  About the team members:  Mikhail (Co-Founder) has a four-year legal experience in copyright protection. He worked in information security for four years and supervised a franchise project for another three years (18 facilities in the CIS).  Igor (Co-Founder): For over a decade he has been working on the problem of counterfeit beauty products in EU countries. He has 12-years experience in photography and video production and two-year experience in virtual reality business.  Igor Slabykh (advisor) advises the team on computer piracy-related legal issues. He has 15 years' experience in copyright protection. He worked for a number of companies, including Adobe Systems, 1C, Ergo and Solo. At present, he heads a law firm.  More information you can find on our website www.stopthefakes.io or Linkedin  Let us describe the general mode of operation of our service. - The requestor submits a request for infringement search. - Doers start working. - The infringement is detected. Two possible scenarios:  1. The requestor works with the alerts received independently (gets in touch with the offender, law enforcement agencies, etc.) 2. The requestor moves to the next stage and generates a complaint. - Complaint generation. The system generates a complaint, taking into consideration the scope and nature of the infringement and the legislation of the country, in which it has been detected. Two possible scenarios. 1. The requestor receives a ready legal document (Complaint) and takes action independently. 2. The requestor has the system file the complaint. - The system files the Complaint in a specific order, taking into consideration the jurisdiction requirements of the country, in which the infringement has been committed. A separate Complaint is generated for each address. 1. The Complaint is sent to the offender. 2. The Complaint is sent to the hosting provider. Accessible immediately. 3. The Complaint is sent to search engines. Accessible within five days following the sending of the Complaint to the hosting provider. 4. The Complaint is sent to the domain register intending to delegate the rights to the domain. Accessible within five days following the sending of the Complaint to the hosting provider. The requestor obtains the final report. We are fully aware of the fact that there will be cases when the involvement of law enforcement agencies or judicial institutions is required, but they will be fewer than at present because our method of dealing with infringements will make it possible to eliminate 90% to 92% of all the detected infringements.  At every stage, the requestor will be able to use the available data as he pleases or to entitle the service to eliminate the detected infringement. Furthermore, potential offenders also have access to the information that this or that brand is actively engaged in detecting infringements of their rights. This will give offenders yet another occasion to think about whether it makes sense to continue committing violations or maybe it would be better to go into legal business and have no fear of being brought to justice.",False

Very High Score on: https://icobench.com/ico/stopthefakes 49 experts expressed their approval for the StopTheFakes project.     StopTheFakes.io is a service allowing its users to detect violators of intellectual property rights, producers and distributors of counterfeit goods and pirates anywhere in the world!   WEBSITE|WHITEPAPER|ONE PAGER|TELEGRAM|TWITTER|FACEBOOK|MEDIUM|REDDIT   IT`S TIME TO STOP PIRACY AND COUNTERFEITING!  We've created a user-friendly and affordable Blockchain service for everyone to track and record cases of illegal use of their logo, trademark or any other intellectual property and to take immediate action to eliminate the infraction!    PROBLEM  According to the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development, the counterfeit market is over $461 billion, and the International Chamber of Commerce estimates that it will reach $2.81 trillion by 2022. The losses suffered by holders of intellectual property rights from computer piracy are difficult to estimate  CURRENT SITUATION  The public bodies and right holders spend huge sums on the detection of infringements of intellectual property rights, but to no avail. Fakes producers act quicker and are better organized! You’ll be surprised to know that only one out of ten clandestine enterprises are localized and shut! As a result, consumers obtain low-quality products, the environment is polluted, governments get less tax revenues, the number of jobs goes down, and right holders lose from 20% to 70% of their legal profits!  OUR SOLUTION  StopTheFakes.io is a service allowing its users to detect violators of intellectual property rights, producers and distributors of counterfeit goods and pirates anywhere in the world!  Governments and Right Holders will no longer have to spend enormous amounts of money searching for smugglers!  The army of Doers is ready for work! Doers are remunerated for every recorded infringement! All they need to do is take a picture or make a video or a screenshot on their smartphone or PC  In 12 to 16 months, detection of large numbers of infringements will allow access to the Big Data system for an additional analysis of the data collected in order to work in a proactive manner and to predict infringement patterns.  HOW IT WORKS   TECHNOLOGY  Using Ethereum-based Blockchain technology, we can guarantee the inalterability, authenticity and integrity of the infringements detected by Users, as well as the compliance with the rules by all users of the service.  Our use of the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) will allow us to store large amounts of data in a decentralized and independent manner!  STFCoin is the only method of payment on StopTheFakes.io. Users can purchase it with cryptocurrencies (on our service or at stock exchanges) or with fiat currencies (we will issue invoices in compliance with all the EU regulations, since our headquarters will be located in Prague, the Czech Republic).  INVESTORS  Technology enables us to stand up to pirates and counterfeit producers. In the past, the cost of locating infringements was too high, and right holders had to turn a blind eye to and put up with the sale of counterfeited brand products. Today, however, we can win. Our team developed a unique system that puts the latest technologies, such as Blockchain and decentralized networks, at the service of the law.  Criminals make right holders throughout the world lose over a billion of dollars per day. Our simple and effective solution will allow right holders to stop losing money. Big brands, world-famous producers and small entrepreneurs will all be able to get more profits.  Blockchain technology has so far been used to circumvent the bans imposed by government watchdogs, but we use it to help law enforcement agencies and big corporations.  Join us, let’s together change the world for the better and create a new industry!           ≈ $ 1,000,000 $ to share in the Bounty&Affiliate HERE        ANTI-COUNTERFEIT & COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT BLOCKCHAIN SERVICE     _______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________ StopTheFakes.IO │ SUBSCRIBE NOW Pre-ICO 1OO% raised ICO 21st of March 2018 _______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________ ANN THREAD | BOUNTY | WHITEPAPER | ONE PAGER | TELEGRAM | TWITTER | FACEBOOK | MEDIUM | LINKEDIN | REDDIT",False
