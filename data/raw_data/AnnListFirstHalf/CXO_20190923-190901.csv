I would suggest reading the blogs of their trips to confirm that: (they are also an interesting read)  https://cargox.io/news/china-see-you-blockchain/  https://cargox.io/news/it-is-all-about-timing/   Also, I the update for May was sent via e-mail:  May was just another one in the line of busiest months ever for us! We got huge amounts of work done - our CargoX Smart B/L solution is in its final development stage, our partners are actively testing it, and we have made a lot of progress on some interesting integrations as well.  We presented our solution at the EurTradeNet Annual 2018 in Belgrade and we visited the transport logistic China 2018, the leading trade fair for logistics, mobility, IT, and supply chain management. Igor Jakomin, Ph.D., CBDO of CargoX, had some really interesting after-thoughts about timing after the fair, and Stefan Kukman, CEO and founder of CargoX, described his feelings from his business trip to China. His intuition about China and blockchain was spot on, as only days after his visit the Chinese president Xi Jinping called blockchain a breakthrough technology.  Igor Jakomin also visited Collaborative Innovation Days in Barcelona and he presented the CargoX solution exclusively at the European Commission’s Mobility and Transport department, headed by Commissioner Violeta Bulc.  Last but not least - we have also produced a CargoX Business Overview and Technology Bluepaper, as promised in our CargoX Whitepaper. The document is available to our partners in its full form. Please, note that the Bluepaper available to the public does not include all of CargoX’s business details.  Stefan Kukman, CargoX CEO and founder, explains: “As we are a B2B provider and we are establishing ourselves in the logistics/supply-chain field, it is important to differentiate ourselves from just being an ICO to becoming an authority in the field where our products will be used. As you all know, we have decided not to spill out our business secrets regarding partners or deals that we make, or the internal workings of our solution - until they are completely safe to publish in terms of not giving a heads-up to our competitors about where we are heading. We are aware that the community, which we love so much, expects all the information from us - but we cannot reveal all the details, so that they do not fall into the wrong hands. It is our primary obligation towards the community to make the CargoX Smart B/L a huge success, and we are acting in the spirit of achieving this goal big time!”  Great times ahead of us for this one. I think it is quite independent to the whole crypto market in the long run. We will have to wait for the long run for this one, but when it will hit, it will hit hard. Very hard!",False

How safe is blockchain, and will I still have control over my data?  It’s easy to confuse cryptocurrencies with blockchain, since they are so closely connected. But while the value of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin can fluctuate wildly, blockchain, the underlying technology, is a permanent distributed ledger that records transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable, secure and permanent way, without the need to trust one centralised entity, or anyone at all for that matter. So while cryptocurrencies are still in their infancy, the technology that underpins those transactions is stable and proven. Every hour, blockchain technology enables millions of transactions, and secures assets of over USD 450 billion in value. To date, nobody has hacked the blockchain.

Using express courier services, it usually takes 5 to 10 days and it costs around $100 to get this document from origin to destination. By using Smart B/L, which is a blockchain-based token, we cut down the time and costs needed for B/L transfers. By sending tokens on the blockchain you can easily and securely change the ownership from Exporter to Importer which makes the Smart B/L tokens the perfect tool for claiming the ownership rights to the cargo.   Smart B/L is built on top of the blockchain’s capability to transfer digital value in an open and decentralised way, bringing this to the paper-plagued world of Global Trade.

The max amount of ETH that people could send was set at 5 ETH to prevent whales buying up all the tokens. The ICO hard cap was small to begin with and that's a good thing. It shows that these guys aren't here to just take peoples money, but they are here to deliver a solution for a critical problem in the shipping industry.

Logistics are the backbone of all global trade. Some 90% of all goods in global trade are handled by the sea shipping industry each year, making shipping one of the world’s biggest industries. And this industry still uses one of the world's oldest methods for issuing proof of ownership. Paper. Around 400,000 trees are felled just for the printing of Bills of Lading. Per year. Whoever has the Bill of Lading owns the goods in the container, making this piece of paper the most important document in global logistics. Blockchain and Smart Contracts are made for this industry.  About the Project Bill of Lading (B/L) document is the most important document in the global logistics industry. B/L is the mandatory document needed for every container that boards an ocean cargo ship. Over 50 million B/L paper documents are issued every year. Value of B/L document equals the value of shipped goods. Only holder of this document can claim the container at the destination port. Unfortunately, paper B/L documents themselves are the root cause of many challenges that plague the industry.  CargoX.io aims to disrupt the global logistics by introducing Smart Contract B/L documents based on blockchain technology, replacing old-style paper bill of lading documents. Problems and proposed solution - a Smart Contract based Bill of Lading By tokenising the Bill of Lading documents using the Ethereum blockchain network, we solve the biggest problems of logistics and supply chain management:  PAIN 1 — SPEED: These paper documents need to be sent from exporter to importer, and have an average travel time of more than a week while swapping hands of 2–3 courier delivery services.  PAIN 2 — LOST: The longer the voyage, higher the chances for documents to get lost or even stolen. Which would not be a problem, if the process to resolve it wouldn’t be a complete bureaucratic nightmare and the replacement document wouldn’t require over 20 days to be re-issued.  PAIN 3 — COST: Cost of issuing and transporting one paper B/L document is between $100-$180.  Blockchain-backed CargoX.io Smart B/L will offer a superior service at a fraction of the cost (<$12). Users of CargoX Smart B/L will be able to transfer cargo ownership rights in a safe and transparent way, in mere seconds instead of weeks.

Dear CargoX.io supporter,  Judging from comments and feedback, our community is eagerly awaiting the CargoX ICO start. We are delighted that you are as passionate about CargoX as we are! Without further adieu, finally we can announce the CargoX ICO smart contract address!  CargoX ICO smart contract: 0x6267b5376c809445c9432bd9f14a3808b00eae2c  Exactly at 15:00:00 CET / 14:00:00 UTC on 23 January 2018, it will start accepting contributions from your whitelisted wallet addresses.  To give everyone a better chance of contributing, we have stopped new registrations once counter hit 10,000 approved KYCs. Even with the 5 ETH personal contribution cap for the first 3 hours, we have a feeling, that ICO might be over very quickly.  Just don’t forget that you can only contribute from ETH address that you have specified in your KYC. You MUST NOT send ETH from exchange! You MUST NOT send ETH from wallet for which you do not hold the private key, or which does not support ERC20 tokens. For a list of supported wallets visit https://cargox.io/wallet-CXO-token-support/.  Recommended gas limit >= 400,000  Recommended gas price > 40 GWEI  Because of the smart contract mechanics, contributing to it requires a little more gas than a regular transaction. If you want to make transaction faster, hence raising your probability to secure your spot in the CargoX ICO before it reaches hardcap, you might want to raise both values! But do calculate how much you are paying for the transaction (we recommend using https://ethgasstation.info), as raising these values can become increasingly expensive.  Be vigilant! Scammers at work! They will rob you blind, if you are not careful!  Are you 100% sure, you are sending ETH to the right address? Before sending your ETH anywhere, please double check the destination address. You should cross-check the address of our smart contract on several CargoX official sources. The address should be the same everywhere!  As an additional layer of security, we have partnered with Clearify.io, to permanently store ICO contract address and ICO name on the blockchain, which is much harder to falsify. Visit https://clearify.io and input our contract address to verify. You should see the name CargoX and our URL https://cargox.io",False

Top 5 issues of cargo shippers and carriers regarding the Bill of Lading   The Bill of Lading (B/L), which is the key document (besides the contract for purchasing the goods), that currently needs to be issued in paper and transferred physically — securely and safely, usually in more than one copy — can cause numerous problems for the shipper, carrier or purchaser.  One thing is clear — without the original Bill of Lading, the cargo can not be delivered at the destination port, except via a court order (which can take a long time to process).  As the value of the B/L equals the value of the cargo inside a container (on average this is USD 60,000). When the cargo is received, and the B/L is issued by the carrier, this document has to be sent to the owner (shipper) of the cargo. Once payment for the cargo has been received, the owner (shipper) sends this original document to the buyer of the goods (Cnee or Consignee, or in case of L/C a bank) by express courier service (UPS, DHL, Fedex). Upon arrival of the vessel at the destination port the carrier or designated release agent asks the importer (buyer) to present the original Bill of Lading in order to release the shipment to the importer.  There are upsides, but also some downsides of this traditional way of issuing and processing a Bill of Lading.  High cost  Today each Bill of Lading has to be printed out on paper and then sent via express parcel delivery companies such as UPS, Fedex, etc. This is extremely time and money consuming, as the average express courier costs are above USD 100 for each B/L.  Complications when lost  The B/L can be lost, stolen or compromised in some other way. In this case the legal procedures are time consuming, and a significant amount of money is required to reclaim the cargo from the carrier. The importers need to officially declare the B/L lost, and this alone results in weeks of waiting for a new B/L to be issued. This also causes cost of demurrage at the port of destination, late cargo arrival problems, and in some industries, this can cause total factory downtime with multi-million dollar losses and claims.  Low speed  As mentioned before — it can take ages to receive a B/L in a conventional way. The issuer (carrier or NVOC) needs to send it to the shipper (1–2 days), the shipper sends it to a bank of the importer or to the importer (3–5 days), and then the importer sends it to destination carrier office for container release (carrier, forwarder, agent — 1–2 days). In total, each B/L travels with at least 3 courier services and it is in transit for a period of 5–10 days. Just imagine, how many times it can get lost, stolen, or damaged. Reiterate that with the number of cargo loads you are sending.  CargoX: Fast, cheap, safe, secure and reliable  That is why CargoX is up to revolutionize the industry. We are developing the world’s first blockchain Bill of Lading.  CargoX will create an open system based on Ethereum and encrypted permanent decentralised data storage which will enable the creation and exchange of Bill of Lading documents.

And having smart contract in the middle of everything really solves this dilemma. At the end, standardization is just pure math, unless powers that be, degrade it into a political question.  Although we are beginning our journey with a total focus on MVP and its first field pilot, this short glance into the future reveals that we already know we’ll be a disruptive ecosystem that will also be one of the most vocal standardisation forces for the outdated world of logistics.  p.s. did we mention, that blockchain based B/L’s proof of ownership will be something, that parties will be able to do without an actual transaction — meaning it will be fee-less as well…  p.s.s.

On a beautiful and sunny Sunday afternoon, CargoX registrations have hit 10,000 approved KYCs.  In order to say thank you to our early community members — the ones who actually read our whitepaper and who believed in us since before media picked us up — we have decided to stop the registration/KYC process early.  Tomorrow we will peg the ETH/USD rate (7-day average) to get the final amount of ETH to be raised in CargoX ICO on Tuesday, 23 January 2018 @ 15:00 CET / 14:00 UTC. But even with personal cap limit set at 5 ETH for the first 3 hours of CargoX ICO, it looks like demand will be higher than supply. We don’t want to ignite a gas war, but we also believe in a free economy, therefore we stand by our decision not to limit gas or gas price.  Some other ICOs in a similar position have decided to raise their hard-cap, but we don’t believe this to be an appropriate solution.. Therefore the only logical thing to ease the ICO pressure a little bit was to close the registration doors early in order to avoid contributor oversubscription.  If you were early enough to register and complete the KYC process, you are all set to be part of Tuesday’s CargoX ICO (23 January 2018 @ 15:00 CET / 14:00 UTC). We advise that you check your KYC status and registered ETH wallet at https://cargox.io/kyc-profile. Prepare yourself and fill up your wallet and be sure to only send funds from it.

In many cases, an NVOCC operator  might request for a telex release from the shipping line so that they can issue their house bill of lading to their customer. So in reality we/you will be facing one process in old fashion way and another one with smart contract one for same shipment therefore at least with NVOCC your idea will be still colliding with 2 systems? b) Since the project in my eyes would really ""fly"" only when Ocean carrier (as the direct carrier) would adopt the smart B/L via block chain how do you plan to realize that? Asking due to the fact that shipping lines are extremely rigid in terms of adoption the new technology (mainly due to the size and defragmentation of local offices-agents), and knowing that even the basics e.g. centralize billing or track and trace are in 2018 not a milestone yet achieved for many of them - talking about top 10 biggest lines.  Wishing your project a good start and a success and looking forward for your answers and potentially some further debate.",False

Read and you will know   https://cargox.io/#questions   ICO/KYC related What is the hard cap of the ICO? Why is your cap so low, just USD 7 million? What is the minimum contribution in the ICO? What is the maximum contribution per person in the ICO? If I contributed 7 ETH in the presale, does your 5 ETH ICO limit mean that you will return 2 ETH to me? Where can I see my contributions, and the amount of CXO tokens I will receive? Where can I see the contribution address for the ICO? Must I really wait for the ICO to start to send a contribution? In my KYC application I announced that I would contribute 1 ETH. Can I contribute more now, or is that limited for me? What is the gas price that I need to set in order to contribute successfully? Why have you decided to take a 7-day average ETH/USD price for valuation of ICO? Isn’t this unfair towards presale participants? Where can I see the ETH wallet address which I entered in the KYC form? I mistakenly entered an exchange address instead of my own wallet address in KYC. What can I do to fix this? In the presale I mistakenly contributed from an exchange address. Is that money lost, or can it be fixed so that my contribution counts? I (we, an ICO group) wish to invest 1000+ ETH. Can you offer me (us) an additional discount? Do I understand correctly – you will only do the USD/ETH/CXO conversion once, both for presale and ICO tokens? Is the token locked with a ratio at the time of the ICO? What was the presale price? What will the initial ICO price be? What are your bonuses for contributions? Can I send ETH from an exchange? Can I send ETH from one address that I hold the private keys of, but which is different from the address where I want to receive tokens? Can I contribute in several transactions? Will I receive a confirmation when my ETH is transferred to your address? When will you be listed on exchanges (and which ones)? Do I really need to go through the KYC (Know Your customer) process? Can citizens of the US and China contribute? Why do you prefer ETH over BTC? I forgot my password for the KYC system, how do I reset it? Do i get bonus if I refer someone. How do I get a referral link? CXO token related What is the CXO token supply? What will you do with remaining tokens? Will there be any? Will you mint another batch of CXO coins at a later time? What will the CXO tokens be used for? When do I receive CXO tokens? When will team tokens be unlocked. Are there any other locked tokens? Where do I find the market price of CXO after the crowdsale? Which wallets support CXO token?   CargoX related Where is CargoX based? Slovenia or Hong Kong? Are you related to the CargoX shipping company from Brazil, or CargoX PTA from Spain? Do the team members have a long history of collaborating? Has any team member left the team? Are you only handling sea freight? Do shipping companies need to have a blockchain expert employed to use your service? Will you implement atomic swaps for the B/L tokens? Are there other companies blockchainising Bills of Lading? Why is it important to reduce shipping time for B/L documents from weeks to minutes, if the container cargo on a ship is travelling for many weeks anyway? Aren't there a lot of companies who use e-waybill already (e-waybill is a B/L but just sent by e-mail)? The biggest shippers like Maersk, MSC, China Shipping do that a lot. What is CargoX's advantage over e-waybill? Will you distribute the profits or part of the profits of CargoX to token holders? If yes, how – buyback and burn, or ETH dividends, or… If not, why should the price of CXO token appreciate? What are the barriers in accepting your service as a legal equivalent of an actual paper Bill of Lading? Isn't the telex version of B/L already widely used nowadays? Which advantage over telex B/L do you see in your product? Where can I see a comparison of a paper B/L vs. Blockchain B/L? What happens if the CXO price rises dramatically? Will the CargoX B/L become uncompetitive? Where will shipping firms get CXO tokens from? Is the CargoX.io project open source? Is the actual product functional? Or only in theory? Are you waiting for the ICO to finish before development? Have you looked at *this* or *that* similar project? What about your partnerships? How will CargoX earn money, if the CXO tokens are already sold? When will you beta-test the smart B/L? Is CargoX.io the only blockchain solution for paper-based proof of ownership? Why do you use blockchain technology and not just a regular database? Does your solution make screening easier, or are documents just scanned instead of digitised? How will you solve this issue if the customs authority in each country requires the original documents? Is there any GitHub or demo that can be reviewed to shows the product you are proposing? As far as I can see there seems to be nothing to show us. There is no prototype of the new B/L protocol. There is not much technical detail in the whitepaper. Is there more detail somewhere? You are proposing to be the arbiter between parties in disputes. I think there would be concern amongst the industry about being reliant on a single party for this.

Disrupting the Shipping Industry With Smart B/L on the blockchain there will be no need for paper B/L anymore.  Secure No central storage which could be attacked by hackers. Global Trade's most important document is encrypted and securely written on the blockchain network, accessible only with traders' private keys.  Fast Smart B/L is issued instantly and is immediately available to the Exporter. When agreed conditions are met, Smart B/L is transferred to the legal owner of goods – instantly, without couriers in the middle. Just like sending an e-mail.  Paperless A blockchain-based Smart B/L will be equivalent to a paper one. Having it on the blockchain just takes the pain away. No need to print, send, store and archive it in a conventional way anymore.  Cost savings Each paper B/L is sent at least three times with couriers making it extremely expensive and slow. The average cost for sending a B/L three times is around $100 and it takes up to 10 days to reach the final destination. More than 50 million B/Ls are created every year.  Bill of Lading Fact Sheet 50+ million B/L each year  More than 50 million Bill of Lading documents are created each year.    $100 costs per document  Average Bill of Lading courier costs are $100 per document.    $5 billion courier costs per year  Companies could save $5 billion per year just on courier costs.    5 to 10 business days  It takes 5 to 10 business days on average for a Bill of Lading to get from its origin to the destination.   From the Past to the Future A Bill of Lading is issued for sea-freight shipments and it gives the holder of this document the ownership rights to the cargo.  Using express courier services, it usually takes 5 to 10 days and it costs around $100 to get this document from origin to destination. By using Smart B/L, which is a blockchain-based token, we cut down the time and costs needed for B/L transfers. By sending tokens on the blockchain you can easily and securely change the ownership from Exporter to Importer which makes the Smart B/L tokens the perfect tool for claiming the ownership rights to the cargo.

If yes, how – buyback and burn, or ETH dividends, or… If not, why should the price of CXO token appreciate?  We believe in building a service that will provide more and more value to its users and we intend to innovatively entangle our token with core interactions on our platform, which are the creation and utilisation of digital B/L documents.  Our token is a part of our digitised business model, a part of our software and we do not believe that destroying assets is the right way to do business.  Our aim will be to minimise the transaction costs of such interactions, to provide better matchings and to provide trust — of course, leading to a bigger and bigger CargoX ecosystem. But this does not mean that we will be passive in regard to CXO tokens — we are planning to use them mostly to actively incentivise the launch of our platform and later incentivise its growth; to provide better and better utility for token owners.  So, the answer to your question is no, we are not planning to distribute profits to token holders, we are not planning to burn the tokens or put in place a mechanism to do a buyback. But we will do our best (e.g. using the substantial part of platform's profits) to grow our user-base and design CXO utilities in such a way that more and more users will be active on our platform.  Please note that both, dividends and promise of buyback or burning tokens to push the price up can do more (long-term legal) harm to the project than (short-term) benefit. We will wait for the regulators to perform proper scrutiny of such practices and will consider their response while designing our incentivisation mechanisms.   What is a Bill of Lading? A Bill of Lading (sometimes abbreviated as B/L or BoL) is a document issued by a carrier (or his agent) to acknowledge receipt of cargo for shipment. This document is used in the sea-freight industry. Bills of lading ensure that exporters receive payment and importers receive the merchandise.    Why is it important to reduce shipping time for B/L documents from weeks to minutes, if the container cargo on a ship is travelling for many weeks anyway? There are also faster and shorter routes where a container needs only a few days. But in general that is true. However, a B/L is issued when the vessel / container departs (usually within 3 days), and in a perfect scenario the importer would get the B/L before the arrival of container (with high express courier costs). In many cases this is not how it goes. There are payment delays due to bank transfer, sometimes the importer needs few days to get the money, there are holidays in between, etc. And each day of the container waiting in port will incur additional costs, not to mention other issues which might arise due to late container delivery.  What are the barriers in accepting your service as a legal equivalent of an actual paper Bill of Lading? Going directly to carriers (Maersk, MSC, CMA,...) would keep things slow. But we have done it it differently.  We will approach logistics companies who can accept this without any issues, as long as they are certain that the one claiming the goods is the only one with this B/L token. And this is easily done in blockchain. Just like sending eth from one address to another. So the exporter will send ‘B/L token’ to importer once he gets paid. At that moment he will no longer have it, only the importer will. And it is archived for a certain period of time – a benefit available to token holders.  In second phase, we aim to address that “once he gets paid” part, as currently this action is clearly based on trust. Once we integrate onchain payments, the B/L smart contract will detect payment, and change ownership of the B/L from the exporter to the importer automatically. No need to trust anyone, and no need for expensive escrow like L/C (bank's letter of credit).    How long has the CargoX team been together? Some of the core members know each other and have worked together for more than 15 years, but most of them more than 10 years. The founders worked together at K+N, so have a long history together.    What do the shipping companies need to do or know in order to use CargoX smart B/L solution? Do they need to have a blockchain expert employed just to use your service? The process will be quite easy, they will either need to register/login or EDI/API connect with our Smart B/L dApp. Once the B/L is created, it is stored in a decentralised storage – there are already the public addresses of the importer/exporter in that document. All parties will just need to do KYC, so we know who is who, as the B/L can not just be issued by anyone. No other knowledge will be needed. If they use online banking, they should be just fine. There is no need for any development on the part of our partners or logistics companies. If you print a B/L today on paper, you are good to go with our dApp.   Will you implement atomic swaps for the B/L tokens? Atomic swaps will enable cheaper, faster and safer exchange transactions between different crypto currencies. The technology is still in the prototype status and we are monitoring it closely. Since our token will be an ERC 20 token, we will rely on the capabilities of the Ethereum network, especially the Raiden network.  We are confident that it will be crucial in the future to eliminate any friction in exchange to and from several other crypto currencies, tokens and fiat. Hence, we are following the progress made by other development teams (e.g. altcoin.io, ace-platform.com, tokens.net). Since our primary innovation is in the shipping industry, we believe in establishing long-term partnerships with projects that are developing customer friendly solutions, that will enable fast, secure and user-friendly exchange and will in future take care for adaptations to the newest exchange technologies, like atomic swaps.   Aren't there a lot of companies who use e-waybill already (e-waybill is a B/L but just sent by e-mail)? The biggest shippers like Maersk, MSC, China Shipping do that a lot. What is CargoX's advantage over e-waybill? E-waybill B/L can not resolve the trust issue. If you have a B/L that means importer has paid for the goods from exporter... If the importer doesn’t have the B/L, there might be many reasons behind this and in the worst case the exporter can claim the goods back from the logistics provider...  There are several versions of this document. There is also the seaway bill (and others) which doesn’t need to be presented physically. However, the B/L is the only guarantee the exporter has that he will get paid for goods produced.  Having the B/L on the blockchain means that it cannot be stolen or lost, its ownership and authenticity is 100% verifiable by anyone, meaning that it can be highly trusted (emails can be spoofed on the other hand). Also, it means no more scanning of documents, thus it is time saving.  And we don’t even focus on shipping lines: our target group are freight forwarders, which issue more B/Ls than shipping lines.    Why such a low cap of only $7 million? Lately, more or less every ‘hairdresser‘ has an ICO looking for at least $16 million. We calculated that $7m is enough to develop and implement our product. Additionally, we have reserved 25% of tokens for future development. With a low hard cap we are forcing ourselves to do make smart and calculated decisions, which we believe is the only way for a business to succeed. Also, this way, there are more benefits for ICO contributors.   What is the total supply of CargoX.io CXO tokens? The total number of coins will be known after we have locked the USD/ETH ratio, which will be done the day before the public, no-limit ICO officially starts. Since our hard cap target is in USD, we need that ratio to calculate the maximum number of coins for investors, and with that also the total supply.   More at www.cargox.io",False

That is why CargoX is about to revolutionise the industry. We are developing the world’s first blockchain Bill of Lading. We will create an open system based on Ethereum and encrypted permanent decentralised data storage which will enable the creation and exchange of Bill of Lading documents.  The diagram above illustrates the workflow between different parties in the CargoX system.  Our blockchain-based Smart B/L will work in a similar way to tokens. Users (shippers, carriers, forwarders, importers) will be able to create, transfer and claim ownership of the B/L, and thereby the cargo that is the subject of the B/L.  The process will be simple, smooth, safe and secure, but also cheaper and much, much faster than it is today with technology with roots in the Roman times!  A simple and secure process  At the origin the carrier uses our dApp (distributed application) to create a blockchain-assisted Smart B/L with the exporter’s address and sends it as a token to the exporter. After receiving the money for the goods from the importer, the exporter transfers ownership of the Smart B/L to the importer using our dApp. The importer can claim ownership of the goods at the destination port by presenting the Smart B/L token to the carrier or designated release agent at the destination using our dApp. At the destination the carrier releases the goods to the importer once the importer proves ownership of the Smart B/L token. All global-trade-sensitive information will be hidden from public view and only shown to the importer, the exporter and the issuer of the Smart B/L and to the designated release agent at destination; special care will be given to properly secure all information about multiple business interactions between the same peers.  What is needed for Smart B/L to thrive  To build the ecosystem and drive the market, the CargoX will create tools, initial rules and protocols to ease and incentivise the interactions between partners, to boost network growth and facilitate creation and exchange of Smart B/L by actively developing the following elements:  A governing body comprised of industry leaders that will be responsible for the adoption of the standard in the industry and legislature. CargoX B/L eXchange protocol (B/L X) for exchange of Bill of Lading (B/L) documents.  CXO token that will serve as a protocol utility token and allow decentralised transfer of digital ownership claim and facilitate a payment method for logistics services. Smart B/L dApp is a web-based decentralised application allowing customers to interact with a Smart B/L digital document. Smart L/C dApp will allow depositing of money in accordance with smart contract and will be released when the buyer receives the goods. Banks and current L/C procedure such as escrows and payment intermediaries will become obsolete.  Smart Booking Module — integrated at external shipping platforms (such as 45HC.com, etc) Gains  Revolutionary gains will be achieved through speeding up the process, as it will take minutes or at most hours, not days, to deliver the document in a safe and secure way.  There will be no intermediaries involved, and the document will be stored in a distributed and publicly confirmed way, yet it will be encrypted so that its contents will only be available to the issuer and the recipient.
