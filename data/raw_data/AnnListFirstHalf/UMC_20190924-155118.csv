We are still working with the client and are currently attempting to sync the client with the network on the blockchain. So far it works in a test environment and must be stress tested once we solve this program communication issue to ensure it works across the network. Once we have confirmed it functions in a small test group a larger test across a greater volume of users will occur.  We also recently put out a poll asking the community if the utility we are working to provide should be usable in any hardship outside of the realm of insurance-related overhead costs and the response has been overwhelming yes to this question.  The changes that must be made to the client to function in this way will not be hard to accomplish as it involves removing some restrictions and rewording some of the interfaces and functions. We would still be using the original code submitted on the GitHub with some minor alterations.  The road has been long for us all It has been a wild rollercoaster thus far and regardless of the setbacks our team has no intention of walking away.

We do have a demo version which you can see here. It isn't complete and isn't ready for beta testing, but let us know what you think: http://staging.umc.meteorapp.com/  During this time, we are in contact with several large insurance companies about offering benefits packages on our blockchain solution. We are advising some, and potentially partnering with others. Nothing formal to announce yet, but we think as we get closer to client launch we will have a great chance of solidifying something.  We're entering the busy holiday season, but that's not stopping our progress! We have blockchain integration and workflows working locally! This is a huge landmark for the project and we're one step closer to going live. We want to ensure everything runs smoothly and accurately when we go live so we anticipate 2-3 months of testing and bug fixing. Thanks for your continued support.

This is has been a crazy month for us here at Umbrella Coin. Our last month had few ups and downs, the major being the transition of the new team from previous team and subsequently the loss of a great development team. Today we’re pleased to announce after discussions with few aspirants, we’ve hired a new developer towards our project. The new developer is a research scientist at Virginia Tech and has worked on lots of projects as a hobby and commercially. In the last few days, he has worked on the product to add support for UI for uploading documentation for claims as well as support for integration of UMC wallet with user accounts. Right now, mostly efforts have been made on UI development side and we will continue to work to add functionality to the buttons and integrate them with smart contracts.   On another note, we have revamped and relaunched our smart contract to give a greater bonus to our investors. As of now, we have compensated all previous investors with a doubling of your initial investments. We have also developed a new reward tier system for the remainder of this sale. The news tiers will be as follows:     1st Tier: 350 ETH – we will give a 4x bonus (2400 UMC/ETH) 2nd Tier: 351-1000 ETH – we will give a 3x bonus (1800 UMC/ETH) 3rd Tier: 1001-1950 ETH – we will give a 2x bonus (1200 UMC/ETH) 4th Tier: 1951-4000 ETH – we will give a 1.5x bonus (900 UMC/ETH) 4001 EtH and after will receive 600 UMC/ETH as normal     You can join our crowdfund by going to https://www.umbrellacoin.org/crowdfund/ Remember, we will not and do not post our contract address anywhere other than the site. If you see it anywhere else, it may be an attempt to trick you.   On a last note, I would like remind everyone that our #getyourumbrellasout picture contest is still running to the end of the crowdsale! Don’t forget to submit those pictures, because the ones we have gotten so far have been great! For more info on this contest visit: https://www.umbrellacoin.org/umbrella-coin-photo-contest/   We can’t even begin to express our appreciation for the support that our amazing community has provided us over these past months.

UmbrellaCoin Mod, if this is a policy for your mod team, don't even think about deleting this post here because I will make a new thread and write about it on my Steem. It's already saved to my hard drive so super easy for me to do. You should have allowed a discussion instead of auto-banning dissent.

People on the telegram group are wondering if there is something wrong with the app that messages are being deleted, but the truth is that we are being censored. I do not appreciate this, nor does the community. Some members of the community were voicing their agreement with me, which makes it all the more inappropriate to ban me in an attempt to silence dissent.  The bonus structure has changed with this new ICO, and these are different terms than we invested with at first. Early investors were promised a 100% bonus over other investors, which we were all entitled to receive when the smart contract ended. Our original coins were doubled for all the problems the team had, but now we find these new investment terms with tiers of 400% and 300% bonuses offered. In effect, there is no bonus for those that invested originally compared to the 400% tier, and decreased bonus than originally promised compared to the 300% tier. This amounts to dilution of the early investors. The team did this simply because there were not many people investing at first, and they want to attract more funds. They did not even ask the community for our opinion when they changed the investment terms.   ",False

People who trusted our platform early on have been eager to hear updates from our side regarding marketing, team, whether we will continue if we don’t hit our “soft cap” and what happens to all unsold UMC tokens during the crowdsale. The time is finally right for us to share the answers with you. We have continued to make great progress on both the marketing as well as the development front with more scenarios being available in our staging app, and we’re now closer to integrating UMC Wallet with the website, as well as creation of claims and voting on individual claims. However the development team has faced personal hurdles in the past week, as conflict-of- interest with their current job has required them to step down from their positions as developers for our platform. Unfortunately this includes our CEO who works at the same company and has been confronted by the same HR policies. As a result, all of them have forfeited their share of UMC tokens. We thank them for the time and effort they spent making this product a success.  Our new team However we’ve worked out a transition going forward. Ryan, who has worked full-time in insurance industry and has left his position there to avoid any conflicts of interest has volunteered to take over the responsibilities as the new CEO. Alex, who was the Head of Marketing and a co-founder for UMC has also decided to commit himself purely to the success of UmbrellaCoin and is COO. Emilio and Nick have also left their previous jobs to dedicate themselves to the success of UMC as a web developer/ media manager. Our ex-CEO continues to assist us through the transition process. All of them are from the Hartford, CT area and have shared beliefs on things needing fundamental change in insurance industry having grown up so close to it. We continue our search for full-time developers as a result of the recent departures but till then we are receiving part-time/ freelance assistance. If you want to contribute to the development efforts, do contact us. Min Cap and fate of unsold tokens The departure of our development team has freed a lot of our funds, and as a result we have decided to reduce our soft-cap significantly to 1500 ETH. This was partially facilitated by ETH’s price boom since the beginning of ICO. When we originally set the cap for this project, ETH was in the mid-100s after suffering a prolonged decline, so we had to adjust our funding goal accordingly. The presale bonus continues though. As to the question of the unsold tokens during the crowdsale after much discussion on whether to put it back into the float or not, we’ve decided we would burn all the unsold tokens during the crowdsale. There will be some tokens left over for the new development team, but it will be a significantly reduced amount. After the momentary storm, our prospects look bright going from here.  We’ll be soon featured in some Youtube videos by prominent marketing specialists, have struck some marketing deals and continue to work with the exchanges such as Evercoin, Hitbtc to get listed after the crowdsale besides Coinomi and EtherDelta. We hope to reach our soft-cap within the next week. We’re all working hard on our shared goals to provide coverage for out-of-pocket costs to policyholders who’ve suffered in the hands of insurance and we have necessary funds at this stage to continue execution.",False

Is this a good time?  terry - Today at 3:28 PM hey thanks for looking at our work. we're always happy to answer questions  cryptoisdafuture - Today at 3:29 PM Great. My first question was what sets you apart from other insurance offerings on the blockchain such as InsureX?  terry - Today at 3:29 PM great question. first of all, I think it['s important to note that we're not insurance. we're not offering any services in that space and we're not having customers sign insurance contracts.  We're really concerned about how millions of people have to pay huge out of pocket expenses, even when they already pay so much in premiums and that's true in almost every sector - auto, home, life ,health etc. we're trying to fill a certain niche and there are not many other offerings like us and we're not in this to gouge you like regular insurers, our plan is to give you the principle of your policy back after one year if certain conditions are met. you don't get that with traditional insurance  cryptoisdafuture - Today at 3:32 PM  wow that full refund idea is wonderful.  Do you intend to operate just in US, or other countries as well?  terry - Today at 3:33 PM personally, I'm most comfortable with US jurisdiction, but we have a diverse team from Asia, Australia and Central America and the community in MENA / East Asia seems to be enthusiastic about this working there too. healthcare is much less of an issue in countries with socialized medicine but there are still auto mandates in a lot of places if there are any issues supporting many different places, we can always make adjustments to our smart contracts but yeah initially we're aiming to cover as much as possible  cryptoisdafuture - Today at 3:36 PM  Right, I have some friends abroad as well who complain about out-of-pocket costs of auto insurance. However what do you think about legal challenges? Insurance and healthcare in general is such a regulated area and cryptocurrencies continue to have changing regulations by SEC. How do you plan to stay on the right side of law?  terry - Today at 3:36 PM  another great question, and a difficult one we get asked a lot. we've spent a lot of time ensuring we're on the right side of law and the SEC. we wrote up a terms and conditions you can see on our github and we link to on the website. Let me find it https://github.com/umbrellacoin/umc/blob/master/documents/umc-terms.pdf  Basically, US and HK residents can't participate in the crowdsale, we're not insurance and we're not here to promise if you help fund us that you will see any monetary gain that's what a Ponzi scheme would do; we're trying to fill a legitimate customer need and we think blockchain is the best way to address the issue due to the efficiency of smart contracts and the security they provide so we're not going be a security  After the crowdsale, US customers are free to use our service, just not as an investment; you need to suffer real damages to have a chance at using our service - at best you should break even as far as insurance regulations go. we think we'll face licensing challenges from the insurance lobby, but the decentralized nature offers us time to build a customer base who actually love the service we provide. we go to this example a lot, but Uber and AirBnB would have been considered illegal because of licensing requirements when they started but regulators weren't ready to deal with apps in 2008 and they were playing catch up so by the time they did catch up, there was a real user base and real demand for their services - regulators worked with them to coexist with taxi companies and ensure customer safety, driver background checks etc. we'll be compliant with HIPAA for information privacy to begin with, but if regulators ask us to do more in the fture we can enable our contracts to do the same  cryptoisdafuture - Today at 3:44 PM  Wow, that was a lot of explanation to my simple question.  I will check the link for sure.  Thanks a lot for going through the pain to type all that out :smiley:  terry - Today at 3:45 PM  no problem. we've debated this a lot amongst the development team and it's questions like this which help us ensure high standards of customer service do you have any other questions?  cryptoisdafuture - Today at 3:46 PM  Yeah, I did. It was on your code. So I am a software developer by profession, and I was going through your Github. I really like how you’ve created a separation of concerns in your frontend, server, blockchain and smartchain logic. Even though I have developed an idea myself, I just want to make sure I am on the same page so- how are you making sure you’re reducing the amount of gas (Ether) spent on verifying transactions?  terry - Today at 3:47 PM  great technical question - we don't get many of those from potential users but we are thrilled to answer this. we were founded on a passion of creating software basically, we're trying to move as much of the code which executes smart contracts to the server as we can. we want to keep the critical business logic on the blockchain for example, when you file a claim, the results from the vote will be processed on the server and based on the next action we will continue executing on the server only when we know what the actual change will be (refund, claim state or some other core business logic) will we make a call to our contracts you can see some examples in claims.sol or contribution.sol  cryptoisdafuture - Today at 3:50 PM  great. yeah, I went through some of those files and I will go through it again, might even tweak with your code if I find time. It sounds efficient. I see the blockchain integration code is not there yet. Is that something in the work yet?  terry - Today at 3:51 PM  we're focusing more on verifying the crowdsale and token contracts for now and standalone development of business logic contracts. we want to make sure the sale runs smoothly but we also have the server piece being developed separately, mostly using mock data.  when we iron out more of the contracts to the point where all of the base cases are functional, we will start integrating smart contract calls with our javascript application you can try our prototype at http://staging.umbrellacoin.meteorapp.com/ in the whitepaper and on the website, we gave an estimated date of launch around October-November of this year I think we're well on track for that  cryptoisdafuture - Today at 3:53 PM  sounds excellent. I will play around with the prototype, thanks. I tried it once a week back or so, but will see any if there are more developments. Thanks a lot for answering my questions, I feel much more confident to use your services after this discussion and I hope other people also see the utility of this. If it's fine with you, can I share this discussion on the original BitcoinTalk thread  terry - Today at 3:54 PM  yeah sure, that's fine. we always appreciate the community getting involved and votes of confidence from our potential users. we want to make this product great and we want to make it work for the people using it. we love any feedback or further questions you might have if not, have a great day   cryptoisdafuture - Today at 3:56 PM Thanks again",False

If anything I would expect there to be a sizable group of people who try to be as stingy as possible. Related to this, we all know that the (real or not) hot girl in trouble is going to get 3x the votes a man in the same situation would, another sizable chunk of the community will be pretty biased against everyone who doesn't look like them and so on. Decentralizing oracles work for prediction markets where there is a clear right answer that anybody can look up, but I don't see a good way to make this work for something with this much subjectivity.

We've had very long discussions amongst our team members on both opposite scenarios- policyholders intentionally voting “No” to prevent the pool’s amount to be used for other agents, as well as colluding on “Yes” votes by making false claims and splitting payouts amongst pools. The first we’ll address here since you ask, it is a very fine example of the tragedy of the commons. Ideally, we’d want everyone to know we’re trying everyone on our end to keep solvent, so denying someone else’s legitimate claim doesn’t help their claim in any way. In no way are they entitled to ""a bigger share"" by denying a claim. We're not an investment fund and the most you can possibly own without making a claim is what you paid in.  However, we understand that might not be sufficient, and we need to infuse some incentives and regulations. Therefore, we intend to provide some incentives in the form of reduced cooling period, increased maximum amount attainable for good “citizens” of our democracy who execute their civic duty in a timely manner and with good results. For every user, we’d be storing their voting history and would tally it against the outcome of the vote in smart contract itself. If there’s a sharp discrepancy in the alignment of results over a sustained period, we’ll notify the user with a warning. We aren't publishing user identity and we're not publishing vote results until the vote has concluded. We’re also working on alternate ways of “reputation” in community, but might work on it in upcoming iterations.  To answer your bias vs correctness problem, we do intend on having a claims adjuster on the team to help identify the ""right side,"" at least initially, while the community is built up. This will not necessarily swing votes, but it will give us better insight on who is more in-line with sound analysis. We're trying to build a community built on trust. People trust their insurance assessor even though they can carry the exact same biases as a group collective. We need to help get the community off the ground to build this trust.

I know in at least the US and Canada there are car insurance mandates. We posted some links on our twitter about business insurance in Asia being unpopular due to cost and rising insurance premiums in the UK. At worst, people are aware of insurance, but there may be other reasons why they don't pursue it like confusion of language or cost. I think insurance can very much be a reactive industry around the world, and we are trying to make it a proactive industry. If things are affordable, transparent, and provide real benefit then we're confident it will attract users. We think the first step of this is giving people a real headway into the hidden costs of traditional insurance. If we can offer any coverage, or augment existing coverage, it's better than no coverage. We reviewed the prospect of launching something to compete with insurance, but that is a risky endeavor, at least initially. There are tons of social/legal/logistical issues to deal with offering government approved insurance.  Thanks for your questions!",False

It has nothing to do with the popular video game/film/fantasy universe. Although if that garners additional interest, great.  Quote from: erep on July 26, 2017, 07:23:26 PM First I thought this is a shitcoin started by Umbrella Corporation, if you know what I mean. Read the whitepaper and the idea is really moving. But isnt there a coin already serving this process.? What is the difference between Umbrella and InsureX.?  We think we differ from InsureX in a few ways. We don't necessarily see ourselves as competitors, even.  1. InsureX is providing a platform for buyers and sellers to conduct business for insurance. Our community is both buyer and seller. They make profits by charging a fee and data mining. 2. The insurers on their platform may still not sell coverage that is agreeable to the policyholder. It is also unclear if this qualifies as proof of insurance, or what countries this will launch in. 3. Most importantly, there still may be deductibles, co-insurance, co-pays on the network. InsureX is trying to simplify the traditional insurance process, which is important, but still carries some risk of traditional insurance.  Really, I could make a case for carrying both tokens. InsureX is for traditional larger claims that should be at a better rate, and UMC is for smaller claims.  The reason we're able to handle smaller claims when traditional insurance companies can't is simply process overhead. If you have a minor dent/scratch in your car that would cost $300USD to fix, there is practically no insurance company that would cover that because your deductible would never be that low. Why? Insurers need to file paperwork, do claims adjusting, handle customer service, talk to other parties etc. Filing a claim costs an insurance company more than just the money they pay out. If we incentivize the community with some rewards, we can cut out the big overhead and pay those small claims. If you're buying from a larger insurer on their platform, it is less likely they will cover those small claims.",False

I just wanted to give a quick update on what the dev team has been working on. Our team has grown quite a lot over the last week, and people have been ramping up on the existing code base and our proposed architecture. Some of the devs have been on vacation, so we’re hoping to have a “hackathon” this upcoming weekend to really make some headway into a prototype and at least have some basic workflows working.  On Friday, we met and discussed some of the outstanding questions regarding the community, fairness in voting, and the optimal way to launch. We ended up taking a lot of notes on a napkin :-) http://i.imgur.com/RiIbX0w.jpg  We agree that limiting the maximum/minimum payouts initially is a good idea until we reach equilibrium in the float pool. We also had very interesting discussions about how votes should be weighed, how to incentivize people to vote on claims, and minimum votes required to pay out. We are leaning against weighing votes — that could devolve into an oligarchy type situation. Those with the biggest policies, the most reputation, or otherwise the greatest vote weights could be in a position of tremendous power. We want to avoid introducing this unfairness and really let the community evolve organically. We are also leaning towards policyholders paying a small fee in UMC with that paid out to users voting on their claim. This fee will be used to pay people to vote on the claim. We like this idea for two reasons. A) It incentivizes people to vote on claims which have fewer votes — this means they get a bigger piece of the fee than a vote that has many votes. Avoiding a flat payout encourages participation distributed across claims. B) It will discourage people from submitting fraudulent claims — they would have to pay the fee and, if their fraud was discovered, they would lose their policy entirely. In the same vein of community growth and reaching a consensus, we want the community to have a forum for discussion for each claim. We want theme to share information and allow their expertise in certain areas to show. We also want to prevent users from submitting duplicate claims, or submitting duplicate evidence across accounts. We’re thinking of having a “similarity score” between two claims based on the parameters submitted when making a claim (amount, area, day of occurrence etc.) and the data they submit (receipt, video, photo) and giving that information to users.  The team is really excited to build this product and get something working and able to be used by the community quickly. We want to surface as much information as possible to let the community reach a consensus in a fair and reasonable manner, and build on this system going forward.  Thanks for your continued support!",False

The developers will not have any more of a say than any other member of the community. Votes will be weighted by how large of a policy the user holds - this will ensure payouts are assessed fairly as those with the most in float will be wary of fraud.

As premiums go up for Property/Casualty (P/C) and Life/Health (L/H) - policyholders are still required to pay hidden costs such as deductibles, co-insurance, and co-pays. In the United States, it is very prevalent to avoid exercising L/H insurance, like visiting a doctor, because of these hidden costs, while people actively avoid filing P/C claims to avoid rates going up. We think it's wrong that the entire industry is founded on not using the service they provide. UMC believes that blockchain technology built on a decentralized network can change this forever.   Traditional insurance companies take your premiums and invest it. This is called float. They build interest by investing it in various commodities and pay out claims from this pool. We're going to build a similar system on the blockchain. Users will create a benefits package by contributing to the UMC float pool. This entitles them to at least get their UMC back if they don't use the package but, in case they need to file for a payout, a vote will be held in the community of other policyholders. The policyholders will ultimately decide if the payout should be approved and what the amount should be. The latter amount will be capped while we initially try to reach equilibrium in our float pool. There will be a small incentive for voting. We are also going to take measures to ensure the float pool isn't drained such as imposing fees if the funds to create packages are withdrawn early.  Our token is going to be ERC20. Users will interface with our policy/claims system via a web client, which is under active development (http://staging.umbrellacoin.meteorapp.com/) and is being developed using Meteor. Meteor is a popular full-stack framework for javascript applications. It abstracts away many superfluous details during development, integrates with databses easily out of the box, and provides its own hosting environment for easier deployments. The essential business logic will be handled by the blockchain, while our meteor app and data store will be in charge of non-essential data. Our aim is to provide a user-friendly experience that seamlessly integrates with our blockchain backend.  We have plans to develop a mobile application after the web client is feature complete.   We initially see this as a way to augment existing insurance by providing benefits packages for certain life events. Ultimately this will be up to the community, but we are not targeting at replacing traditional insurance right now. This is due to the high cost of regulation in this industry. With respect to the immediate release schedule, please see our website for more information.   https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2027272.msg20195463#msg20195463   We are very excited to start this project and really look forward to working with the community to make this great!

Regarding the legalities, we are explicitly not aiming for this to be proof of insurance/regarded as accepted insurance for a few reasons:  i. We wouldn't be able to reliably offer this to coin holders in other countries. ii. The legal costs alone would be a nightmare. We wouldn't be able to fund that plus development.  We're taking the approach of the community purely funding the community through this pool. Insurance companies don't care how you pay deductibles or co-pays, as long as they don't have to pay them . Your concerns are well taken.  With respect to float, that is a topic we've had a lot of discussion about. First of all, there will be a waiting period before you can exercise your policy. So you can't just create a policy and attempt the drain the fund in a sort of coup with a bunch of your buddies. Second, the community votes on whether or not a claim is approved and their votes will be weighted by how big their policy is. The people with the most skin in the game should be the ones that are most cautious about paying out. Would you pay out when somebody submits a claim with no evidence saying they broke their leg? Dubious claims should be rejected, and there is no incentive for policy holders to pay out their own money to fraudulent claims. Third, in case the exchange rate changes between UMC and the fiat of the real world claim, we're planning on giving voters the ability to account for this by specifying the payout, up to a cap. Finally, in case people want to cancel their policy and take back the money they have invested, we're going to impose a fee if they do so prior to what we're calling a ""mature date."" Right now we're talking about the fee being between 10-20%, but we see this as a very effective way to maintain float levels.  Longer term, we want to make sure the market reaches an equilibrium with float throughput. That is a harder question to answer and which is why our roadmap has time allotted for algorithmic improvements.  Thanks for your questions",False
