Every street and address matches its real-world equivalent - but VR city is more than just a 3D map. It gives a big data of our daily activity of life which helps a city manager to take effective economic, social and environmental decision and plan. It also enables us to travel through the streets like a giant, observe architecture from up on high, zoom in to the ground or zoom out to the air, change lighting and weather, and take snapshots of the most unique city. You can‚Äôt imagine how this tech will change this world rapidly.  ‚ÄúWhat changes and benefit will have if a city is digitalized by VR/AR?‚Äù  Smart living: Smart Living enables consumers to enjoy the possibilities that life offers, through seamlessly and remotely managing their connected homes from anywhere, at any time, on any screen in real time. With the help of VR city app it is possible to connect and travel like teleportation from one place to another place seamlessly and remotely with everything in real time.  Mobility: VR city app will bring mobility to our lifestyle. With the digitalization of every sector with VR tech it will be possible to manage everything easily with a closer look such as buying foods, shopping and paying. It will save our time and will help to bring quick prosperity of a country.  Communication:  VR visualization techniques improve the level of communication between end-users (The public). For example: User can enjoy the lively atmosphere of presentation and can communicate with each other.  Business growth: Businesses will enjoy scaling and growth of profits. Besides, it will be much easier to search for partners, investors and customers. Marketing will be much easier than before. Services can be a great way to market your product. For example: to allow you to place furniture in your home. All the user has to do is download the app, browse products, and point their phone‚Äôs camera at the space they‚Äôd like to test out. Consumers are able to interact with products without ever setting foot in the store.  Visualization of data: With the help of VR city it is possible to visualize almost all data of our livings, economic and environmental etc. in real time. ‚ÄúAt present many countries are pushing virtual reality technology at a state level. Virtual reality is becoming cheaper and more accessible, and major companies such as Google and Facebook have ploughed billions of dollars into VR initiatives.‚Äù  Healthcare: It is possible to mobilize healthcare service. In a VR city app all people will be connected with the system where the system could know about the number of people‚Äôs health status of a specific area or whole city. So, this data source can be seen by doctors or government in a virtual visualized screen and they could take a quick and correct decision for healthcare services.  City master plan: VR city app can help to make a master plan for a city. By having a virtual visualization of area or places and data source, it‚Äôs become easy to make a city master plan to control everything easily.  Tourism sector: Tourism is the biggest in industry in the world & Virtual Reality has become the attraction point in Tourism Industry. VR city app allows for guided tours of any place around the world. Pegged to advance the tourist industry, people can now 'try before they buy' destinations.  Smart environment: The concept of smart environments evolves from the definition of ubiquitous computing that, according to Mark Weiser, promotes the ideas of ""a physical world that is richly and invisibly interwoven with sensors, actuators, displays, and computational elements, embedded seamlessly in the everyday objects of our lives, and connected through a continuous network. So, it is only possible with the VR city application.  Smart governance:  Just think about a world where every government form and the VR city application can be accessed, viewed and completed through a variety of  VR/AR devices ‚Äì smartphones, smart glasses, in-office displays and readers ‚Äì with a full range of accessibility aids (sound, language translations, visual and graphic instructions, etc.). Also think about a world where the very foundations for governance ‚Äì policy, legal, regulatory documents and frameworks ‚Äì are transformed into truly ‚Äúliving‚Äù documents that can interact with citizens and officials via VR city application.  Sustainability: Sustainable development is the key to have good economy and life standard. VR city app will bring sustainability in the economy and the life of people.  ‚†Ä The first version of Virtual City of Antalya is expected by May 1, 2019.‚Äù  #ShowMeBizexpo#ExpoCoin#VRBusiness",False

With the kick start of 10,000,000 security token sale in the first stage ICO period (January-November) 2018, we had started our journey to the wide development of our project with our Co-owners, Team members and other investors. ICO‚Äî Initial Coin Offering was a very useful tool to implement the project of the innovative G&V expo platform in all the countries in short terms. Also it helped us to buy and build resources of our project. We call our investors co-owners. ShowMeBiz/G&V Expo enables everyone to become a co-owner of the innovative VR/AR platform buy purchasing security token. Now, our co-owners receive monthly dividends where 40% of the profits of our innovative VR / AR platform are distributed among the owners monthly. But, only our earlier co-owners receive 80% of the profit monthly. So, now it is still possible to get 40% of the profit by buying our security token.   Success with the Progress of our products and implementation    Our Android and IOS application are ready to use. Also, other necessary VR/AR/AI related product resources have been collected for implementation of digitalization and commercial use. With the help of G&V EXPO it is possible to digitize almost anything ‚Äì exhibition, business, sport events, cultural objects, all types of entertainment and videogames. We provide targeted traffic from around the world and constant flow of new customers through the attraction and promotion of traffic to applications of digitized businesses. Our goal is to become a no1 platform for business.  ‚Ä¢   We are working on fashion online shop. Anyone could walk around the updated fashion online shop by putting on VR glasses. A jacket, you want to touch by your hand will be possible and If the eye lingers on the menu - the color changes.  Amazing feeling! Be sure to download the update of the Showmebiz Application, experience the full effect of presence!  ‚Ä¢   Ukrainian drag racing series 2018 was digitalized by team ShowMeBiz.

The plan is to digitize the entire city (city streets, real estate, attractions, tourism facilities and other areas). In addition to Antalya, the authorities of the cities of Dalaman, Alanya expressed their intention to cooperate in the digitization of the city Ankara (Turkey). Each city will have its own VR City mobile app. It is predicted that this will favorably affect the development of the economy, tourism, popularization and promotion of business on the international market. 2019 will be devoted to digitization of cities in collaboration with investors. The city authorities, for their part, provide large-scale media support and a wide advertising campaign. This will help to increase traffic; increase the number of downloads of the application and, accordingly, increases the monetization of the G & V project.

Women in the history of world exhibitions EXPO.  The role and participation of women in the history of world EXPOs evolved from the first World Exhibition in London in 1851 to the present day. The first Women's Pavilion, which not only demonstrated the work of women, but also managed them, was presented at the EXPO-Philadelphia in 1876. 75 women participating were able to present their inventions in the humanitarian and artistic fields, as well as in technology. At the World Exhibition in Chicago in 1893, the Council of Women Managers was created. The council was responsible for the organization and management of the Women's Pavilion, which was designed by a female architect, and its interior was decorated with women artists. After that, many World Exhibitions built their own Women's Pavilions. These include EXPO-Paris in 1900, EXPO-Paris in 1937, EXPO-Montreal in 1967 and EXPO-San Antonio in 1968.  In those days, Women's Pavilions gave women the opportunity to demonstrate their entrepreneurial skills and creative spirit. It took more than a century for women to go beyond the ""framework"" of the Women's Pavilion and manage the National Pavilions and even entire EXPOs, such as Birgit Breuil, who was the General Commissioner of the EXPO exhibition in Hanover (Germany) in 2000. As part of the World Exhibition in Milan (Italy), in 2015, an international public project We - Women for EXPO was created, bringing together outstanding women from around the world: Nobel Prize winners, politicians, cultural workers, science and sports, philanthropists and entrepreneurs. The project also organizes and conducts conferences and seminars during the EXPO. Work is already underway to prepare women's events at Dubai Expo 2020.  The role of women in the history of EXPO continues to grow. Nowadays, the rapid development of science and technology, the exhibition industry is beginning to actively use VR and AR technologies (virtual and augmented reality). It is very symbolic and significant that the founder of the world's first platform for virtual exhibitions based on BlockChain technologies using VR and AR-reality - GLOBAL & VIRTUAL EXPO - is also a woman - Ukrainian Olga Amraie üòò.  #Showmebiz #EXPO #virtualreality #vr #expocoin #expoblock",False

Quote ExpoBlock are accrued on the first day after the ICO completion to each participant possessing ExpoCoin at the ratio of 1:1. So, one can become the owner of ExpoBlock only by the acquisition of ExpoCoin during the ICO period. ExpoCoin purchased after the ICO on the stock exchange or in other ways do not come with an ExpoBlock attached. The ICO process runs in several phases. This is due to the fact that the GLOBAL & VIRTUAL EXPO Ltd. Company is obliged to search for tenant companies and lease ExpoBlock belonging to investors. The phased implementation of the project will provide investors with a high profitability ratio. The ICO stage takes place in August-September 2018. Plans include the sale of 30,000,000 ExpoBlock (10% of the total number within the platform). Here we also take into account the tokens that were sold in the period since the launch of the ICO (since January 2018). The purpose of this stage of the ICO is to attract investors and to distribute 10% of the assets among them, so that within three months after the launch of the GLOBAL & VIRTUAL EXPO platform, these blocks could be leased to tenants. Once the stage platform will be 80% full, the next phase of the ICO will be announced together with the launch of an additional 10% of the assets (30,000,000 ExpoCoin + 30,000,000 ExpoBlock). The phases will go on until all 300 000 000 ExpoBlock will be distributed between investors. In order to minimize the risks for the owners of the tokens, GLOBAL & VIRTUAL EXPO Ltd. undertakes to invest 20% of its profit on a quarterly basis in the buy-out of ExpoCoin tokens from the stock exchange. The platform will be monetized immediately after the launch of the GLOBAL & VIRTUAL EXPO platform.",False

For KYC verification the requirements are: 1. Passport / Id card 2. Driving license or Bank statement 3. Selfie with the passport/ Id card  The KYC procedure is necessary for solving such tasks:  Read more   Based on the above you need to fill out a KYC application form on our website  IMPORTANT! Only after the passage of KYC investor will be charged ExpoBlock.  In case of failure KYC: ExpoBlock which will bring monthly dividends will not be credited to your personal account but will go to the reserve fund of the company waiting for your passage. Once you have completed the KYC procedure the blocks from the reserve fund will be transferred to your personal account. ExpoCoin will remain in the private office and they can be sold on the stock exchange. Here it is Important: if you sell the part of ExpoCoin after passing KYC procedure, then after passing KYC you will be credited with blocks in the number of remaining in the personal office of ExpoCoin.  Important!  We plan to cooperate with banks and create an account for each investor, so that it is possible to deduce dividends on your bank card and cash it in any ATM. And, so that later we do not hurry our investors to pass verification, right now, we prepare in advance necessary for this the soil, namely KYC. The data is kept by us, not passed on to third parties.  At the time of cooperation with exchanges or banks, we can request this information.  Thus you are the original sources of assets and have a certificate confirming ExpoBlock in their offices. And after that blocks can be freely given to anyone from users the same small child (Investors of the project can only become 18+ years old.). Then the certificate of the block will be marked as a gift after which the minor children legally receive dividends. And in case of regulation of the legislation in the field of crypto-currency our investors will be fully prepared for this.The first stage of the ICO ends on September 25, 2018! Only after passing KYC you will be added blocks 1:1 (security token). These assets will bring you dividends.  Important!  For those who sent documents for verification and did not receive a confirmation it is necessary: - in 1-2 days again go to the site in the menu of the KYC; - read the error message; - add or correct the necessary information; - send again for verification.

This question is one way or another from investors, from bounty program participants, from interested and non-interested.  Ico, as a fund-raising process, has been in place for about five years. And to this day, the crowdfunding is a pre-trial process. When buying tokens startup, you are not provided with a package of protective mechanisms that define not only the moment of marriage , but also the dissolution of marriage "". any obligations prescribed in the whitepaper published on the web sites and so further do not have legal forms of control.  To be completely direct - participating in ico, you do actions in the informal sector of the economy. What to say if states that determine the status of cryptocurrencies can be counted on the fingers of one hand. The rest of the world is a legal vacuum. This means that ico is not a legal or illegal means of attracting funds.  We are in a situation where the state and the right, as a mechanism, with its anti-terrorist systems have not been able to keep up with technology. And most likely, these cases will only be multiplying exponentially.  Therefore, the concept of safeguards, as such, is not possible in ico. This unpleasant part of the news ends, and it starts pleasant.  At the heart of the of relationship between ico project and investors lies trust. Which, in turn, is based on the reputation of persons declared as a project team. Especially the founder.  If you analyze the successful and failed ico, you can get some statistical information that comes down to one - tell me who you are, and I'll be your investor.  In this regard, the global virtual expo has all the necessary advantages and indicators of good faith, that is, high investment attractiveness:  - we have prepared and comply with all necessary agreements and rules that are published on the site in the form of a public offer; - watching the development of the project, you see how a product is born - every day, every week there are updates and an opportunity to see how it will be then in reality. In our case, virtual reality; - we have voluminous and detailed wp; - we are completing the registration process in the US Securities Commission (SEC), that is, getting maximum legalization, which is in principle possible in the market; - managing company is a legal person; - Reputational weight of the project team and its founder strive for maximum!
