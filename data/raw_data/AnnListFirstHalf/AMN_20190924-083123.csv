Here is what i stated as FACTS about any Crypto Card Projects promising a working card:  To get the license of a crypto card (partner), you'll need at least 9 months to get your application reviewed (accepted or refused).  What does this mean for me an an Amon investor?  This means that if Amon ICO finished in May 2018, or a lil bit before, add AT LEAST 9 months to that date to start talking about a "" working product "" lol. This is supposedly they already made their application ready, or simply a partnership going on with that crypto card provider or whoever it is, but seeing how things going on, i suppose they started nothing or any kind of partnership, they simply LIED about it to investors.  This will give investors a window of more couple more months to come, approximately January 2019 or even after that (probably next May 2019 if lucky), this is of course taking into consideration that they weren't lying about that partnership with a card provider, but i personally don't believe their shit talk anymore.  Now let's get the Amon shameless lies:  1 - Amon admins LIED to us by telling the investors that the cards will be shipped by May 2018, this lie during the ICO,of course now i know why, just to make sure they gather more money.  2 - They come up with that bullshit "" AMON millionaire "" in the latest days of the ICO just to make sure to gather as much money as they can, although almost the whole community was against that.  3 - They can't reply about that address holding 40 millions AMN lol, 40 Millions !!! imagine that, he's been dumping since ages for such fucked up price (it says a lot about how not transparent they are).  4 - They keep posting blog updates which has nothing to do with the project or the Amon token lol, nothing that interest me as an investor.  Now let's talk about this dirt cheap price, let's suppose they'll deliver (which is impossible from a personal point of view), the AMN buyers who bought at such low price will be making x50 or even x100 gain just by getting to the ICO price, this means, that even if we have a working product, you'll be waiting like 2 years to get rid of these "" Whales "" lol, especially that 40 Millions AMN holder.

To comply with regulations, Amon will ask contributors to complete KYC. Our KYC partner is Identity Mind Global.  If you have the ID docs ready and want to do KYC first, then do it before private/public ICO has begun. Once the ICO has begun, be sure to contribute first and KYC afterwards.  We do understand the concern that a significant number of people might require some days to gather their KYC docs and they might run the risk of getting left out as the ICO fills up quickly. Therefore, to avoid logistical and timing issues, you can complete your KYC after you have contributed so that there is no chance of missing out.  1. What is KYC? KYC is Know Your Customer. These are standard procedures requiring basic ID information from ICO contributors for compliance and Anti-Money-Laundering (AML).  2. What are the steps for completing KYC before ICO and the steps if ICO has begun and we haven’t done KYC yet:  Steps to follow for KYC before ICO:  Sign-up for Amon Token Sale (Sign-up functionality goes live on 27th February) Login to your Token Sale Dashboard Go to the KYC Tab on your Dashboard Follow on-screen instructions to complete KYC Sign back in on 1st March to your Token Sale Dashboard Purchase AMN tokens during the Private ICO on 1st March. If you miss the private ICO, contribute in the Public ICO from March 4th to April 4th Steps to follow for KYC if ICO has begun (contribute first, do KYC after):  Sign-up for Amon Token Sale Login to your Token Sale Dashboard Purchase AMN tokens FIRST (before KYC) You get until 7th of April to submit your KYC documents. However, we advise to do it within 2 days of contributing and not wait until the deadline so that you have ample time to re-apply for KYC if your first attempt is unsuccessful.  3. What happens if my KYC fails?  No worries! We will notify you and give you a chance to re-apply. In case you don’t pass the KYC multiple times, please contact us or we will refund your contribution in full at the end of the ICO.  If for any reason, you do not want to run the KYC or you do not agree on the result of the KYC we advise you to contact us at hello@amon.tech.  4. Which countries cannot contribute?  Citizens and residents from US and China cannot contribute due to regulations of the countries.  5. Can Americans accredited investors contribute?  Americans can only participate as an accredited investor. You can get proof for this via www.verifyinvestor.com, your accountant, lawyer, bank, or anyone else that is legally allowed to provide verification. No exceptions will be made for non-accredited Americans.  6. Can I submit my documents for KYC before contributing?  Yes! If you want to do KYC first then do it before the Private and public ICOs have begun. You can start KYC on 27th February. Private ICO starts on March 1st, and Public ICO starts on March 4th. However, once the private ICO has begun we recommend contributing first and then completing KYC afterwards, so that you don’t miss out in case ICO hard cap is reached quickly.  Priority will be given to contributors who have already contributed. Contributing first and then completing KYC will also give you time to re-apply in case the first attempt at KYC is unsuccessful.  7. What documents do you accept?  We accept Passport (preferred), Driving licence, Identity Card and any other complementary documents such as utility bill, certificate of residency.  8. My passport only has one side, what to do?  Our KYC process requires that you upload both sides (front and back) of your passport. If your passport is one-sided, simply upload the front part of your ID twice.  9. How long does it take to verify my KYC?  It generally takes few hours depending on the volume of KYC that we processing but might take longer, therefore do not wait KYC approval to contribute.  10. When do you stop accepting contribution?  We will accept contribution until the Hard Cap is reached. If the Hard cap is reached during the 24 hours Private ICO on March 1st, we will not run any Public ICO.  11. I would like to change some info in my KYC. How do I do that?  Please specify what information in your KYC was incorrect, and send it along with your KYC email to hello@amon.tech.  12. I completed my KYC but never received a confirmation email. Has my KYC been fully verified?  Your KYC is only verified if you received a confirmation email. Please be patient, we will send this to you as soon as the process is complete.",False

Our ICO begins soon. You are about to become part of a revolutionary Crypto Debit Card. We welcome our 25,000+ whitelist investors to the private ICO on March 1st and others to the public ICO on March 4th.  Here’s everything you need to know about the upcoming event:  Timeline  Private ICO: Private ICO will run for 24 hours only March 1st, 9am UTC to March 2nd, 9am UTC. It is open only to Whitelist participants (Whitelist on amon.tech closes on 28th February 12 am UTC).  How to participate in Private ICO: Sign up for the Token Sale, contribute and complete the KYC. While signing-up use the same email you used for whitelist. Also make sure you’ve agreed to our T&Cs.  Public ICO: Public ICO will run from March 4th to April 4th.  How to participate in Public ICO: Sign up, contribute and complete the KYC. Also ensure you’ve agreed to our T&Cs.  How much you can contribute: First 2000 contributors will not have any restrictions. After the first 2,000 contributors, there will be an individual cap of 5 ETH to give a fair chance to all our 25,000 whitelist contributors to be able to invest in the private ICO and to get 25% bonus tokens plus FREE Amon Card. However, Public ICO will be open to all.  Hard Cap: The hard cap is $25 million USD. The conversion to Ethereum will take place just before the token sale and account for potential volatility.  Token Release Date: Tokens will be displayed immediately after sending ETH or BTC in the Token Purchasing Area. At the end of the ICO AMN Tokens will be sent directly in your Amon Wallet.  Exchanges: We are in discussions with HitBTC, Binance, Tidex and few other exchanges. We will be in a position to make listing announcements once the ICO is underway.  Token Details  Price: 1 AMN = 0.05 USD. Conversion from ETH or BTC to AMN token will be calculated by our aggregator that checks the prices of different exchanges and takes the best rate.  Accepted currencies: We accept ETH and BTC.  Number of Tokens: A maximum of 500,000,000 AMN tokens can be generated in the Token Sale event.  Eligibility and KYC  KYC: KYC will be open until April 7th 12 am UTC time, however we do advise you to complete it within two days of contributing. We do understand the concern that a significant number of people might require some days to gather their KYC docs and they might run the risk of getting left out as the ICO fills up quickly. To avoid logistical and timing issues, you can complete your KYC after you have contributed so that there is no chance of missing out. Our KYC partners are Identity Mind Global.  Eligibility: US and Chinese investors cannot contribute in the ICO. We are able to accept contributions from accredited investors from US. You can get proof for this via www.verifyinvestor.com, your accountant, lawyer, bank, or anyone else that is legally allowed to provide verification. No exceptions will be made for non-accredited Americans.  Nationality Restrictions: We reserve the right to not accept any contributions from citizens of countries where ICOs are banned and that do not comply with AML regulations.  Utility of AMN Token Holders of AMN tokens get exclusive benefits like  Amon Card Discounted Fees: Holders of AMN tokens will get special fee structure. Details of the discounts and low fees will be released after the ICO and will vary depending on the type of Card and numbers of AMN tokens held.  Priority Customer Service Line: Customer service in crypto industry is not up to the standards of other industries. For this reason, we will provide different levels of customer service with 24/7 priority line to AMN token holders.  MasterNode Benefits: Although AMN tokens won’t be running any masternodes, but the top holders of AMN tokens will be passed on masternode benefits that Amon accrues from cryptocurrencies that do payout masternode benefits. For details about how it works check out our Token Sale FAQs.  Cashback of AMN Tokens: For every transaction made with the Amon Card you will get a percentage of AMN tokens as Cashback. We have set the Cashback at 0.5% for Gold and Platinum Card.

Amon wants to simplify Crypto spending in everyday life. First by providing our users with a Debit card that is accepted everywhere be it retail or online and secondly by powering the card with Artificial Intelligence that ensures they get the maximum value out of cryptocurrencies.  How does Amon navigate troubled waters in the wake of the recent Visa crackdown on Wavecrest and the effect this had on Crypto Cards? The Wavecrest problem has not impacted us as we do not work with Wavecrest card. However, we do wish that users of who’ve been hit badly are provided with an alternative card by our competitors. We believe that the Wavecrest issue has impacted negatively on users’ trust and this affects us as well. We want successful competitors and a healthy market. For this reason Amon Team has been working hard to create partnerships that allow us to ship cards to our investors at the beginning of the ICO AND working with a network that has no such problems.  How does Amon differentiate itself from other players in the Crypto Card niche? Our card will be backed by an Artificial Intelligence system that helps people decide which crypto to spend. Amon users won’t have to check every time the current conversion rate and the past performance of the coin: the AI system will tell them the best performing currency and support them in their spending decision. This is something unique in the current competitive landscape.  What questions to do you encounter from prospective investors? Our Telegram community of 5K people (and growing) is very active, and we try to answer all their questions every day. Often, we receive very good questions that help us clarify aspects and give more details about the project.  The most frequently asked questions are often related to the Token Sale, the product and the AI. Although our White paper is all-encompassing and self-explanatory, thanks to our community we keep posting additional details on our blog to make sure we keep our community up to date about product features, development, and roll-outs.  What factors do you see behind the growth of crypto card specific coins? The growth of crypto-card coins will be strictly connected to the success of the companies but also to the growth of the currencies these cards will support. For this reason, it is important for us to support also alt-coins with strong projects and potential. The niche, in general, has done exceedingly well on exchanges as more and more people discover the utility of crypto debit card and as these cards penetrate into everyday life. It is now literally as easy as swiping a card at a point-of-sale. You spend your crypto, the business gets their money in Fiat, your card takes care of everything in between.  What happens to crypto after the hype dies down and Where does Amon fit in in the larger scheme of things? I believe that after the hype and the subsequent decrease in the prices of some Alt coins, crypto in general will consolidate and become stable. In any phase Amon Card will be there to allow Crypto-spending in everyday situation. So Amon is immune to any major fluctuations because of the card’s unquestionable utility in making people’s lives easier.  How important is it for a blockchain project to do well on the exchanges? I think it is important that the project does well and it is successful. The performance on the exchanges must be subject to that. No project should pursue the success on the exchanges as an objective, on the contrary, the focus has to be always on pushing for stronger and better products. This will help the acceptance of blockchain technology as a whole and the scalability of blockchain projects.  What is Amon’s Value Proposition? How do you see Amon in the future? Amon wants to simplify the spending of crypto in everyday life. In the future we want to work together with the community towards the acceptance of cryptocurrency in the traditional economy. We believe our project will become a bridge between blockchain and traditional economy. And supply the absolutely critical use-cases that the crypto ecosystem needs to be sustainable in the long term.  Remember to sign up to the whitelist.

It was less than a year ago that Bitcoin was trading below $1000, very far from its current price of $17,000. It’s current price too, in turn, is 15% below the all-time high of close to $20,000, reached only a few weeks ago. It is very frequent for cryptocurrencies to have one-day movements of even 25–30%, as trading news can change investor sentiment almost instantly.  This volatility has been one of the main obstacles to the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies in the consumer economy. Most cryptocurrency users are involved in trading them day in day out, rather than spending them to buy goods and services. The simple fact is that retailers have been slow to allow cryptocurrency payments on a large scale. That is because the pricing of their products would have to be changed constantly to adapt to the rapid changes in the value of cryptocurrencies. This would be a proposition that would be both costly and difficult to implement, especially for small-scale operators. On the other hand, retailers would risk missing out on profits if their post-sale cryptocurrency revenues are less than the official sale price of their product.  Despite the proliferation of crypto debit cards, of which there are more than 30 in existence, their inherent shortcomings prevent them from being of any help. Among their weaknesses are the unavailability of AltCoins and the over-reliance on Bitcoin, delayed conversions of crypto to fiat currencies, and the lack of a conversion system that maximizes the consumer’s spending power.  What could help retailers accept cryptocurrencies, hassle-free?  The Amon Card aims to be the solution by becoming the game-changer for retailers worldwide. Thanks to its real-time conversion from cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies, exactly when a purchase is made, there is no uncertainty on how much money the retailer receives. Furthermore, while most crypto cards only allow conversions from Bitcoin, the Amon Card also allows them from Ethereum and Litecoin, (additional cryptocurrencies will be added with upcoming releases).  The Amon Artificial Intelligence System (AAIS) in addition helps retailers optimise their customers’ spending potential. Through its scientifically-researched and extensively tested algorithms, the AAIS suggests which cryptocurrency from the customer’s portfolio should be used to make a purchase. This helps the customer manage the changes in the value of his or her holdings effectively, making purchasing decisions faster and simpler. For retailers, the Amon Card simply represents the key to unleashing hundreds of billions of dollars of cryptocurrency spending.  The Amon Card is nearing its launch after the successful pilot test of November 2017. We are currently preparing for the Amon ICO, scheduled for Q1 2018. To be part of Amon’s retail revolution, sign up to the whitelist at www.Amon.Tech.

Here’s a Q&A with our security partner Digital.security of Econocom Group.  We want our investors to take a closer look at how we keep their funds secure, our operations stable and all information well protected. This Q&A will give you a good insight into how we are making it absolutely water-tight.  1. Tell us a little bit about Digital Security company.  Digital Security (https://www.digital.security/en/) was founded in 2015 by a group of experts in computer security with the support of Econocom Group (https://www.econocom.com/en).  As the name suggests, our corporation helps companies to permanently improve the way they protect their information and support them in securing their digital transformation and the opportunities offered by the IoT.  Therefore, at Digital Security, we capitalize on the talents we recruit. We are surrounded by a passionate, curious and highly skilled team, which is able to understand and to adapt itself to the emerging threats. The value of Digital Security is our ability to let our employees blossom and allow them to satisfy their curiosity in order to: better understand and grasp threats, permanently find new solutions and working methods for companies, and serve at best their cybersecurity needs.  2. And now the key question for our investors. How will you make Amon secure for investors (ICO phase) and consumers (operations phase)?  We were selected by Amon to independently assess their security at different levels :  - Consulting, design and security review of Amon’s ICO concept tokenisation;  - Ethereum smart contract security audit (best practices, source code, security checklists …);  - wallet security (design, authentication, storage …).  Every step of our missions was concluded with a dedicated report that includes technical recommendations, correction plans and an executive summary.  3. Data security is very important, especially for a Fintech company. How is Amon’s customer data secured?  Most companies won’t disclose details about security measures they implement. Our mission is to make sure Amon’s customer data security policy is in accordance with security state-of-the-art and best practices.  More about this may be disclosed directly under NDA by Amon’s team.  4. With evolving technologies and the Cyber Threats that come with it, how do you keep up with the changes?  Digital Security has a dedicated team called a CERT (https://www.digital.security/en/cert-ubik). Its main tasks are:  - To ensure the availability of an emergency team response 24/7;  - to stay current on the last threats in order to be well prepared;  - to rapidly detect new threats;  - to assess smart devices in its own test laboratory;  - to communicate with other worldwide CERTs.  A CERT is an operational entity in charge of threat intelligence and incident response on information systems and new technologies.  CERT brings together experts from different fields: telecom, IT and electronics, spectrum analyzers, RF receivers and reverse engineering platforms are namely required for assessing the security of connected objects and for implementing an incident response process within the Information Systems.  5. Recently the poor security of some exchanges and wallets has caused a lot of damage to the entire community. What is your point of view?  Indeed, there has been a lot of security incidents in the last few years in the blockchain industry. Developers and system administrators are now quite aware of the fact that security is important, but they are often unable to implement “security by design” because of preconceived ideas. Systems and applications still lack some major input validations and “defense in depth” measures and with the amount of money that is handled, attackers are encouraged to find vulnerabilities, that’s why dedicated security experts should take part in these projects.  6. As Security partners of Amon, what role does Digital Security play in ensuring stable/secure operations?  The golden rule to implement stable and secure operations is to make sure you have defined a strong security policy, set up key periodic controls, permanent controls, which will help you stay aware of your operational risks.  Digital Security’s role was first to make sure security basics were already implemented, to check that the full ICO process and following phases were compliant with state-of-the-art security measures, and finally to give permanent security controls recommendations. One of these will be an important bug bounty security campaign, which will come up soon.  7. Are ICOs in general taking care of cybersecurity in the current atmosphere?  A lot of ICOs are ephemeral and disposable and are just created to raise money without having a real, concrete and achievable project in mind. Those ICOs are not really interested in security and several of them have already been hacked in the past.  On the contrary, real projects backed by serious founders and investors take appropriate measures to secure their business by hiring dedicated security experts to audit their backend, smart contract and social media accounts, to ensure their successful operation.  8. What are the possible security loopholes that Fintech companies must guard against?  Fintech companies have to deal with increasingly frequent phishing attempts (fake emails, fake websites, fake social media accounts) that try to confuse small and medium investors. A new threat is the smart contract hacking: Ethereum is a pretty robust platform for smart contracts and ICOs. However, writing secure smart contracts is a new and difficult challenge for developers and there is still a long way to go develop new tools and techniques to protect smart contracts.  In the meantime, a lot of classic vulnerabilities are still exploited, like web, system and database attacks.  9. How vulnerable are companies and consumers in the blockchain space to cybersecurity threats?  Blockchain companies are very prone to hacking attacks because of their exploitation area. This latter is very wide: it goes from system to web application, to smart contract, and usually handle large amounts of money. Moreover, blockchain smart contract code and data are nearly completely public, which ease attacks.  Along with the IoT sector, Blockchain companies are the biggest security challenges and still will be in the next few years.  Amon private ICO begins soon.

Paying for goods and services with debit cards in stores and online is the norm by now, while cash is on its way out. Estimates are that the total number of non-cash payments in the EU increased by 8.5% to 122 billion in 2016. Similar trends are taking place in America and Asia.  At the same time, cryptocurrencies are quickly becoming an integral part of the world economy. The market cap of all cryptocurrencies recently broke the $750 BLN barriers, up from less than $100 BLN only a year ago. Bitcoin itself, the “emperor” of the crypto world, has a market value of more than $300 BLN and has increased in value 20-fold in the last 12 months alone. More and more retailers globally are accepting payments in cryptocurrencies, and the number of crypto debit cards is rising.  The Amon Card aims to be the most innovative, technologically advanced and user-friendly crypto debit card on the market. To understand why the Amon Card is unique, here are 5 everyday situations where its special features can benefit you:  1) You are invested in cryptocurrencies but keep most of your portfolio in Bitcoin. You do not check the crypto market every day, but regularly follow the value of Bitcoin. You can choose to pay with the Amon card with Bitcoin as a default payment option, simplifying your buying decisions.  2) You own a selection of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether and Amon tokens. You follow closely the crypto market. You choose what cryptocurrency to use with your Amon Card each time you buy something, based on your own personal parameters.  3) You select to use the Amon Artificial Intelligence System (AAIS), which calculates the best performing cryptocurrency in your wallet at the time of payment. This helps optimize your spending decisions and save you money on purchases, each time.  4) You have different cryptocurrencies in your Amon Card portfolio and you want to make money on your balance. Unlike any other crypto card, Amon allows you to earn interest on selected cryptocurrencies that operate masternode systems. Your interest is paid out regularly, offering you a source of continuous passive income.  5) You are interested in adding more and more cryptocurrencies to your portfolio, both for investment and to use them for purchases with your Amon Card. Amon will be adding more cryptocurrencies to the portfolio with upcoming releases, allowing you to manage your purchases with full flexibility.    The Amon Card is about to revolutionize the crypto economy - for good.  Our demo of November 2017 was successfully completed, setting the basis for our ICO in Q1 2018.

As Ethereum's price has become all too volatile, Amon's contributors have reached out to us for clarity and asked for a USD denominated token price.  Therefore; for the benefit of our community and to bring more clarity in pricing, we shall now be displaying AMN price in US$ terms.  This doesn't change anything in terms of token issuance numbers at all.  1AMN = 0.05 USD (5 cents) 1 USD = 20 AMNs 1,000 USD = 20,000 AMNs  The soft cap is at $3M and the hard cap at $25M. The Amon ICO supply is hard capped at 500M AMNs. The soft cap is 60M AMN tokens.  For any question reach out on our Telegram Channel https://t.me/amontech, we will be happy to answer you live.",False
