Join this incredible DLT now!!,"   Sure below is a high-level description then go to www.DisLedger.com for more information about the token sale.  As a summary, DisLedger is a low level architecture that creates shared Counterparty Ledgers (CLs) between organizations. The CLs use standard cryptographic hashing and signatures, but only the counterparties validate the transactions. We record the 'concurrence' of the actual parties instead of having the crowd provide 'consensus'. This means the data is kept completely private and the processing is orders of magnitude faster than blockchain-based DLTs.  Each organization aggregates all of their CLs into a single Prime Ledger that shows the real-time balances of all its assets.  We distribute the data in a mesh of Counterparty Ledgers as opposed to a massively redundant blockchain with everyone's data commingled in one dataset.

DisLedger competes against current installed centralized databases and their switching cost; Blockchain projects in the finance space like Hyperledger, R3, Digital Assets; and DAGs like Iota in the IOT market.  Blockchains are great when you have data that you want to ensure is accurate, AND you are willing to share that data with the entire network, AND you can don't have to process a lot of data quickly. But that's not the type of problem we're trying to solve. We want to handle massive amounts of payments each second and keep the buyers' information private.  Our competive advantage is that we are far faster than blockchain ever will be; are totally private so ensure sensitive information is never released to competitors; and maintain data privacy in line with regulations like GDPR, CSL in China.  So for use cases that need both speed and privacy (payments & capital markets) we excel. We don't try to solve all problems... there are no silver bullets... but the spaces we work in are very large and lucrative.",False

I just noted that, by holding tokens in a reserve for later re-selling them directly to customers, people that bought tokens during the ICO will have no guarantees on their future value. After the ICO, you will be able to sell your reserve at a judgmental price. If (for example) you may need some liquidity for business operations (or any other possible reason), you may want to incentive to buy part of your reserve at a lower price than the ICO or the market price, this will indirectly depreciate the tokens that have been bought during the ICO. This is just an example, my concern is regarding the risks related with the reserve. Normally other ICO projects ""burn"" unsold tokens to protect investors from this risk and avoid ""pre-mine"" accusations.

Join this incredible DLT now!!,"What it is:  DisLedger® is a non-blockchain, distributed ledger technology designed for high-volume transaction processing such as payments and capital markets clearing. DisLedger’s patent pending technology provides a solution for permissioned networks that handle high volumes of transactions, require low-latency, and must maintain data privacy. DisLedger doesn’t compete with permissionless, completely transparent networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum but offers the DLT solution for enterprises like Mastercard, Intel, and SAP who require speed and privacy.  What it does:  DisLedger creates a private ledger between the counterparties to a trade. DisLedger doesn’t mix every company’s transactions into one common chain, but keeps each counterparty’s transaction in its own distributed ledger called a Counterparty Ledger. This way DisLedger provides the cryptographic benefits of blockchain but also maintains complete privacy of all transactions; allows for net or gross settlement; processes hundreds of thousands of transactions per second; and does not suffer from latency issues. The architecture provides the immutable, Golden Record of transactions, reduces clearing time to free up collateral, and supports large-scale, low-value payments such as Internet Of Things (IOT) micropayments. DisLedger provides definitive final settlement for capital markets; processes hundreds of thousands of transactions per second; and supports the regulatory required central clearing parties in the financial market infrastructure.  DisLedger is scalable for definitive, final settlement of hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. Whereas latency, lag and a lack of finality are noted deficiencies in blockchain, DisLedger can keep pace with the fastest markets. Cyber security is greatly enhanced by DisLedger because the network is closed and isolated from the internet; transaction data is only shared between counterparties, no third-parties are involved; and the simple governance model makes it easy to upgrade to new encryption standards including future quantum-computer resistant encryption. The transactions are shared with the counterparty directly and are completely private, so competitors will never see the trades. Leakage of business intelligence, the negative consequence of full transparency, is a significant issue in blockchain but is avoided in DisLedger. Business continuity is assured as transactions are processed only by the parties to the trade, so third-party competitors can’t block or delay trades in the system. The inherently private design of the Counterparty Ledgers supports compliance with data privacy regulations.  Token Launch:  DisLedger is offering licenses for its Intellectual Property to users that want to prototype and build their own production DisLedger systems. Instead of requiring users to purchase an enterprise license the technology is available to license on a per-transaction basis. This way organizations do not require a large capital commitment to build and deploy their DisLedger system and will pay only for their actual usage over time. DisLedger provides a fast, private, cost effective solution for high volume transaction processing.  The per-transaction, IP licenses will be issued as ERC20 tokens named ‘DCL’ that can be purchased via the Ethereum network. This is a new use of the ERC20 standard as DisLedger is not offering what most organizations have so far: a coin, ownership in a company, voting rights to a foundation, or security interest. In this case what is being tokenized is a license to use the existing DisLedger technology based on a license agreement that is incorporated within the ERC20 token.  Per-transaction technology licensing is a common practice, and tokenization is used in numerous other types of systems. This approach creates a hybrid system where users process their transactions using DisLedger’s high-speed and private technology, and their licenses to use the technology are processed on the Ethereum network. This pragmatic approach capitalizes on the strengths of the public, global Ethereum system as well as the private DisLedger system. The users benefit as they’ll be able to acquire the rights to use DisLedger’s IP easily and with little up-front cost. DisLedger benefits as it simplifies the management of the licenses; eliminates an enterprise license cost which is a barrier to adoption; and broadens the user community to maximize the network effect. Users will register with DisLedger, be verified, then be given instructions how to purchase DisLedger IP tokens during the soft launch/pre-sale and launch. On a monthly basis users will count the number of transactions they processed and submit that number of DCL tokens to DisLedger on Ethereum.  More information on the DisLedger technology including a technical whitepaper, slides, and a demonstration of the DisLedger DLT in action is available at DisLedger.  Telegram: DisLedger_Launch Twitter: @DisLedgerInfo Email  A soft launch/presale will be held prior to the launch date, contact us for details.  The DisLedger architecture is a very different approach to distributing the data than a traditional blockchain with consensus. Please reach out if you have any questions after reading the technical whitepaper. In the future we'll hold tutorials, webinars, or AMAs to continue the dialog and support the developer community.
