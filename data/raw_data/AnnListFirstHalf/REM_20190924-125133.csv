It provides out-the-box mechanisms so developers don’t need to write the entire blockchain software from scratch.  The Hyperledger Sawtooth framework is being developed by Intel under the hood of the Hyperledger foundation. It is a blockchain framework highly focused on agility. Basically, the framework itself provides basic things like communication between nodes in a network, storing data onto the blockchain and the architecture for plugging smart contracts and consensus algorithms. Everything besides that can be easily swapped in and out.  Let’s dive deeper into the architecture of the framework. Here are some important statements to keep in mind:  1. Any data needing to be persisted is stored in the on-chain key-value storage distributed among the network of validators.  2. This storage allows any binary data to be stored in it.  3. Data is modified with transactions.  4. Every transaction has an associated transaction family and is processed by a corresponding handler.  5. A transaction family handler take the transaction payload, parses it and performs the required business logic and writes out corresponding changes to the storage.  6. Data in storage is addressed with 35 byte addresses, where the first 3 bytes are the prefix, which is by convention unique for every transaction family, and the rest of an address is any data specified by the transaction family (it may be a hash of any data, some number etc).",False

A password may be too easy to guess; people leave their browsers open on public computers, write passwords down on paper or in a file on their computers, or simply get tricked into giving away their login data. The REMME technology makes passwords obsolete, thus eliminating the human factor from the authentication process. And just recently we have seen many exchanges and their data with password hacked and even MEW have been hacked and most people's funds been transferred to another account in this case REMME is very useful and for more detail you can see this short video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9APHeHRmrGw .

EthCC was a great success, and the excitement within the conference hall was palpable. Over 650 attendees and 130 speakers from all over the world converged to discuss four major topics: Scalability, Anonymity, Development Tools, and Governance.  This latter topic was tackled by Bob Summerwill on Thursday in his address, in which the Ethereum community manager urged an end to “tribalism” in favor of a renewed spirit of cooperation. Ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir also weighed in, speaking of the “coordinance problem” that governance needs to resolve.  https://medium.com/remme/insights-from-ethcc-2018-in-paris-with-the-remme-team-463853c811b6",False

We now have over 5,000 active and highly engaged Telegram members and more than 15,000 subscribed to our token sale mailing list. These numbers have taken us by surprise, and caused us to give thought to the fairest means of conducting our crowdsale, which is launching in February. After careful consideration, we’ve decided to open a whitelist. That way everyone will have a chance to register, and it will make our token generation event easy to administer.  There will be two whitelists for the REMME token sale: Telegram Community Whitelist  We love our community and are extremely appreciative of their support. That’s why we want to give our Telegram members the opportunity to be the first to join us.  To participate in Telegram community whitelist you need to:  Join our Telegram group     Pre-register via bot.      Pre-registration starts: January 27 at 12:00 UTC.     Pre-registration ends: January 29 at 12:00 UTC.  The bot will check that you’re a current member of our Telegram community and you will be asked to submit your email address. You can then proceed to registration on our website when it starts (on January 29, at 18:00 UTC)  More details will be announced in our group and Telegram news channel.  3. Complete your registration on website.      Starts on: January 29 at 18:00 UTC     Ends on: January 30 at 18:00 UTC  The first step here will be to validate your reserved place and then add some basic information such as your name and purchase amount. Nothing too crazy: just follow the clear instructions that will be provided during the registration process.  ‼️ Please note that you should complete the entire registration process, first securing your place via bot and then filling in additional information on our website.  You won’t be able to apply for the Telegram Community whitelist after January 29, at 12:01 UTC (when pre-registration is closed), but you will still have a chance to join the Public Whitelist. Public Whitelist  The Public Whitelist starts on January 30 at 18:01 UTC (London time) and will last till February 11 at 20:00 (UTC). During this time everyone is welcome to join by creating an account on our website and filling in the necessary information. Contribution period  The REMME token sale opens on February 13, 2018 at 20:00 UTC and will be structured as follows:      Day 1 (24 hours): The token sale will be open to Telegram community members only. Every participant will receive a 10% bonus.     Day 2 (24 hours): Members of the Public Whitelist can join the token sale and will receive a 10% bonus.     Day 3 (24 hours): Everyone can participate in the token sale and receive a 10% bonus, with no need to be whitelisted.  We may also decide to apply a maximum personal cap on days one and two, but this will be based on the volume of whitelist applications. Join our Telegram group and stay tuned for further updates. We look forward to welcoming you to the REMME token sale.",False

When a user needs to log in to their service, however, they open themselves up to a lot of attack vectors that hackers and other parties can use to their advantage. A hacker can install a keylogger, for example, on the potential victim’s system and look for the keystrokes that denominate the password – moreover, passwords themselves are often easily cracked with dictionary attacks, massive password leaks, or user error/idiosynchrasies. An example of the latter is the password “password1”, which remains one of the most used passwords worldwide – users in many cases have little to no defense in securing their account from would-be intruders.

Even though we have come a long way from traditional security to the username/password architecture, there is still considerable room for human error.  According to a recent study published by researchers at Google and Berkley: “Over the course of March, 2016–March, 2017, we identify 788,000 potential victims of off-theshelf keyloggers; 12.4 million potential victims of phishing kits; and 1.9 billion usernames and passwords exposed via data breaches and traded on blackmarket forums.”  Not only are these statistics alarming, they also show that the existing systems are not very effective. Secure passwords are hard, if not impossible to remember, and memorable passwords often include patterns of numbers and words which can be used by persistent attackers to gain access.

The sale lasted a bit more than 24 hours, as the first day had maximum cap per registered user of 15 ETH. So basically after 20:00 (GMT) biggest part of token sale was done during first minutes. Then the next day (when the maximum cap per person was listed) the remaining amount of tokens were bought in 1 minute or so. That's very good, I hope soon they will develop great product, so let's keep this thread observing it! Personally I'm interested to see their password system integrated into crypto-exchanges. It seems for me that Binance and Kucoin are on the list, because for day 3+ of token sale it was written that BNB and KCS would be accepted too. Why would it be if not some agreement or idea of cooperation with both exchanges. But that's only my thoughts) I think somebody from REMME team can either confirm or deny this.  Regarding Telegram, I just checked and both groups work (English and Russian/Ukrainian) REMME team didn't lock them after sale start and there were so many scammers posting. So the admins banned a lot of people. If you don't see the group may be you were banned accidentally. Well, don't be very sad, I was banned too) Probably it was accidentally, but they have 26 000 of users in main Telegram group, so few users more, few users less doesn't change much.
