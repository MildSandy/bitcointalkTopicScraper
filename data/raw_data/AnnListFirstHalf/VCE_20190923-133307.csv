The platform is up, touch.tube so far looks good but still requires some sorting features. But the main porn topics are there. I like you can watch porn without the annoying adds and advertisements, or the malicious links you need to avoid, and is free.  Regarding the coin, there are two types of VIT at the moment. an ERC-20 token which was released during ICO and the native token which you earn in the platform. At this moment the ERC-20 can't be used at the platform, their only use is to create new accounts, so that is why is going down in price. Stuart (CEO) has already announced the transfer of ERC-20 tokens to Native VIT is almost ready and will be released next week.  -How to earn from it? Similar to STEEM (VIT is a fork of Steem) if you upload a porn video you earn VIT depending on the votes the video get. If you vote on a video you earn VIT as curation depending the total amount the video earned. You can also earn VIT by commenting on videos and other people voting on your comments.  -Why people must deposit 1500VIT in the site, i mean, what will be the benefits to do that? The 1500VIT you deposit are staked in your account (you need a certain amount of staked VIT in your account to interact with the platform (Upload, comment, vote). You can always unstake them after (takes several weeks like steem) but you never lose those 1500 they are yours.  -Is a platform like steemit, or..? VIT works quite similar to Steem, the more VIT you have staked the more your votes are worth. And the more you can earn by curation.  Adding to this, the community is great, its the first time I see a CEO interacting like this with the community. Finally, tube8 is almost done with implementing VIT in their site. And there is talk about cannabis companies wanting to integrate VIT (Automanseeds.com and copperheadgrow.com). https://automanseeds.com/automan-to-accept-cryptocurrency/  If you are interested in VIT news you can follow their twitter account https://twitter.com/VITupdates",False

The ERC 20 token, which has recently received a vote of confidence from porn star Stormy Daniels, plans to change the adult film industry’s economics with its innovation. It is built on top of a blockchain fork off Steem, a chain that similarly rewards users for content, and has been adopted by the likes of Playboy Enterprises Inc. for their online wallets. VIT concluded its token offering recently. (See also: Playboy Rolls Out Its Own Cryptocurrency Wallet.)  A Race to the Bottom As outlined in VIT’s whitepaper, subscriptions to online content account for a minority of revenues in the adult film industry. Producers mainly recoup costs through traffic (generated from Google and affiliated websites) and advertising. Ad rates depend on engagement with content measured through an assortment of factors, from viewing time to clicks on a site or a video. The revenue split is mainly a result of the peculiarities of the internet’s ad-supported business model, which rewards free content over subscriptions. (See also: Steemit: The Disruptive Blockchain-Based Media Community.)   But it is a not a successful or profitable model. Free content has resulted in a proliferation of websites and a race to the bottom in terms of content quality and advertising rates. According to the VIT white paper, adult content creators and affiliated websites and programs generate only 24% of total revenue. “Advertisers earn very little of overall adult revenue, content producers earn even less, and viewers earn nothing,” the white paper says. VIT’s token is an attempt to rectify this state of affairs.  How Does the VIT Token Work?  Here’s how the system works: Each stakeholder in the adult industry value chain uses tokens to engage with the product. Viewers are rewarded for watching and engaging with porn videos through VIT tokens. The folks behind VIT claim that these tokens are a step up from traditional metrics used to measure viewer engagement in that they also record metrics from other silos, such as social media interactions, comments and likes. Instead of relying on third parties for this data, adult film producers can use token data to find out more about viewer preferences and tailor future content accordingly. The direct connection between producer and viewer through blockchain technology will help result in an “ongoing feedback loop” beneficial to the adult movie ecosystem. It will also provide content producers with another stream of revenue in the form of viewer engagement data that can be resold to other parties, such as advertisers interested in such information.",False

I also find the advertising part interesting although sites like porn.com and many others already offer methods like this, but ok not combined with a token.  But i do see some problems: 99% of all regular advertisers do not want to advertise on porn sites. The advertisers who do want to advertise (like the ones now doing through banners, popups, popunders, inplayer ads, and so on) only want to advertise on soft porn related sites. I can already see at your partners lists that they also only offer soft porn as well (some nice names but still), so im assuming your platform will only contain softporn. And as you mention yourself there are already over 150.000 sites where you can watch these kind of porn movies for free...so why would they visit your platform? And sure, some cheap users will come for the money but i expect they wont earn thousands of dollars a day, so im not expecting that this money-thing will attract many customers.  I dont want to be negative, but when i look at myself, if i want to watch porn i want specific movies, explicit/rare stuff, no softporn and stuff you see everywhere... So my question is: what kind of porn can we expect? Will you try to become another xhamster sites filled with promomaterial or are you going to offer full movies?  And what exactly is the role of your partners? Have you gotten the rights from all their movies, or will they just become merchants of your system?",False
