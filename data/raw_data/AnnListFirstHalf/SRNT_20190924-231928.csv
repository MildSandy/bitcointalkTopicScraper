Exchange📈,"Serenity Exchange listed one more stablecoin: Gemini dollar (GUSD)    The stablecoin Gemini dollar (GUSD) has been added to Serenity Exchange and now the pair GUSD/USDT is available for trading.  By listing Gemini token, Serenity team aims to provide clients with an alternative to Tether (USDT), the first stablecoin listed on the exchange. Thus, traders can keep their savings in two stablecoins for the purpose of risk diversification.  Gemini dollar (GUSD), issued by Gemini Trust Company LLC, is built on the Ethereum network according to ERC20 standards. The cryptocurrency is backed by the traditional fiat USD held at State Street Bank and Trust Company.  This is a unique stablecoin, as the US dollar deposit balance is examined monthly by BPM, the largest in the US accounting and consulting firm based in California in order to verify the availability of required amount of dollars on the accounts in the ratio of 1:1 according to the volume of GUSD issued.   Now there are 14 crypto pairs available for trading on Serenity Exchange. The team intends to continue selecting and listing coins with high potential and large communities in order to increase customers’ activity and improve our trading turnover.  Serenity Exchange was successfully released in May 2019, and has been rapidly developing since then, increasing the trading potential and expanding the community. One of its most competitive advantages among those offered to traders is the ability to aggregate liquidity from large markets which guarantees a genuine trading volume for customers.

Arbitration⭐. Exchange📈,"Serenity.Exchange Development Report     Dear friends!  We strive to be as open as possible, so every two weeks we will present a progress report on the development of our Exchange.  During the period from August 27th to September 10th, we have improved a number of features, thereby increasing the security and usability of the Exchange:  1. Passwords are now more secure! The risk of your account being hacked is minimized thanks to the improved password generator: not only alphanumeric characters can now be used in passwords. This makes any hacking attempts much more difficult.  2. Select your citizenship from the full list of countries. We have expanded the list of countries, now all users can choose their country to specify citizenship.  3. Minimum transaction limits are set for each instrument. The limits will be displayed in the currency of a quote, so our users can immediately access information about the limitations of trading a certain instrument.  4. User’s order list bug fixed. Our users are reporting a problem: when one of the placed orders is canceled, others get canceled too. We already fixed the bug — try it now!  5. TradingView vulnerability eliminated. TradingView, a web service providing online charts for exchanges, reported vulnerabilities in its software. Serenity Exchange team promptly updated TradingView libraries, thereby protecting the exchange and users from possible attacks.  6. Automatic verification of scans and photos of documents. To pass the KYC procedure, you must provide photos of your documents with a .JPG or .PNG extension. Now Serenity automatically checks documents before upload and rejects images with wrong resolution. This eliminates the risk of downloading malicious files and increases Serenity Exchange’s resistance to external threats.  7. “Unnecessary” notification about loss of chat connection removed. The notification was groundless and confusing to users. Bug fixed.  8. Favicon added for the web version of the Exchange. Minor aesthetic upgrade: Serenity.Exchange icon added in the site loading bar.  We will continue to keep you informed about our development process. Your awareness, safety, and comfort are of the utmost importance to us. Like this post if you think that these Serenity.Exchange updates are useful.

We got a lot of questions from our tokenholders regarding the utility value of SRNT token, especially in connection to Serenity exchange.  SRNT token in Serenity products  First of all, we want to make it clear that SRNT token is used both in Serenity Escrow and Serenity Exchange and will be used in all possible future Serenity products.  We are already accepting SRNT tokens as a possible way of paying fees for using Serenity Escrow. We accept them at the minimal price of 0.0001 ETH, and will soon start accepting them for USDT/TUSD (US dollar-tethered stablecoin) deposits at the minimal price of 0.10 USD. In case a client comes to Serenity Escrow without SRNT tokens, we will buy tokens at exchanges for at least 50% of the fees paid by the client. All the SRNT tokens collected as part of Escrow fees will be immediately burned.  We are still finalizing the fee structure for Serenity Exchange, but we can already say that we will adopt the model used by Binance and some other exchanges: we will accept the listing fee and most other fees exclusively in SRNT tokens.  SRNT token in 3rd-party products  Besides using SRNT tokens in our own products, we’ve already signed contracts with two of our partners that they will accept up to 50% of the price of their products in SRNT tokens.  The first company, one of the founding members of Serenity, is UpTrader. For the last 10 years, UpTrader has been producing software for brokerage companies.

Stanislav Vaneev, Serenity founder:  “I’m convinced that conjoined efforts of tech companies whose goal is to create a safe and transparent space for trading will lead to truly significant changes in the non-exchange market. It’s a synergy of two companies that share the same goal. We’re very happy to be working with Tradefora. This company meets the highest standards in terms of quality of the services they offer. They work with massive amounts of data, which allows analyzing the prices of trades and the quality of their execution with utmost precision. We plan to finalize the integration with Escrow within two weeks. It will become the final point in the Serenity Escrow roadmap. After that, traders will get a unique, technologically advanced, functional platform for secure and transparent trading with any broker.”  Tradefora.com provides a real-time Transaction Cost Analytics (TCA) and trade execution scorecard to all of its users, bringing out into the open any suspicious pricing or sub-par execution practices with highly visual charts.  The real-time trade verification will be conducted via an API connection. All the trades conducted within the Serenity-Financial ecosystem will be automatically pulled into Tradefora database, where they will be cross-checked against the market average prices, which will ensure that traders are getting a fair execution and best market pricing. Smart contract technology of Serenity-Financial will further allow automating the settlement of those trades that pass the verification and further more detailed review of those trades that don’t with built-in arbitration mechanism.  “We are very excited to start this cooperation with Serenity-Financial, because it creates a perfect showcase for the real-time trade verification technology. This is the first project of it’s kind in the market. Coupled with smart contract escrow, we believe that it sets a new benchmark for the retail OTC market. For decades brokers have been boasting lowest spreads and fastest execution, now we finally have the tools and infrastructure to not only verify those claims, but to settle the trades based on such real-time verification results”- mentioned Pavel Khizhnyak, Tradefora Co-founder.  How does this work?  Tradefora’s patent-pending algorithm for analysis of trade execution quality works by aggregating “mystery shopping” live trading accounts from 100+ brokers with an unlimited number of retail traders’ account data across most popular forex, precious metals, energy, CFDs and margin crypto instruments. All the tick-by-tick data is analyzed, aggregated and stored in real-time with millisecond precision to produce Tradefora Composite Index (TCI), which acts as a market average benchmark.  Tradefora’s API is based on the TradeGuard tool. TradeGuard technology evaluates each trade by comparing it the execution price against TCI market average before and after the trade with millisecond precision. The resulting 5 score levels are based on which quantile the trade price falls into in the TCI statistical distribution for the execution timestamp using Box Plots statistical method.  “The time has come for the retail OTC space to become more transparent and more mature”, stated Tradefora’s co-founder Pavel Khizhnyak. “We are looking forward to working with Serenity-Financial and bringing more transparency and accountability to the OTC space”, — he added.  About Tradefora PLC  Tradefora PLC (“Tradefora”) is an independent broker-agnostic big data company, founded in 2015 with a core mission of bringing more transparency to OTC markets through an impartial TCA and trade execution quality analytics.  If you would like to learn more about the services described here, please visit https://Tradefora.com  About Serenity  Serenity is an escrow for secure trading on OTC-markets.

This Association was created by Finacom, an international regulatory body that resolves trading disputes. Its goal is to promote self-regulation in the field of digital currency trading by uniting cryptocurrency exchanges and financial firms.  In addition to Serenity Exchange, the Association’s members include Etheralabs (a New York City based lab and ecosystem that builds, reproduces and invests in innovative blockchain technologies), YouHodler (blockchain-based financial ecosystem focused on cryptocurrency-backed lending with fiat loans) and Ibinex (B2B exchange ecosystem, harnessing the power of thousands of exchanges with a connected and unified backend infrastructure).  All clients of a company that is a member of the Association have a unique opportunity to report any trading problem to the independent Blockchain Expert Committee of the Financial Commission, which consists of fintech and cryptocurrency experts. This option hasn’t been previously offered by any regulators or other self-regulatory organizations. It’s expected that this will establish the process for resolving claims in the field of digital currency trading.  Another advantage of the membership is that the Association’s member and its clients can interact and consult with industry experts, legal compliance experts and other blockchain and cryptocurrency professionals. Serenity Exchange has joined the growing community of companies thanks to complying with the highest standards of business ethics, establishing trust with their customers, fair business practices and transparent partnership.  The exchange, as a proprietary development of Serenity Financial, aggregates liquidity from external providers, which means that full depth of market (DOP) is always available on the exchange.

Arbitration⭐. Exchange📈,"We unveil the Serenity escrow beta    Dear friends,  Serenity has announced the launch of the beta version of escrow for financial markets.  This is the first system of this kind that is able to store investors’ funds on a smart contract and protect them from any fraudulent activity and risks.  Beta version of escrow contains a publicly available smart contract, which stores customer funds. The smart contract code can be found on GitHub. At first, customers will be able to make deposits only in Ethereum.  Serenity team has extensive experience and knowledge of the foreign exchange industry and owing to that we can anticipate that the system will become the authority that guarantees a reliable trader-broker relationship. Serenity developers were guided largely by the needs of Forex traders when creating the escrow.  According to the founder of the project Stanislav Vaneev: “Escrow, which is being created by the Serenity team, is a universal instrument that can be used for mutual settlements in any sphere of business, which expands the scope of the system and increases its appeal. Now the team is developing the proprietary Serenity exchange, the beta version of which is expected to be released this fall. The development of escrow and exchange takes place in full accordance with the roadmap which can be found on Serenity website.  Anyone can test our escrow system. In order to do this, you will need to open a Standard trading account with Grand Capital broker, which you can use to trade major currencies and single stocks CFDs and deposit at least $50. At the moment, deposits and withdrawals of funds are carried out only in Ethereum. You can open an account and deposit funds in Serenity Member’s Area.  Follow the progress of the exchange and escrow development on Serenity Telegram channel and in the Roadmap section on our website. We would also like to remind you that SRNT tokens can be used to pay for escrow services and as a partial payment for services of partner companies.",True

Arbitration⭐. Exchange📈,"Vasily Alexeev: How does Serenity smart contract work?    Recently we launched the Beta version of our Escrow system, which features the first edition of our Escrow smart-contract. You can view its source code on our GitHub.  In this post, I want to give an overview of how our smart-contract works.  First of all, the contract knows that when it accepts a transfer and has enough SRNT tokens, it should immediately burn them. This process happens absolutely automatically. In case there are not enough tokens on the contract, 1% of the transfer goes to Serenity’s wallet, and we buy and burn tokens ourselves.  But the main part of the smart-contract is the Escrow logic: the contract holds Ethereum addresses of the trader and their brokerage company. These addresses are saved in the smart-contract at the time of its deployment, and can’t be changed later, even by us. The main thing in the logic of the contract is that the funds can be transferred only to these two addresses. That means that even theoretically, no one else, not even Serenity, can get money from the contract, because it just can’t transfer it to anyone else.  How does the smart-contract know when it needs to transfer the money? It waits for two exactly matching transfer commands. These commands can be done only by brokerage, client or from Serenity’s wallet. Again, the wallet addresses can’t be changed after the contract’s deployment. The command is really simple: it specifies which amount from what is held on the smart-contract should go to the brokerage, and which to the client. When we see that the contract received a withdrawal command from one of the parties, we notify the second party about that.  For example, if there’s 10 ETH on the smart-contract, the client can issue a transfer command, requesting to transfer 9 ETH to themselves, and 1 ETH to the brokerage. But the transfer won’t be executed until exactly the same command arrives either from brokerage or Serenity. This procedure ensures that each transfer decision is approved by at least two of the three parties: brokerage, client, and Serenity.  This simple and straightforward structure of the contract ensures that it’s secure and can be easily audited.",True

Arbitration⭐. Exchange📈,"Update on the development progress    In this post, we wanted to give you an update on our development efforts in July 2018.  Serenity Escrow  Withdrawal experience First of all, we’ve been working on the final touches to the base Escrow platform, including more streamlined withdrawal experience. It’s really important for us to make this process user-friendly to both the brokerage and the client. We want withdrawals from the platform to happen as smoothly as possible. We’ve been testing several UX ideas and worked with our partners from brokerage companies to determine the best strategy to ensure a quick and hassle-free withdrawal process. Every brokerage has a unique procedure for confirming withdrawals, and we had to account for all of them.  We plan to release the updated withdrawal experience at the end of August.  USD nominated trading accounts Second, after launching the Beta system, we got feedback from both end-users and brokerage companies that if we want the system to succeed, we need to find a way to allow trading accounts nominated in USD to be used in the system (right now we allow only ETH-nominated accounts).  We considered several ways of achieving that, but all of them seemed problematic due to high level of ETH volatility. Finally, we got an idea: beginning end of this month, we will accept TUSD (TrueUSD) and ERC20 USDT (Tether) tokens as a way of topping-up trading accounts. Both of these are what is called stablecoins, that is cryptocurrencies fully backed by USD reserves, and the price of 1 TUSD or USDT is always equal to 1 USD. And since they’re based on Ethereum network, we can fully integrate them with our smart contract and Escrow system.  You can freely choose using either TUSD or USDT, depending on your preference. While Tether (USDT) has been on the market much longer, recently it became a source of controversy due to lack of formal audits, which TrueUSD (TUSD) has.  Verify My Trade integration Third, we’ve been working on VMT integration. Verify My Trade is a service which analyses prices of several hundred brokerage companies and can determine whether a certain trade was executed consistently with the global market, or if the execution was unsatisfactory.  Right now we’re in process of signing a formal cooperation agreement with VMT and will be releasing this new service shortly.  Serenity Exchange We got a lot of questions regarding the lack of visible updates on Serenity Exchange. The truth is, we focused on the exchange’s engine while laying aside the front-end.  Most of the July was spent on integrating external liquidity in the Exchange platform. What does that mean? It means that we will be fully integrated with several large exchanges (right now it’s Kraken, Binance, and Okex), and when you open a position at Serenity Exchange, it will be automatically matched to positions at these three exchanges. This means, that by trading at Serenity Exchange, you will be in fact trading not only with our own clients but with the clients of these three large exchanges. This means that Serenity Exchange is more than an exchange — it’s a cryptocurrency trading broker.  We’ve made a really great progress, and it seems we will need just a couple more weeks to finalize this part of the Exchange, and then we can move on to integrating ERC20 tokens, which should be pretty straightforward, considering that we already have full Ethereum integration complete.",True

Arbitration⭐. Exchange📈,"Important announcement! Changes in road map and future plans    Hello, Serenity community!  A week has passed since the end of our ICO. Thank you to all who participated to reach our final sum! After all the calculations our total amount in USD at the time when we stopped the crowdsale was $4,034,745!  During the pa, t week we have managed to fulfill almost all SRNT payments, and all available tokens are already in circulation. In the next days we will still be transferring tokens for some of the last small credit card purchases, which got delayed due to KYC. Since all unsold tokens had been already burned, for these transfers we will be taking tokens out of the team’s pool.  During the campaign, we have encountered heavy interest from both crypto and institutional contributors.  Stanislav Vaneev, the founder of Serenity: “For our company it has been a long way, but it is still just the beginning. We’ve attracted a very loyal and engaged community and gained invaluable feedback for our project. We are excited for what the future holds and are looking forward to make revolutionary secure marketplace for Forex. Overall, the ICO provided us with a solid foundation to launch and grow”. We haven’t raised the anticipated target amount, but we are very proud of our community and the goals we have reached. Thanks to you, we are excited to build the escrow platform in 2018.  Moreover, we have summarized everything, finalized our future plans, and we’re ready to share it with you. But before moving on to the plans, we want to share the full statistics and numbers for Serenity ICO.  The ICO lasted 6 weeks from January 25 to March 7. More than 3,500 people have bought Serenity tokens and over 26,400 people have joined our community.  The total amount of fees raised — $4,034,745  The total amount of tokens sold — 84,049,746 SRNT  12,607,462 SRNT goes to the team and bounty participants  Tokens in circulation — 96,657,208 SRNT  Note: Team and bounty tokens located here — 0x47c8F28e6056374aBA3DF0854306c2556B104601, we will freeze team tokens once we finish all bounty transactions. Right now tokens are freely traded on:  - Yobit (ETH / BTC)  - Etherdelta  - KKcoin  Since our platform is in the process of being developed, the only use of SRNT, for now, is for speculative purpose on exchanges. We plan to add more exchanges once we have sufficient trading volume. The volume also applies to CoinMarketCap.  Future Plans  We have a new road map for each of our steps. Right now we are working on three directions: Escrow/Attracting brokers to the system/ Attracting traders to the system.   Escrow    This is the largest part in terms of developing and coding. Our escrow platform includes several parts:  Serenity smart contract and smart contract deployment system  - MT4 and MT5 integration and implementation of API for other trading platforms - Integration of Verify My Trade module - Development of Serenity Personal Area - Third party liquidity integration - All interfaces will be based on Python/Django/JavaScript/Angular programming languages and frameworks -Integration with MT4 will use C++ -Smart contracts will be created using Solidity  Vasily Alexeev: ”We can’t wait for the platform to be released and we are doing everything to make that happen. Serenity has a proficient team that mastered all applicable programming languages and they have proper experience in creating such products, thus, we will deliver masterpiece project according to our road map”   Attracting more brokers to the system    We already have around 20 early adopters among the brokers who joined us during pre-ICO and ICO stages. We actively shared our vision with brokers as well as other members of fintech community. During the past several months we received massive feedback about what we need to accomplish on development side and how we should interact with new members of Serenity system.  Platform development relies on principles of simplicity of integration with brokers’ trading systems backends and their online client areas via various APIs and protocols.  Our main channel for new member acquisition into the system will be direct communication with brokers through the existing network of contacts. Besides, Serenity team will attend major trading and fintech conferences and exhibitions around the world to promote Serenity to brokers directly.  We will also involve our digital marketing as well as social media marketing. We will refine our website interface in shortest possible time in order to sell Serenity product to broker. Our sales department will hunt and gather brokers from a direct sales perspective and will be provided the tools to do so.  As a part of our marketing strategy we will devote our efforts to the promotion of Serenity mission to retail OTC trading and Crypto community. We will encourage traders to ask their brokers to join Serenity and to become more transparent, comfortable and reliable in cooperation.  All of this will ensure successful acquisition of new members into Serenity systems.  Attracting traders   We will be promoting Serenity intensively and ensure that the platform launch is a much-anticipated event for the Forex trading community. Our main channels for the promotion will be forums, financial analytics websites, professional communities and a number of well-known reputable international media. The team plans to participate in major B2B and B2C exhibitions and continue presenting the project worldwide. We are planning to use our own marketing and PR resources, as well as those of the partner brokers. By the moment of the Beta version launch, which is to take place in June 2018, we expect to have no less than 10,000 traders in the project.  Stay tuned for our next communication! We plan to have weekly digests of news about our project.  Once again, thank you all for your support.  This is just the beginning!  Serenity Team",True

Exchange📈,"Serenity project raises its first $1,000,000 two days after the ICO launch    Serenity ICO started on the 25th of January, and at the moment of writing the news, the amount of funds raised was US$1,000,257.  Vasily Alexeev, CTO Serenity:  “We are really grateful to every single supporter of our project. You give us a chance to make our dream about transparent and fair trading on financial markets come true. The months of preparation for the ICO have been really hard for all of our team members, and it's great to see that you value the work we have done preparing the project.”  Serenity is the first escrow broker-platform for financial markets that protects investors' funds from fraud and trading interferences by using smart contracts. The platform operates based on smart contract technology.  The company plans to raise $19 million to develop the platform. The project will be launched in separate stages.  The SRNT token has been listed by the largest Russian exchange, Yobit. Talks with several more exchanges are currently underway.  The project has been supported by major brokers from the Forex and binary option industries, including IQoption, Liteforex, NordFX, as well as Alexey Kutsenko (Founder of a fintech company Tools for Brokers), Yagub Rahimov (adviser of the ICO project nagaico.com and founder of AtoZForex), and many others.  Serenity ICO will last until the 7th of March 2018, offering a range of discounts on SRNT tokens. At the first ICO week, the discount will be 40%. It means that only until the 31st of January, you can buy tokens for 0,00006 ETH/token. The discount will be decreasing each week by 5% and by 10% at the last week.  Ticker — SRNT. Serenity token nominal value — 0.0001 ETH. Minimum purchase in Ethereum — 100 tokens. Minimum purchase in Bitcoin, VISA/Mastercard, via Bank Wire — 500 tokens. Minimum purchase in tokens/coins — 5,000 tokens.  You can calculate your purchase in Serenity token calculator.  If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact our Support Team via LiveChat or in our Telegram channel.  Register on the website to buy Serenity tokens.  Serenity team",True

About FinaCom  FinaCom is an independent international dispute resolution (EDR) organization for financial markets. The Financial Commission settles disputes between brokers and trader and conducts audit for ICO projects, technology providers, and brokerage companies.  What is FinaCom certification  FinaCom’s ICO certification committee consists of experts in fintech, blockchain, and cryptocurrency. The experts conducted a detailed assessment of our ICO based on 150 criteria. Here are some of them:  — applicable law and registration; — potential compliance with regulatory requirements; — aptitude of the industry and the product for the goals of ICO; — reasons for cryptocurrency funding instead of traditional funding; — ability of the issuer’s technology to adjust to capitalization changes; — funding and security of the project; — smart contract and blockchain technologies; — token specifications; — ICO details; — third-party products and solutions used; — ICO communications; — project’s website; — Investor risks. Why certification by FinaCom is important There’s been a craze on the ICO market lately. Investments in ICO are profitable, but more often than not investors don’t know how to evaluate the prospects of a particular project. A project may seem promising, but lack a clear business plan or the necessary resources. Independent evaluation of ICO conducted by professionals helps investors to choose a truly attractive project. By now only two ICO projects were certified by FinaCom: Serenity and Genesis. Serenity ICO is in progress: discounts decrease every week! Make sure to buy SRNT tokens with a 40% discount until January 31st.",True

Arbitration⭐. Exchange📈,"SERENITY introduces a number of improvements to the project prior to the ICO    SERENITY has redesigned the website and made a number of improvements prior to the ICO  After the Pre-ICO (which ended on December 1st, 2017), the SERENITY team conducted an audit of the project, website, and marketing campaign and made a number of improvements and changes towards the project to make it easier for you to participate with our ecosystem.  Website redesign and the Exchange prototype  The design has undergone significant changes for convenient use. In addition to that, we’ve added the Serenity exchange prototype. Serenity exchange will give our token holders the opportunity to exchange cryptocurrency and currency in the most convenient way. Deposit/withdrawal process through Serenity Exchange will be carried out in any cryptocurrency and fiat money. Our platform users will also be able to invest in Crypto Fund performance indices. You can already see all the updates on our website.  The token price has decreased by 1000 times  Due to the recent Ethereum(ETH) price surge, the team has decided to reduce the price of Serenity token from 0.1 ETH to 0.0001 ETH. Serenity token Ticker is SRNT. The smart contract has changed in connection with the change of the token price - the new contract is available here.  All tokens purchased during the Pre-ICO and the Closed Round stages will be replaced with the new ones in the corresponding equivalent within three days of the news publication.  $19 Million Hard cap  We have decided to keep our $19-million hard cap. This amount will allow us to implement the entire technical and legal part of the project in full and in a timely manner to serve you better.  Buy SRNT for cryptocurrencies, tokens and fiat money!  Due to the frequent requests from our participants to buy the Serenity tokens in other ways than BTC or ETH, we have expanded the possibilities of payment. Now you can buy Serenity tokens in the US dollars, Euros, via Bank Wire, VISA / Mastercard, Skrill, Neteller, Webmoney, and also exchange the existing cryptocurrency for Serenity tokens. A detailed description of how this can be done will be available in your Personal ICO Area when the ICO starts.  We remind you that during the ICO:  — Minimum purchase in ETH is 100 SRNT. — Minimum purchase in Bitcoin or EUR / USD is 500 SRNT. — If you exchange tokens/cryptocurrency of other ICOs for SRNT tokens, then the minimum purchase will be 5,000 SRNT tokens.  Do not forget! Serenity ICO will last from January 25th to March 7th   Throughout the ICO period, there will be discounts from 40% to 10% for the purchase of Serenity tokens. During the first week of ICO, the discount will be 40%. The discount will decrease every week by 5% so it’s better to participate in the ICO earlier to get a great deal on our platform. In the last week, the discount will be 10%.  If you want to buy tokens with a 45% discount, you can participate in the closed round of token sales, which will last until January 24th. During the closed round the minimum purchase according to the new rate of tokens is 20,000 tokens, at a price of 1.1 ETH with a discount of 45% applied. To participate, apply through the Personal ICO Area. For details of participation email us at presale@serenity-financial.io.  Sincerely, The Serenity Team",True

Arbitration⭐. Exchange📈,"   Hi there ! MT4 supports many functions and functionalities, including 3rd party apps like my software that copies trades between multiple platforms, thousands of different indicators and even expert advisors which can take the form of automated trade assistants/forex robots.  There are several companies offering these indicators and robots and other Forex software and MT4 programming services. The popularity of MT4 comes down to a number of different advantages that it has over other trading platforms.  This is what we are going to take a look at here in this article.  Here are just a few of the reasons for the popularity of Metatrader 4 and why the forex trading community has embraced it so much.  Metatrader 4 offers to forex traders:  Customized Forex software  MT4 allows traders to install their own trading software and custom indicators and downloaded indicators.  This represents a great advantage to traders who thrive on using indicators in their trading.  There are hundreds of different custom indicators available online—many of them for free.  (Note on repainting indicators: Be wary of buying custom indicators that don’t offer a money-back guarantee, or that ‘repaint’.  Repainting is a process of ‘backdating’ the information that the indicator displays, and can be troublesome for live trading.  Repainting typically makes the indicator look a lot more powerful than it really is.  The repainting indicator uses the current price action/data to ‘redo its prediction’ of what the price was going to do.  There are many fraudulent trading systems that are sold using repainting indicators—you will know it if you buy one and try trading it live.  You will look at your chart and then the next minute the indicator has ‘repainted’ its data and you will wonder why you did not get into the trade that was suggested at a better price.  It can be quite a deceptive feeling and I just wanted to pass along this warning to you about repainting indicators.  Not all repainting indicators are bad but they certainly can be used to manipulate signals and it’s something you should watch out for.  It is important to note that many indicators repaint until the current price bar is still open. It is obvious, because no one knows at what price the bar will close and the indicator just displays its value based on the current price. While price is floating and is not fixed, the indicator value is likely to change. Once the price bar closes and its close-price is known the indicator should not change its value too.  The bad part about repainting indicators is that there are many of them which will change indicator value if the newly formed price bar is not in its favor. This is where you enter the market on an entry signal given by the indicator and when the next price bar closes that entry signal (the one you have used to make your trading decision) is replaced with a better signal (one that makes the indicator look more accurate than it really is).  Some repainting indicators will even repaint over multiple bars in the past and really distort the real-time picture.  Stay away from such indicators.  Automated trading  MT4 allows traders to write scripts for automated trading and self-developed Forex indicators, as it supports algorithmic trading.  Automated trading is a dream-come-true for so many of us.  It took me several years before developing a profitable forex robot.  But the time was well invested because the returns that one can make with a robot can be great—and perhaps the best part about automated trading is the fact that it does not require much time investment at all.  You can keep your normal job or other business activities running while your robot automatically trades profitably for you.  More detailed information on robot trading systems is available here with this article.  Here again, there are hundreds of different robots that have been developed with this goal of automated forex trading.  Some are good but most of them are unprofitable.  Be cautious with your money whenever deciding to risk money on a trading robot.  Always test on a demo account first.  I have made the mistake of running a new EA on my live account before testing it first on a demo account.  It was a painful lesson and it cost me money that I should have been wiser with.  I give you this warning so that hopefully you will be wiser than I was and can save yourself from potential painful drawdowns. Simplicity and ease-of-use  Although extremely advanced, MT4 offers a rather simple, user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate even for novice traders. It offers both front-end and back-office mechanisms to control chart displays, indicator/expert-advisor settings as well as clever display options for multiple chart setups.  Note: Investopedia.com has a great tutorial on MetaTrader 4 that you might find useful if you are new to trading or new to the MT4 platform. You can also find some good videos on YouTube which will walk you through many of the most popular features of MT4, as well as demonstrate how to change chart displays, install trading robots and configure indicators, etc. Consistent Updating with cutting-edge features  Traders can enjoy this unparalleled trading experience with the comfort of knowing that MT4 is updated on quite a regular basis with new, clever and intuitive features.  This includes software like Expert Advisors and multiple drag-and-drop charting that help analyze and execute trades automatically.  One of the newest options recently incorporated into MT4 is the option for closing trades with just one click.  This was an option that many traders were wanting in the previous versions of MT4 and as of 2012 the MetaQuotes Company responded and provided the one-click close feature.  This is just one example of how MT4 is rather continuously updated with useful features and improvements.  System-based trading  MT4 allows the download and installation of Expert Advisors that can function as semi-automated trade assistants.  These trade assistants monitor and analyze the market and manage each trade automatically, but they don’t necessarily place the initial trade.  Some of these assistants will bring a pop-up onto the screen asking whether or not you wish to take each trade.  If the trade is taken (by final human decision), the trade assistant robot will monitor the trade and manage/close according to the trade parameters and the rules programmed into the robot/expert advisor.  Note:  These types of trade assistants are usually difficult to find and are only usually a part of more-costly trading courses/systems. Automated Trading System/Robot Testing  MT4 is great at helping traders and software developers to test various automated trading strategies.  This process is known as ‘backtesting’ and is the process of running a robot using the past/historical price data to see how it will trade/function.  Note: Robot developers use this backtesting feature of MT4 in order to check their robots for malfunctions and also to measure for proper execution and effectiveness of the trading rules.  It is not a guaranteed that a properly backtested robot will perform well in a live trading environment, but it gets programmers and trade system developers one step closer towards a profitable robot. Personally, I never trust trading records created during the backtesting process. Technical analysis  With the MT4 technical analysis feature, traders are able to manipulate several indicators with a high degree of accuracy. Technical analysis helps traders identify trends and generate ideas for profitable trade entries.  Typically, new traders will have an obsession with indicators because they get the idea that ‘the more indicators the better’, but of course this is not necessarily true.  On the converse, loading up a chart with too many indicators can often be counter-productive to locating profitable trades.  There are thousands of different trading systems available on the internet; some are free and some are very expensive.  It is the job of every new trader to try and identify the system that works the best for them and then to master that system very well.   It is through mastery, not dabbling, that the trading profits will come.  Flexibility  MT4 also offers enhanced flexibility and complex order capability.  It is possible to have dozens (or even hundreds) of different orders running at the same time in the same MT4 platform.  There are some trading robots that use this many trades (a.k.a. Grid Trading style), but this doesn’t necessarily make them profitable.  Depending on the country that you live in (mainly it is the United States that has this restriction), you can even have multiple trades open on the same currency in opposite directions.  This is a process commonly known as ‘hedging’ and can be an effective tool if used properly. Traders who use this to take advantage of the market use tools like Hedge EA to help them automate some of this process.  Multilingual  MT4 platform supports many languages. Hence, traders from anywhere across the world can utilize the MT4 platform and its data, irrespective of their language proficiency. It is very easy to switch to another language by selecting it from the list in the top main menu and then restarting the platform.   Time-frames  MT4 offers traders the choice of various timeframes, starting from one minute to one month. They can choose the best trading time frame based on their needs.  This is another area where new traders can get caught up in confusion.  Again, try to find the system and the timeframe that works best for you.  What works well for one may not work well for another. Personally, I like higher timeframes like 4 hour or Daily. This usually gives more accurate entry points and setups.  The lower timeframes are often easily manipulated by news releases and whipsaw price action, while on the higher timeframes the price action will tend to be smoother.  Customization  With MT4 programming, users can create their own customized charts with technical indicators.  MT4 also allows for an unlimited number of customized layout options of the trading interface in general.  All of these chart setups, designs and customizations can be saved as templates and recalled at a later time, as well as transferred to other users/computers/MT4 installs.   Data storage and offline usability  Storage and organization of data (including transaction histories and past reports) is quite easy with MT4 because it is stored on the user’s computer or server.  The data and price information is also available offline so studying and testing can be accomplished even without an internet connection, and also on the weekend when there is no price feed from the broker. This enables traders to track their trades and prepare for the future ones even when the market is not open.  Note: This process of study and visual/manual backtesting is very valuable, especially for new traders who are trying to learn the rules and entry points of their trading systems.  Studying the past data with a fine-toothed comb is one of the most effective ways of learning a new trading method. Demo accounts  With MT4 demo accounts, new users can practice trading without investing any money. Totally free of cost, these accounts help traders gain years of expertise through a few months of practice trading.  This is indeed invaluable experience and should not be thought of likely by new traders who are learning the ropes.  Demo accounts are also incredibly valuable when it comes to testing forex robots.  A demo account can never replace a live account when it comes to emotional involvement.  This emotional involvement is incredibly valuable as well, when the time is right and when the trading has already been mastered on a demo account.  In terms of robot performance, a demo account is highly recommended for initial tests before going live with real money.   ‘Light-Weight’ Application  MT4 isn’t a very ‘heavy’ program so it is relatively easy on the computer you are running it on.  Some trading platforms are very cumbersome and use up a lot of computer memory in order to run them, but fortunately Metatrader 4 is not one of these programs.  This allows you to run MT4 even when you are running several other programs at the same time.  And of course you can run multiple MetaTrader 4 instances on the same computer or VPS server. System Requirements      Windows 2000 / XP / Vista     2.0 GHz or faster CPU     512 MB RAM (1 GB recommended)     Screen resolution 1024×768 or higher     Modem/connection speed 36.6 Kbps or faster     Internet Explorer version 7.0 or later     Mozilla FireFox 2.0 or later  As you can see, any average (or even older) computer will be capable of running MT4. Highly secure  MT4 facilitates high security trading, as it encrypts trading data and personal data. It also conceals the trader’s IP address, thus enabling enhanced security and offers a reduced risk of hackers gaining access to an account. This is especially important in modern days of computer hackers when even giant shopping chains like Target are successfully hacked and customers’ personal identity and credit card information are being stolen.  Free components  MT4 also comes with two sets of free Forex software with in-built automation that supports the programming language MQL. This allows traders to make their own trading scripts and indicators. This is an incredibly valuable free addition to the MT4 charting software.  These programming software tools can also analyze data, create customized alerts and automate several programming tasks.  MT4 enables traders to use modern financial instruments with robust exchange analytics. Hence, traders can execute all types of trading operations easily, generally without any technical issues.  MT4 really is a fantastic trading/charting software that can facilitate both robotic trading and manual trading alike (even in the same platform if you so desire).  If you learn this charting software well, as well as a good trading system, you have all you need to systematically build wealth—even starting with a small amount of money.  MT4 is also easily downloadable from the web and totally free of cost. It only takes a few minutes to install and is easy to use. Traders can familiarize themselves with the terminal in just one or two weeks. MT4 also enables traders to trade with more than 1000 brokerage firms’ servers that run on the MT4 platform. MT4 offers brokerage services to Forex, futures, stock markets and Contract for Difference (CFD) traders.  It truly is a wonderful trading platform that almost every trader finds value in. My Personal Take on Metatrader 4  Personally, what I like about MT4 the most is that it allows me to create so much software and connect the software with Windows API functionalities using DLL libraries.  This is ‘programmer language’ so I realize you might not follow, but for me it is very important.  There probably are other platforms that already can do that, but with MT4 I’ve found it convenient to create software like my Remote Trade Copier. So that is a benefit from the programmer’s point of view.  😉  The other thing I like the most about MT4 is the ability to share trading results with other traders and internet services using an “investor” password.  This little gem allows you to share your trading history safely with others. For example, if I give you my trading account’s ‘investor password’ and you plug it into your MT4 account using my account number, you can see all of my trades!  This is a stunning thing to be able to share trades and trade information with other traders.",True

Arbitration⭐. Exchange📈,"7marketz CEO Yagub Rahimov became the Key Advisor of Serenity Financial    Serenity Financial keeps on growing and getting empowered by the day. We are honored to introduce our new Key Advisor, Yagub Rahimov, Co-founder and CEO of 7marketz Inc Group. He has assisted a number of successful ICOs to reach their goals and has been investing in cryptocurrencies since 2009. Yagub brings expertise from Financial Markets and Blockchain perspective, empowering the Serenity team.   «I have been nominated and awarded Best Trader of the Year title a number of times since 2005. During this period, I believe I could have achieved more if my counterparty (brokers) were more transparent with their pricing. I’m confident that Serenity Financial has the potential to become the solution I wished for.  Imagine, you are entering a position and your broker gives you a massive slippage. You naturally send a complaint, expecting the broker to return your loss, but in return the broker replies — ”your order was filled in by the market price”, providing no proof at all. Alternatively, like in many cases, a trader submits a claim and although the answer does not satisfy them, the broker would not be at fault. For scenarios like this, traders, as well as brokers, need a middle party to operate as an arbitrator. Serenity Financial will become that missing piece of the puzzle for the Financial markets».   Short Bio:  Yagub Rahimov is the CEO and a co-founder at 7marketz Inc., the parent company of AtoZForex.com, FintechEvents.Center and NewsOgram AI. From 2005 he has founded a number of companies in 18 countries that specialize in alternative investment channels and machine learning.",True

Thus, when brokers are connected to the platform, clients' trades are being recorded, which eliminates the possibility of backdating transactions. If honesty of a transaction is being questioned, we look at the records and the arbitration committee, which is comprised of industry professionals, makes the verdict.   how to play  A trader registers on Serenity platform and chooses any broker connected to the system. The trader then purchases tokens and their funds go to the depository, thus the broker doesn't have access to them. The broker provides the trader with an equivalent account balance, which is used for trading. When the trader wishes to withdraw funds, they submit a request through Serenity platform. If the broker denies withdrawal of funds, Serenity has the ability to make the broker do that.",True

Arbitration⭐. Exchange📈,"Honesty in the Forest market. How is that possible?   The headline of this article expresses the public opinion that the Forex market is a big hoax.  The reason is simple: most brokers do everything so that the clients would lose their money.  Let's be honest: Well, what a sensible financier, economist, businessman taking from you $ 100, would add 99,900 dollars to an incomprehensible person who has just learned to trade?   Moreover, it is well known, that most brokers do not teach you to trade in the market. They explain how difficult it is to constantly monitor quotes offering the services of traders whose goal is to bring money to the company, not to you.  Let's get the specifics. How does a broker make his millions? Transaction commissions. Customers' losses due to dramatically changed prices. Commission for the transaction postponement until the following day.  Did you catch the point? CLIENTS' LOSSES. Therefore, nobody but you is interested in your benefit. It’s only your goal to be ""in the black."" Therefore, this leads to the conclusion that broker makes a profit, when you lose money, your balance, deposit, funds on the account - whatever you want to call it. It’s vitally important for brokers that you lose money, which means having the opportunity to influence the quotes and prices that you see in your trading terminal. In their favor.  Working in the Forex market and having experience in developing software products for the market, Serenity-financial.io was able to develop a platform for controlling brokers and protecting traders. Each transaction is recorded in a distributed ledger and cannot be changed. Any controversial transaction that is opened by the broker and pulls the trader in the negatives is canceled within 24 hours.  The value for brokers is also obvious - your customers will come and trade just because all transactions are transparent, and any change is prohibited by blockchain. Due to client’s trading brokers have an opportunity to make a profit in the form of spread. As for clients they have a guarantee of honesty of the broker.  We appreciate your feedback, feel free to leave comments and subscribe to serenity-financial.io newsletter. We send only up-to-date information about the project and the Forex industry.

Arbitration⭐. Exchange📈,"Serenity Financial — the first blockchain-based arbitration platform for Forex market!  The project that will change the Forex market  A revolution is coming for those who trade Forex or Binary Options. Serenity Financial is the first marketplace for brokers and traders based on Ethereum blockchain. Marketplace is a platform that processes all transactions between brokers and traders. All trading and non-trading transactions are recorded in blockchain, which guarantees transparency and eliminates the possibility of forgery. The platform stores clients’ funds and acts as an arbitrator in disputes, guarantees security and return of funds.  Why is our project relevant?  Trading volumes of today’s Forex market reach billions of dollars. Thousands of brokers serve as intermediaries for millions of traders around the globe, while only 10% of these brokers are regulated. The market is practically on its own — no standards, no evaluation criteria, no transparency or guarantees. Even choosing a broker is a huge gamble for a trader.  The project acts as a marketplace.  A trader registers with Serenity, connects to any certified broker from the pool, purchases tokens and transfers them to the broker that then provides the trader with an equivalent amount in the account currency. Trader starts placing trades while their funds remain on Serenity accounts and all trades and transactions are recorded in blockchain. When the trader closes a trade, they can submit a claim to our arbitration committee if they suspect any interference from the broker.  All trades are recorded in blockchain, thus the arbitration committee can always review the trading terminal data and establish irrefutable evidence whether the trade was executed correctly. If it was not, Serenity obliges the broker to reimburse the client. Everything is 100% transparent. First, Serenity Platform will be integrated with major trading platforms MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 and then with other trading platforms.  Who works on the project?  The team behind Serenity Financial has already launched several successful projects: Grand Capital Forex broker with monthly turnover of $4,7M and a brokerage software provider UpTrader. Why are we sure that Serenity will reinvent the Forex industry?  We are creating an environment where all participants feel completely protected. Brokers will get liquidity easily and on favorable terms, as well as guarantee transparency for traders and thus attract additional funds.  Let’s change the Forex industry together!

Arbitration⭐. Exchange📈,"It's time to say some words about:  Problem description At the present moment in time, about 6,000 brokers provide Internet trading services through the MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 platforms. According to average estimates, about 4,000,000 traders have trading accounts in those brokerage companies. But only 10% of brokers from this number have a license to provide intermediary services on the financial markets. Most of the new brokers do not become licensed which is due to a complicated procedure, stringent requirements and high costs of about $ 200,000 - $ 400,000 which small companies cannot afford at the initial stage.  Over the years of the industry's existence, and against the backdrop of weak regulation and lack of clear standards, the industry has acquired an ambiguous reputation. New companies face difficulties in attracting customers while customers risk losing their deposits due to improper or ill-advised actions of the broker. For the past several decades, the arrangements of working with the account and of the processing of trading operations on the accounts of traders have not undergone any significant changes. The system remains closed and nontransparent. Brokers continue to have the technical ability to influence information regarding trading accounts, to freeze funds, to recalculate profits, to deny payment orders and to use client funds for non-intended purposes. In this regard, the non-transparency of the system creates difficulties for serious market participants or actors and favorable conditions for fraud. And it also provides ample opportunities for unfair competition among companies, for manipulating the reputation of competitors with the help of anti-PR tools.  At the same time, speculative trade on the difference in exchange rates remains one of the most profitable and continues to attract millions of people. An important aspect is the wide range of investments that exist, especially with respect to innovative investments: trade in crypto-currencies (brokers and stock exchanges with margin trading), trade in binary options. These areas are even less protected from the point of view of a private investor. For this reason the financial industry badly needs new technologies of regulation. To change the situation, you have to radically change the approach. What is needed here is a single transparent regulatory system created on the basis of blockchain tech.",True

Arbitration⭐. Exchange📈,"There are a lot of rumors and negative reviews of the Forex market. They are concerned with unfair brokers, who resort to fraudulent manipulations with deals which a client did not even conduct. This unfair business practice results in huge client’s losses.   Just imagine that the daily turnover of the market is about $ 5,000,000,000,000. There are major players - market makers who create the main movement in the markets. However, there are thousands of brokers and millions of traders who try to make money on these movements while 90% of brokers in this market work without a license and some of these brokers seek to get benefit at the expense of other players.  Undoubtedly, the dealings conducted by some major brokers are strictly regulated but some smaller companies work without a license simply because it is too expensive to get it (1 - 2 million US dollars). Moreover, it is a well-known fact that even the possession of a license does not always save a trader from illegal actions of a broker. Thus, the underlying problem of the forex market is a lack of customer trust. The unscrupulous brokers inflict damage to the whole market and undermine the credibility of the companies operating in good faith.  As you may have guessed, an obvious solution to this problem is blockchain, which allow to register all transactions without a possibility to change them backdated and store client's money in a depository, which is not accessible to any broker. What could be more simple and reliable for today? That is how the Serenity project was launched - the first arbitration platform with segregated accounts for forex brokers and traders.",True
