The Tap Project means something different to everyone. Depending on your social economic status, experience, position or location your view of the Tap Project may mean something different. To some the Tap Project symbols a push to a new industry standard of gaming, a universal wage and currency system, an opportunity to get paid to play, or as a developer a new revenue stream. What ever it may be, the Tap Project means something different to everyone.  What does the Tap Project mean to the team? The Tap Project is a symbol of change and disruption into a long withstanding industry. The Tap project means all of the above and more. The Tap Project is an opportunity for many to create and change something that they believed could not, and would not change. It symbolizes the fact that hardwork, dedication and grit can change absolutely anything. The Tap Project is the evolving organism, while the Tap Coin seeks to fuel that organism with blockchain technology.

Tap is an innovative undertaking that is targeting millions of dollars worth of value that is locked away in gaming platforms and inaccessible to players; a gamer might spend hours and hours in one game amassing rewards and points which are then useless once he stops playing that game. However, other players could make use of these points since they are transferable in-game, but currently, there is no way to transfer value from one game to another short of an extremely convoluted fiat exchange agreement.

With close to 600 transactions, approximately 1200 ETH, was contributed to the project and the vision of the Tap Coin. With that being said the team would like to thank all those that were able to support the project in the foreground and behind the scenes. We know that a long journey lays ahead and the team is ready to take on any obstacles that may come. As history states, with change and disruption comes resistance, and that is to be expected.  Contribution Recap  On October 5th we launched the early contribution period which gave supports the ability to receive a 30% bonus before our ICO. A week later we completed our early contribution period and surpassed 50% of our soft cap goal. We released our Conceptual Alpha and received an amazing response and feedback.    Users were able to create an account, view games on the marketplace, add games to their favorites, and most importantly test out the functionality of the Tap Coin. This allowed users to go into the selected games in the marketplace and input the amount of Premium or Earned Currency they have in those games, showing the Tap Coin valued outcome.  A few days prior to the end of our initial contribution period, we reached our 400K soft cap and the funds were unlocked for the project. Upon doing so the community requested a month long extension to use the funds for marketing and put the project on the map. We implemented the Tap Project Improvement Plan and asked the community if they had any feedback in regards to the contribution period. We brought all feedback to the team and had lengthy meetings and discussions about them. As a result, we lowered the hardcap and implemented a month extension with a waterfall bonus structure. With the month extension we wanted to ensure that those who contributed during the early contribution period were compensated for their early support and belief in the project. With that, we initiated a manual 50% retroactive bonus for those supporters, which was well received by the community.  During our ICO the Ethereum Network became bogged down and congested due to a recent product launch on the network. Thus we implemented an increased gas price of 50Wei.  Rise in Ethereum Price Throughout our ICO we were faced with one major change, the price of Ethereum. When we first started our early contribution, ETH/USD pricing was approximately $300. However, during our contribution period, the crypto community saw ETH rise as high as $1600 within 2 months. Seeing as our price was fixed to ETH, the TTT to ETH ratio remained consistant throughout despite the rise in ETH pricing. Towards the end of our contribution we saw our ETH contributions decrease, but our USD value remained consistent.  https://medium.com/@Tap_Coin/tap-coin-contribution-recap-69c4901830a7",False

There are a few ways that the Tap Coin works. Firstly, to use the Tap Platform and gain access to games, contributors must hold over 5000 TTT. Secondly, being a Tap Community Partner and holding between 65,000 TTT and 249,000 TTT gives contributors access to the Tap Coin Proof of stake concept and drip bonus. platform users in this category will be provided a .10% daily drip bonus* of TTT for one year, in addition to their earned Tap Coins for playing. Thirdly, holding over 250,000 TTT (regardless if you are a Tap Community Partner) provides contributors with a .25% daily drip bonus*. This bonus will run for a indefinite amount of time and be analyzed monthly. This is also in combination with their earned Tap Coins for playing games. *Rates are subject to change and will only be initialized upon release of games to the platform*  Read the blog for further information!",False

The key is always going to be the team and the ability to execute the vision. We are the only coin actively working to provide benefits to both developers and gamers. We are actively talking with and partnering with developers about what we can deliver and how they can best utilize Tap Coin in their projects. I think of all the coins and tokens out there, how many teams actively seek feedback from the people that will ultimately use their coin? Tap Coin will be a part of the game, bringing in new players. social media promotion, and increasing replayability. When a developer approaches us and says they have trouble getting beta testers we have a solution for them. When they want the community to develop new maps and content, we have a way to reward the community with something they actually want (a currency that can be exchanged on a real exchange with actual liquidity).  You have coins that are rewarding E League players, compensating players for skins, and providing a platform for Indie game developers to post their new games. I think all of these are great ideas, but they are fundamentally different from Tap Coin. We are the only coin working to actually reward the developers and the gamers, working to provide the balance that benefits everyone. In addition, Hugh one of our co-founders is working to educate people on how to develop their own tokens and Dapps on the Ethereum blockchain.  We are open to criticism and are constantly evolving. There is room in gaming for several coins and tokens, but the best one will ultimately give everyone involved in gaming a reason to use it. That is what we are creating. We hope to educate others along the way, and we hope that the community will provide us the guidance and honest feedback we need to exceed your expectations.  McDonalds did not create the first hamburger or fast food chain Amazon was not the first online book store Apple did not create the first smart phone Google did not invent the search engine  The key difference is team, vision, and execution, we invite you on our journey.  Fueled by Gamers, Inspired by the Community and Disruptive to All. This is our misson, and we are working everyday to make it a reality.  Rory",False

Have been doing reliable work for other projects before. But 2500 TTT for a full translation? That's less than 0,01% of the total distributed bounty tokens. In other words: Dust! Especially considering the total supply of 1.500.000.000 TTT I like your homepage, looks good.  Here is my in-depth analysis of your translation bounty: According to your webpage your team has only three members? 30% of tokens for your team = 450.000.000 TTT -> 150.000.000 tokens per member. That's 60000x times more than a translation that takes about 3 - 5h. So your payment equals 240.000 hours or 10.000 days of translation work. That's 27.4 years of non-stop translation work. Obviously as a devolper you should get paid more, let's say by a factor of 2.7x. So the developer reward of 150.000.000 TTT is still equivalent of 10 years non-stop work, or, if we think about a 40h work schedule per week with no vacation, you had to work 50 years! In other words: Your current 2.500 TTT payment for the translation is waaaay too low. btw: that was some fun math.",False
