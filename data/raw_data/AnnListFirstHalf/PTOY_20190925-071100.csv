We are a healthcare company FIRST, not a crypto company. Crypto/blockchain is used as an infrastructure for the platform it is not the platform. We host conferences to educate the healthcare community, which we get sponsors who without our teaching would NEVER in a million years adopt crypto. This does not happen overnight.  Do you also say this about Ethereal Summit and IOHK Summit?    Not sure how you came up with your generalizations without doing any valid research.  Telegram is not closed and it is not our official channel. Slack is.  There are quarterly videos on our video page on patientory.com  Technical updates are shared on slack by Vince (CTO).  I re-iterate PTOYNet is available in under 2 years which you can join on ptoy.org.  We have over 1000 app registrants (people who have requested the dapp access code).  It is not our strategy to follow other projects that are over HYPED and pour all their resources into short term marketing just to see coin prices increase, without pouring resources into development. In our whitepaper we made it clear that 80% of ICO funds goes into developing PTOYNet and educating the market on PTOYNet platform which the team has delivered.  The Patientory, Inc dapp is just one case for PTOYNet blockchain network.  Thank you.    ",True

Please note we ensure all features that are released to the public comply with HIPAA. The team takes great pride in knowing the minimum viable features released will have the most effect on getting consumers to gradually adopt the technology. Based on our roadmap released in 2017, the team is on track in completing those deliverables. The roadmap is also updated periodically to include more in-depth details.  Based on current research mobile health apps are on the rise but still face minimal day to day adoption (https://www.iqvia.com/-/media/iqvia/pdfs/institute-reports/patient-adoption-of-mhealth.pdf). The team's goal is to provide an efficient means for any user whether suffering from a chronic illness or considered a healthy person to use the dapp.  The team is proud to say they are market makers behind the healthcare industry in pushing blockchain education and adoption to healthcare stakeholders. At the time of the starting the project healthcare leaders were not informed on how blockchain will impact their organizations. The CEO sits on the board of the Hospital Management Systems Society (HIMSS) the largest global healthcare organization boasting over 60,000 members for information technology and management systems in healthcare.  If you are not in healthcare, here is a good read that explains the healthcare sales cycle can last up to 18 months.

An Important Patientory Product Update Hello,  Patientory Inc. wanted to provide you a quick update on a current product bug experienced by some of our users for our beta DApp.  Currently, the PTOY Wallet in the DApp is pointing to Permissioned PTOYNet and not that of the ethereum main net. As a result, it will not currently accept transfers from the main ethereum net directly. Any transfers initiated using the DAPP wallet will still reside in the ethereum main net only at the same wallet address (DApp address).  If users execute the above actions, they will not be able to see their balance in the DApp. Users, however, can see their balance using other wallets such as metamask.io by connecting to the mainethereum net.  We also wanted to let you know that we are currently working on a fix to point our wallet to connect to both mainethereum net and PTOYNet. We will let you know as soon as it is ready - until then, please refrain from using PTOY wallet to avoid confusion.  Thanks!  The Patientory Team",True

I don't think so, So in this example either PTOY is very undepriced or Verge is very overpriced. At this point I would never invest in high cap Coins like Verge when there are many better and cheaper options.",True

The app/patient portal is also a health data storage wallet. In order for the app to work a wallet needs to be created. All of the steps shown was explained in creating a profile (wallet) on the PTOY blockchain. While we can technically pull and push all data from the patient EMR, for this use case we were able to pull Test Results data from the EPIC EMR and format it to our standards.

A beginner’s guide in 360 words.  If you’re living in Miami, and get in a major skiing accident in Colorado, it could take up to four months for your medical records to transfer from your home hospital to your current treatment center.  There’s currently no uniform system in place for creating and storing electronic medical records (EMRs). A variety of EMR companies, each with their own unique program, compete to sell their services to medical providers; when your providers have different EMR systems, getting the two systems to make the exchange is yet another joyful experience in the world of healthcare bureaucracy.  Your medical information must remain private and secure, so when the files need to be transferred, a trusted third party converts the original documents to fit the format of the receiving party’s EMR system. The records are moved from one data silo to another, an expensive operation that leaves room for hacking.  Chrissa McFarlane, CEO of Patientory, has over a decade of experience in the healthcare industry and founded the company to put control back in the patient’s hands.  https://cryptomarket360.com/what-is-patientory-ptoy-a-beginners-guide-in-360-words/",True

Their goal is to ensure a safe transaction of patient information data from one provider to another. A good goal, considering that most information regarding your health are very important for your everyday life – if your information gets public, the consequences can range from nonexistent to awkward to devastating, depending on your circumstances. If you don’t believe that such information can be absolutely ruinous, I really can recommend watching the movie “Philadelphia”. In this movie from 1994, the information of Andrew Beckett having AIDS led to his outing, as well as the inevitable downfall of his career and reputation in the US of the early 90s. While the story of Philadelphia took place more than 20 years ago & homosexuality is not as a problem as it was back then, health information is still very confidential and not as secure as you might think. During May 2017, the attack of the malware “Wannacry” infested computers of the British national health service, making data inaccessible.

Quiana_patientory [11:15 PM] Hi all - I'd like to acknowledge the various questions. I'll work with our team next week to review. Thank you.  [11:20] Hi Slack community, I appreciate your patience! I've included the Q4 AMA questions below. We'll update the FAQ section shortly. Thank you.  Quiana_patientory [11:40 PM] *Part 1*  *What are the details around product updates?* • Please refer to patientory.com/roadmap or github.com/patientory for the 2017-2018 roadmap and updates on product development.  *Why is the code not open source?* • There are two parts to the Patientory development effort: • The Patientory Blockchain - which is intended to be open source. • The Patientory Client Interface(s) - which are closed source.  • Currently, both efforts are closed source. However, it is our goal and intent to open source the blockchain portion of the technology when we believe we have made sufficient progress.  *What are the details related to the FDA submission and the background history?* • Our FDA submission was premature. After beginning the process of submission, we realized that the schema submitted would not be sufficient to move the approval process forward. To conserve capital and time, we withdrew our application. Subsequent internal audits of our roadmap led us to the conclusion that pursuing the FDA in the near term was not the best use of our time. As a result, we reduced the scope of our product release schedule to focus on items that allowed us to not only deliver against the vision articulated in our white paper but also give us the most significant impact. As we continue to make progress, our goal is to revisit the Machine Learning Technology initially intended for FDA submission. This scope reduction and reprioritization of effort are reflected in the latest release of our product roadmap found here - patientory.com/roadmap or github.com/patientory.  *What are the details about Hyperledger framework?* • Blockchain is still a new technology and continually evolving. As an organization, we work very hard to keep a pulse on the space and the technologies developing within it. We are currently a general member and vendor partner of the HyperLedger Consortium. The membership/partnership gives us an opportunity to see first hand how the technology is developing and to build integrations between Patientory and Hyperledger where appropriate.  *Is Patientory HIPAA compliant?* • All healthcare/medical record technology in the U.S. that deals with private healthcare information is required to comply with HIPAA regulations. In addition to our existing efforts, we will continue to consult experienced HIPAA compliance professionals and experts as we develop our technology and market presence in the U.S.  *When will the pilot program begin?* • The pilot program will start once Patientory Core is complete. A private alpha testnet will proceed pilot programs. The pilot phase will give us an opportunity to iterate on core features and functions as we test them with our partners.   [11:41] *Part 2*  *Please explain how the $PTOY token works with the app.* • The current utility scope of $PTOY is as fuel for the network.  *Does Patientory envision rewarding cryptocurrency for American and or Latin American's that improve their health by using this system?* • We believe the proper alignment of incentives is essential to the Patientory ecosystem. As we continue to build out our platform and open it up for contribution, we can see opportunities where a stimulus such as this could exist through Patientory or others who build on the network. At this stage of development, we are not offering this type of incentive.  *Can you customize the dashboard for various organizations?* • Our goal is to provide a system that is both consistent and dynamic. Consistent is the sense of usability, design and user experience. Dynamic in the sense that that usability, design, and expertise will integrate seamlessly with other EMR implementations through customizable dashboards that meet the needs of the organizations and the patients/customers that they serve.  *Do you have potential consumers at this time?* • Our current focus is on healthcare organizations, with consumer adoption close behind. We look forward to engaging the $PTOY Community as early adopters once we get to that point.  *Is Kaiser still an Equity Holder?* • Colorado Permanente Medical Group in conjunction with Boomtown HealthCare Accelerator was an early investor in Patientory, and are affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.  *Where the team located?* • We are in Atlanta, Georgia.  *Are you able to mine $PTOY?* • No, $PTOY is not a PoW token, as such, you cannot mine $PTOY.  *When will there be a $PTOY specific wallet?* • The Patient Portal, listed on our 2017-2018 roadmap under Patientory Core: Part 1 will include a $PTOY Wallet as part of its implementation.",True

I was a hesitant supporter till I read of all the red flags. Then not a supporter at all after reading them  Too many people expect to make 2-3x earnings merely by investing in an ICO. Or even a token that promises to secure your data and identity on the blockchain. We all realize that identity theft is a problem but look at PTOY and Civic.

The reality of dealing with US healthcare laws and regulations have required a lot of rethinking based on pushback from governmental bodies and Drs themselves. The system needs to be able to ensure the privacy of patient data, which goes against the open ledger protocols of most blockchain projects. As such, they need to develop a custom side-chain that can store the data privately - which is no small undertaking. It may all go belly up, but I'm willing to give them more time, given the uphill battle they have on their hands.",True

Team Experience  We, the project founders, have a combined experience of over 100 years working in medical fields not only in the USA, but also in our respective home countries of India, South Korea, and Pakistan. All of us have been affected by online hacking of our patient information and had to resort to older methods of diagnosing and treating when all systems were locked, until millions of dollars in ransom were paid. We want to ensure that we can prevent all security issues that may hinder the opportunity for optimal health care and complete healthcare confidentiality for our patients and for healthcare employees. We also believe that blockchain technology can help increase the efficiency of data transfer and management when dealing with patient information in the clinical setting. We also believe that blockchain technology will help send patient information faster and more securely between primary care doctors and specialists. We also want to protect patient care by using Blockchain technology to track any semblance of malpractice done by healthcare professionals. Blockchain technology allows users to see if any patient data has been tampered with so unethical doctors will be punished for their malpractice without the need for the accused to spend thousands of dollars on legal bills. Lastly, one of our goals is to make it easier for each patient to maintain their healthcare records in a safe and easily accessible manner. Our mission goal is for the complete security of all aspects of healthcare.  Team Page   What currencies do you accept?  The crowdsale platform is designed to accept BTC and ETH.  What if I don't have BTC or ETH?  You need to have either BTC or ETH to take part in the crowdsale. If you have other cryptocurrencies you can use Shapeshift to change them to ETH.  To change FIAT currency into ETH there are a number of exchange platforms you can use to get ETH such as Kraken, Bitfinex and Coinable but please ensure that you send your ETH to a secure wallet like MyEtherWallet before taking part in the crowdsale. Do not send tokens from an exchange as you may risk losing your tokens.  Can I join the crowdsale without an Ethereum address?  No, because you need it to receive your tokens. If you don’t have one, you can create one using MyEtherWallet or any other secured wallet. It is important to make sure your account is properly backed up.

First of all my advice to you don't listen to the majority of people who looking for fast profits they are invested in many coins and don't focussing on one thing so they actually only can give a feedback on how everything looks from the surface and we all know currently it looks not good and so their feedback.   Chinchetas [22:15] Let me begin:  The Atlanta team includes Chrissa, Anita, Garnie and Randy who seem to not know much about the current technical issues because they are actually not the devs behind the scenes. Chrissa's job is building connections, partnerships, presenting on conferences etc, Anita is the designer, Garnie and Randy are brand new team members and I think Randy is the important guy who will collect all information from the devs, updating the roadmap and share all information with us soon. As by November they want to start to be transparent with us. So let us give Randy a little time to collect all information. And again Randy and Garnie joined the team newly. Why should they if Patientory would be ""naked""? Use your brain, panic boys.   [22:16] Anita Evans is the Designer and here you find some previous projects where she was involved in: https://www.behance.net/aceux Patientory is the only project where she is fully active since July stated on her website here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8xu_VlGZYOxZlhyTEdDVDlldms/view  Now I come to the devs behind the scenes who the majority probably never heard about from that these people are involved in patientory, because chrissa mentioned them only casually in a comment so u must have been active here on slack to know that: Ankur Maheshwari: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankur-maheshwari-9ab2a215/ Here you see him helping people answering questions about blockchain: https://www.quora.com/profile/Ankur-Maheshwari-2 Vishal Maheshwari: https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishalmaheshwari87/?locale=de_DE Sumit R. https://www.linkedin.com/in/sumit-r-ba0481142/?locale=de_DE These 3 come from Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India and possibly work very close together. Ankur and Vishal are part of Techracers: http://www.techracers.com/blockchain-application-development   [22:16] Then I found these two but i am unsure if they are the right profiles. Chrissa wrote ""Tanjus V"" instead Tanju V. but maybe she made a typo because I cant find anyone with the name Tanjus V Tanju Vonal: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanju-vonal-16049157/ Ranita Saha: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ranita-saha-09981246/  [22:16] And then last but not least Michael Beer from US, Indiana he has a own software company specialized on Software Development, Android Application Development, IOS Application Development, Research & Development, Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, IoT, Business Strategy, Product Strategy, HIPAA Compliant Hosting, GPS, Healthcare Software und Education Software His website: http://www.m360degrees.com/ He was one of the people involved in writing the whitepaper. He is part of the team since beginning. Do you think he does nothing all the time? m360degrees.com A Trusted Software Company- M360Degrees doesn't just develop software, we compose, orchestrate and perform modern art masterpieces.   [22:17] Put the puzzles together. They are building something big in the background. The majority of investors doesn't know that, they simply don't research those things because they want see fast cashhhh. The non belivers will jump back in sooner or later and unfortunately many of them will be able to buy cheaper than me. not fair lol   [22:17] About our CEO Chrissa: For me she acts like a big boss who shows herself rarely and doesn't feel in need to interact with the community, like a Mark Zuckerberg who doesnt give support for Facebook questions lol. But in the eyes of investors this is completely wrong, chrissa. You really should interact with us because we as investors put our money in your vision and you should care about our wellbeing. I bet that many people couldn't sleep well in the past days as the price dropped day by day and they always have a picture of their investment in front of their eyes. if they are hypothetical in loss and seeing the price dropping more they getting crazy and it feels like a torture. You should be more empathetic. Maybe it's because of the many negative people who send hate comments, racist comments or whatever since the pre-sale, but it's wrong to punish all people then with silence.   [22:17] And again the very important info regarding the dev team which chrissa wrote as a COMMENT under a furious question and not even shared with #general proves me that she either want keep secret as much as possible or just don't care to communicate with the whole community.   [22:17] But as we noticed positively in one of the last announcements: They stated they want change the communication radically by November. (why nov. and not asap? because i think randy must become familiar with everything so let us give him the time that he needs.)   [22:17] About the FDA subject: I read almost each single comment here on slack after I am invested when the price was 11k satoshi. For me the situation is clear it was not a lie and it all based on miscommunication. It seems to me that chrissa also didn't communicate much enough with the community managers. She gave them information and they shall give them forward to us. Thileepan made clear that an app was submitted to FDA this was not a lie because as chrissa stated the fda application was rescinded later. The new community manager Filip did not know about that and that's why he stated here on slack that what Thileepan wrote was wrong and shouldn't happened. But the interaction of Filip in slack based on his own knowledge/opinion. I knew Filip even before he and his girlfried became community manager, we chatted daily via private messages here on slack. He was a normal investor like you and me and a part of the community. Then he became community manager and he just got the information from chrissa to announce that the FDA application is not submitted. chrissa should have make clear to him that the app was rescinded but she didn't she only let him know the current situation the fact and that was the big big communication mistake which resulted in catastrophe and rumours so that even Filip plus his Gf quitted the job because the hate comments were too much for them.   [22:17] About CTO left the team: Many of us know Jesse Brown left the team after 3 months and changed to another project named ""vezt"". And you know what he also left vezt after 2 months. (he is not listed in the team anymore: https://vezt.co/#about ) (editado)   [22:18] Oh my god he left. Does it mean he did nothing? Of course not! Check his Linkedin profile then you will find out what he did for Patientory. About the other guy who was Chief Software Architect, Rob Campbell has a own company named Med CyberSecurity and offers his service here: https://www.medcybersecurity.com/services.html . Probably same as Jesse he did his job and went to the next project. (editado)   [22:18] So ladies and gentlemen now ask yourself if u believe they are working behind the scenes or not.  my 2 cents cheers ps: hodl pps: remembering mark cuban answered to the question where he wants to invest next with ""AI, machine learning, medical apps"" at venture atlanta...just saying",True

However, what happened here should be a huge flag about how risky it is to deal with patientory for now.  Few points :  - About those who say that they at least have been transparent about the fact they lied, we could argue that whatever can be said, they lied, it's a fact and admitted it. After what, the question is why did they end saying it ? Was it because they really wanted to get back to some transparency at some point or was it because they hadn't much choice than this ? Many people were waiting for FDA approval news and they couldn't escape the social pressure for it.  - Maybe there really is some production and development, however we have no evidence of this as the project is not, and apparently can not be, open-source. What should we relay on then ? Screenshots ? Could be photoshopped. Live video ? Could be PoC mocking up behaviors of the app and with no real background processing.  - Patientory might be huge player in some years if they REALLY achieve their roadmap, but for now it's just a small start-up with many big players around. As they lied, if they're really leggit they'll have to accept that they will need a colossal amount of energy, faith, time and results, to restore the faith of their token holders.  - On the slack and here i see people blaming other people for FUD. As i don't like FUD, only company can be blamed right now for the FUD going around. How can we be confident when we got lied at, and when communication has been so poor lately about that. Dont blame users and investors, this is at some point the price to pay for lying and you won't get anything else that more FUD at blaming people expressing this FUD. The only way to kill it is to get forward in the project and show that it's reliable and concrete.   As for me, i've sold most of my positions of the token. Luckily i haven't lost money on this but feel pain for those who invested lately and bought the tokens at the price peak. I'll get back in when the company will have been able to provide some seriousness, delivered what they commited to deliver, even if it means for me to buy back those tokens at a higher price.

Problem is they announced on something that factually was a lie, which is kind of different. If PTOY had announced to the community since they knew that there would be some delay, it would have been a whole different topic. Community would have asked why but pressure wouldn't have be as rude and many people would have kept trust and faith into the project.  Aside of this, an AMA were announced, then canceled. The only reason given by the CEO for that was due to the overwhelming ambient, blaming by the FUDDERs. I can understand they are under pressure, but can't blame people for FUD. The way they acted provoked FUD, it didn't come from all of sudden from people.  When publishing the admittance of the lie they knew that people would ask questions, would need answer and i guess that at some point it makes sense that if it has to happen you usually prepare to give answers as fast as possible. Most questions aren't THAT difficult to answer : where really is standing the project. If the team is quite commited and clear onto their ongoing development, with a clear communication, CMs would have probably been able to give an answer to that.  Instead of that you've got people dismissing themselves from the project and....not much more.  So here we have : a lie, an AMA canceled, and investors still without any answer. How can you expect it goes otherwise than FUD growing ?    EDIT & P.S : i'd like to clarify here that when talking about FUD i'm pointing out a real Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt of members of the community, not Hoaxing , which is a quite different matter. I wanted to be clear on the use of the term due to the fact that most of the time FUD is misused to some hoaxing conception.",True

I was one of Patientory's biggest advocates. I know there has been FUD for months because I was trying my best to answer questions on behalf of the company since I believe there are growing pains with many start-ups. In fact last month I posted here about how great the company's future appeared based on the information I had at that time. Recently I found myself debating with the FUDsters over questions which I really had no factual answers to due to the lack of company provided information.  I have traded stocks for years and know all about the FDA application submission process. I also know after 2 weeks there is a 99% chance the listing of the application submission will be seen on the FDA website. You can even find Apple's application submission information there. When I could not find anything about Patientory I started begging the Telegram mods for answers as to why or what name they may have applied under. Nothing was granted to me (I know, I am just a contributor so why should they answer to me  A few weeks ago there was some posted hearsay about an error in the application submission. I needed to know what was going on as I am a very large pre-sale contributor. The mods were not answering so I went off on a tangent about the need for a good marketing team and transparency. The company replied a few days later with mock-ups of the application they submitted to the FDA. The application looked pretty bad but at least it was something. That kept me satisfied for another couple of weeks since they even updated the roadmap to show the application was submitted to the FDA.  The FDA application submission for software is a new process for the US govt. It is not required until late 2018 but for now it helps companies get ahead of the game. I could not understand why Patientory would not at least show us what we were investing in first before submitting to the FDA. The general answer seemed to be because they were not open-source. After thinking back on that it truly does not make any sense not to be open-source in a decentralized system like Crypto. They should have gone the regular route but I later found they previously did and found no success. They had an app created back in 2015 - I finally got smart and used Google to research them.  The first thing people say is ""HIPAA"". OK well then that makes it limited to the US standards only which could limit interest from other countries. I say design a system that is open source (decentralized) but still protects medical information. I even provided several possibilities on the Telegram chat how to make it work and still be within the bounds of HIPAA protocol. No response from Patientory.  Now to the present - unfortunately the information we received is what I suspected at the beginning, no application was submitted to the FDA. They could have easily been spun the situation to blame a past employee or a simple error but there was no effort on the company's part as they watched the token price plummet. I can count on NO fingers how many times a company stayed in business after a fiasco like this without any news to investors. It appears there were attempts at covering up mistakes [lies] by putting out 'feelers' in the community - what I mean, is they give some unofficial 3rd party provided information first to see how the news is taken. If bad then they came up with something else.  Patientory should have immediately canceled any conferences until they got the Developers straight. It is my fault alone for contributing, I should have paid more respect to the response made to the negative Reddit poster during the ICO - No facts were responded just a rebuttal similar to what you would hear in a middle school argument. Patientory fails to see that the criticism is constructive. If the community did not care then we would not respond - Think about it this way, We invest in Bitcoin but I assume the majority aren't posting to the BTC community about questions they want answered or suggestions. We cared enough to offer our time to Patientory but they apparently were uninterested. This is not an established company in its current form so it is vital to respect the VCs (contributors - all of them).  I do not see this token above a few hundred sats in 6 months. Competitors will be all over this model and soon flood the market as they learn what not to do from Patientory. A successful competitor will be a good steward of the contributors' funding. I think it was a total embarrassment when they continued spending money for the last conference knowing they had no application and the road map was cloudy. What would they have done if Mark Cuban happened to approach and show interest? Would he say the idea is fine or would he want to see something tangible?!? They could not offer him anything so why risk looking foolish to others unless there was no intention of picking up anything but an all-expenses paid trip? Of course, that is a light embarrassment compared to the pictures they posted of the slides dated September 2017 during an October 2017 event. They even still have the photo posted to their Twitter page!  I do not wish anyone to lose here. When I completely sell out I am done with Patientory for good. My ultimate goal here is to do my part to tell everyone how important it is for us to level the playing field for every person around the world and keep our wealth. In the current world economic system, we lose wealth every second with the devaluation of our fiat and the inflation that 'does not exist'. We need crypto to work! There are plenty of places for unscrupulous people to go to steal wealth but in crypto they are only stealing from their own near future. Once North Korea is taken care of there will be a central bank in every single major country in the world. This provides the means for one world-wide currency for all but will still be based on fiat so we can all be affected together at once. Yes, there will be promises of blockchain use once the new system gets organized but it will never materialize because it would only serve those outside of today's banking system.  There are plenty of good companies out there but many depend on the current philosophy of the team regarding crypto. I hope everyone is successful in their investing and I will do my best not to be a jerk when I slowly sell of the rest of my tokens over the next month.",True

Seems crazy to me to hold on to this as it seems like a guaranteed lo$$. Patientory's next excuse will be that the FDA decided not to approve and they have to go back to the drawing board. Of course they will need in 6 months because they will ""not want to resubmit a substandard application"".  I used to think, ""How can they lose?"" Just put out an app and hopefully fate rewards well. Now I think, ""No way this can win"", their inexperience will cost them greatly. More delays while competition passes them and floods the market. I believe by next summer there will be no less than 20 health-record related companies. Just because they were first does not make them the defacto winner. They cannot even keep a team together (if they even still have one as it changes week to week).  My next post will be after more pertinent news is released. Even if they surprise, I will never touch Patientory again.  Good luck with your other tokens. After looking at the volume charts I think I can speed up my sale by selling bigger blocks off around 9am each day which should not disrupt the fragile market.

Again, FDA approval would not be needed to test the application during the pilots with hospitals, but we may decide to wait for it so that also the machine learning part is tested and we can commercialize the solution immediately after the pilots.  We aimed to wait for new key team members to join us, review and update the roadmap and have a new communication strategy by November, however we notice the immediate need to clear all the concerns and risk factors that affect PTOY.  Our community is our biggest asset and my team and I apologize for not being fully transparent the past couple of weeks.  We make it our duty to be open and transparent with you in the future.  Randy Mitchell, our new Lead Technical Product Manager is working hard reviewing and updating the roadmap with all the milestones both completed and yet to be completed. We will publish it followed by AMA session with me and other team members. Also in future we will be transparent on the progress, so everyone can see were we are and what are our short-mid-and long term goals.  Regards, Chrissa McFarlane and the Patientory team  ----- Nothing new in crypto world, pretty standard that some projects delays their releases, so just need to be patience while other people (gen weak hands who look for quick profits) sell and we can buy cheaper",True

Here are my thoughts.  I don't know who this ""Dr"" is but I can tell you he has the tech savvy of a rock when it comes to healthcare tech and the industry. I seriously doubt he works in healthcare at all. My name is Zachary Bauer and I have been in development since 1999.  I have developed healthcare software, mobile and web applications for numerous companies including Essence Healthcare in St. Louis, MO and Med Assets in Dallas, Texas before they were acquired by Visient. Let me just address some of his concerns here.  (1) Electronic Health Record (EHR) companies are clawing and screaming for new ways to protect patient data. Instead of thinking they will be resistant to blockchain technology, they're probably doing high level investigations into its use. Chances are that one of these companies may purchase PTOY and whatever developed technology they have. Healthcare companies themselves are HUNGRY for secure ways to transfer patient data. Every year, hospitals and healthcare companies are paying out MILLIONS of dollars in HIPAA fines for breached patient data. As a developer, this one issue was the biggest concern in any project. AVOID THE FINES BY PROTECTING THE DATA. As understanding of blockchain technology grows, EHR companies and patient data experts are going to run to this in hope of securing data and stopping the flow of fines their companies have to pay every year for not being up to date and insecurely storing data.  (2)Blockchain tech is secure. By its very nature it prevents data leaking and fraudulent data from entering in. Industry regulations and compliance measures will be thrown out the window because they will no longer be needed. Or they can be rewritten for the blockchain. This point is just really a non-starter.  Compliance measures for this industry are literally being rewritten on a weekly basis as it is now. Nothing new.  (3)Potential Implementation Cost? Heck dude, this is why I think ""Dr. Blockhead"" doesn't know anything. Teenagers are creating coins and launching ICO's from their parents basements. I really don't see a lot of cost being associated with training office personnel or staff on this process.  It's all back end. They download a program. Enter in their keys for access and they are off and running.  What implementation costs is ""dr blockhead"" assuming will be needed?  (4)Technical challenges? I'm not aware of any MIT case study.  Maybe someone can post a link to that here. But I don't see a lot of challenges other than familiarity with regulators on the abilities of blockchain tech. Biggest hurdles are going to be Hipaa. Will it be a universal blockchain that the whole of healthcare uses approved by Hipaa?  Or will EHR companies use there own with communication taking place between multiple chain environments? Who knows but these decisions can be decided by the bureaucrats. The important thing to remember is that the technology being developed here is solid. PTOY is one of the first in the market and its good to be on board early as an investor.  (5)The good ""Dr"" is correct that healthcare companies are very RISK averse.  This is why they are so HUNGRY for alternatives.  They are scared to death of fines resulting from patient data leaks. Many of these companies are staffed and funded by people on the cutting edge themselves and will be VERY EXCITED to hear about a technology that can absolutely secure patient data and reduce fines and prevent fraud.  STAFF ISSUES As for the claims about Patientory and their staff?  I have no idea. But I know the political winds in the medical industry many times lean left and a minority women led company is a jackpot when needed to deal with bureaucrats and the politically correct bozos in government agencies like HIPAA.  The CEO of PTOY is black and a woman. That is gold.  Time will tell but its good to be in early on this industry change, because a change is coming.  Everyone in big industries in this country is exploring blockchain technology. I just talked to a Walmart executive this week (I live in Northwest Arkansas) and they are R&Ding blockchain tech big time. Blockchain technology is coming to all major industries and that includes healthcare. The healthcare companies will pay big bucks to implement a technology that will save it from hefty fines in the future.  Any company that is developing blockchain use for the medical industry is a win in my book. I'm keeping an eye on all of them and PTOY is a big one.  If anyone else has thoughts on Dr. Blockhead's comments, I'd love to hear them especially if you have worked in the industry.      ",True

In the US it is currently a nightmare to try to get medical records from facility to another. Many places will just make you redo a lo of labs and physical already performed in another facility simply because its easier and faster for them to obtain than to request. The insurance company eventually gets billed twice for the same diagnostic, the patient ends up paying the same copay twice as well and it amounts to a waste of time and money. Now imagine that you were seeing several doctors because you had a severe condition and wanted to get multiple opinions for treatment?  Even though the hospitals now have switched to EMR, the EMR of each facility is completed independent form the facility next door, meaning again that the doctor or care team in a different facility can't possibly know what treatments, medications or allergies you may have.

As someone whose family members have suffered from the medical communities failure to find a common-sense way to make our medical records seamlessly available, I am a strong advocate of change in this arena.  If PTOY is the answer, I'd like its leaders to refute the claims made by the clinician dr_blockchain on that reddit.  Here is a copy/paste:  Background: Recently I attended a CIO roundtable where we had participants from most midwest and east coast health systems + 1 national health system. One of the topics discussed was blockchain. We reached a consensus that for the following reasons blockchain solutions will not be deployed at scale in the US within the foreseeable future: (1) Incumbent major EHR companies and their strongholds in health systems' IT departments (2) Industry regulations and lack of guidelines/compliance measures (3) Potential implementation costs (4) Technical challenges vis-a-vis blockchain in medical record management that are yet to be resolved! See the MIT case study! (5) Healthcare systems are the most risk averse corporations you can find - cultural challenges A couple major red flags about patientory(PTOY): 1-Their team is severely underequipped to handle what they claim. They lack not only the technical expertise but also the management capabilities to build meaningful senior executive relationships 2-They are outrageously overstating their ""partnerships"". One of the roundtable attendants knows Rick Daniels and knows for a fact that KP (Kaiser) is not pursuing any blockchain solutions at scale. Calling out Michael Rubin (the Director of Communications for Patientory) - Patientory's claims of partnering with Kaiser bordering on fraud. I strongly recommend that you take Kaiser's logo off your website. You are misleading token holders for monetary gain. PTOY's partnership with Kaiser is probably the pet project of a mid-level manager (director of X at a regional market) at most. Their other partnerships are basically incubators that provided them early funding to test out ideas. 3-Their ""foundation""...Does anyone seriously think that a CIO would pay up $250K to become the member of an obscure entity that has no industry relevance?

Does Patientory need to link up with Siacoin or Storj to work together? I'm not familiar with decentralized storage. Blockchain is not very efficient when it comes to large files.  Patientory hasn't addressed this problem yet and if anyone who understands blockchain can explain it to me, that would be great.  Quote from: amir24 on September 02, 2017, 09:27:06 PM Dev please answer question: how do you store big data on chain? this not possible. community must know if project not possible.  In white paper I see:  ""The limitation of the blockchain to host private information may be overcome through data obfuscation, such as encryption, but in the event that the decryption key is ever leaked, there is no way to remove the sensitive data itself from the blockchain""  ""we implement a mechanism for the persistent storage of sensitive information through the use a private implementation of an Ethereum based blockchain""  but then I see:  ""The HIPAA compliant storage facility hosts the actual data""...what is HIPAA compliant storage facility and who owns the hardware? who pays for the data storage?  ""Patients are given an allotted amount of space to store information for free on the Patientory network"". how you give storage for free? what you mean store on the network?  So far I read white paper many times and I think it still no make sense.   Yes. You see I ask same question long time already and no answer. Here only talk about coin pump and make money but no talk about fundamental technical idea. White paper made hard to read on purpose. If you try read it no make sense. Just big word to sound smart.  Anybody will answer technical question on project?? So far I only see CTO leaving project. Michael Rubin leaving project. Project take ICO money to sponsor conferences...this not make project good.

Have any businesses been signed up yet to make use of it when ready?  Thanks for all of your questions!  • Yes, we have several international health systems in the pipeline.  • As for marketing, it must be said that we received extensive coverage from news outlets around the globe at the time of our crowdsale last month. Once the notoriety from the crowdsale started to fade, however, we decided to enter a semi-quiet mode so we can keep our focus primarily on finishing development and fulfilling the product rollout. That means marketing is primarily being done through events and appearances by our CEO. Once we begin to execute our product rollout in the Fall, you'll see a much larger marketing push.  • We have 8 pilots in the pipeline for extensive validation and proof of concept testing. We've been partnered since January 2016 with Colorado Permanente Medical Group as part of the inaugural class of the Boomtown Health-Tech Accelerator in Boulder.  They've already provided extensive assistance to us, including but not limited to the ability to conduct 2000+ customer validation interviews. (FYI, Colorado Permanente Medical Group is part of the Kaiser Permanente consortium and quite a large medical group: 1,100 physicians that provide care for 623,000 Kaiser Permanente members.)  • Please see a copy of our roadmap detailed below.

How can you expect to succeed, they ask, when others have already failed? There are four ways to answer this question:  1. The timing is right. For healthcare organizations, the situation is growing increasingly fraught. Ransomware like WannaCry are no longer relegated to the relative obscurity of info security blogs. Instead, news about ransomware is loudly broadcasted on mainstream global news outlets like CNN and the BBC.  2. The technology is finally mature. Instead of having one central administrator act as a gatekeeper to data, blockchain deploys one shared ledger spread across a network of synchronized, replicated databases visible to anyone with the authorized access. It is virtually impossible for a cyber criminal to hack one block in the chain without simultaneously hacking every other block in the chain’s chronology. This makes blockchain incredibly appealing to not only store a patient’s entire health history, but determine who should have access to it.  3. We take a different approach. We have deliberately chosen a path that does not require healthcare IT executives to impose a new solution or dispose of their legacy capital investments. Instead, our system is a bridge that seamlessly integrates with existing EMR systems such as Meditech, EPIC, Allscripts, and Cerner. In addition, we leverage smarter technologies such as machine learning and AI to help provide better care treatment plans, which promote better health outcomes.  4. Patients are demanding to own their own data. From Fitbits to fitness apps, a plethora of products have ushered in the age of the quantified self. Patients – both healthy and ill – are accustomed to owning their health data and are now demanding healthcare organizations unlock their silos. Our app lets patients create a universal profile to keep track of their entire health history. The will provide an easy and hassle free way of tracking doctor visits, medical bills, personal medical information, insurance, immunizations and pharmacy medications. All of this information can then be shared with other providers, labs and diagnostic services.  Read the full story: http://bit.ly/globalhealthcareindustry",True

Patientory is a patient-centered enterprise solution designed to eliminate many of these pain points.  Patientory uses blockchain technologies to ensure end-to-end encryption while adhering to region-specific regulatory guidelines and compliance requirements.

I understand PTOY was a way of accumulate capital for Patientory and Patientory may have a bright future ahead as well.  My question is what is PTOY for an investor?  To make it clear, let's take Ripple as an example.  Financial institutions may buy Ripple from market if they are interested to integrate with Ripple.  This increases demand for XRP.  Investors/Traders who believe this theory will buy Ripple and if everything comes true, value of Ripple increases and investors take profit.  Many cryptos are there with same logic (creates demand for their tokens).  I did not see such scope in PTOY for a trader/investor.    What is the benefit in buying PTOY?

One thing we have tried to do to differentiate ourselves is in how we communicate.  Second, that's a great example using Ripple. PTOY tokens act in a similar manner for Patientory's contributors and purchasers. The key to remember is that Patientory acts a broker to healthcare organizations in setting up nodes on the Patientory blockchain network, which in turn drives token transactions and volume. More transactions and more volume are what create value for PTOY token holders.  Unfortunately, too many folks equate tokens (not just PTOY) with stock. This is not stock. When you buy PTOY, you're not buying equity. There are no shares, shareholders, and we do not plan to ""buy back"" PTOY along the lines of some have suggested.  We plan to update our website in the coming quarter with more educational content about PTOY and how it will be used in the Patientory network. In the meantime, we encourage you to check out the white paper, which has more details on how PTOY will be used. http://bit.ly/patientorywhitepaper  At your service, Michael",True

So, especially if you are planning on keeping your coins for the long run, I would highly recommend using MEW and saving your keystore file on a USB offline if you don't have a hardware wallet such as a Nano S or a Trezor, and writing down your private key on paper and not on your phone/computer and storing all of that safely somewhere. An added benefit of MEW is that you won't ever need to log in to check your account, just simply check it on etherscan.io",True

The potential of blockchain and similar technologies for this industry is incredible and Patientory is an interesting project.  It's not only the secure transfer of patient data between hospitals but also and in particular the conduct of clinical trials where pharma companies, Clinical Research Organisations, Drug Suppllier, investigators and patients are involved.  A huge part of the costs of a clinical trial are linked to the cumbersome and highly regulated interaction between those parties. Blockchains can help to reduce fraud, product counterfeiting, exchange of patient consent forms blinding of patients and other contractual relarionship with the parties, by reduced costs and increased speed.  There are a couple of proof of concept papers out there which are sounding quite promising:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5357027/  https://f1000research.com/articles/6-66/v1  https://www.buildingbetterhealthcare.co.uk/news/article_page/Doctors_use_Bitcoin_to_improve_transparency_in_clinical_trial_research/118028  https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/ibm-watson-health-and-fda-to-collaborate-on-blockchain-project-1484148297/  A said this industry is highly regultated and it will take time to resolve technical and regulatory obstacles of different bodies like the FDA or EMA, so we are talking about years.  In order to save time I would like to the see a crypto currency specially focussing on that topic as it could be a real change of the game and there's a lot of money in the healthcare business :-)  A group of blockchain IT experts together with some experts of the Clinical industry and their different sub areas could setup a nice promising project which could be a revolutionary step forward.

The 70 million PTOY sold from May 31–June 3 will be released immediately for exchange by the public.  Patientory founder and CEO Chrissa McFarlane said:    CoinFabrik, a respected developer of smart contracts and blockchain applications, began the audit of the smart contracts written by token sale specialists TokenMarket on June 3. The audit did not find any issues with the PTOY token. CoinFabrik suggested some further attack mitigation methods that Patientory will now implement.  Ultimately, Patientory sold 70,000,000 PTOY tokens ($7.2 million USD) in a successful crowd sale driven by 1728 contributors. The audit proved all smart contracts were developed to withstand any breaches, and at no time was the security of the crowdsale under serious threat.  Please note: tokens from the bounties (including The Viral Exchange) will be available by the end of day Saturday, June 17.  • Click here to view the full results of the audit: http://bit.ly/ptoyaudit • Click here for more details on the exchanges: http://bit.ly/ptoyexchangeupdate",True

However like all business it will need good execution. Looks like they have a diverse group of advisors. One area of concerns I have is how they plan to integrate PTOY to their service. I don't  understand why there is a need for users to buy PTOY when they can pay in cash directly. Are they plan to convert the cash and distribute the dividends to all PTOY holders. So as their business generate more money PTOY will increase in value like how stocks work. Maybe someone can help me shed some lights. Thanks in advance.,True

Putting records on a blockchain is not something you will sell to hospitals in the next 10 years and if you prove me wrong then good for you but I just don't see that coming to pass in this world.

Until recently there has been no possibility to trade such tokens (no network – deposit/withdrawl doesn’t work). But Liqui team has found a solution: when a trader/investor participates in ICO indirectly but through our platform (all transaction IDs are of course provided to developers’ wallets) – we can credited the balance of the relevant coin to them once the crowdsale is over!  Therefore, trading begins hours after ICO and there’s no need to wait until coin developers release the network (which often takes months). Or you can just keep the tokens on the balance (like it happens in any ICO) and once the network has been released – witdraw them. When the network is ready – IOU flag disappears from the relevant pair and then this pair functions as an ordinary coin.",True

That's a benefit to the medical providers who are subscribed to the service. In addition, the Patientory app will allow patients to create an individual profile. On this profile, they will be able to store their medical information on a secure, HIPAA-compliant blockchain platform. Then they can connect with care providers as well as other patients who have similar health issues or concerns. Anyone who's had the ... ahem ... ""pleasure"" of juggling a care team of multiple doctors and specialists spread inside and outside different hospitals and offices will know how huge of a benefit this is.

After contacting HiTBTC, we can confirm the following:  HitBTC purchased PTOY tokens during the May 2017 pre-sale. HitBTC has established a trading instrument on its platform (PTOY/BTC), supplying tokens from its own previously purchased stake. With the Patientory crowd sale still in progress, PTOY tokens are still currently locked in our smart contract. The PTOY tokens being traded on HitBTC are IOUs. PTOY tokens are not available for withdrawal until the official release. At that time, HitBTC will activate its PTOY trading instrument in a standard token listing. All questions about this trading instrument should be directed to HitBTC. We have contacted ICObazaar, but have not received confirmation yet that they have implemented a similar trading instrument.  Please note that the only official updates about exchanges will come from Patientory. We are conducting due diligence with several exchanges at the present time, and we will have an announcement when everything is finalized.

Our security and IT teams are working diligently to address the problem, and the website will be up as soon as possible.  In the meantime, we have a backup site available. If you would like to invest now, please go to our backup crowd sale page at https://tokenmarket.net/crowdsale/patientory/begin_investment?currency=ETH  _Please remember to be security conscious during the sale!_  Important Things to Always Keep in Mind 1. The crowd sale will only take place at alternate address for now: https://tokenmarket.net/crowdsale/patientory/begin_investment?currency=ETH 2. The only location that will be issuing addresses is directly through our web application. 3. Do not trust any wallet addresses posted publicly. 4. Beware of possible phishing attempts. If you are ever unsure, please manually navigate directly to https://patientory.com/token-sale. 5. Please be mindful of who you contact during the token sale. If you have any questions, please call us at (678) 951-9007 or email us at info@patientory.com.  Slack and Telegram will be closed at launch. We are taking this action in the hope we can prevent some of the fraud and misinformation campaigns that have plauged other recent crowd sales. We will re-open Slack and Telegram on June 1 at 9.00 PDT.  Other than that, let's all have a great crowd sale!

Yes, Patientory is a blockchain-based distributed electronic medical record storage computing platform. Think of us a network/bridge that connects with siloed, centralized EMR systems (e.g., Cerner, EPIC, Allscripts, Meditech)  • The biggest advantage for doctors and healthcare organizations is the employment of blockchain to help the healthcare ecosystem mitigate damaging data breaches. EHRs are vulnerable to hacks. By it's very decentralized nature, blockchain isn't. It's a more secure, permanent record of online information exchange and can't be hacked.  • This isn't just idle conjecture or marketing puffery, either. WannaCry was proof of that. Cyber attacks like it are projected to cost hospitals $305 billion by 2021.  • Doctors (and their healthcare organizations) use Patientory to get the patient’s complete and up-to-date medical history. They use PTOY tokens to secure private health information, rent computing power, servers and data centers. In addition, smart contracts can be executed in relation to the patient care payment cycle.  One more thing ... It's not just the medical providers who will benefit. The Patientory app will allow patients to create an individual profile. On this profile, they will be able to store their medical information on a secure, HIPAA-compliant blockchain platform. Then they can connect with care providers as well as other patients who have similar health issues or concerns. Any patient (or doctor) who has had to juggle a care team of multiple doctors and specialists spread inside and outside different hospitals and offices will know how huge of a benefit this is.

This led to a collaborative exchange with Permanente Medical Group, part of the Kaiser Permanente consortium. In case you're unfamiliar with Kaiser Permanente, they are one of the largest not-for-profit health plans in the U.S. serving 11.3 million members across a chain of 38 hospitals.  Patientory is also part of the Startup Health portfolio.  With over 2,000-customer validation interviews with the aid of Kaiser Permanente and Startup Health, this has given us the ability to continue to learn, build and scale our product on a global level. We’re on track to provide superb value to our users.  And now as of May 2017, we have 8 pilots in the pipeline.  All of this is in our Roadmap, which you can find online. It's also in the Executive Summary PDF I sent you earlier via email.  -------------------  As for regulation, the biggest obstacle to most healthcare innovation is HIPAA. However, that has not proven to be any challenge for us because Patientory’s use of blockchain follows HIPAA Security Rules, including but not lmited to: Administrative Safeguards – Assignment of a HIPAA security compliance team. Physical Safeguards – Protection of electronic systems, equipment and data. Technical Safeguards – Authentication & encryption used to control data access.  This ensures covered entities maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for protecting Electronic Protected Health Information (e-PHI), with 0 health breaches. [/list]  -------------------  You said it best: change doesn't come easy. What we've got going for us is that Patientory is so much more than just a flashy demo and hope.

Patients are getting more acquainted with this patientory concept. Supposedly, a lot of patients are old people who are not interested in tokens or don't have access to the token market.  My question is how these patients can buy your tokens? There will be installed automates for exchange dollars to tokens in hospitals? or there will be any other special service for this group of people but not internet exchanges like poloniex? or maybe medicine staff will be instructed to help them to buy tokens?  thanks  ",True

Scroll past the sections on the pre-sale and the crowd sale, and you'll find some straightforward questions and answers about the service itself.  As for your question, there are a few answers:  • First, we're much more than a traditional patient database. Patientory is a blockchain-based distributed electronic medical record storage computing platform. Think of us a network/bridge that connects siloed, centralized EMR systems.  • The biggest advantage for doctors and healthcare organizations is the employment of blockchain to help the healthcare ecosystem mitigate damaging data breaches. EHRs are vulnerable to hacks. By it's very nature, blockchain utilizes a more secure, permanent record of online information exchange and can't be hacked. Cyber attacks are projected to cost hospitals $305 billion by 2021. WannaCry was proof that this isn't just idle conjecture. There is a need, and we are going to fill it.  • Doctors (and their healthcare organizations) use Patientory to get the patient’s complete and up-to-date medical history. They use PTOY tokens to secure private health information, rent computing power, servers and data centers. In addition, smart contracts can be executed in relation to the patient care payment cycle.  • One more thing ... It's not just the medical providers who will benefit. The Patientory app will allow patients to create an individual profile. On this profile, they will be able to store their medical information on a secure, HIPAA-compliant blockchain platform. Then they can connect with care providers as well as other patients who have similar health issues or concerns.  Any patient (or doctor) who has had to juggle a care team of multiple doctors and specialists spread inside and outside different hospitals and offices will know how huge of a benefit this is.  Please let me know if you have any further questions. Thanks!  At your service, Michael",True

Pre-sale participants get the ratio at that time. This also makes it fair for participants in the crowdsale.  There have been reports that some investors have experienced difficulties supporting tokens on certain wallets. We want to minimize that risk, so we have standardized the process by accepting ETH. Everyone is on the same playing field. In addition, tokens are distributed immediately via ETH, a better model established in other successful ETH crowdsales. Its benefits include transparency and more investor protection. Unfortunately, such smart contract capabilities are not available in other cryptocurrencies.

There have been reports that some investors have experienced difficulties supporting tokens on certain wallets. We want to minimize that risk, so we have standardized the process by accepting ETH. Everyone is on the same playing field. In addition, tokens are distributed immediately via ETH, a better model established in other successful ETH crowdsales. Its benefits include transparency and more investor protection. Unfortunately, such smart contract capabilities are not available in other cryptocurrencies.

An example is ico  - tokencard and aragon. Many people did not have time to become the initial investors, since the maximum amount was collected within a few minutes. At the same time, transactions did not pass and people who really wanted to become investors could not participate in the projects.  Your project, too, may be of interest to many small investors and may gain more funding than you have declared maximum.   For greater fairness, I suggest that developers provide for an option in the case of collecting the maximum amount of money to provide another 24 hours (or 12 hours, or less...). Determine if if the maximum amount has already been collected, investors can still deposit their shares during these 24, 12 ... hours.  Then, after collecting the entire amount, distribute it to investors.  I think this method will make your project even more attractive and fair and will bring universal respect to investors and devs.   Listen to my proposal I think this will benefit your project.

In the proposed project it is quite possible that there will be 5 to 10 whales and many small shareholders. In this case, the project will not be popular and does not represent a particular interest.

Think of PTOY tokens as the fuel of the Patientory platform. After signing up through our app, a patient is allotted space to store information for free on the Patientory network (a secure, HIPAA-compliant blockchain platform). PTOY will allow the patient to purchase extra storage space from nodes setup in their hospital's system.  Doctors (and their healthcare entities) can use PTOY to secure private health information, rent computing power, servers and data centers through a unique private infrastructure on the Ethereum blockchain. In addition, smart contracts can be executed in relation to the patient care payment cycle.  Ultimately, the aim is to reduce readmissions, make medical records more secure, and reduce overall health IT costs.  We go into full detail in our white paper, which you can download here.",True

PTOY token is the fuel for the Patientory platform. As a patient you are given an allotted amount of space to store your information for free on the Patientory network. PTOY allows you to purchase extra storage space from nodes set up in hospitals systems. This is when you will need to buy the crypo-token PTOY.  Healthcare organizations use PTOY in this instance as well. It is also used in payments once smart contracts are executed with healthcare insurance companies. An overview of how the closed loop system works can be found in our white paper here.,True

The concept is certainly innovative. However as a medical professional, I had some questions:  Why does your project need a blockchain structure as opposed to a centralized database (per HealthVault, Epic, etc)? The product that you showed is obviously a thin client, so are full clients storage nodes? The structure seems akin to projects such as SiaCoin and Storj, but with a medical twist. How does such data (even encrypted) maintain HIPAA compliance across state and possibly national borders? Do you consider your project a HIPAA-compliant cloud? How do you see the storage utilization of your nodes compared to the two above projects? (this gets back to the ""Why blockchain"" question.) Why did you select Ethereum for your blockchain of choice for token issuances? Do you plan to engage the traditional EHR providers such as Epic to facilitate the initial data preload as well as extensions for utilizing your blockchain/database?

Thank you for asking!! Please see answers below:  Why does your project need a blockchain structure as opposed to a centralized database (per HealthVault, Epic, etc)? The product that you showed is obviously a thin client, so are full clients storage nodes? - Centralized databases are currently prone to cyberattacks and they are not interoperable. Blockchain gives us the infrastructure to connect with multiple EMR centralized databases (nodes) ie: Epic, Cerner, etc. for a longitudinal patient record. The structure seems akin to projects such as SiaCoin and Storj, but with a medical twist. How does such data (even encrypted) maintain HIPAA compliance across state and possibly national borders? Do you consider your project a HIPAA-compliant cloud? Since we are run on a private Ethereum blockchain (permissioned blockchain) with encryption we fulfill HIPAA regulatory requirements on a national level. How do you see the storage utilization of your nodes compared to the two above projects? (this gets back to the ""Why blockchain"" question.) Currently, we are working with pilots to securely transfer health information across different centralized database infrastructures. Why did you select Ethereum for your blockchain of choice for token issuances? Ethereum allows us to also execute smart contracts which is a high priority for the insurance industry. Do you plan to engage the traditional EHR providers such as Epic to facilitate the initial data preload as well as extensions for utilizing your blockchain/database? If not, how do you expect to get patient data onto the network? From doctors/nurses? Patients? Our customers are hospitals and healthcare organizations that utilize different EMR (electronic medical record) vendors. We have APIs that currently push and pull data from Epic, Cerner, Allscripts and Meditech.",True

Video : Patientory Pitch at Boomtown Demo Day Linkedin Pulse : Connecting Medical Records Without Compromising on Privacy  Through use of the company’s mobile app, Patientory users create an individual profile. Their medical information is then stored on a secure, HIPAA-compliant blockchain platform, allowing them to connect with care providers as well as other patients who have similar health issues or concerns. This allows patients greater control over their overall health across multiple care teams, both inside and outside of the hospital.   Blog: hacking HIPAA: Blockchain and Healthcare Team: Link  From electronic health information confidentiality to security threats identification to disclosure protection, Patientory’s employment of blockchain technology helps the healthcare ecosystem mitigate damaging data breaches. Unlike electronic health records, which are vulnerable to hacks, blockchain technology is able to utilize a more secure, permanent record of online information exchange.   The team believes in a future of decentralized healthcare infrastructure and market network, where Big Data, HPC, IoT, and AI applications, highly valued data-sets, and computing resources (storage, CPU, GPU etc.) will be monetized on the Blockchain with the highest level of transparency, resiliency, and security.

From the platform smart contracts can be executed in relation to the patient care continuum cycle.  Who uses Patientory and why?  There is a growing demand for healthcare cybersecurity solutions and computing power from the health and scientific community to run large applications and process huge volumes of data. Large volumes of patient health information can be supported which can further be utilized by Artificial Intelligence for accurate patient treatment.  Healthcare Dapps (blockchain-based applications) that need private off-chain computation. High Performance Computing, Big Data, machine learning for care treatment (shorter time-to-diagnosis, reduced administrative costs). Future healthcare distributed applications that will require new form of decentralized infrastructure see Edge/Fog computing, ambient AI, IoT + Big Data, distributed deep learning, parallel stream processing etc...  What is the legal structure of Patientory?  Patientory is a company incorporated in Delaware, United States under the name PATIENTORY, INC. (Company Number, 5921117).  Where is Patientory at the moment?  Headquarters are located in the city of Atlanta, Georgia. Patientory works with advisors located at the prestigious Georgia Institute of Technology.  What about the team experience?  The management team has over 40 years combined experience building and growing healthcare technology companies. They’ve received international published healthcare research and developed platforms for VC backed digital health companies as well a Fintech blockchain company. The team received both national and global market validation and was recently named a Top 11 company Disrupting Healthcare in 2017.

Since September the team has grown to include blockchain developers, PR and marketing specialists, and business developers.  Why is your technology valuable?  For the last 2 years, we completed extensive validation and proof of concept testing. With over 2,000-customer validation interviews with the aid of Kaiser Permanente and Startup Health, this gives us the ability to continue to learn, build and scale our product on a global level, we’re on track to provide superb value to our users.  What is the role of PTOY tokens?  PTY is the native token of the Patientory platform. In exchange of PTOY tokens, users will be able to use the network to rent information storage space, and to execute smart payment contracts.  Why a crowdfund and not traditional funding?  We must distribute the PTOY tokens to create a ‘market network’. We want it to be a project for the public so it is important that distribute our tokens as widely as possible in the interests of you, the public and benefactors.  What currencies do you accept?  The crowdsale platform is designed to accept ETH.  What if I don't have ETH?  You need ETH to take part in the crowdsale. If you have other cryptocurrencies you can use Shapeshift to change them to ETH.  To change FIAT currency into ETH there are a number of exchange platforms you can use to get ETH such as Kraken, Bitfinex and Coinable but please ensure that you send your ETH to a secure wallet like MyEtherWallet before taking part in the crowdsale. Do not send tokens from an exchange as you may risk losing your tokens.  Can I join the crowdsale without an Ethereum address?  No, because you need it to receive your tokens. If you don’t have one, you can create one using MyEtherWallet or any other secured wallet. It is important to make sure your account is properly backed up. Also, note do not send tokens from an exchange as you may risk losing your tokens.  What will you do with the money?  It will cover the costs of developing and launching the Patientory platform. See our roadmap (coming soon).  What kind of escrow service do you use?  We use multisig wallets. We will publish our Ethereum smart contract code before the crowdsale.  -------------------------------- Articles and Press Releases:  English: Forbes: here Hypepotamus: here Beckers Hospital Review: here Bitcoin Magazine: here Techsling: here Colarado Biz Magazine: here PR Newswire: here SuperbCrew: here CyberMed News: here  Chinese ChainB: here BTC 38: here  -------------------------- Follow Us:  Website: here WhitePaper: here Slack: here Facebook: here Twitter: here Reddit: here Youtube: coming soon Linkedin: here Blog: here Telegram: here",True
