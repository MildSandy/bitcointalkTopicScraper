PUBG has partnered with Refereum, driving blockchain adoption in the mainstream and gaming communities! Press release below.    Refereum’s & PUBG Corporation’s new partnership drives mainstream blockchain adoption Refereum’s cryptocurrency-based rewards campaign introduces PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS’ users to blockchain technology  SAN FRANCISCO — July 24, 2019 — Blockchain-based rewards and marketing company Refereum today announces its partnership with gaming juggernaut PUBG Corporation, which connects PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS users to blockchain technology through the most creative and massive blockchain use case in gaming yet.  In a first for both the blockchain and gaming industries, PUBG players can earn on-chain crypto rewards (Refereum’s utility token, $RFR) for completing in-game feats — for instance, winning a match. This new rewards program involving in-game objectives is an innovative new addition to Refereum’s already established work in rewarding gamers for livestreaming their gameplay, watching other players’ streams, and promoting games’ social media content.  “Gamers do so much free marketing for games through streaming services and social media, but they’re rarely compensated sufficiently for it,” says Refereum CEO Dylan Jones. “This is the problem Refereum aims to fix — and now, with this revolutionary new way of rewarding gamers for their in-game engagement with PUBG, we not only reward them for playing a game that they love, but for their dedication in becoming better players, too.”  Refereum’s inaugural PUBG campaign lasts until August 20, and is the latest in a string of successful marketing and rewards campaigns that has also propelled mainstream blockchain adoption amongst the audiences of games such as State of Decay 2, Fortnite, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield series.

I read about Refereum and was really interested in it - cool idea, working product, great partnerships. But I realized that I don't understand how the token will grow. The main idea of the token is to reward gamers, influencers, and streamers. So when gamer or streamer will receive the reward in Refereum tokens what the first thing they'll do? They'll sell tokens to receive $ and to spend them. In this way, we are going to face the constant inflation of the token. As we can see right not on your Refereum site - there are a lot of quests with RFR prizes. People earn RFR and sell it immediately.

Traditionally, game companies spend exorbitant amounts of money on marketing channels that often prove inefficient. Meanwhile, Twitch and YouTube personalities produce content about video games that is now more popular than televised sports, but they have no way effective way to work directly with game developers at scale. The Refereum cryptocurrency uses blockchain technology to bypass traditional advertising companies and complex legislative and geopolitical restrictions, shifting over $100 billion in advertising revenue from corporations to distribute to individual game players.  By cutting the marketing middleman, Refereum directly rewards influencers and gamers for promoting and playing video games — something otherwise unattainable for most influencers.  Refereum is working with Twitch, the most prominent influencer gaming platform; Unity, the world’s most used game engine; and Ambisafe, which has secured cryptocurrency projects like Tether and Chronobank. Refereum is backed by a team with years of experience at top-tier game and tech companies such as Zynga and Google, with veteran analysts, developers, business development managers, and marketers leading the project.  On November 13th, Refereum will put 25,000,000 RFR utility tokens available for sale, at an initial rate of $1 per with early adoption discounts. The engineer of the Smart Contract managing the ERC20 tokens is none other than Oleksii Matiiasevych, the white hat hacker who saved millions in July’s multi-sig exploit.
