Dear VINchain community,  For those of you who have not yet made their token swap, the deadline is fast approaching! The MEW (My Ether Wallet) website is being updated and they are removing the ability to swap tokens. There is no specific date set when the website will fully transition to the new version. When this happens, everyone who has not yet swapped their tokens will no longer be able to do so. That is why it's SUPER important for everyone who was not yet made their token swap to do so as soon as possible!  What is a token swap? We distributed tokens to everyone who participated in our ICO. These tokens have to be ‘activated’ (or ‘swapped’) before they can be used, traded, sold, etc.  How do I know if I have to swap? 1) You have to do the token swap if you: 2) Participated in the VINchain ICO 3) You got tokens airdropped to you 4) You have VINchain tokens in your wallet  How do I swap my tokens? 1) Go to https://www.myetherwallet.com/ 2) Scroll down to the column ""MEW"" and click on the ""Vintage"" button 3) Now follow these instructions:    - Video Tutorial: https://youtu.be/mwQOIzOiRHQ or    - Written Instructions: https://medium.com/@vinchain/how-to-swap-your-tokens-af58bc2237ba 4) After the token swap is done - activate your wallet: https://medium.com/@vinchain/instructions-to-activate-the-vinwallet-5167d0c5106b  Thank you for your continuous support!

We have some thrilling updates to share about our growth in Edinburgh, London and beyond. We’ve devoted ourselves to examining the ecosystem and opportunities of the region and have met with valuable investors to secure mentorship and funding.  We had the pleasure of visiting the University of Edinburgh Incubation Programs, where we spoke about blockchain technology, our approach to data collection and about what it means to innovate.  Next, we were able to get acquainted with Codebase, who help spread ideas among like-minded startups, learning specificities across the industry.  We enjoyed a session at Galvanise Capital which outlined how to structure and conduct business in Scotland, and also met with lawyers and venture capital investors.   Met at Scottish Enterprise Session with ecosystem players and visited SkyScanner - a leading global travel search site which allows businesses to learn how to increase positive communications with clients.  We were able to secure a productive session at Google, paving the way for some incredible future growth - we’ll be able to share more details at a later date!  Another session was held with FieldFisher, a European law firm with market-leading practices across many of the world's most dynamic sectors.  We were able to secure a workshop with Mike Butcher, an 'Editor at Large' of TechCrunch, the largest breaking-news site covering the world’s hottest tech companies.  Visited EBRD to learn how the huge corporation do their business.   One of the most surprising events was with Pitch@Palace. The Duke of York founded Pitch@Palace in 2014 to provide a platform to amplify and accelerate the work of entrepreneurs and provide opportunities to interface with people who can help make their business dreams a reality at St. James’s Palace. This brought unique chance to make a small pitch to the prestigious guests of the event and evangelize VINchain’s vision.  Techstars is well known across the startup world as a premier worldwide network helping entrepreneurs succeed.

We believe our device platform is vital to develop as the means to produce first revenue and demonstrate the incredible utility of our blockchain data marketplace. With the National Automotive Dealership Association (NADA) Show fast approaching, we are devoted to courting mutually beneficial partnerships. We believe having a beta OBD platform is the most surefire way to accomplish this while highlighting the strengths of VINchain.

Across all industries, all modern, hugely successful companies share one similarity: their ability to utilize data to guide their decisions.  An old saying reminds us that to be forewarned is to be forearmed, that knowledge is power. This power can be used to better serve customers by better knowing their needs, to more efficiently engage resources like fleet vehicles, to guide marketing and sales decisions and more-- the sky's the limit. Data sets are only limited by the quality and scope of the information used, which is why VINchain remains devoted to building the largest and highest quality vehicle data marketplace.  Our data analytic services empower companies with blockchain information to most effectively guide their business through the treacherous terrain of the automotive sector and beyond.  3) 2019 Roadmap  The holidays are traditionally a slower time of year for business, as people spent time with their loved ones and travel. With this in mind, we’re focused on the future of VINchain in 2019 and will be updating our roadmap as the new year rolls around-- stay tuned for exciting developments still to come.

IoT is the ability of various devices, objects, vehicles, homes, and other ‘things’ to communicate with and interact through the internet. Simple.  This opens up a world of possibility for both the ‘thing’ involved and the user, from being able to change the temperature in your house and keeping track of your vehicle’s location through your phone to turning on your favorite song and lighting setup with an audio command. All these benefits have one thing in common, they empower you to have greater control over your life and the things in it with greater convenience.

Dear VINchain community,  We’re delighted to announce that we’ve launched VINchain Block Explorer and it is currently accessible on our website. We’re constantly working to develop our system and it’s the highlight of our week when we have progress like this to share.   Ok so all of this sounds exciting, but what is a block explorer?  Generally when you have a blockchain, you need something to be able to scan every block and see whats inside. This is what makes blockchains transparent. A blockchain scanner does exactly that - it helps users easily see what's inside individual blocks and helps keep track of all of the transactions that happen in the network. For those who have used the website etherscan.io this is very similar to that. With the aid of our blockchain explorer you will be able to view all transaction histories and balances of addresses. Right now you can navigate to our website (vinchain.io), click on PRODUCTS in the top bar, and select VINchain Block Explorer from the dropdown menu.  All transaction histories can be seen for all those who are interested. Be sure to check it out if you’re even half the blockchain enthusiast (geek) we are!

We have several projects in the pipeline and development on our current projects is moving forward at a meteoric pace. Our audience is hungry for the future and we are ensuring each of the products we offer is in their best possible form as we move forward.  Check out our video with today's announcements: https://youtu.be/wrxiOav_1uI  1) Fleet Tracking Platform Development  Our biggest and most tangible achievement of this week is that our fleet tracking platform (gps.VINchain.io) is almost available for use and it’s well worth the wait.   The platform is designed to service the largest fleets on the road, small-scale operations looking to grow and everything in between. Our fleet management solution will track vehicle and driver statistics, maintenance records, fuel stats and more, providing unprecedented communication with your assets and drivers. It will allow your routes, drivers and vehicles to be as efficient as possible, saving you money in wear & tear and more.  Soon it will be available for testing firsthand.   2) Content Evolution Continues  One of the most difficult challenges we face is also one of our greatest strengths, that we offer diverse benefits both to consumers and multiple sectors of the automotive industry. While this is one of our most compelling selling points, it also makes it difficult to cater our content to all of these audiences simultaneously and consistently. We are currently in the process of rewriting and producing more content specifically targeted at each of our audiences. Soon, our website, social media and content will fully reflect the multifaceted nature of our business and provide a streamlined and informative experience for everyone from dealers to consumers.  What would you like to know more about VINchain and what content do you love to see? Do you wish we had more videos explaining the intricacies of our system, or want to hear more about our partner’s developments? Please let us know on our Telegram or social media below.  3) Looking for New Exchanges  The most common question we receive from our community is in regards to getting listed on more exchanges. We have begun to focus more on this aspect as our development continues, though our main priority continues to be on delivering the highest quality product possible. It’s important to understand that this very focus is what separates us from many blockchain startups that will come and go in the blink of an eye.  Listing on exchanges is only as useful for us as far as we can offer a truly developed and complete product which then gives value to our company and contributors. To be blunt, our goal has never been to make a quick buck and run, we are fully committed to revolutionizing the automotive industry.  As always, thank you for your continued support.

Highlight: VINchain Connected Vehicle Device  Our app teams up with our connected vehicle device to make your car smarter after a simple plug-and-play install. This simple solution enables a host of benefits outside of the ability to earn VIN tokens and we want to overview some of them for you.  Diagnostics Your car, smarter. A check engine light just isn’t enough information, why is every device connected now besides the most expensive investment we make? Diagnostics give peace of mind on your safety and insight into any problems so you can know what to expect before walking into the mechanic.  Driving analysis Get scored on aggressive driving, excessive idling and efficiency in order to fine-tune your driving, reduce wear & tear and save money on gas.  GPS tracking The geolocation system allows you to track your trips, set custom points of interest (POI) and personalize geofences around your work, home and more. This feature lets you put a close eye on a new teenage driver or keep tabs on a whole fleet of vehicles.

We’re excited to announce another week of development with the end of summer and more opportunities on the horizon and we’re as grateful as ever to have the support of a wonderful community.

The OBD device is easy to install and will have incredible value for individual consumers, families, dealerships and other companies who manage large fleets. In addition to having GPS and tracking capabilities, through the use of an accelerometer it’s capable of detecting crashes, excessive idling, aggressive driving, towing events or even theft.   The potential applications of the VINchain OBD device are almost endless. The crash data is accurately timestamped can be accessed for insurance purposes and lawsuits. Individuals and companies who maintain a fleet can assess which drivers are putting undue wear and tear on vehicles through aggressive driving and excessive idling. We’re overjoyed that the potential application of our device in coordination with our data network grows every week in stride with our partnerships.   3) Content Development Continues   The VINchain system is multifaceted and offers value to a diversity of clients, from dealerships and insurance companies to consumers and big data firms. We are focused on providing content that offers a specialized experience for each of these markets through our website and beyond.

This rating will change the amount of VIN tokens given for supplying differing types and qualities of data. We’re asking our community what information they consider most when assessing a vehicle’s value and condition. Your opinion is vital to us and we’d appreciate a small amount of your time filling out a brief survey. Your answers will contribute directly to our research and the future of VINchain.  Participate in the brief survey here: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Z97B5NM  You can find more information about the survey here: https://vinchain.io/blog/help-us-shape-the-future-of-vinchain/228  2) VinInspect now hosts VINchain-certified reports  We’re grateful to count VinInspect among our valuable partners and are excited to announce that they’ve successfully implemented our blockchain into their system.

They can find investors who buy at a price of over 200 to 400% below the ICO price. At this time in Idax you can buy with 1 ETH = 80,000 VIN. In ICO was 1 ETH at 20,000 VIN. I can not understand how you can be interested and not buy. I have already over 100k bought in the last hours at a price that was higher than now. Other projects are investing in providing incentives over time for those who trade. Recently, I have seen such a contest in Kucoin, offering for a week a total prize of 100 ETH for the first 500 as a trading volume on that currency. You can also offer an amount less than 100 ETH for the top 10 or 20 largest trading volume. I do not think it's a good option to focus on the product ignoring the importance of the exchange price.

This is from their official telegram:  IDAX will open VIN deposit/withdrawal and trading  Dear users ,  IDAX will launch VIN on BTC、ETH markets.  Deposit &Withdrawal Start Time: 11:00, July 10,2018 (UTC/GMT+08:00)  Trading Start Time: 18:00, July 10, 2018 (UTC/GMT+08:00)  About VIN  There are many problems in the used car industry-- One of the biggest is that used car buyers have limited information on a vehicle’s history. This can be disastrous for an important purchase if the vehicle has been in an accident or past damage has been hidden. This means that buyers are hesitant to pay full price for a used vehicle, as they must plan for any unseen issues.  VINchain solves this problem by creating a transparent and accurate vehicle history report. We’re able to accomplish this by decentralizing data and storing it on the blockchain. Vehicle data is collected from repair shops, dealers, manufacturers, and even the vehicle itself! Because the data is decentralized, it can’t be falsified, and it is accessible by all.

We will soon be listed on exchanges and are negotiating partnerships with major manufacturers. Thank you all for being with us through our growth, we appreciate your support of the VINchain revolution! As always, please leave comments - all feedback is appreciated.  Check out the video with today's announcements: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roZXkgxclF0   1) Interview with Joseph Derkos- Senior Account Executive, Digital Supply Chain Specialist at SAP. This week we were able to record a tremendous interview with Joseph, an expert in the arena of automotive sales analytics with a focus in the used and certified pre-owned market. Joseph talks about his experience in the industry while providing insight into the automotive industry and the way it is currently transforming. Further, Joseph shares his vision of VINchain and the future he sees for the company.  You can find the interview here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1J9tk_27c&t=316s    2) Exchange Integrations Exchanges have been a focus of ours while we have been waiting to be listed. Currently CoinEx Market has agreed to finish all integrations and list us by the 8th of July. Additionally, IDAX.mn is finishing their integrations and project having us listed by the 10th of July. We apologize for the delay, but we are sure the results will be worth the wait.  3) Partnership Development At VINchain we believe in collaboration, that it's better to work together than to compete. We are in communication with several automotive companies regarding the forging of partnerships. We cannot yet announce their identities as we are still finalizing agreements, though we are excited to share updates as things move forward.

Deposit and Withdrawal will start at 11:00 AM, July 10, 2018 (UTC/GMT+08:00). The trading itself will start at 18:00, July 10, 2018 (UTC/GMT+08:00).

We cannot express our gratitude to all of your enough for being with us this whole time and remaining patient while we got the entire listing situation sorted out. The whole reason for the delay is because we have a non-traditional token framework which is very difficult for all of the exchanges to list. So to get to this point IDAX had to build out a new framework on their exchange, which understandably takes a long time.  Now all of that is behind us, and we take another step towards a bright future for VINchain. Join us today and let's change the industry together!

Dear VINchain community,  We are glad to announce that our blockchain is officially live again now! As you all know due to the changes in US legislation we had to refund all the US ICO contributors.  In order to do that we stopped the swap and suspended our blockchain for some time to process the refund. It took us a little longer than expected as we have been waiting for people to fill out the necessary documents.  Right now we have refunded the majority of US contributors. Those who haven’t confirmed the refund address need to do so inside their VINchain.io account, and they will get the refund at the end of the week. The refunds will continue to be processed once each week on Friday.  If you went through the token swap previously, then you need to reactivate your wallet so you can freely use your tokens. Please follow these instructions to reactivate your wallet: (https://medium.com/@vinchain/instructions-to-activate-the-vinwallet-5167d0c5106b  ). This guide is intended for those who have went through the token swap process already.  If you haven’t completed the token swap then you will be able to do it in your VINchain.io account later today. Here is are guides for how to do so: Token Swap Video Tutorial: https://youtu.be/mwQOIzOiRHQ Token Swap Written Instructions: https://medium.com/@vinchain/how-to-swap-your-tokens-af58bc2237ba  After you complete the swap you will be able to see your tokens within 24 hours in your VIN wallet! Thank you all for your patience and for the support of our project.  Also we want to address the issue of the delay with the exchanges. This is all due to the fact that we are not an ERC-20 token, and so exchanges are having difficulties integrating our token into their trading platform. We apologize for this. We are waiting for our listed exchanges to finalize the integration. We will announce our official listing as soon as the exchanges are done integrating us! In the meantime we are working on being listed on additional exchanges, which we will announce as soon as they officially accept us.

We have been working diligently on the reload of the blockchain, as we need it to be complete for the refund of US citizens. We apologize for the delay, due to the need to update servers there is an inherent time constraint and we are aiming for it to be completed the beginning of next week. The swap will be available as soon as the blockchain is reloaded.  Check out the video with today's announcements: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mepis_qdA8&t=18s  1) New Adviser  We are honored to welcome the valuable asset of Joseph Derkos to our advisory board. Joseph is a Senior Account Executive and Digital Supply Chain Specialist at SAP who is a recognized expert in the arena of automotive sales analytics with a focus in the used and certified pre-owned market.   With nearly ten years working closely with sales departments he brings a new perspective to the VINchain team regarding the automotive supply chain, where blockchain technology has expansive implications. Joe was named one of Auto Remarketing inaugural ""Used Car Industry's 40 Under 40"" and we’re elated to have him as an adviser.   You can read more about Joseph Derkos here: https://vinchain.io/blog/206   2) New Partnership  VINchain is excited to announce that we have formed a partnership with a conglomerate of giants in the auto industry known as MOBI (https://www.dlt.mobi/). MOBI promotes standards and accelerate the adoption of blockchain, distributed ledger and related technologies. Further, they provide valuable insight in the fields of vehicle identity and history.   The MOBI organization is comprised of titans such as Bosch, BMW, Ford, General Motors and Renault. We look forward to forming tighter relations with these top-tier companies.  3) Joined MotorMindz  We are joining an organization that is comprised of the very top automotive masterminds in the entire auto industry. We will be working closely with legends such as Jess Van Dongen, Jim O’Sullivan, Bruce Coventry, John Felice, and Troy McLean, and this is only just scratching the surface. The MotorMindz are a collective of approximately 60 former CEO’s and top decision makers of top Auto Manufacturers, Dealer Groups, service stations, etc. Each is a heavy hitter and we will be working very closely with them as we take our product to market.   The best part about joining the MotorMindz? We have arranged a deal with them where they will be going out to dealerships and OEM’s and selling our products and services for us!  4) Blockchain Progress  We have been working very hard to reset our blockchain. Unfortunately this process is not an easy one… if only it were as simple as restarting a computer. During this process we encountered several unforeseen hurdles that have been out of our control and we apologize for the wait. We are doing everything we can to get it back up and running as soon as we possibly can. Meanwhile, we thank you for the patience!  We are appreciative of your feedback and understanding, thank you for being such a supportive community. As always, we wouldn’t be where we are without you.

Here is our weekly update with all of the interesting developments this week! This week has been very active for us. We have made some very anticipated announcements that everyone have been looking for and done lots of things in general. We are doing our best to keep you updated about all the work that has been done by our team! As always leave your comments because we are interested in what you think! Thank you so much for being with us and for all the support!  1) Exchanges  We have officially been listed on two different exchanges. We would like to mention that it took us some time to get listed, but this was due to the fact that our token is not a standard ERC-20 format and so the process is longer. However, we have been working hard and we have 2 confirmed exchanges that we are going to be listed on:  Exchanges we will be on (starting from 18th of June):  IDAX.mn (Ranked #26 in the world by daily trading volume) https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/idax/  CoinEx Market https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinexmarket/  We have been closely following recent new and developments and we have decided to withdraw from the OctaEx Exchange. There has been a lot of suspicious activity going on, and we do not want to risk our communities safety.  2) Refund for US Contributors  Recently, we decided to refund US ICO participants. All the participants who have made their contributions in ETH have received their tokens back to the address they contributed from. We are processing the remainder of the refunds today (6/8/18) so if you didn't get yours yet, you will receive it very soon.  Those whom contributed with other currencies (BTC, LTE, DASH) are going to get their refund today as well. For user who contributed with these currencies will have to declare what wallet they want to receive the funds back to. If you haven't followed these instructions yet, please do so now: https://medium.com/@vinchain/us-refund-instructions-63f82adc121b.  If you have received an email from us saying that we need your KYC, please make sure to confirm it ASAP! If you want to change your refund address you need KYC as well.  3) Blockchain Development News  As we are refunding all the US participants we need to re-start our blockchain. This process will be completed on Monday. Furthermore on Monday the option for the token swap will be opened again, so all those who haven’t completed it yet will get their chance.  4) OBD Device  Last week our team visited Teltonika (https://teltonika.lt/ ) a huge manufacturer (top 5 in the industry) of OBD devices. This is a great company with over 20 years of experience in this industry. We took a few samples of OBD devices which we are testing. We will let everyone know about our future possible collaboration with such a great company!  Here is a short video from the factory where a special robot automatically checks, calibrates and sorts GPS modules. If module does not pass the test, it is sent for revision. Check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI06RlUhT5o  If you would like to read more about our OBD manufacturing check out this VINchain post: https://vinchain.io/blog/204  Also you can check our our new video with all the results here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPUb_gMvPgI   Stay Up to Date: Join our announcement group, https://t.me/VINChainOfficialAnnouncements  to stay up to date on all news and developments.

We are working on producing our own OBD device - that thing that plugs into your car to help you capture your driving / vehicle data. Last week our team visited Teltonika (https://teltonika.lt/ ) a huge manufacturer (top 5 in the industry) of OBD devices. This is a great company with over 20 years of experience in this industry.  We analyzed their manufacturing process, and witnessed OBD devices being produced right in front of us - going from raw materials to completed devices.  We visited the location where the raw materials for the devices are stored. All of the materials are counted, tracked, and inputted into the system, they are sent to the production floor.  Also we have attended the factory itself - where the OBD devices are assembled. We made sure that during this processes the device is of high quality.  Human intervention is used seldomly, in order to minimize human error and to reduce the possibility of malfunction. At the final stage of the process a robot checks the quality of the assembled device to make sure that it is 100% exactly as it should be. With the help of a special machine, they check the 3D model how the device was assembled. After that the special robot automatically checks, calibrates and sorts GPS modules. If module does not pass the test, it is sent for revision.  And finally EACH device is tested before being sent out. The device work is also tested in different conditions such as heat, high humidity, cold and etc. This is done to ensure that every device working at 100% capacity and with utmost quality.  We took a few examples of OBD devices which we are going to be testing. We will let everyone know about our future possible collaboration with such a great company!

This is our weekly update on all the work that we have done during the week and let you know everything that has happened in the world of VINchain over the course of the last week. We are working hard on our project and we thank you for being with us and supporting us so much! We are looking forward for your feedback!  1) News from legal team!    Due to new SEC rules and regulations our legal team has informed us that we need to return all of the collected funds to our US participants. In order for us to do so we have to re-launch our blockchain. This process will take about two weeks to complete.  Those who have gone through the token swap will just have to activate their wallets again. This process takes less than a minute to complete. Those who have not gone through the token swap, will still have to do it and then later on will have to activate their wallets. All US citizens will receive their contributions in exact amount and currency that they have contributed with.  This process is necessary in order for us to ensure that our project has a bright and flourishing future.  2) Exchanges  After this process is complete we will be tradable on exchanges. We will do our best to make it as fast as possible.  3) Development of OBD  This week a part of our team has a meeting with potential OBD providers. This is one of the largest OBD companies and is known for the quality of their devices. We have great negotiation and we are looking forward to working with them, so soon you will get more news about that!  Thank you for all your support and for being with us!

We would like to mention that it took us some time to get listed, but this was due to the fact that our token is not a standard ERC-20 format and so the process is longer. However, we have been working hard and we have 3 confirmed exchanges that we are going to be listed on:  Exchanges we will be on: https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/idax/ starting from 18th of June; https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinexmarket/ starting from 18th of June; https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/octaex/ starting from 11th of June.  We will be listed on exchanges once the refund to US participants is complete (June 11th).   Refund to US Contributors  We want to thank you for participating in the VINchain ICO. Recently, we decided to refund US ICO participants. The refund will be available starting from tomorrow (6/5/18). All the participants who have made their contributions in ETH will receive their tokens back to the address they have been paying from.  If you have received an email from us saying that we need your KYC, please make sure to confirm it ASAP!  If you are a US participant and have contributed with LTC,BTC or DASH here are step-by-step instructions for you: https://medium.com/@vinchain/us-refund-instructions-63f82adc121b.  If the address that you want to receive your tokens to is different from the address you have paid from, please make sure to complete your KYC!

Check out what we have been up to for the past week. We are glad to say that work is progressing and we are building our project bigger and better every day! During this week we have made steps to further our business and we will continue this pace of progress in the future. Thank you for being with us and as always letting us know your opinion! We appreciate any feedback!  1) Project update  New website is live!  Since we have finished our ICO, we are now shifting our focus to business development and attracting new customers and data providers. As such we have updated our website to reflect this shift of focus. In this new version you can see updated information about our company and vision. We would tremendously appreciate any feedback you guys might have for us. Let us know how we can continue to improve our website and if there is anything that is unclear. We have come a very long way since we first published our website, and we have listened to your feedback every step of the way. Your opinion is valuable to us. Email us at info@VINchain.io and let us know what you think.   You can see our new version of website here: https://vinchain.io  2) Development updates:  We are continuing to populate our blockchain with information! We have been creating digital signatures (called ""hashes"") of our data partners information and uploading it to our blockchain. You can see the information being uploaded as each of the new blocks forms. We are happy to be making such tremendous progress in such a short amount of time!  You can see the newly created blocks here: https://wallet.vinchain.io/ .   3) Results of the conferences  VINchain took the 2nd Place at IoT World!  Last week we have attended two conferences: IoT World and Emerge. The IoT world conference was held in California, where we entered and won the “Project Kairos” startup pitching competition! It was a very exciting time for all of us and we are happy that we got such an amazing opportunity to present our idea in front of hundreds of audience members. We took the second place in pitch contest and we are extremely happy that our idea got such a high reward!  You can read more about this conference here: https://vinchain.io/blog/195  We took part in Emerge Conference!  Another part of our team also attended the Emerge conference that was held in Minsk during last week. This conference was really productive for the whole team. We have met many experienced people who have been sharing their feedback on the development of our project. We got some great perspective connections that can grow into partnerships soon, and even got an invitation for the next conference.  You can read more about the conference here:  https://emergeconf.io  4) New Interview  The latest interview with our valuable adviser Roger Crook - the CEO at Capital Springboard.

You can read more here: https://vinchain.io/blog/198  2) Development progress:  The VINchain Wallet is Ready!  Our team has been working hard to make it happen, and finally we are glad to announce that our wallet is ready and you can see it here (https://wallet.vinchain.io ). In order to start using your wallet you need to activate it. The guide is here (https://medium.com/@vinchain/instructions-to-activate-the-vinwallet-5167d0c5106b ). This guide is intended for those who have went through the token swap process already.  You can read more here: https://vinchain.io/blog/196  The Token Swap Is Available Again!  Our swap is open again for the people who haven’t completed it before. You can see the link to the swap here (https://vinchain.io/account/swap ). While you go through the swap you will create a VINchain public wallet key and a VINchain private wallet key. KEEP THESE KEYS SAFE!!! - Just like any other keys in the world of crypto. You will need these keys to use your wallet.  You can read more here: https://vinchain.io/blog/197  Also our blockchain is ready and you can see it in GitHub (https://github.com/VinChain/VINchain-blockchain ). Its open source and publicly available for everyone to analyze and see how everything works!  3) Membership  We have joined The Automotive Service Association (https://asashop.org/ ).

Their aim is to connect decentralized and centralized economic institutions to create a new economic order that works for all humanity, honors innovation and secures sovereignty — this is VINchain’s purpose as well, therefore, we are glad that we have been part of this.  You can read more about it here: https://vinchain.io/blog/189   2) Swap News  As many of you know we have been undergoing our token swap for the last two weeks. Now that a sufficient amount of participants have swapping their coins, we are putting the token swap on hold while we integrate everyone's swapped coins into the genesis block - the very first block of our blockchain On Monday everyone who has done the swap will get their tokens unlocked in their new VIN wallet. ( we will post the link in Monday’s news release).  You can read about all the token swap results here: https://vinchain.io/blog/190  For those of you who haven’t swapped their coins yet, the token swap will be available again on Monday.  We have been listening to your feedback This time around we have streamlined the entire process and it will be much easier to do the token swap. We have decided to make the token swap FREE for everyone. This means that even if you missed the opportunity to swap your coins earlier, VINchain will cover the transaction fee that's necessary to swap your coins.  You can read more about it here: https://vinchain.io/blog/192  3) New adviser - Jon Arnett  We have new adviser on the team- Jon Arnett. Jon is responsible for launching Carfax in Canada and he is also the President, Consulting, Canadian Sales & Business Development at Contact At Once! a LivePerson Company.

Also, we will create important deals and partnerships, as so many valuable people and companies will be a part of this event — we will get the chance to introduce them to VINchain.  This event is held by the World Tokenomic Forum, which is the leading international organization for enabling public-private cooperation, interoperability, and innovation, as we move toward a new economic order in a token and blockchain-based global economy.  Their aim is to connect decentralized and centralized economic institutions to create a new economic order that works for all humanity, honors innovation and secures sovereignty — this is VINchain’s purpose as well, therefore, we are glad to participate.

Dear VINchain community,  We have an announcement for you! As you all know, our system will be working on our own blockchain, which is why we have been asking you to complete the swap! The swap is on pause for now because we are calculating the percentage of people who have done it. Everyone who has completed it will have their tokens unlocked in their VIN wallet (you will get the link soon).  As for the first results, we can say that from 5131 people who have took part in the ICO, 3747 people have completed the swap which is 73.03% of participants. From 452,598,800 tokens, 381,457,198 have been swapped — which is 84.28% of all the amount of tokens in circulation.  We will collect all of the results until this Friday and make the finals. People who have bought more than 2.5 ETH still need to submit documents for KYC, so we are waiting for them as well. During the weekend, the tokens of those who completed the swap will be transferred to their VIN wallet and the work of the wallet will be tested. On Monday, you will receive all of the instructions about how to use your new wallet and your tokens will be unlocked there. Also, on Monday after tokens get unlocked, the swap will resume but with a transaction fee. The fee will be 1.5% from the amount of tokens you swap, but not more than 25 tokens!

We cannot wait any longer - and we will unlock the tokens at the end of the week!  If you don’t swap now, you will have to pay a commission later!!!

Please remember that the security of your wallet is guaranteed by your private key, so ALWAYS make sure to keep your private key safe! - We cannot recover your private key if it is lost or stolen!   Questions and Answers:  Q) What is a token swap? A) As you all know we will be using our own blockchain (not Etherium) and our own VINchain wallet that you can use to store your VIN tokens! In order for our tokens to be stored in your wallet, they first have to be converted from the Ethereum based tokens that they are now, into VINchain blockchain compatible tokens. This is known as a token swap. Q) Why is a token swap necessary? A) You have to go through a token swap so that your tokens become tradable, transferable, and usable. Q) Who has to do the token swap?

(Apr.16-Apr.22)  Dear VINchain community!   Starting from this week VINchain will release a weekly update on our developments, this way you will always be updated! As this is our first update, let us know what you think, we’re happy to hear feedback from our valuable community.   Main News:       1) Most importantly, our Initial Coin Offering (ICO) completed on the 15th of April. In the beginning of the week we announced all the results of the ICO. We have 840,108,901 tokens in total supply and 159,891,099 tokens will be burned.   You can read more about it here: https://vinchain.io/blog/180       2) We became members of the National Independent Automobile Dealers Association (NIADA). This great news brings our project to a whole new level and exposes us to new opportunities.       3) We have finished the distribution of tokens for the affiliate program and bounty, so all the participants can see the tokens in their wallets.   Technological Update:   This week we have started with our swap. As long as we use our own blockchain everyone must participate in the swap in order to have their tokens unlocked. We want to remind everyone of the importance of completing the swap as fast as possible as tokens will be unlocked when the majority have completed the swap.   If you are having difficulties completing the swap please watch and follow the step by step video instruction.   Token Swap Video Tutorial: https://youtu.be/mwQOIzOiRHQ   All the news about the swap can be seen here: https://vinchain.io/blog/181   Conferences:   This week our CEO Alex Miles attended the eMerge Americas expo, a premier technology event connecting the Americas and exposing us to a wealth of potential partnerships.   You can read more about it here: https://vinchain.io/blog/182   New Member:   We are thrilled to announce that we have a new member of our already expansive team. Don Harris is our new advisor and is currently serving as VP of Financial Planning and Analysis at Sonic Automotive, a Fortune 500 publicly-traded automotive dealer. There’s no doubt Don’s diverse expertise will help VINchain achieve our goals as we continue to spread globally and launch in the United States.   You can read more about it here: https://vinchain.io/de/blog/184   Coming Up:         1) We have been hard at work on our own blockchain and wallet. On Monday we will release the web wallet and next week we will launch the desktop wallet!         2) Next Monday is going to be a big day as the mainnet will be launched, so stay tuned!

In order for you to get your tokens everyone must first go through a token swap. This is a quick and easy procedure. Please take a few minutes to read the instructions carefully.  Step 1 - Before you can do a token swap you first have to enable 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) for your account.  Instructions to enable 2FA can be found here: https://medium.com/@vinchain/vinchain-logging-in-after-the-security-update-ceb8cac0bf  Step 2 - After 2FA is enabled, you then have to do the token swap.  Instructions for the token swap can be found here: https://medium.com/@vinchain/how-to-generate-keys-to-your-vinchain-wallet-6011bb616621  Reminder The security of your tokens is guaranteed by your private key, so as always please remember to keep your private key safe!  After the majority of the people will create a swap all the tokens will be distributed straight to the VINchain wallet! So do this as soon as possible in order to receive your tokens earlier!  Questions & Answers Q) What is a token swap? A) As you all know we will be using our own blockchain (not Etherium) and our own VINchain wallet that you can use to store your VIN tokens! In order for our tokens to be stored in your wallet, they first have to be converted from the Ethereum based tokens that they are now, into VINchain blockchain compatible tokens. This is known as a token swap.  Q) Why is a token swap necessary? A) You have to go through a token swap so that your tokens become tradable, transferable, and usable.  Q) Who has to do the token swap? A) Everyone has to go through a token swap  Update Also we have a small change in the amount of tokens burned. First of all some people have paid straight on our wallet so we will send 1,480,765.225 tokens to them. Second, some people have been paying from an exchange and 102,552.1135 tokens will be sent to them. Some people forgot to enter the ETH address and 77,730 tokens will be used for them. So in total we will have 840,108,901 tokens in total supply and 159,891,099 tokens will be burned.

One of our big backers from the very beginning has been A Better Bid - who invested $500,000 USD. Right now we are finalizing our agreement for them to increase their contribution to $2,000,000 USD!  A Better Bid (https://abetter.bid/en ) is an online car auction with more than 100,000+ vehicles on sale every day. It is a registered Copart Auto Auction broker which gives its clients access to the largest car auction inventory in USA, including used, repairable, theft recovery, fleet & lease, repo, flood and hail damaged cars.  Their contribution cannot be done all at once, and they will release the USD over the course of a year, so it will come steadily into our account. For the period of a year, the tokens that A Better Bid has reserved will be locked.  Our amazing partnership with A Better Bid is not only about financial support - we have a mutually beneficial relationship. They also provide us with access to their wealth of data that they have accumulated over many years of being in the vehicle auction business. We provide their clients with trusted vehicle history reports so they can feel confident in the car that they are about to purchase. Our partnerships always work both ways - we are always striving to make everything as beneficial for everyone as it is possible!  If you want to secure the most maximal discount that we offer, hurry and contribute to our project.  Contribute Now! (https://vinchain.io/account )  Detailed instructions on how to contribute can be found here: (https://vinchain.io/instructions)  We are really grateful for such amazing support from one of our biggest partners! With this we will be able to pursue new horizons and tackle new challenges in a way that would not be possible otherwise. We are all very excited to work with such amazing partners!  If you have any question don’t hesitate to contact us through telegram (https://t.me/vinchainio ).

This subject has been discussed extensively on many social-economic and political platforms. The impact of having a decentralized operation can be widely seen through the various cryptocurrencies that are coming up. As more people gain knowledge about this technology and incorporate it into different ideas, it is clear that blockchain is more than just a system. At VinChain, the team is proud to be one of the leading startups that incorporate blockchain technology into increasing the safety of your car.  Nowadays blockchain technology allows to create a single database with all the information about the car. If you get your car repaired at an official repair shop, this information will be available to an insurance company that can give you a cheaper insurance plan. This is because the official repair shop guarantees the authenticity and reliability of installed spare parts. This is what company VinChain is working on.

It was a massive event that was held on the largest world stage for the high-level industry moguls and investors—In short, a great opportunity to educate like-minded individuals on what VINchain has to offer.  Our CEO and founder Alex Miles was selected to give a presentation detailing the future potential of blockchain technology and his unique vision on the topic. He spoke about the perspectives of the VINchain system and its necessity in the current and future landscape of the used vehicle market to a powerful reception.  This event was honored with the attendance of many valuable investors and enthusiasts who are interested in the incredible possibilities of blockchain technology. Alex made many valuable connections during this summit, which will surely grow into the partnerships as many of his past business relationships have. Networking opportunities like this are best way to spread word of the incredible potential of VINchain, and to attract people who are interested in the technology. Many already see the wealth of applications created by the VINchain’s decentralized database, and are ready to share their experience and excitement.

You can check out the official Legal Opinion here (https://vinchain.io/files/LegalOpinion.pdf).

On the other hand i found a few reports powered only with epicvin with no ebay data.  So for example, I'm looking at the VinChain Nissan Juke report and epicvin saying it's Juke trim S and ebay is sayin trim SV (correct). Also, Juke is a SUV and not the hatchback as your epicvin data claims...etc etc..  Furthermore, there is a vehicle history section in your report powered by ebay where you offer Carfax report !? - which is kinda funny.

Approximately one week ago the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it treats almost all Initial Coin Offerings (ICO’s) as securities. In a swift proactive response to this announcement, we had to temporarily limit the access of US residents in our ICO.  We had set our sights on overcoming this hurdle by the third quarter of 2018, so we are overjoyed to be able to announce that VINchain token purchasing is open to the US market as of February 14th, 2018. We were able to accomplish this major goal as VINchain was concluded to be a utility token and not a security.  VINchain tokens can be acquired here: https://vinchain.io/  VINchain tokens can be acquired with multiple currencies, including Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), and Dash (DASH).  The ICO opened on February 1st, and will continue until April 15th of 2018. Purchased VINchain tokens will be distributed between April 16th and April 23rd.     There’s never been a better time to get involved, with over 1,000,000 VINchain tokens sold already. The sooner you get involved, the greater bonus on top of your token purchase you will receive. We are currently in stage 2 of 7, which carries a corresponding bonus of 25% on top of your purchase (the current stage and bonus can be viewed anytime at vinchain.io). US contributors on the waitlist will receive the full bonus that was available at the time of signup!  One Ethereum (ETH) is equal to a base of 20,000 VINchain tokens, plus the bonus corresponding to the stage (+25% in stage 2), so currently one ETH purchases 25,000 VINchain tokens. Stages are progressed through when the specified amount of ETH is collected.  Please read our detailed, step by step instructions on how to get involved in the VINchain ICO here: https://vinchain.io/instructions  Many US-based contributors have been following our developments closely and are already excited to contribute, while others are hearing news of VINchain for the first time. VINchain offers a decentralized and secure vehicle history report built on the blockchain. This means that for the first time ever, consumers will be able to obtain reliable and transparent data on vehicles they are considering purchasing.  This reliability and transparency comes from the data being attached to a blockchain-passport specific to the VIN of the vehicle. Information about the vehicle is accumulated from databases of all system participants, including auto manufacturers (OEMs), insurance companies, service stations, banks, leasing companies, the vehicle itself and more. This information can be aggregated into a report which is purchased with VINchain tokens.  For more comprehensive and technical information, please consult the VINchain White Paper here: https://vinchain.io/files/VinChainWhitePaper.pdf  We’d love to chat and answer any questions or concerns you might have.

There are some fundamental differences between us. Yes both of us are doing vehicle history, but besides that almost nothing else is the same.  We see vehicle history as just a part of a much grander vision.   We are creating the future of connected cars, we just happened to start with vehicle history.  Today whenever you generate data, someone else profits from it. Think of facebook. They collect thousands of dollars worth of information from you, and you never see a cent.  Ultimately what we are doing is putting people in control of their own data.  We want to create a network of connected cars where all drivers worldwide are connected to VINchain. In this network all of the data that they generate belongs to them.  In this connected network, other business models can be built on top. Things like connecting to the drivers at the exact time when they need a specific service.  We are planning on generating revenue right after the launch of our solution  We have many great partners who are ready to do business with us. By the time of our launch their vehicle reports will be sourced by us. Also they will contribute their massive databases to us. So we are starting out ahead of the competition. Also they will accept our coins as a form of payment  We have much more experience than everyone else who is doing vehicle history on the blockchain, not just CarVertical. The combined auto experience of our core team members totals well over two decades! CarVerical cant say the same.  We have been around longer. If you check both of our BitcoinTalk branches, you will see that we were the first to come up with the idea.",False

There was an unpredictable fall of the ETH network for a few days when none of transactions went through.  Some our investors did not manage to make a purchase due to these circumstances. When the presale ended, we received lots of messages saying that people were not able to buy our tokens due to all these problems. That is why we decided to make our ICO longer so everyone who is interested could take part and make a purchase.  Our ICO will be held from the 1st of February till the 15th of April 2018.

We have important news!  We decided to double the amount of tokens you get for your purchase. Earlier you could get 10,000 tokens per 1 ETH, now you will get 20,000 per 1 ETH.  As long as our presale has already started we cannot change the terms of our smart-contract, so when you purchase VIN tokens on our website you still receive the previous amount of tokens, but when our presale is finished we will send you the same amount of tokens you have already bought (we will double the amount of tokens you own).  Here it is the presale price list according to our update:  During the presale 12.500.000 tokens are available for sale.  • 0 – 1,000,000 tokens used to be 1 ETH – 10,000 VIN and now it is 1ETH = 20,000 VIN • 1,000,001 – 5,000,000 used to be 1 ETH – 8,570 VIN and now it is 1ETH = 17,140 VIN • 5,000,001 – 12,500,000 used to be 1 ETH – 7,500 VIN and now it is 1ETH = 15,000 VIN  Why we are doing this:  The price of ETH has doubled since the time we started. We made our plan with ETH cost of $300 and now it is $600. Also, to make it completely fair, those who have already bought our tokens will receive double after the presale (the same terms for everyone).

The reality is that it can happen to anyone who decides to sell a car. Once you post an ad on the internet on any site, you become a target for them. If you are lucky, you will get an honest buyer. However, most of the times especially on sites such as Craigslist and Oodle, you are likely to get a scammer posing as an ‘interested buyer’. The interested buyer will find a way to make you pull up your car history from some website that they refer you to. The ultimate goal for the scammer is to get you to the site of which they get a commission from the lead. Once that’s done, they pretend to have changed their mind after you’ve bought your car history from their site.  And that’s not all. Many of the existing companies that provide data about used cars are also caught in the web of this violation of the law. Such a company is Carfax which is one of the biggest commercial suppliers of vehicle history reports to individuals and businesses on used cars. Carfax has always claimed to have information about the accidents for all the 50 states in the US. However, in 2006 it turned out that they were not able to check the information about accidents in 23 states. Even though the lawsuit was settled in May 2007 in the Trumbull County Common Pleas Court in Ohio, the fight against car history scams still continues. Carfax representative revealed that more than 10 million consumers were affected. The company asserts that it has major accident information from all 50 states and it backs up its claim with a buyback guarantee. The settlement in the West v. Carfax, Inc lawsuit was overturned and the lawyers for the class never pursued the case after that.  These are some of the problems Vinchain will solve through the decentralized vehicle database. With the help of this blockchain system, such situations are impossible to happen due to the decentralized system and absolute clarity of information.  Just to Remind Our token pre-sale started.

It is precisely because of this that the project not only needs brains but also you need to have a lot of experience to make it work. Many similar projects have been launched over the past few years with many failing before their 2nd year birthday. Even with the best idea, lack of proper monitoring and evaluation is what drugs many start-ups down. Let’s not forget that there is limited budget at that time hence there are hardly ever funds for trial and error projects. Nevertheless, we learnt from our predecessors mistakes and emerged more successful. That said, we definitely have the enough muscle to work in such a business.    The history of Vinchain started a long time ago with creating by our partners http://crashescars.com/ru in 2004. The company is located in the US in New Jersey. The company is engaged in the supply of new and emergency vehicles, motorcycles, boats and yachts from the USA to other countries. Delivery is possible “from door to door”, including customs clearance, insurance, registration. That was the first step they took when started to collect a history of accidents.     What followed in 2007 was the creation of  https://www.easyexport.us which is an officially registered broker of Copart auction. This Company specializes on selling used cars globally. They provide a client with detailed information on each lot, so that he or she can be confidently sure about the vehicle that they are going to buy. One of the greatest achievements for this company is when they got into the inc500 rating as the most dynamically developing company for 3 years in a row they. In 2015, they made a bold statement by rebranding https://abetter.bid/en .    Another brand worth looking into is A Better Bid which is an online car auction with more than 100,000+ vehicles on sale every day. It is a registered Copart Auto Auction broker which gives a client the possibility to the access to the largest car auction inventory in USA, including used, repairable, theft recovery, fleet & lease, repo, flood and hail damaged cars.    Our advisors are brokers of the largest salvage auction in America for many years. Moreover, they export cars to dozens of countries of the world and therefore deeply immersed in the topic. In 2007, they created autoinspect.us LLC ( https://www.autoinspect.us ) and created a service to check the status of auto. Autoinspect.us does not buy or sell vehicles and spare parts. The primary objective is to inspect cars that the client is interested in purchasing and to give a detailed report after the inspection. In 2013 they created https://www.epicvin.com . At EpicVin, client receives verified data updated in real time that’s collected based on the VIN.   NMVTIS is the largest and most trustworthy U.S. database and Autoinspect.us LLC is it’s approved data provider. Here the client can get all the essential information about the used car which is bought or planning to be bought. An online VIN check reveals all the data needed to know to feel safe and confident about the vehicle. This system eliminates all possibilities of data being altered, manipulated or misrepresented in the process of obtaining it. What’s more the system is based on the blockchain technology hence it makes it decentralized. A decentralized vehicle database simply means that you can access it from all parts of the world. Apart from eliminating discrepancies in data verification, this system also ensures that all parties involved in the process of buying and selling of a used car are not duped, underpaid or overcharged. We’ve partnered with big names in both the Automotive and Blockchain industry to ensure the success of this project.    If you are thinking of investing with us, this is your chance. So as you can see, there is a lot of experience standing behind our project so we definitely know a lot about automotive industry and aiming to develop it in the best possible way. We have put in the effort and time to ensure that VINchain in a huge success. We believe that it is the time to restore the trust between dealers and buyers in the automotive industry.

In a bid to close a deal, many of them have ended up buying poor quality or stolen vehicles. However, the automotive industry has tried to curb these growing concerns and created portals where customers can ask for such information.  Even so, customers still face a challenge when doing this because they have to deal with a lot of agents when applying for information with the help of other companies. To get the information about the car, other companies will need to contact all the previous owners and dealers. Because the information gets transferred from one part to another, it might be misrepresented altered or deleted in the process. This leads to the incorrect information and lots of possibilities to fabricate data. Moreover, it also takes a lot of time and if needed, the customer will not be able to check the efficiency of information.  However, with the help of our project, this problem will be solved. Customers will directly contact the provider and get all the information. As long as it all stored in one system, with the help of blockchain technology, it's impossible to change it. You can see all the origins of data and it’s an easy, safe way to know everything about your vehicle.

Alex Miles is the CEO of VINchain project and the marketing strategist with specialization in brand development. He is a person who believes that VINchain is able to change the whole automotive industry. And here is why:  Why do you think, VINchain project will be helpful and useful in an automotive business? VINChain will create a decentralized marketplace for used vehicle information. This will create transparency in a market that desperately needs it. The entire history of a vehicle will be easily accessible to any individual.  In your opinion what are the biggest benefits of using VINchain? The biggest benefit of using VINChain is to know exactly where you are getting your information from because it can all be traced back to its source. It creates something that has never existed before which is transparency and accountability in the Automotive Industry.  How will decentralized data storage systems solve the problem with inaccurate information? Decentralized data storage systems will solve the problem of inaccurate information by accurately identifying any and all discrepancies. Since no data can be hidden or suppressed, a decentralized data storage system is the ideal solution. Moreover, the data cannot be altered, so the consumers can feel reassured that they are seeing the truth about the vehicle.  Why do you think that such a technology can change the industry itself? This technology opens up the industry for disruption because it creates a system where no trust is necessary. Consumers don't have to go through an intermediary in order to acquire services. With VINChain, consumers get their data straight from the data provider.

The conference was held during the annual Used Car Week of 2017. The event was widely attended by shareholders, professionals within the industry and experts from all over the world. During this time, representatives from Vinchain made numerous presentations to the audience regarding the current project.  The CEO, Mr Alex Miles was also in attendance and was able to interact freely with various parties in the automotive industry. He explained the finer details of the project, answered questions from numerous parties and also explained what the corporation seeks to achieve with the project and exactly how they are going to get it done.  One of the highlights of the event was the discovery of the blockchain ability to store data. A lot of people were unaware of this development and did not think it would be possible. The conference also created a platform for contracts and agreements to be made between Vinchain and associated corporations in the industry. The only thing that is left is to communicate with these corporations, honour the contracts and begin working towards a better and brighter future.

ICOs are the best and quickest way that start-ups are raising capital in the blockchain industry. ICOs are like IPOs (Initial Public Offering) which is an event that a company opens up its shares to be traded by investors in the public. Just like the company puts up its shares for sale to the public in IPOs, new projects trade their crypto-tokens for bitcoin and ether in ICOs. Quite a number of start-ups have been able to raise an unjustified amount of capitals. Moreover, ICOs also open up a new world of opportunities.  Vinchain plans to take the opportunities that ICOs offer. An ICO (Initial coin offering) is a great way to see if our project will actually find a feedback from people. It’s a great way to find out if it will be a demand among others and if people understand the concept the way we do. Most importantly, ICO is a good way for any startup to collect money on the project as it's easy to invest through it where there can be lots of investors.  An ICO is a brilliant idea for startups as they usually don't have a huge budget as it does not require any spending at the beginning. All you need is a great idea and a business plan that people will want to support and will believe in. We believe that Vinchain can significantly change the industry and help the automotive business to develop in a way that there is a new level of understanding between customers and dealers. Therefore, creating an ICO opens up the door to the people in the automotive business to contribute to the development of our project.",False

Ever since the launch of digital currencies, many people have explored what other possibilities are there when you implement the blockchain technology. Blockchain technology solves any problem associated with a centralized system. Using technology that fully depends on a centralized system has become rather difficult especially since the beginning of the Internet. Poor data storage systems have led to the increase in cyber crimes. In the automotive industry, several buyers have purchased ‘bad’ cars due to manipulation or misrepresentation of information by the seller. This is because records on vehicles are being stored by a person or company. Needless to say, having a centralized data storage system for all vehicle records gives room for manipulation for personal gains.  However, Vinchain seeks to solve this huge problem with the help of the Blockchain technology. With its help, the information will always be transparent and up-to-date due to the decentralization of information. No one will be able to influence the data for their own aim. There will be no possibilities of losing any data. Everyone who is interested will be able to get the access to this information.  It will also benefit every member of the automotive business, companies, and services that are connected with it. Also, the rewarding system will be fair and clear. You will receive your tokens for each request that is done by anyone on that info according to the rate of information you give us. Vinchain hopes to offer this service as soon as the project has successfully been implemented.",False

Aleksey Listopad - CMO  Every now and then, it is not uncommon to see individuals who have exceptional careers in their respective professions. However, it is harder to find those who scale the heights of professional ladders at a very young age. Aleksey Listopad is one of these people. Since he was just a boy, Aleksey developed a keen interest for business. He was curious to know how all the moving parts came together to create a system that is so diverse but remains fully functional. This prompted him to choose a career path that is business oriented by enrolling at the Belarusian State Technical University to study marketing.  Unlike most of his peers, Aleksey preferred to stay proactive while he pursued his career. He created his first business venture at the tender age of 19. The company, which was called 'The Logistic Club', was created to handle all logistical and marketing activities of their clients. While at the company, Aleksey worked as a marketing specialist. The newly founded corporation not only allowed him to put all the knowledge he was acquiring at the university in perspective, it also allowed him to learn what it means to be a marketing professional and also helped him create a name for himself in the industry.  After he graduated, Aleksey began working as the Head of Marketing at Better Bid Car Auction LLC. During his tenure, he managed to bring 9 major projects to the US market. This was a feat that none of his predecessors had managed to achieve at the corporation. He accepted a job offer at Vinchain after he left Better Bid Car Auction LLC and now works as the Chief Sales and Marketing Officer.",False

According to a survey carried out in 2013, customers believe that car dealers make a 20% profit on a new car. However, the study revealed that this was not the case. The car dealers actually make a profit of 3.8% on any new car sold and much lower on used car. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the study gave an indication that the lack of transparency in the car buying process was the reason for this belief system.  Nowadays, there is a huge mistrust between dealers and customers. Due to the lack of information and existence of centralized data storage systems which is marred with many faults, customers have many doubts when purchasing a used car. These systems allow room for manipulation of data such as changing the provided date for your own benefit. Also, sometimes the dealer might demand a lower price because he has no idea about the real price of the car as sold in the market. Among others, these are some of the challenges that a dealer will no longer face once we launch the decentralized vehicle database.  Vinchain will give access to authentic information about all the cars so that all providers have transparency on the vehicle records. Because of the Blockchain technology, the information can be accessed by multiple users from anywhere in the world but can never be altered or deleted. With the help of Vinchain, a dealer will be able to accurately determine the market value of the car. He/she will be able to provide full information about the car when selling it, so that the customer will not have any trust issues. Vinchain creates transparency in the car buying process. As a result in a medium-term perspective, this is a winning strategy for building loyalty among consumers.",False

Following on from that amazing news, today we are proud to announce that we have made our first partner, AutoInspect.us LLC.

This is a huge step forward for us, and one that we do not take for granted.   AutoInspect.us LLC will also become the first strategic partner in creating a transparent vehicle history.

Some had no idea what Blockchain is and why it's important while some were very familiar with it and had very good technical questions. We interacted with so many people from all walks of life and answered all their questions about our project. We met a lot of people and even created new networks from that conference.  Overall, everyone was interested in the idea of how Blockchain technology can solve some key problems that the world faces. With every person that visited our stand, we offered the best customer experience by giving him/her undivided attention while explaining the concept. In the end, they left satisfied and happy to have known about our idea to create a decentralized vehicle database.  We also had a chance to speak to other exhibitors and find out more about their businesses. Many of the other companies said that they were interested in monetizing their data although they were not sure if they can because of their contracts. We agreed to stay in touch and continue discussions on this topic. Some of the companies we talked to included ADD123, WeGoLook, SGS and a few others.
