Just a quick comment on this in the form of a reminder that the nature of GET protocol is anti-fragile to general crypto sentiment, due to its consumer-driven demand. Of course everyone would much rather be in a bull market, but this does mean that as long as there is real-world demand (people buying tickets through the protocol), there will be liquidity and growth. The buy-backs from the open market which will begin in Q3 of this year will do exactly that.  You can see a projection of what this will look like in a blog on the buy-back: https://blog.guts.tickets/buy-backs-in-q3-q4-of-2018-140-000-tickets-in-total-using-84-000-in-get-8ba9e0e59e83  Hope this gives some clarity!",False

Just over a week ago, more than 50.000 tickets were sold by GET Protocol's first user GUTS Tickets in under 4 hours. These tickets were all part of a big batch of shows from the Dutch comedian Jochem Myjer in the Royal Dutch Theatre Carré. This sale marked the first time ownership states and changes for the tickets were registered on the Ethereum main-net. For more about this sale you can check out this blog:  https://blog.guts.tickets/the-things-you-learn-when-you-sell-50-000-tickets-in-3-5-hours-5f991cd1fe1a   This first main-net sale also meant that the protocol needed to conduct its first buy-back, buying GET from the open market to satisfy the Event Organizer's (in this case royal theatre Carré) demand for GET tokens in order to register and distribute the tickets. More info on why & how this works here:  https://blog.guts.tickets/fueling-up-on-get-to-cure-50-000-no-coiners-on-a-casual-saturday-morning-885d909a25a5   The first ever GET Protocol buy-back auction was held on Sunday, September 30th 2018, and completed within 20 seconds. You can track the submitted transactions by following the link below:  https://etherscan.io/address/0x15732Db2a067e57b060B7759B01f6d72C98d3b0C#tokentxns   What might be more important than the success and speed of the buy-back is the fact that the chain of events (sale & subsequent buy-back), proves the concept and structure of the protocol - all driven by actual, real world demand.

In my opinion, a very solid project. They have won a tech startup price in The Netherlands, already have a fully working product (already selling tickets, for example for a well-known Dutch comedian) and have the manager of Martin Garrix as an advisor. Which has huge potential, as his network in the music industry is very extensive and Martin Garrix also does a couple of solo shows in Amsterdam with around 15.000 people each.

So yeah it was a slow start, our main-stream marketing is just about to take root and will increase in upcoming weeks. It is completely true we don't have the FOMO driven sales frenzy you see with other ICO's out there. Avoiding this FOMO motivation was intentional and by design. I don't know if you were aware but we have used an ICO application (based upon the infrastructure of our smart ticketing application that is already in use). Read more about it here https://blog.guts.tickets/the-ico-application-how-it-works-f65c41465dec. The reasoning (as you can read in that blog) is to improve upon the ICO experience and actually lay a foundation for a token that is based on more than FOMO alone. I think you'll find this foundation/philosophy in a lot of aspects on how we approach our endeavors.  As for larger investments, yes we do very much expect several larger pledges to come in upcoming days/weeks. We are in talks with several groups/syndicates but have chosen to first let the community do their rounds. I highly recommend checking out our blog as we are very transparent in all the choices we make! Let me know if there is anything else I can help you with!",False

No hype. That is a good thing in a way. In the sense that there is no FOMO fueling this ICO/GET valuation. But if you have following this project for a while you should have noticed this is intentional. We are actually founding/basing our proposition on a lot more than FOMO value alone. We don't want to have a community of pump and dumpers that are only in it to flip the coin because they expect people will buy it on exchanges, or add some empty partnership. We don't like empty stuff, we like full stuff. Like the events, we sell out weekly with our smart ticket application. This will create demand for GET by actual event organizers, believe me, this type of demand is a lot more sustainable growth model than the pump/hype/announcing-an-announcement that currently drive digital asset prices.  It's pretty easy to interpet what I am saying here as some stupid try-hard excuses to rectify a slow crowdsale. Sure we would have liked the sale to have sold out or at least that there would have been a more solid stream om contributions. But as I look at it the underlying value of our concept and working product is still the same.    It all comes down to if you believe in the fundamentals of this company. Especially if you benchmark us to other smart ticket crypto projects. In the contrary, to aventus or blocktix we are fully operational and have a 10 people strong on-site team in Amsterdam for almost 16 months now. Fully dedicated to smart ticketing on the blockchain. We have a full event feed we already provide blockchain ticketing for against competitive rates. Check it our here: https://events.guts.tickets/events.

From the blog:  The GET-Protocol buy-back mechanism  The protocol's token, the GET, has to be acquired by event organizers in order to use the protocol smart ticketing contracts that are able to transact with the consumers smart wallets. The event organizer (EO) is not able to directly acquire GET from the open market, the EO purchases the GET needed to ticket a certain event from the stability fund(SF). The price the EO will pay per GET to the SF is dependent on the market GET price average provided by the GET price Oracle (GPO). The SFs programming dictates that the price per GET will not be lower than €0.50 per GET (even if the GPO indicates that the GET price on exchanges is lower). As the EO will pay at least €0.50 per GET it buys from the stability fund, the SF will always offer the open market token holder with at least that same price.  If the average price on the exchanges listing GET is for example €2.50, the EO will have to pay the same amount in FIAT but will receive less GET in return from the SF. A higher GET price thus won't hurt the competitiveness of the ticketing protocol as the net costs (in FIAT) for the EO aren't effected by the price inflation of the token. This mechanism provides the EO with a stable protocol price while providing the token holder on the open market with a certain level of investment security.",False

While hitting the hard cap in a few days would be great I wouldn't expect as default it or be really disappointed when this doesn't happen within the first few days of the sale.  The point you should understand is that the GUTS proposition is quite solid and we already have an operational ticketing business which already guarantees token usage and thus a solid token evaluation. We have really solid proposition/proven use case with a guaranteed exchange rate mechanism which will act as a price bottom on exchanges(€0.50). Long story short (I'll do a blog on this) - the way we see it is that our token and the mechanism of the protocol (so recycling and burning per event cycle) will guarantee a sustainable value utility/value. As we have hit our soft-cap we already have funds to build the protocol, more funds will only give us the possibility to build it quicker and do more marketing/acquisition.  The only thing you'll have to trust us on is if we'll do ticketing on the protocol, and the great thing is. We are already doing that.

After we gave all early-whitelisters the opportunity (if they haven't yet, they still can!) we opened up the app for everyone to make a whitelist request and immediately join the queue.  Bottomline: not all early whitelisters have contributed yet, but since we're not going to wait for them, everyone can now make a request to get whitelisted. We already whitelisted some new people during the day today which were able to contribute. You can always make a whitelist request here: https://ico.guts.tickets/  New requests of whitelisters will be in the queue in a paused state until tomorrow (they can't contribute yet, but older white listers still can!). Every request will get an email when you can contribute and the app will also show your position. So submit a request and we'll let you know when it is your turn!  Once you are through, you can always contribute immediately with no deadline (until the sale is full of course). Even the whitelisted people that haven't contributed yet are still able to do so! Remember we built this to make the ICO experience better not worse! This way (with this low cap) everybody has the time to GET into this ICO and create a solid distribution.  We notice now a few people are confused by this system, and we can only conclude that this is our fault in not communicating it well enough. We will definitely work on this, and make sure it more clear when the next tier starts. All feedback is welcome!",False

The pre-sale of the GET-protocol will commence tomorrow on October 25 2017 at 13:00 CEST. In order to be able to contribute you need to be whitelisted. You can whitelist yourself by submitting your details on our website. For managing all contributors who want to participate we will use a similar online application that we use when facilitating the sale of tickets for events. That way we will showcase our very own product by the GET token allocation event itself. You can get a spot in the waiting line already a few hours before the starting time. When the pre-sale has begun and when it is your turn, you will be told your contribution address to send your funds to. For more information about how to contribute, please our blog post How to contribute to the crowdsale of the GET-protocol.  Note that the only official information concerning the crowdsale will be shared through this ICO application hosted on our website or via our official blog.  What you need to know      - DO NOT send funds from any cryptocurrence exchanges like Coinbase, Bitfinex, Bitrex and many more. Read further to learn which platforms you CAN use.     - The crowdsale will start 25 Oct. 13:00 CEST. DO NOT send your funds before the crowdsale has begun.     - Set the Gas Limit to 250,000 (important) and Gas price at 21 gwei in case you will be asked to set it.     - The amount of GET tokens corresponding to the amount contributed will be sent immediately to the wallet from which the ETH arrived. It will not be immediately tradable. Tokens will be able to move on the 20th day after the end of the ICO.     - By participating in this crowdsale you agree to the terms of exchange and confirm that you are not a citizen of the USA.  IMPORTANT:      Do NOT send ETH before the crowdsale starts at Oct. 25th 13:00 CEST.     Do NOT use exchange services to attempt to purchase GET.     ONLY use the platforms mentioned below.",False

So the buy-back guarantee is funded by event organizers using the protocol (and a few of them are already doing so ) These event organizers need GET in order to create smart tickets and run events on the protocol and so buy these GETs from the Stability Fund. After this ETH transaction, the Stability Fund will buy back the GET that was transferred to the Event Organizer from the open market. Please note that EOs can't directly buy GET from the open market, the only way to acquire GET is with the stability fund mechanism. This means that the stability fund will set the price the EO pays per GET. The price is the SF charges the EO is based on the averaging of the GET price on exchanges for a certain time span. There is a 'hard coded' minimum price per GET that the stability will always have the event organizer pay and that minimum price is €0.50 per GET.  So that is a general explanation, now for your specific question. If the price average price per GET is €0.40 then the EO that needs a certain amount of value covered for the event in GET will pay €0.50 per GET as this is the minimum set by the stability fund.  TLDR to your question: Yes, you would still receive €0.50 per GET, taken that at the moment you want to exchange GET for ETH  the stability fund is in the process of buying back GET. The stability fund will only need to do so if there are event organizers that on their part are buying GET from the SF on the 'protocol side'.  In the end €0.50 is the minimal/gauranteed amount you will receive at leatst for your GET, assuming GUTS Tickets will be able to onboard event organizers to use the protocol for their ticketing. And we got that covered  Let me know if this explanation clears it up!",False

If you would read back a bit you would see a lot of explanations of how we are differentiating from both blockchain as non-blockchain competition. As I don't want to spam this thread with some reiterated answer I would advise scrolling back and study some of the responses.  So apart from that I believe that GUTS Tickets has a bit more established company and a more experienced founding team there are of course quite some similarities in the white paper (must be a coincidence right ) Anyways I don't really like to criticize other projects and as such I would just encourage to do your due-diligence on every product you consider investing in.  I personally believe that rushing an ICO can be an indicator of not wanting long-term attention on the project you are proposing in the hope to just build a short-term hype train and attain funding. This is a valid strategy of course, I am not implying any malicious intent here on the side of crypto.tickets all I am saying is that the angle we have chosen at GUTS is to really build a community around our porject. That is why we have been active here for quite a few months now and have our ICO planned in November as we really want to take the time to inform the contributors and show them what we are capable of.

We are happy to announce that we published the details concerning our GET ICO! Straight out of our blog post:  Details of the ICO      Date: Mid/end of November     Duration of ICO: 14 days     Total amount of tokens : 90 million tokens minted     Min. cap: €2.3 million (lowered value)     Max. cap: €15.0 million (lowered value) Public Crowdsale | 41% |  As can the diagram shown above, 41% of the total tokens minted will be sold to contributors during the ICO period. Tokens that remain unsold after this period will be destroyed.  User growth fund | 30% |  The user growth fund promote protocol usage by rewarding both event organizers and consumers for using the GET-protocol.  GET Stability Fund | 14% |  The GET stability fund will act as an stabilizing buffer for event organizers to acquire GET so they can use the GET for their events. The stability fund acts as a siphon and will buy back GET from the market. This means that there will always be approximately 14% of the total amount of issued tokens in this fund.  Team and advisers | 13% |  Of the total amount attributed to GUTS Tickets team members 6% is distributed after the ICO, the remaining 7% is set aside for future team members. For each issuance there will always be a standard vesting period of minimally 12 months before the tokens become spendable.  Contingency | 2% |  Amount of raised funds is set aside for unexpected expenses. ICO price tiers  The amount of tokens sold per tier will be announced at a later date. The queuing and tiering contract infrastructure will both be dynamically managed by GUTS own smart ticketing system.  Mechanics of the crowd sale  As crowd sales in the past have been riddled with chaos and uncertainty. During the GET-protocol ICO we want to prevent this type of network cluttering and general chaos from occurring. Therefore GUTS Tickets has decided to self-built queuing application.  Dynamic ICO queuing application  To manage the contributions during the ICO a custom version of the ticket queuing module will be utilized. This queuing application, which will be a customized version of our own tested and operational smart ticketing application, will serve every contributor with a unique contribution instructions at a certain time. By using this application we are able to showcase our tech while at the same ensuring that scammers can’t copy or mirror our front-end in an attempt to lure contributors. ICO contract publication & audit  The contracts used during the ICO will be made public in the weeks preceding the ICO this will be accompanied with a bug-bounty campaign. GUTS Tickets will only use audited and tested contracts.  Details on the GET presale  A portion of tokens sold to the public have been sold to strategic partners of GUTS Tickets. These pre-sale token contributors share long term goals with GUTS Tickets and in some cases will only receive these tokens if they have delivered on a certain ticketing volume.  At the moment of publication of this blog post the GUTS Tickets advisers and partnerships have not been announced to the public yet. Subscribe to our medium blog or join our Slack channel to keep up to date with the latest developments in our quest to revolutionize the ticketing industry.  The wallet address containing the funds raised during the strategic presale will be made public.  Buy-back guarantee  We believe that the GET-protocol ICO contributors deserve a certain level of certainty for their investment in the development and roll-out of the GET-protocol. This certainty is provided by the buy-back mechanism, this mechanism enables token holders to sell their GET back to the event organizer when so that the tokens can be used in the protocol as a store of value for the event ticket value during the event cycle. The GET-Protocol buy-back mechanism  The protocols token, the GET, has to be acquired by event organizers in order to use the protocols smart ticketing contracts that are able to transact with the consumers smart wallets. The event organizer(EO) is not able to directly acquire GET from the open market, the EO purchases the GET needed to ticket a certain event from the stability fund(SF). The price the EO will pay per GET to the SF is dependent on the market GET price average provided by the GET price Oracle (GPO). The SFs programming dictates that the price per GET will not be lower than €0.50 per GET (even if the GPO indicates that the GET price on exchanges is lower). As the EO will pay at least €0.50 per GET it buys from the stability fund, the SF will always offer the open market token holder with at least that same price.  If the average price on the exchanges listing GET is for example €2.50, the EO will have to pay the same amount in FIAT but will receive less GET in return from the SF. A higher GET price thus won't hurt the competitiveness of the ticketing protocol as the net costs (in FIAT) for the EO aren't effected by the price inflation of the token. This mechanism provides the EO with a stable protocol price while providing the token holder on the open market with a certain level of investment security. GET price on the open market  It is important to note that the €0.50 price pegging is only internal and arbitrage between the internal GET and the open market is not possible. The GET price on the exchanges is allowed to valued in anyway the market sees fit. Diagram displaying the fiat/GET/ETH flow during an event cycle. After the GET purchase of the EO the stability fund will buy the GET back from the market for the price provided by GPO. Source: GET-protocol white paper.  The GET price oracle (GPO)  The function of the GPO is to assess for the stability fund what a fair value for the GET is at the moment a EO needs GET to run an event. The oracle makes this price evaluation on the basis of data input of a set of curated exchanges that list GET.  Making sense of the buy-back mechanism  From an ICO investor point of view a case can be made that this guaranteed minimal buy-back price of €0.50 ”is too good to be true”. At face value this seems like a logical conclusion as the guarantee of the GET-protocol basically promises that there is little to no risk of monetary loss. Since the investor will always be able to recoup his initial investment with profits by means of a buy back mechanism of the stability fund. This mechanism will buy GET back for a price minimal price of €0.50 / GET.  This buy-back promise doesn’t seem to make any economic sense from the perspective of the protocol itself as the buy-back price is higher that the price the protocol received for a GET at the ICO. Thus creating a net-loss from the perspective of the protocol. From this assessment one could come to the conclusion that this buy-back promise of the protocol must be simply untrue or at least unsustainable in the long run. However, this conclusion would be false, as one would have failed to distinguish the difference between the GET-protocol and the actor using the protocol; the ticketing company. This company is using the GET-protocol to serve their customers (event organizers / venue owners etc.) The ticketing company only uses the GET-protocol as a back bone/infrastructure cost to add the convenient features of smart tickets to the service they provide. The margins of the ticketing company lie in offering this full-service package to its clients, not in speculating in crypto tokens. The ticketing company, at the moment that they acquire GET, has already landed a client and thus ensured event specific revenue. As such the company won’t lose money paying €0.50/GET price as minimum fee as this base fee is just a vehicle for company to acquire the margin they make on the service they are providing.  Allocation of the raised funds All of the funds raised during the ICO will be managed by the GET foundation.

The industries you mention are good examples where the technology can be used as well. We also have had companies that excel in online hotel registrations (really well-known ones) approach us and asking if we would be interested in doing the same for that industry. These are all great opportunities and one could dream endlessly about how great it all could work if it would be done.  But at the end of the day, it is also really important to stay realistic and focus on market segments that allow you to implement your tech and expose it to real-world consumers as soon as possible. The aim is to fail quickly and often, finetuning the technology/protocol based upon real end-user feedback as you do so. As such the event space is perfect as it has real problems that can be solved with our tech and the way the industry is structured makes it perfect to test and improve the technology in incremental steps. As you can imagine train and bus tickets is a lot harder to experiment and fine tune with. First of all it a continuous service meaning that you can't stop or pause to implement improvements, you basically have to have all the fundamentals right at the get-go this is not impossible but when you want to do that it would really help to have some gained some real-world experience first.   I also would like to point out that apart from other industries and usecases being very interesting theoretically, GUTS/GET-protocol is first and foremost a ticketing system.

You are right in your assessment that there are some similarities with the Aventus ICO. There is some overlap in that Aventus also wants to provide a protocol/infrastructure that provides an internal primary and secondary market for ticket holders of a certain event. As finding similarities is quite easy, as both initiatives strive to solve the problems in the primary and secondary ticketing market I will focus on the differences in this post. I am not in any way trying to put Aventus down or criticize their approach/solution just want to provide you with my view on how these two companies are different.    Difference in execution / market penetration GUTS was founded in 2016 and has been active in the market since. As of now, GUTS tickets employs 9 people of which 6 are developers, some of these team members are relatively new, some of them have been with GUTS for quite some time. Between 6/2016 and 6/2017 this team has predominantly been preoccupied with developing and testing a ticketing system that works and is able serve the needs of both the event organizer as of the consumer using the system (so usability and UX wise) Only after GUTS had gained this valuable market experience (for examples check our blog!) in the several pilots GUTS conducted the decision was made to do an ICO in order to accelerate the growth and  further push toward more transparency and decentralization. With all these lessons gained by experience in mind, the GET-protocol white paper was written in the summer of 2017. At the moment of writing GUTS has an already live and operational product, with paying customers and a team that has formed organically of the course of 1.5 years.  Everything described in the white paper comes from a very practical 'but will it actually work' perspective and less from a 'wouldn't it be cool if' angle. I am not saying the Aventus WP is written from that angle, just mainly pointing out the GUTS white paper and its proposed and partially already realized and tested solutions are written with the operational/practical nuances of the industry in mind. Also, GUTS has already gained experience in how to onboard customers in a bootstrap manner, something you won't necessarily learn when you start off all comfortable.      Difference in concept / solution The Aventus solution seems to have a heavy focus on putting tickets on a name, which will mean that everyone entering the venue will have to identify him or herself with an ID or credit card. While this is approach will prevent that tickets can be sold outside of the system (as the verifiers at the venue will be able to look up to whom the ticket is registered) if will be very costly both monetarily(in manpower needed for verification) as in processing time(everybody has to be checked 1 by 1) In the past, there have been several bands that have demanded that their tickets are sold on name (there still are bands that require that) and as such there are ticketing companies specialized in that type of ticketing (Friendly Fire for example) The solution you can see working in our sandbox environment(and tested during real events) is based on phone verification via SMS(other verification methods will be added soon) In the age of mobile tickets we believe that the printed out QR has had its time and is ready to be retired. Aventus has mentioned on their blog a few weeks ago that in some cases (lower value ticket) they would consider nesting the tickets in phones cache like GUTS but they still seem to prefer to put the tickets on the buys name. While I can see that one would find that this point is quite a straw-man argument (somebody more objective should access that) I really do think that this difference is one of the more important one's concept wise. Aventus did propose a quite intuitive revenue sharing structure in their white paper for the secondary market (so that the original seller would also profit from the sales on the secondary market) GUTS currently only lets people sell their ticket for the original price (the fact that we currently do this is again more operational, but still give credit where credit is due - it is a cool idea that also inspired us in a way)  That being said, I encourage any initiative that strives to make the ticketing market more fair and transparent. It would be a 'scarcity mindset' to presume that there is only room for one blockchain based ticketing solution. Ticketmaster sells more than 500 million tickets a year (http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6890347/live-nation-2015-earnings-7-6-billion-revenue) and has a yearly revenue of more than 7 billion US dollars (in 2015) Competition (especially blockchain based solutions) will keep us sharp and innovative, in the end it all about execution and we sure as hell are ready for it    As mentioned you can verify everything I said by visiting our blog on Medium (https://blog.guts.tickets/), try out our Sandbox(https://sandbox.guts.tickets/) or research the 'realness/seriousness' of our clients for yourself!

This is a very good question and frankly a very important one. Therefore my answer will be a bit long!  The current system you observe in the sandbox and see in the screencaps in the original announcement is currently live and used by GUTS, a ticketing company. GUTS could, in essence, for the cost reduction reasons you mention yourself go without the blockchain registration without really losing the key benefits of this system.  Going for a 'native' database registration by GUTS would make the system less transparent for consumers as GUTS could make these state-changes unavailable for the public or could (in theory) present false state-change data. This lack of transparency is what causes a lot of problems observed in the market at the present moment. With companies as Ticketmaster owning secondary ticketing markets and more sketchy business models that are allowed to exist due to this darkness/lack of transparency.  So up until now, I haven't explained why a blockchain is necessary to solve the problems in this industry, only why it would be 'nice' to have one. This is obviously not strong enough of an argument to go to market. So let's get into the real reason we need the blockchain and why the market will move towards a blockchain solution. First of all, it is important to distinguish the difference between GUTS Tickets (the ticketing company)  and the GET-protocol, the protocol that will be run by an independent foundation/entity and that will build the open protocol for other ticketing companies to use so not only for ticketing company GUTS. GUTS will use the protocol as well but as just another ticketing company. By being an underlying protocol/API this initiative can scale quickly as existing ticketing companies with there existing clients can implement the GET-protocol and add smart ticket features without changing a lot of their business model and 'front-end'.  So in a sense, the blockchain is needed because it enables the smart ticket solution described and tested in the market by ticketing company GUTS to scale. The protocol will create wallets for every unique user (currently we verify by SMS, but we are researching other unique-ness measures, like social logins but also decentral identity solutions like CIVIC) With this unique account tied to the user they will still always have the same wallet address even if you are buying a ticket in a different country or from a different event organizer. For consumers this would mean they would only need one verified account with the GET-protocol, that has an ethereum wallet connected to it, to buy tickets with every event-organizers or ticketing company worldwide. Pretty cool. Apart from the standardization aspect the blockchain provides, there is the role of the GET and its distribution/economy of the token in the event ticketing value chain. Transferring the tokens among these actors also requires a blockchain, as you well know. Especially as it is our roadmap to eventually cover the whole value of the ticket instead of only the transaction costs. This would greatly reduce the transaction and processing costs in FIAT/crypto conversion that currently are present in the secondary market.  More on the tokens role in this system can be found in the white paper.  So that is the fundamental reason we believe that blockchain is the solution to the problems in this industry. But we also believe that apart from solving the problems in the industry this protocol can actually add a whole new layer to the event experience. Currently, an event ticket is just a QR code on a piece of paper / on your phone. But with this tech + the blockchain, it can be much more. Beverage and drink tokens that belong to a certain event-organizer can be added to a wallet and used the next time you visit the event of this organizer! Or these beverage tokens can be transferred to your friends via the GET-protocol wallet etc. The days of entering an event with a piece of paper and buying plastic coins is over:)  I hope this answer is sufficient, I may have to edit it a bit as I am in a bit of a hurry. But I think the overall message is clear. In upcoming weeks we will add more information about our roadmap and future rollout plans of the protocol GUTS is a company that is live in the market with a ticket application and real event-organizers using our service. As such the team has their hands full with development tasks to make these customers happy. We have a big ticket sale coming up in a week after this more developer time will be available to put our future plans for the protocol into writing and tell you guys more about the ICO. I would strongly recommend reading our white paper in the mean time!",False

I am not sure when you exactly white listed yourself, but if it was fairly recent you might have missed the email we sent out to all our Slack requesters/white listers. As this may message is relevant for all people interested in this project I'll add it to this bitcointalk thread as well.  ---  Thank you for your interest in the GET-protocol ICO. We have received your white list request in good order.   We have decided to postpone publishing specifics concerning the ICO until September 1. The reasoning behind this decision is that the GUTS development team is currently too occupied with deadlines concerning an upcoming ticket sale. During this ticket sale, another big Jochem Myjer theatre show, important new features of the ticket application will be pushed to production. Recently developed features as the live sales dashboard for the event organizers (Hekwerk in this case),  the seating algorithm and load balancing improvements will be put to the test. Also, in upcoming days, GUTS will be monitoring a rather important smart ticket verification event (these tickets were sold on 9 July, the ticket trade of both the primary and the secondary market can be observed on the blockchain: etherscan)  As we believe that developing, new features, testing our application and making our customers happy is crucial to the success of the ICO as well, we find that postponing opening the direct message channels is beneficial for everyone involved with the project.  If you have questions about the protocol please fire away publically at our bitcointalk announcement thread, we have nothing to hide.

GET is listed on Qryptos! See a recent update (June 2018) about exchanges and what we've been working on at the bottom of this message.    For a complete overview of the distribution and allocation of GET: Wrapping up - the finalization spreadsheet    You asked, we answered. ""So whats the difference between GUTS and Aventus?""    How to add GET to your wallet.     GUTS is a ticketing platform which uses blockchain technology to register ownership of smart tickets by doing so GUTS makes ticket fraud impossible. The purchased smart tickets can only be resold within a fixed price range, this means no more disgraceful prices for (secondary) tickets.   GUTS is live GUTS Tickets has a live smart ticketing application with paying event organizers in the Netherlands ticketing with the application. With the proof-of-concept and practical market experience of developing and operating a ticketing company the GET Protocol described in our white paper was designed. The protocol will allow all event-organizers and venue holders to securely add smart ticket attributes to their tickets without having knowledge of crypto or smart contracts. During the ICO period the protocols own ERC20 token, the GET, will be up for sale. In the white paper more information about the GET token and the protocols GET buy-back guarantee can be found.   Transparency for all stakeholders GUTS provides a transparent ticketing platform built upon ethereum blockchain that holds no surprises for clients and customers when it comes to pricing. What you see is what you get. GUTS is a user-friendly platform that keeps the process of purchasing a ticket as simple and clean as possible for all parties involved. We strongly believe in blockchain technology and the opportunities it has to offer to the event ticketing industry.   Usability for the end-user The GUTS ticket platform facilitates fair-use and a good user-experience. We issue smart tickets to the customer that are protected from anyone with bad intentions. Furthermore, we provide an internal exchange platform that allows customers to easily resell their tickets within fixed boundaries. A GUTS smart ticket will never leave the protocol, thereby guaranteeing access to each and every customer to the event at a fair price.   International Ambitions Currently GUTS Tickets is primarily active in the Dutch event market, as the company was founded in Amsterdam mid-2016. Since it's founding, the team has cycled through multiple development cycles with several pilot events improving the smart ticketing application based upon feedback of the event organizer. With the launch of the GET-protocol GUTS will be able to enter foreign markets by offering stakeholders in these countries the possibility to improve their ticketing by making use of the GET-protocol.    Have some GUTS, join our revolution!    Introducing the GET Protocol GUTS Tickets is fed up with the excessive profits made on event tickets on the secondary market. We are of the opinion that money is only to be made by those who deserve it, by the people and organizations who put so many efforts in servicing and entertaining the public. Furthermore, we want fair ticket prices for all fans. The introduction of the GET Protocol will be the first step towards eliminating the rotten parts of the secondary ticket-market.   The reason for the ICO When accessing the investment proposition of the GET Protocol and of its initiator, GUTS Tickets, one might ask himself the question, why does this company need a funding round in the first place? As GUTS seems to have a working smart ticket application, prominent clients and relevant industry partners that are already using and paying for the service GUTS provides them. The reason the ICO is needed is simple, while all these commercial and technical achievements may be beneficial for the company GUTS itself, these achievements aren't bringing the fundamental paradigm shift that is needed to tackle the problems in the ticketing industry. GUTS believes that changing the ticketing industry by being yet-another company competing for business in the crowded and competitive ticketing space will not be a strategy that will ultimately fundamentally change the way the industry operates.   GET Protocol: An open and accessible smart ticket platform for event organizers In order to bring fundamental change the protocol should enable all of the current stakeholders in the ticketing industry to participate and thrive. This will be ensured due to the open and inclusive character of the GET Protocol which will enable the existing stakeholder to add smart ticket attributes to their current product offering. This participation by all stakeholders that are willing to create a more open and transparent ticketing market will be ensured by the GET Protocol's own token; the GET. In our white paper more technical and economic details about this ERC20 token are provided. The fact that the GET-protocol operates upon the ethereum blockchain will guarantee a basic level of accountability and transparency for all stakeholders including the end user.       Hekwerk Theaterproducties BV - ASR Insurance - Innofest - Buma Stemra - Dutch Fintech Awards - Computable Awards     About Hekwerk Theaterproducties BV With more that 20 artists and comedians under their management this event organizer entertains more then 1 million visitors on a yearly basis. With names as Jochem Myjer, Youp van 't Hek en Veldhuis en Kemper, Hekwerk is one of Hollands most prominent event organizers in the Dutch theater scene. On 9 July GUTS sold it's first theater show on GUTS ticketing application. This event marked a landmark in the development of the GET Protocol. This event marked the first of a series of planned events for the Dutch event organizer Hekwerk Theaterproducties BV.   About our smart ticket application The three screen-shots displayed below showcase the UX-design of the GUTS smart ticket application. Note that these images aren't mock-ups or wire frames but actual screen captures from the working and live ticket application. Interact with our ticketing application in the sandbox environment!       Feature 1 - Creating an account on the application If you are reading this post you probably have at least a basic understanding of concepts like the blockchain and its usage of public and private keys. The average visitor going to an event does not have this understanding and in most cases is not interested in learning about these concepts. Therefor the GUTS application creates an ethereum wallet by verifying the phone number of the user that want to buy a event ticket. This verification will instantiate an ethereum smart wallet in the back-end of the protocol and assigning an unique ethereum wallet address to the users' account. This link will be become relevant later when assigning the purchased smart tickets' ownership to the user.      Feature 2 - Dynamic QR code After having purchased the smart ticket via the GUTS application the user will receive the tickets in the same web-app/browser session that was used to purchase the tickets initially. The purchased tickets will stay available/accessible in the browser of the customers phone (as the pseudonymous data-object cached in the phones memory).  When the user wants to access the tickets surfing to https://events.guts.tickets will automatically serve the user the dynamic smart ticket web-app displayed below with the tickets purchased by the user.     Feature 3 - Selling the smart ticket on the internal secondary market As the user is legally the owner of the ticket one should be able to easily sell the ticket in case they are suddenly unable to attend the event. GUTS acknowledges this need and thus have added the possibility of putting your smart ticket for sale in the smart ticket object of the web-app. If a user wants to sell his or her ticket outside of the protocol, he or she isn't able to do so as the QR code isn't visible. The steps of selling a ticket on the GET Protocol is displayed in this series of screen shots. Take note that all these actions all happen in the browser of the users phone. No app or specific software is needed to interact with the ticket application. Buy your own smart ticket (for free) and put it for sale on our smart ticket sandbox!      Step 4.  Blockchain registration In this phase of development the GUTS application registers every state change of ticket ownership on the blockchain. See for yourself how the primary and secondary market register state changes for the Jochem Myjer show on 22 September on etherscan.       To inform yourself about why the GET token is needed for this protocol to work please read our white paper!     GUTS is live, buy your own free smart event ticket (and put it for sale) on our smart ticket sandbox! I want a smart event ticket!        The team While solution design and the underlying logic of a protocol are both crucial for a whether an initiative becomes reality, an integral part of every ambitious en-devour will always be the people making it happen. As the future is unpredictable we expect that our convictions will be challenged and that pivots will be necessary in order to make our vision reality. Over the last year the GUTS team has proven it is able to hustle in the event industry, commercially by on-boarding the prominent event organizer Hekwerk to run three pilot shows with GUTS for one of Netherlands most prominent comedians; Jochem Myjer. GUTS ability to hustle and pivot on the technical front was tested and proven as the company was the first ticketing company to completely merge, with help of the ethereum blockchain, the primary and secondary ticketing market on one and the same ticketing application.

I am aware of the details of the Aventus project and how they are approaching the core problem in the ticketing industry. The first big distinction with Aventus is that they intend to put the event-tickets on their system on a consumers name/id/creditcard. GUTS has experience in the ticketing industry and we know for a fact that this can be quite problematic both from a verification perspective as well from a secondary market perspective. Especially when events scale and a lot of people need to get in at the same time (like with soccer matches) As for the reselling, people want to be able to resell their ticket easily and GUTS facilitates that with a dynamic QR code and a smart ticket web-app that can also put tickets for sale (you can try out how our live ticketing app works here: https://sandbox.guts.tickets/ ) We have a demo video on our blog as well that walks through all the steps, it all happens in the phone's browser (https://vimeo.com/199637753) Not saying that their solution won't work, it's just a different approach.  Besides from that distinction I find we are a bit further ahead client acquisition wise. We recently sold out a theatre show with 700 seats with our system. You can see the state-changes of the trade of tickets between consumers on the ethereum test net here: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x81ab999c1f3bcd0780d0a46dafc8842ca1738ec2  We are very much live and have serious paying customers using protocol.  There are more differences between the two projects, like the utilitarian value of the protocols token. In the end it comes down to different views/philosophies on the core problem. They seem to approach the problems in the ticketing industry more from a B2B perspective, creating new event-marketing and promotion mechanisms and incentives powered by their token. While we offer a more B2C platform in which consumers with smart tickets can trade their tickets safely and with fair margins over our protocol, fueled by our token.  In the end, I am very interested and will keep tracking how the Aventus team will move forward. I've been impressed with their marketing and demo's so far. To bring actual change to this troubled industry, we can use any help we can get so I applaud them.",False
