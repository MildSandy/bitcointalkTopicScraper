OMG’s currency-agnostic decentralized exchange will allow users the freedom to exchange and manage any digitized asset. However, the volatility of many cryptocurrencies makes them less than ideal as a medium for everyday transactions, in which users want to know that the money they are sending will be worth the same amount when it arrives at its destination.  Stablecoins provide a relatively static benchmark (as static as the currency to which they are pegged) within the volatility of the crypto market. But most stablecoins are centralized, backed by reserves held by private entities whose self-assessment of their own trustworthiness often leaves much to be desired.

What does the cover mean? Well, I think I have an idea. The coin around the phoenix neck has the symbol of an empty set, ∅. So what is empty in cryptocurrency? Well Ethereum comes from the word Aether which in Old Newtonian physics was seemingly unexplainable empty medium in which light happens to pass through. So, ethereum of some sort is probably going to be the new global currency in 2018.

OmiseGO is uniquely ready to expand worldwide, and still remain perfectly legal in the regulations of every country, Japan and China included. I will explain further here: OmiseGO developers released the OmiseGO Software Development Kit (SDK). The SDK is a package of software tools and OmiseGO team support, so that any person or any company can develop their own application to utilize the OmiseGO Network rails. This makes it very easy for existing retailers or payment services companies to develop a user interface and run an application on OmiseGO Network. This is great for OMG token holders, because OmiseGO is Proof of Stake, and all transaction fees from the network are paid to PoS hodlers.  OmiseGO Network has a built in, on-chain, decentralized exchange. So currency swaps are written in to transactions. This makes it possible to fund your account with one currency, and then make payments from the same account in any other supported currency (at a coffee shop, for example).  This is what OmiseGO means when they say they are currency agnostic. This is also the most important part of OmiseGO when it comes to international regulation. Remember how OmiseGO SDK will allow other developers to make their own payment services apps that run on OmiseGO network? Well those developers can specify the currencies and types of trading behavior that are allowed on their specific application, and thus it is easy for those developers operate on OmiseGO Network and still comply with the regulations of any nation in the world.",False

This is Fuseki on our roadmap. As a reminder, the OmiseGO SDK is a code framework on which developers can build wallet applications that will eventually interact with the OmiseGO blockchain. We are also proud to announce the OmiseGO SDK is in the hands of one of our strategic partners, a huge multinational company that will help us develop one of our first live use cases. Furthermore, we would like to extend an invitation for keen developers to sign up for our OmiseGO SDK closed beta. We will be accepting applicants based upon their background and their potential to contribute to helping us get the SDK ready for open beta and then release. We are seeking people to provide feedback on all aspects of the development process: documentation, ease of use of the API, code style, code quality, etc. If you are interested in participating in our closed beta, please apply here https://goo.gl/forms/8WoL31ccfT57I67z1 The beta version of the OmiseGO SDK contains: A self-deployable OmiseGO API service Multiple language bindings for interacting with the API Demo iOS and Android app that demonstrates how to integrate the OmiseGO SDK We plan to work closely with our closed beta invitees to gather feedback and get ready for wider adoption. We expect to support them through the SDK development process and expand our documentation to be more self-serve once we enter open beta. Our next milestone is Sente which will be a full release of the code in an open beta. Cash In / Cash Out Details 73% of Southeast Asia is unbanked. That means a majority don’t have access to traditional banking infrastructure such as cards, loans, etc and primarily use fiat money for everything from getting paid to buying groceries. But, everyone has a smartphone and many companies have started building “e-wallet” apps where one can walk into a convenience store, give the teller cash, and it gets loaded onto a siloed utility app to pay the monthly utility bill.  Another well-known example is the Starbucks app, although dealing with cards, it’s an example of a wallet application that money goes into but cannot get out of besides paying for coffee. These apps all exist on a “closed loop” payment infrastructure. We want to open up these wallet siloes and have wallets exchange with each other. We believe this will make users happy and increase merchant volume.  Our goal with cash in and cash out touch points is to create a network of banking, hardware, and retail partners where users can deposit and withdraw their cash. The cash becomes tokenized on to their wallet application of choice, and is immediately exchangeable for other tokenized currencies and assets via the OmiseGO blockchain.  With integrated merchant mobile wallets, a decentralized exchange on a blockchain, and finally cash in / cash out touch points this fulfills the final part of our mission to unbank the banked. In addition to servicing the unbanked, what this really provides is an alternative to the current banking system. A free and open financial service network to all people, whether or not they have bank accounts.  Our ambitions are global, we are in active discussions with business partners and unfortunately there is not much we can publicly share. These discussions can take a very long time but rest assured, the talks have been very exciting for everyone involved.",False

Also As of my knowledge a lot of willing participants was refused by Bitcoin Suisse in this ICO. So do not worry the chances that you could participate was little to none.  I think investors was those who are very close involved in Omise Company and Ethereum Development.  Let say good friends of Vitalic, June,Gavin , Poon ,Bitfinex , people from Thai Ministerium of Finance ,McDonalds franchise CEO and others was the main investors in OmiseGo ICO.   https://www.bitcoinsuisse.ch/omise-go/     Minimum participation amount – 5’000 USD (not for everyone as you see, personaly I never would invest such a great amount to an unknown ICO) Maximum participation amount – 100’000 USD (I wish I could invest so much just in ICO)  Exchange rate – 1000 OMG : 1 ETH  ETH/USD price on ICO start/over: 209/285 USD for ETH  Thats mean you could get from 17 000 to 23 000 OMG with a minimum of 5000$   Basiclly if you would invested in OMG ICO a minimum required ammount of 5000$ you would get now 170 000 $$ - 230 000 $$. Depending on ETH/USD value.  Offcourse if everyone would be a participiant of this ICO the price would be never so stable like now. That means participants was allready rich people. Because for me to get from 5000$ 170 000$ is very huge. And I am 100% sure that I would fix that ammount of money. Because well...Its huge for me.  Thats why not everyone could participate in promising ICOs.   Hopefully we will see the big rise in q4 2017 with Mainnet Launch.

We're all hit with limitations, whether that be weekly or monthly of how much money can be pulled out of crypto. Think about China's situation for a second. Yes, they're moving around billions of cryptocoins, but what exchange/bank in China will allow such a withdrawal at a give moments notice. If anything, a side effect of the China BAN will be, CRYPTO-COINS IN LIMBO, because: 1. They couldn't cash out fast enough. 2. The exchanges are closed so they cant access. 3.

Basically, OmiseGo is an e-wallet and payment platform operating across currencies and assets.  Its advisory board consists of starry blockchain and Ethereum developers, including Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, and Joseph Poon.  OmiseGo is to create a platform for managing fiat/cryptocurrency/other assets with its powerful wallet Software Development Kit, used to ensure full interaction with OmiseGo network. It aims to solve a lot of problems, including settlement time, fees, transparency, security, finality.  OMG tokens, ERC-20 token based Ethereum until OMG blockchain is created, will be used to validate the Proof of Stake network of OmiseGo and serve a means for tokenholders to get rewards: more transactions on the OmiseGo blockchain – more benefits tokenholders receive. At press time, OMG takes the 1st place among all Ethereum’s assets being traded at slightly more than $9, with market cap making almost $893M, according to the coinmarketcap.com.  As have been said, OmiseGo is going to be a new blockchain, being closely integrated into Ethereum mainnet, which will enable its users to manage: fiat tokens, cryptocurrencies, other assets (including loyalty and reward points).  OmiseGo can be used in the following cases:  Remittances;Loyalty points;Mobile banking;Asset tracking;Digital gift cards;Tokenized fiat.  According to the team behind the project, one of the biggest markets they want to cover is $442B Remittances market, later moving to payments, loyalty and rewards, gaming and messenger platforms.

Humaniq started off with excellent PR and weekly video updates, until the week they had their first public meet up and product launch. Thats when the weekly updates stopped, they didnt reply to emails and have gone all quiet. While people tried contacting them on facebook and twitter, they would not reply but instead they just copy and paste blockchain news articles, perhaps to look active. I owned 10,000 HMQ at one point, but sold out at minimum loss when they started acting suspicious. If i didnt sell out, i would of lost over 60% of what i put in. Luckily i sold and reinvested in OMG , i am up 700% in 3 weeks because of OMG. I tried warning investors on the HMQ forum, but some thought i was trying to fud, even though i backed up everything i said.

It spiked so much recently it needs time to breathe and refuel. Pull up the chart for NEO for the last 2-4 weeks and look at the rollercoaster ppl had to endure and not sell in order to reach todays numbers (and it's mostly based on a hype campaign vs actual product/usage in place and working with more to come plus a huge dev team).  It can't just keep going up. But that aside - you have to look at the whole eco-system too.  - A LOT of coins got pumped like fuck recently.  - BTC keeps hitting new ATH's.  - The crazy spike was BOUND to correct, and now that it has, it's actually not nearly as bad as I expected. Might even dip down to the 5's still but I doubt it.  - People are chasing the new sub $1 spikes before coming back to $5+ coins that are rapidly rising until they get FOMO from smart investors/traders grabbing this dip.  - This thread isn't an actual announcement thread, in fact there isn't one, they've managed to get this far kind of under the radar compared to what others do/need to do.  - The airdrop that's about to happen to all ETH wallets is going to create mass awareness/appeal which will probably introduce tons of new money.  - I can keep adding to this but I'll stop here.  There is a good race going on for top 10 status among 5 or so coins that are climbing the ranks fast (I mean ones that will stay there not climb then dip forever)..  Now that this round of pumps is relaxing, and pretty much ALL the coins that were pumped are correcting, it's just a matter of time before it reverses and keeps hitting new ATH's.

The other avenue they are pursuing appears to be that they will also be using external (again meaning centralized) exchanges to kick-start the OMG token, which their longer-term plan is to supplant, or at least coexist with, a decentralized blockchain exchange.  There is no magic want to get from our current fiat system to a pure peer-to-peer system as it requires value and trust. The value will initially come from external and yes centralized entities, but their hope is over-time OMG develops the trust to take on a more decentralized approach.  Demanding that someone come up with all the answers at the onset of a project is foolhardy. As long as they have a long term vision and the current infrastructure to support it, I am sure they will work out the issues over time.

How is it possible if the price of coins constantly changes? At a lower fixed rate? - They claim to target ""unbanked"" asians. Ok!

Some of them allow BTC-USD exchange at a fixed internal rate. Many of them ask customers to go through online KYC procedure to unlock some of the features.

According to Omise website they do exactly the same thing now charging 3.65% (!) commission fee per transaction in it's service. - They say it is decentralised.. How, if all it's business would depend on an App in Google play Market and AppStore, that are controlled by US legislation? US Authorities can just ban Omise app in both appstores in case they would aware of ONE US citizen would have made a fiat transfer using a service that doesn't comply to KYC. This is what happened to BTC-E exchange recently. Is OmiseGo blockchain going to run on Omise infrastructure? Decentralised ??

It's basically an alternative payment network to fiat and cryptocurrency.  Hence the airdrop so people have OmiseGo to spend and receive as well as to stake nodes to process the transactions.  Chicken and egg.  It seems to be be uniquely aimed at the unbanked poor and can be co-branded by local businesses.  I guess if you're poor and have little fiat, then its not such a huge leap to get free OmiseGo via an airdrop or some other manner and learn the ropes.  It may all just be a clever tactic to get the next generation onto cryptocurrencies before they're invested too heavily into legacy fiat.

This may have something to do with how the token is abbreviated to OMG, which is fun. OmiseGO is an interesting, albeit ambitious project that aims to bank the unbanked by using Ethereum-based financial technology. Now is as good a time as any to delve deeper into this project.   OmiseGO is not the only project seeking to bank the unbanked using cryptocurrency technology. A lot of startups have been doing the exact same thing, including some of the recent successful cryptocurrency ICO projects. There will be fierce competition in this particular industry, which is both good and bad at the same time. It puts a lot of pressure on all teams working toward this goal, yet very few if any of them may actually succeed. Whether or not OmiseGO will do so remains to be seen.  The project itself is set up in a rather interesting way. OmiseGO uses public Ethereum-based financial technology so it can be used in traditional digital wallets. The team aims to enable real-time P2P value exchanges and payment services. All of this will be done on a global scale, rather than through localized efforts. Furthermore, the project will focus on both fiat currencies and decentralized currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others.  Bringing financial inclusion to the unbanked population is not easy. This is not due to a shortage of people, as there are nearly 2 billion unbanked individuals on the planet today. In most cases, that situation arose from existing problems such as individuals lacking access to birth certificates or an income. However, not everyone wishes to be included in the financial system either. A lot of people value the concept of living off the grid and not relying on global financial services.  There is also a fundamental problem in the traditional financial world. Not only are services somewhat subject to privileges for the middle class, there is also a severe lack of communication and coordination between service providers. According to the OmiseGO team, using a decentralized exchange on a public blockchain may alleviate a lot of those concerns. In their mind, anyone should be able to access any type of financial transaction in a decentralized and affordable manner. Its entire ecosystem will also remain hooked into the Ethereum mainnet.  In addition, there is also an OmiseGo white label wallet SDK to be taken advantage of. This project should allow for convenient integration of payment solutions on the network in the future. Digital wallets have slowly been gaining traction all over the world, and this project is looking to capitalize on that momentum. It will also create new opportunities for wallet service providers to focus on exchanging decentralized currencies and fiat money through its network.  The popularity of OmiseGo is currently on the rise. Although it is possible this is merely the result of someone artificially pumping the OMG price, the token sees a fair amount of trading volume. Right now, one OMG is valued at $3.03, which is quite a high value considering there are nearly 100 million tokens in circulation. There are over 140 million tokens in total. It is an intriguing project to keep an eye on, although one should never be fooled by initial success.",False

While the usual drumbeat of cryptocurrency innovation calls for 'banking the unbanked', a startup called Omise actually has the opposite goal: 'unbanking the banked'.  And with the help of Joseph Poon, co-author of bitcoin's Lightening Network white paper, the Thailand-based payment gateway network is building a decentralized exchange based onethereum to move toward that goal.  The decentralized exchange, which Poon has written another white paper for, is built directly into the company's upcoming proof-of-stake blockchain, OmiseGo. Once it's finished, users will be able to trade fiat currencies for cryptocurrencies, or exchange between almost any cryptocurrencies (say bitcoin for ether) without a third party like Coinbase or Kraken.  Eliminating middleman was cryptocurrency's original value proposition. Not to mention, trust in third parties is arguably what led to some of bitcoin’s most publicized disasters, including thefall of Mt Gox in 2014 and the $65m hack of Bitfinex last summer.  In contrast, Poon described the project as a sign of what's to come in the cryptocurrency space, calling the decentralized trading trend ""a big deal"".

What I mean is they had little publicity in the crypto world, but already are somewhat established in the traditional markets with a working product, agreements with payment processors and vendors, etc. This is how traditional company funding was typically acquired in the past, you had a prototype of sorts working and just needed funding to grow big.  This is the opposite approach of most current ICOs in that a lot of these have no working product and little more than a copy/paste whitepaper with a few things changed, a website with some name dropping (sometimes the people aren't even aware they are listed), and an army of paid hype promoters posting all over the place how great xyz ICO is going to be.  So while there has been some recent low-level hype of OMG as people are becoming aware of it, to me OmiseGo is the understated ICO that actually has a lot of real potential going forward.  So now for your question, you ask if it is going up after August 1st. Well no ones knows for sure, but this type of question seems to me to be a concern more for someone who simply wants to make a quick buck. If that is the case, you may be better off with one of the ICO's of the week and cash out as soon as they hit an exchange.  If you want a long term investment in a company that may actual grow and have a future, than I think OmiseGo will make a good investment. While it probably will not shoot up overnight, I think it has more the potential of a slow and steady growth over several months and years.",False

Good Day today. Have a nice Night   This sounds like my experience.  I was unable to get into the ICO as they had a lot of early outside interest that is why it was not publicized so much on the typical cryptocurrency promotion venues such as this forum. I did manage to invest some ETH into it when it first hit Bitfinex (scaled in from around 0.0024 to 0.0027) and have already cashed out my original investment plus some (had a standing sell order of half my investment at 0.006). So I now have a pretty good chunk of OmiseGo tokens for free basically. This allows me the luxury of not worrying about it no matter which way it goes, but I do have the feeling in a few months these prices will be looked back upon as incredibly cheap.  Myself, I think it is more promising than many of the other high profile ICOs out there and will buy in more if it drops down a bit in price again, say sub 0.05 or so.",False
