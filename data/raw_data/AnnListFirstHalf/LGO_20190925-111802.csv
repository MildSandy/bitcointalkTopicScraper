Up to that point, you can't use the tokens yet.  To clarify on your other question: You don't actually MOVE any tokens to the exchange. The tokens will never have to leave your Ledger, unless you want to sell obviously and you will pay just as much (or more) as the rest. Where's the advantage in that?
