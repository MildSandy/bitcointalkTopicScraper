Improved interface of the information panel (dashboard), in which ""Deposit"" and ""Withdrawal"" buttons was added. 4. Improved layout for Firefox browser. 5. Increased stability of the exchange, eliminated interface freezes while switching between markets and screens. 6. The option to select/view the balance in the desired currency with a convenient switch. 7. Improved the calendar to specify the expiration time of the order. 8. Improved design and layout elements. 9. The system login/logout and control of the user session. 10. Fixed issues with withdraw/deposit window, that now became more convenient for copy data from these windows. 11. Adaptation of the trading page (exchange) for wide screens monitors (aka ""rubber layout""). 12.

We are happy to anounce the expansion of trading functionality of DEEX exchange. The number of assets available for trading has been replenished with several new tokens.  The first is the token of SteX cryptocurrency exchange (https://stex.exchange/), cooperation with which we have previously anounced. Mutual listing between DEEX and SteX will allow traders of both platforms to use deex and STE tokens for operations. The deex token is the main asset of the DEEX cryptocurrency ecosystem and allows its holders not only to trade in pairs with popular cryptocurrencies, but also to get profit from ownership. A2A (Any-2-Any) technology used in the operation of the SteX token exchange, allows you to trade any cryptocurrency from the list of TOP-100 and exchange any assets with a single action. Placing the deex token on the SteX platform will increase liquidity and trading volumes, which will have a positive impact on the value of the asset.  Another token, which was listed on the DEEX exchange, has become the token of the Ice Rock Mining project (https://icerockmining.io), offering users to earn on the mining of cryptocurrencies. The project allows owners of this token to obtain a steady income with transparent system of distribution of profit between holders of the asset.  In the near future we plan to increase the number of cryptocurrencies available for trading.",False

The platform is unique for its short block generation time, proof-of-importance (POI) algorithm, and account ambiguity.  According the research of our financial and blockchain analysts, the NEM blockchain is ideal for building a transparent decentralized crypto Fund. It is this solution based on NEM plans to be presented by DEEX in the near future.

Support and development of the Bitshares ecosystem is one of the most important priorities for DEEX in both short and long terms.

We are pleased to announce the listing of Artex Global token on DEEX Exchange. Artex Global is a unique blockchain project, which cooperation with DEEX we recently reported about. It's a world-class development, a symbiosis of creativity and modern technologies. https://www.alpha.deex.exchange/market/ARTEX_DEEX  Listing of the Artex project tokens is the first step to expanding the services for listing of erc-20 tokens. Previously, we successfully tested interblockional atomic swaps an for our own token, now we are launching a mass program for listing erc-20 tokens of the most interesting projects. Now for such projects it doesn't make sense to seek listing on large and well-promoted exchanges, since it is fraught with losses of funds and removal from trading lists in the future due to sanctions and hard regulation actions for centralized crypto exchanges. Deex is a real help and salvation for such projects. Deex supports and will support promising developments in which blockchain technology is applicable practicaly and can benefit the entire community. Artex is such a project. This fall we plan to bring the project to a large-scale ICO, which will bring an additional liquidity to DEEX and increase profit for all tokenholders.  More information about the project Artex you'll find by watching the video on our YouTube channel https://youtu.be/2shwIMlNnQ4",False

We decided to support Roger's initiative and today we are happy to inform you that a gateway for BCH on DEEX is on.

Here comes the latest news from DEEX Exchange.   Dear participants of the DEEX bounty program!  We are pleased to officially announce that as part of the development of the main DEEX functionality we realized the possibility of creating exchange' accounts for users who had personal accounts in the bounty.deex.exchange system.  Registration is now available not only for investors, but also for those who participated in the promo campaign of the project. The main innovation of the implemented functionality has become the integration of user databases. Now all the accounts of the personal accounts are united into the one system, and those who have been registered in bounty.deex.exchange can check their charges and register through presale.deex.exchange. The new integrated system displays both tokens bought during the main ICO and distributed during the bounty campaign.  This is especially convenient for those who are both a participant in the bounty program and the investor of the project. Your data for entering the personal bounty accounts work in the investor's office. All who have not passed registration via DEEX system need to do this, as the next step before the opening of the exchange will be the transfer of tokens from users' wallets to the exchange accounts.

The development team completes the work on the gateways for the main crypto currencies, builds the server infrastructure. Also the work on the corporate style and usability of the project is in progress.  As a part of the functionality implementation of the decentralized financial DEEX ecosystem, the project developers continue to realize useful tools that will form the basis for building a highly efficient crypto exchange platform. As we reported earlier, the DEEX system will include a decentralized messenger and a place for ICO conduction. The first step in the implementation of these tasks is deex.chat (https://deex.chat) - a message aggregator that use the most popular instant messengers.  It's an important tool for comunication between members of the DEEX ecosystem. It still has to become a single point of entry into the DEEX system and now you can evaluate the convenience of a universal solution for communicating through habitual messengers and social networks. Come on deex.chat and communicate in the familiar environment. Questions about the functioning and operation of the project can be asked through the Viber and Telegram messengers, as well as using authorization from social networks VK, Odnoklassniki, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The number of available entry points will be expanded and supplemented.  The actions of the supervisory authorities regarding the functioning of the most popular Telegram messenger, as we see, have already led to a deterioration of communications in the crypto community environment. That's why the issue of creating a decentralized messenger now is more relevant than ever. That is why our own decentralized messenger will soon release.  We also draw your attention to the fact that the technical support of DEEX moves to the ticketing system and will operate through the technical tasks portal https://deexhelp.zendesk.com. Requests are accepted from users of the system and after processing and solving the existing technical problem you will receive an appropriate notification with the status of the current issue and comments of a technical specialist.  Such a system will allow us to solve the incoming questions more quickly and with higher quality. You can be sure that no request will be left without attention. With the launch of the this processing system the Telegram chat https://t.me/deexbug (@deexbug) will stop working and technical issues will not be considered through this channel.

Today, immediately after updating and correcting a number of bugs, about what we reported earlier, we are pleased to inform you about the launch of the ETH gateway.  There are some limitations for using this method of funds entering, which are designed primarily to protect users from losses when transferring large amounts of crypto. So, the limit of entering is 0.1 ETH, without the withdraw posibility. When you try to make a transaction for a larger amount of cryptocurrency, you risk to freeze your funds. The gateway is in debug mode, so this restriction is superimposed on all ETH transactions.  A detailed instruction describing the process of replenishing the exchange' wallets with ETH is available here  https://www.deex.exchange/instruction/eth-en.html  In the near future several more gateways for popular digital assets will be added.

This event was among the series of international blockchain conferences, where DEEX acts as the main sponsor.  For the city to attain status of crypto capital there are still issues that have to be overcome. One of the matters that were shared by all the projects presented is fiat gateway. Also a major problem in Thailand as not long ago bank account of TDAX (Thai Digital Asset Exchange) in Bangkok Bank was terminated and the negative sentiment from government persists. Furthermore, the trust issue was one of the most frequently raised topics, due to the influx of maliciously intended projects in crypto community and nearly 42% of ICO’s not being able to finalize their aims in 2017.  The DEEX team being the main sponsor of the conference confidently faced the issues showing the solutions in the fast-changing Blockchain world. As a surprise to the guests and speakers of the event, we showed our revolutionary DEEX mobile app, that allows user in real time transfer tokens between Bitshares wallets in couple of seconds. We gifted to the most active guests newly made wallets with Bitshares coins on them. As a front development team in the Bitshares community (DEEX attained Bitshares Accreditation in February), we feel obliged to propagate not just our project, but the new future that is possible with the revolutionary Bitshares Blockchain. Everybody was astonished by the swift transaction operations possibility through the app. Moreover, DEEX application is integrated with investor dashboard of DEEX ICO ecosystem, so investors are able to gain access to their accounts via this application.  At the conference we have met new potential investors, traders and partners for DEEX ecosystem. For example, we have established business connections with the developers of stable coin on the Ethereum blockchain, which is asset backed by fiat currency - Thailand bat. DEEX soon will list this stable coin on our exchange, such that investors will gain access to reliable way of keeping their savings in stable currency in times of cryptocurrency storm. Moreover, some conference participants found out interest in developing the network of self-service crypto ATMs, produced by the DEEX. So, soon this ATMs will appear in some areas in Bangkok, as well as at the popular resorts.  The DEEX community is surprised by the fact that crypto conferences attract not just computer geeks and enthusiasts, but people from financial world of authoritarian countries, where demand is not satisfied by the governmentally regulated supply through severe restrictions. Moreover, the help and the will of the financiers to deliver decentralization with DEEX in those problematic regions also their way of making impossible possible are astonishing. Furthermore, DEEX’ prerogative is to help people, that is why we cannot leave other projects in dead-end created by regulations and always stretch out our helping hand to the ICO’s in early development or developed project in need of functionality of our platform, thus be prepared for the new partnerships on the way.  We are sure, that our road show in the Asian region was quite successful, such that we found investors, partners, traders, ambassadors in such regions as: The Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia. Soon, after the launch of DEEX cryptocurrency exchange, DEEX road show will continue in such countries as China, Korea, Japan.  Let’s DEEX it!",False

Here comes a moment, which we and you have been waiting for a very long time.  On January 10th, the full-scale ICO of the main decentralized project DEEX will start. Less than two months ago tokens presale became the first success of the development team, which clearly demonstrated the interest of the crypto community to decentralized systems with 3410 ETH of investments collected.  Over the past since the end of the presale time we have implemented many important functional features, such as the investor's personal cabinet and the MVP prototype.  Unfortunately, not all of those who wanted to become the part of the decentralized future could become investors of the project. But now you will again have the opportunity to purchase DEEX tokens and invest your funds into the most promising cryptocurrency ecosystem.  You can use the investor's personal cabinet which is located at https://presale.deex.exchange , to purchase the DEEX tokens. Detailed instruction for using the personal cabinet is available here - https://deex.exchange/docs/DEEX-investor-cabinet_eng.pdf  Here you will be available to chose the cryptocurrency, for which you can buy DEEX coins.

DEEX continues the road show and on Friday, December 8th will participate in CryproSpace blockchain conference in Skolkovo (Moscow Region, Russia). Under the curtain of the outgoing 2017 in the technological capital of Russia will take place an event which scale is impossible to overestimate. On December 8th the doors of the campus of the school of management of the Skolkovo Innovation Center will be opened for everyone who is interested in blockchain and who moves this technology forward. How and why to implement the blockchain? Why ICO became the hottest business topic in the outgoing year? Can we make money on cryptotrading in 2018? These and many other questions will be answered by the speakers of the event, who are counted as the leading crypto businessmen and authoritative opinion leaders in America, Asia and Europe. Most of them will come to Russia for the first time, which is an additional incentive for visiting CryptoSpace. The team of developers of the main decentralized cryptocurrency ecosystem DEEX will also take a direct part in the conference.  We will hold a presentation of the system, share plans for the future, tell about prospects for business development and submit the MVP. DEEX will have a separate booth and also will deliver a report. You will be able to personally communicate with the representatives of DEEX and learn how with the help of the latest technologies and unique functionality it is planned to conquer the tops of the blockchain by the project which only on the presale stage was able to collect investments worth more than $ 1,500,000.  Representatives of DEEX are regular participants of such events, this has already become a good tradition for the creators of the project.

And our country is on the first positions in terms of number blockchain projects and it certainly belongs to the number of leading countries that move this technology forward. Extra proof of this fact was the CryptoSpace conference, which took place on December 8th at the campus of the IT capital of Russia, the innovative center of Skolkovo.  Organizers of this event not only successfully chose its venue, but also attracted speakers from Russia, US and Europe. The scope of the conference was added not only by numerous sponsors, but also by a large number of journalists from the leading cryptocurrency and blockchain media. Representatives of DEEX https://deex.exchange  also became participants of the conference in Skolkovo, where they not only talked about the project of the main decentralized financial ecosystem, but also for the first time presented a working MVP prototype that had been developed over the past few months.  Familiarity with the working prototype attracted interest of both ordinary visitors and representatives of other blockchain projects. Everyone without exception could appreciate the scale of the DEEX project in terms of its direct functioning. It is not for nothing that it is said that it is better to see once than hear a hundred times. Direct acquaintance with MVP was very important for potential investors and developers of other block-based solutions. It turned out that visitors from different regions of Russia are aware of the DEEX project, and many have already invested their money in the token of the completed presale. Genuine interest in DEEX was shown by representatives of foreign countries from the Middle East, Asia, Europe, Canada, as well as large US funds offering cooperation. Representatives of other projects also made a number of interesting proposals on the mutual implementation and integration of promising solutions.  At the DEEX booth everyone (and there were many of them indeed) could personally try out terminals for accepting payments in cryptocurrencies and assess their convenience and simplicity. Exactly the same devices DEEX has recently presented at the exhibition Bitcoin & Blockchain conference 2017, a report from which you can see here https://www.facebook.com/groups/deex.exchange/permalink/130590004294872/  For the time since the presale of tokens (remember, it was held from October 26th till November 27th and was able to attract more than 3400Eth investments), many CryptoSpace visitors could already familiarize themselves with the project in detail and become its investors. Therefore, for them the conference became an excellent occasion to get acquainted personally with developers and creators of DEEX.  Speeches of the speakers aroused great interest, since the questions they are being asked about now are being asked by crypto-enthusiasts around the world. What will be the bitcoin course, what will it be possible to earn in 2018, what else can a blockchain as a technology...  We can say only one thing - the future belongs to decentralized systems and DEEX is by far the main platform for convenient cryptocurrency trading and ICO. Everyone who came to the conference in Skolkovo agreed to this. We suggest you to visit the website of the organizers http://cryptospace.moscow  in order to once again make sure that the future is closer than you think and the decentralized blockchain is its main driving force.
