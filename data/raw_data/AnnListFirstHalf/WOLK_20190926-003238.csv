I am not sure if that tokens are actual useable or just some throw in ad-tokens you only get, when you actually participate in the ICO like e.g. Cryptonex did it. I am personally not a fan of this new wave of ""free"" tokens that appear in my wallet. It just feels like the ads, I get in my mailbox. Furthermore it does make the project look kind of shady / scammy do be honest.  I know ""free"" coins are great and all ... but let's be honest... it is not like that this free coins you got, will be ever worth several 1000 bucks, like BTC.
