The reason was a visa issue.   This funny fact did not go unnoticed.

First of all, we want to demonstrate our extremely high concentration on high speed and product development quality.  Those who want, can always send their wishes and advice on the project’s functional, as well as UI / UX solutions to the email address: marketing@echat.io with the note: ""Offers on the Development"".  We start our first digest with the publication of a report on the work which has been done over the past week:    As you can see, the work is carried out at a high pace in all functionality of our messenger.  Over the last month, more than 300,000 downloads of the current version of the messenger were registered. The bulk of downloads mostly fall on the Chinese region, which, as originally defined, is fundamental for further progress, according to the development strategy.  In addition to the development, our Business Development managers have held a number of meetings with representatives of major crypto-exchanges, such as Huobi, Livecoin, and OKEx. Thus, the process of connecting a token to large exchanges currently takes quite a long time, as well as the procedures have become more complicated, but we believe that the fast announcements about our cooperation with them will surely please our entire community very soon.  Stay in touch, and remember you can always send your constructive suggestions and criticism to us in our official chat on Telegram: https://t.me/ico_eChat, and other contacts listed on the official site.",False

SNAPCHAT  Everyone is familiar with Snapchat, an app that was extremely popular a couple of years ago and due to unknown reasons, has dropped in popularity in recent times. Some of the celebrities, for example, Kylie Kardashian once asked her followers on Twitter whether they keep using Snapchat. She claimed herself not to use it anymore. Looks like not many of her fans keep that habit either.  One of the revolutionary features Snapchat introduced is that content you send to your friends or beloved ones self-destructs in some time. But in case the communication is not properly encrypted, the files you exchange are still stored in the cloud of the app and on its server part. In the case of e-Chat, which is gaining popularity worldwide, there is no need to worry if your files, pictures, video, or audio could be leaked one day. It’s absolutely impossible to hack any of the accounts due to the decentralized nature of the app. Many celebrities advocate for e-Chat, mentioning its revolutionary feature of Cryptolike providing various opportunities to earn inside the network.  e-Chat is also planning to introduce appearance changing, but it’s only one of the features we have in the Roadmap of the project.

STAY ANONYMOUS The registration process is significantly simplified. It’s not obligatory to create a classical account. You may send the other participant your ID generated by the app. That’ll be more than enough to find and link to you.  2. CREATE BUSINESS CHANNELS e-Chat has all the needed infrastructure to promote brands, create a newsletter, and business channels. The app has the facilities to introduce the interactive way of your communication with the clients. The most active participants of your channel could be rewarded with ECHT.  3. EASY MONETIZATION OF UNIQUE CONTENT There is an opportunity to create subscription-based channels where the payment is conducted in ECHT. In case you would like to run your own courses online, either motivational or education, e-Chat provides you with the full-fledged frame to communicate with subscribers, run webcasts, and organize both individual and group chat rooms.  4. FREEBIE NATURE The main functionality of e-Chat is absolutely free. In case you want to use the advanced one, i.e. data storage on IPFS nodes for more than 30 days, the access to the unique content of other users, one has to pay.

FIRST DECENTRALIZED CRYPTO MESSENGER 📱,"MESSENGERS WILL NEVER BE THE SAME: E-CHAT PLANS TO LAUNCH THE BLOGGERS EXCHANGE  Messenger is a social and financial tool of modern people, designed to unite all the functions of our usual messengers and to facilitate the financial operations around the world. All that you have recently used in various applications on your phone or PC becomes available in e-Chat: chats, blogs, social networks, online payments, cryptocurrencies and even the exchange!  We made the emphasis on creating an ecosystem for bloggers, who have already become the new opinion leaders and can easily compete with the most popular newspapers and TV channels. Therefore, the new platform offers them a function of content monetization, namely - cryptolike. By means of cryptolike, e-Chat users can thank the content author in the form of a microtransaction and help novice bloggers reach a new level by providing their subscribers with new interesting materials. The cryptolike ecosystem in e-Chat will become for bloggers a real way out of dependence on advertisers and will enable them to earn money by creating the content they like. In addition, cryptolike will allow them to analyze the value of their own content by a modern payment unit - cryptocurrency!  However, a complete breakthrough will be a rating and exchange of bloggers. Despite the fact that that this is a pilot project, we have no doubt that in the future it will take its niche in the growing popularity of the content monetization market and may well become a trend among all social networks. This is a completely new and interesting opportunity, both for bloggers and users, it allows bloggers to create their own tokens and trade them on the internal exchange. This will greatly simplify the interaction between them and their followers and make these connections more effective. Tokens can be used for access paid content or to purchase, for example, a music album, tickets for a concert or show and other events that will be held by celebrities. Tokens of the most popular stars and famous bloggers can be profitably sold or stored as an investment.  Just imagine, e-Chat will become the birthplace of star cryptocurrency! They won't be just internal tokens, we are talking about full-fledged cryptocurrencies based on the ERC-20 standard, which may further be added to international exchanges and traded on the market together with Bitcoin and Ethereum.  Moreover, the e-Chat application architecture guarantees its users complete security, since the application is blockchain-based and is additionally protected at all levels.",False

FIRST DECENTRALIZED CRYPTO MESSENGER 📱,"E-CHAT VS. INSTAGRAM    e-Chat is the first decentralized multi-task messaging platform with an inbuilt cryptowallet. What makes it different from other existing messaging clients, particularly Instagram?  1. E-CHAT IS A DECENTRALIZED APP BUILT ON BLOCKCHAIN Instagram has centralized management and architecture. Instagram gets the personal information of its users, decides what topics to discuss, and what kind of data to exchange. It means that the management policy of this corporation could be manipulated by states or political organizations and it’s a matter of time when our freedom could be fringed.  As you know all products based on the Blockchain technology have distributed architecture. It means that the information is exchanged through the independent nodes scattered around the globe. e-Chat cannot be controlled by any third party. The messenger is completely free from any interference.  2. END-TO-END ENCRYPTION IN E-CHAT ENSURES ABSOLUTE SAFETY OF EACH USER'S DATA Instagram doesn’t provide end-to-end encryption at all, which means that user accounts containing photos or videos can be hacked.  The development team created e-Chat in such a way that the content exchange between users is completely protected, all data is encrypted and stored in a decentralized way.  3. E-CHAT UNIQUE FUNCTION OF CRYPTOLIKE As you may already know, the Cryptolike option has no analogs in any messaging clients, including Instagram. Cryptolike provides the option for any user to transfer any sum of money to anyone within the platform by upvoting their content. This is an ideal way for independent bloggers and highly-creative authors, photographers, etc. to earn online without being forced to go through advertising something they don’t want to on their channels.",False

We are happy to provide you with a better version of our product. Knowing us, you could have guessed already that this is not the end, as right now we are thinking of a great change in the functionality of the platform. We would like to introduce you in the near future ‘Blogger Crypto Exchange’.  WHAT IS BLOGGER CRYPTO EXCHANGE?  One may say that e-Chat is already providing all the favorable conditions for opinion sharpeners, by adopting the option of ‘Cryptolike’ when they can get paid for the appealing content they post. It could be a photo or a news post, audio or video content.  Anyway, Blogger Crypto Exchange will be a breakthrough because it will provide bloggers with an option to create their own tokens and trade them on the e-Chat home exchange. We believe that Blogger Exchange will facilitate the interaction between bloggers and their followers and make their ties more effective. The tokens issued by bloggers will be used to get the access to private content, be the first one to get a new album, buy a ticket to the concert, etc. or simply participate in the campaigns run by your favorite bloggers.  e-Chat could become the cradle of ‘star’ cryptocurrency. The most successful ones, in the long run, could be listed on exchanges and trade on the same platforms together with Bitcoin and Ethereum.

FIRST DECENTRALIZED CRYPTO MESSENGER 📱,"E-CHAT ICO TAKES TWO ADDITIONAL WEEKS! BE THE FIRST TO KNOW THE REASON  Dear friends, we would like to let you know that e-Chat management team took a decision to prolong the e-Chat Main ICO Round. This is dictated by many reasons. First of all, as you know already, we are thinking of launching e-Chat Ethereum Fork right after the end of ICO. The project found resonance and is actively discussed online by famous celebrities, our followers, and community. e-Chat app keeps receiving newcomers and the total amount of downloads exceeds 500K. Secondly, we are actively negotiating with exchanges to enlist ECHT. Thirdly, we take the technical side of e-Chat very seriously and need additional time to introduce smart contracts technology into our product.  For a couple of weeks already, you could have an opportunity to vote for one of two possible scenarios of our platform development: with the fork or without it. We are very grateful for your active participation, but we still have the feeling that not every users/investor who would like to give their vote has had a chance to do that. That’s why we extend the duration of the poll for a couple of weeks, and the ICO period is prolonged accordingly. The deadline of Main Round of e-Chat ICO is March 1, 2018!  Please, participate in the ICO and share your opinion on the coming fork with us!",False

The fund was founded by Moshe Hogeg in 2012 with the headquarters in Tel Aviv. Since then they became well-known for supporting projects that implement new and disruptive technologies. In the past year, the fund management drew its focus toward crypto startup and has already provided the seed capital for more than 50 projects running ICOs.  Maria Jones discussed the e-Chat project with the Singulariteam professionals, elaborating on the funding opportunities and the benefit e-Chat brings to the investing side in the long run. The fund is best known for the provision of top-level professional support from the early stages of the project development. We truly hope that their visionary ideas and the technological know-how to back them up will bring our mutual cooperation to succeed.

FIRST DECENTRALIZED CRYPTO MESSENGER 📱,"TELEGRAM FOLLOWS IN E-CHAT STEPS  Less than a week ago, the Telegram CEO announced the idea to launch an ICO for the world-known messenger and introduce its native cryptocurrency. But let’s face the truth, is this idea so revolutionizing?  The idea to create a Blockchain-based messenger is not entirely new to the market. e-Chat has been spreading the word about its messaging platform for half a year already, moreover, just as in Telegram, e-Chat is a working product with N millions of users worldwide. While Telegram management is still thinking to run a ICO for their product, we have already ran a number of rounds and have raised an impressive amount of funds. As you may already know, we are running our final ICO and asking you to support us!  More and more key media features get notice of e-Chat due to its protected algorithm, strong encryption, Blockchain nature, and incredibly convenient interface. At the same time, Telegram continues to receive negative reviews. Looks like the founder of Telegram, Pavel Durov, the one who popularized the Russian version of Facebook – VK, cannot get his own ideas and keeps borrowing them from us and WeChat.  It means, that while some messaging giants are still thinking about making their first steps in the world of ICOs and cryptocurrency, we continue to strengthen our positions, as e-Chat is the already functioning messaging system of the future!",False

She suggests applying the Blockchain technology for the coming voting in Russia. Among various social apps, she picked up the first decentralized messaging system, e-Chat, and came up with the idea of using the app during the voting process.  She says, ‘You have the presidential candidates on your screen and the one thing you have to do is to tap on the one you would like to vote for’. She also suggested the Central Election Commission take a note of it.

FIRST DECENTRALIZED CRYPTO MESSENGER 📱,"CRYPTOLIKE: UNIQUE E-CHAT PLATFORM FEATURE  One of the reasons for the worldwide love of social networks is the ability to get attention from friends, relatives, and even strangers. It is clear that if your rating is growing, it will manifest itself in the number of likes given to the posts. So, finding their niche, many network users are beginning to acquire fame and become recognizable among thousands of followers. We all know that you can earn on the Internet. A large number of visits to your page and the likes can easily be converted into fiat money. However, in this situation, you still will not get all the money you've earned: in every step to monetization you will encounter barriers in the form of interest, which must be paid to the platform, the site, etc.  And now let's imagine that the whole process of cashing out the likes can become much easier, more accessible, and more transparent. If you use the modern technologies to tie the account to a wallet and add the function of instant transfer to a certain amount of money to the account of the person you put on, the earnings process is accelerated tens of times, and its amount is increased by the same number. On a simple example, let's analyze the account of some celebrity, say, Beyonce. Once she posts something in the network, these photos are instantly replicated and spread around the world. And this celebrity has an account on the platform, which unites social communication with financial incentives.  Such a platform really does exist, it is e-Chat, the first decentralized multifunctional platform with a built-in crypto-wallet. Continuing the calculations, Beyonce puts the photo in the news line on e-Chat, which it is clear by that time on the platform it will have a million as an audience with a stable number of several- hundred thousand likes under each post. Let the post be socially oriented and encourage the followers to support the rights of the black population of New Orleans for free medical care. All those who have the same views, placing the likes, automatically transfer money from their wallet to the wallet of Beyonce.  The creators of e-Chat provide that the users themselves can establish the value of their likes, which can be a dollar, five, a hundred, or even 5 cents- any amount will be automatically transferred when you click. Let's say the average value of one crypto-like is 1 dollar. Let's make the calculation, how much Beyonce can collect by one post? The answer is hundreds of thousands of dollars.  With the help of e-Chat, this kind of crowdfunding is revolutionizing the financial relations to which we are accustomed. All transfer operations are absolutely transparent, as they are recorded by the system, and the withdrawal of money takes a single-click of the mouse. Cryptocurrency can be transferred to the fiat money or to the accounts of organizations that will directly engage in providing assistance to the needy low-income population of New Orleans.  When creating the product, the e-Chat team focused on modern decentralized technologies: blockchain, end-to-end encryption, MTProto protocol, and others. They ensure the security of the funds, transfers, and the recording of all transactions in the blockchain.

FIRST DECENTRALIZED CRYPTO MESSENGER 📱,"Here, at e-Chat, we know what features a messenger for future generations should obtain. Our ideas are based on quite a gloomy prediction of how the majority of well-known messengers function nowadays. Even the fact that each of us is using minimum 5–7 different means is showing that there is not a single one that could serve the needs of all users. We have analyzed the operational facilities of Skype, WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram, Hangouts, Line, and e-Chat.  You would easily find the supporters and haters of each of the mentioned above messenger, but the question on which of the messenger is the best and could serve the needs of future generations is still open. Recently, we observe extremely high competition among the online communication means. Every smartphone has the Internet and it allows the users of the gadgets activate as many instant messaging apps as they want. Everyday startups come out with new messengers. Some specialize at sending the photo and video content; some are so weird that organize the communication by typing only one word (e.g. Yo app). The abundance of means pushes users to multiple their accounts and update the apps they store.  But there is even a bigger problem: the present situation threatens the basis of communication in the future. Everyone knows that the messengers are run by companies, so to say, this sphere is monopolized. We believe that the existing centralized architecture used as the model for all known instant messaging apps threatens the freedom and safety of modern online communication. Every messenger that you use is isolated from another. You cannot send a text from Skype to Telegram and organize a video streaming from Facebook messenger to Viber. Moreover, each company-owner is having the fight of their lives to get you as their user. At the rise of the Internet, the situation with the personal communication was absolutely different, because the open standards penetrate all levels of interaction and provide the availability and interoperability of web-browsers, websites, and email clients. With the time the needs of Internet-users were growing and only small companies that are not using open standards managed to meet them. Skype was the first shot.  The popularity of smartphones brought to masses the real obsession with instant messengers. It was as clear as day that there is no need to spend money on texts or calls anymore and people started installing apps like crazy. Legacy mobile operators are trying to prevent the spread of VoIP and other services, but the idea of globalization and in the near distant future the picture having no SIM-cards in your phones is very plausible. Our developers at e-Chat are positive that quite soon we will witness drastic changes in the sphere of communication. The online instant messaging software is turning into the leading way of interaction between people. And if the centralized infrastructure of the messengers we know doesn’t change, in the end, we receive hundreds of isolated apps on our gadgets that will only keep multiplying. Let’s see what the weakest sides of modern messengers are. Let’s take Skype as a prototypical messenger, the first one of its class and Telegram because it claims to be the best in terms of safety, encryption, etc.  Skype  1. Skype is unsafe to use  It opens up your IP-addresses, including the local one. Having these data, everyone could track you and get to know where you are located right now. Skype technical support doesn’t seem like sacrificing everything to fix bugs that the Skype community is bringing to the table. Even now, you can register a Skype account providing your email and there is no confirmation. Moreover, our guys at e-Chat know at least two ways how to block any user by only knowing their Skype logins. Its transport protocol is safe, but the app itself is not.  2. Skype management policy is unpredictable  There is the whole story of Skype permissions and rejections. Some years ago, SkypeKit SDK was free for software developers and anyone could integrate Skype support into their products. Even at that time, the process to obtain it and make it work was very bureaucratic. Now, SkypeKit is not available, and all the products based on it, stopped working. If we take other instant messengers into consideration, they provide even less space for any additional development, basically, none.  Telegram  1. Telegram has centralized management and architecture  This messenger needs detailed observation as it claims to be the app of the future. But is it really so, or maybe there are some analogs that could outsmart it. Hint, hint (most likely, e-Chat). Telegram obtains all the information about its users, it decides what topics to discuss, what kind of data to exchange. It means that the management policy of this corporation could be manipulated by states or political organizations and it’s a matter of time when our freedoms could be fringed.  2. Telegram provides end-to-end encryption  This is a truly convenient feature. Moreover, we, as users, have the opportunity to put the option of automated chat deletion. The procedure of keys verification is not clear yet and we cannot check it by ourselves. Though Telegram differs from its rivals, it doesn’t have all the features needed to become THE app for the future generations. Let’s bring a table with other messengers and discuss their features:    We discussed the existing messengers and are happy to announce that the weak sides of the aforementioned means of online communication could be strengthened and that’s what we actually did by creating e-Chat. It’s the first decentralized messenger. Only by saying that it’s based on the blockchain, IPFS, and P2P should ring the bells to you. Protection, the safety of data storage, built-in wallet, end-to-end encryption — are only some of the features that make e-Chat primus inter pares.

The event is powered by the Cointelegraph and gathered over 1000 of founders, investors, lawyers, senior executives and Blockchain developers from all over the world.    e-Chat is very proud to contribute to building a strong Blockchain community worldwide, by participating and networking with the representatives from either the businesses that are already using the Blockchain technologies or the ones that still nurture plans to implement some of these technologies. We strongly believe that our experience let us counsel the company’s management during their transfer to Blockchain.    The Cointelegraph is promoting BlockShow Asia as ‘the Window to the Global Blockchain World’. This is very true. We were lucky to try out more than 40 solutions and products presented at the exhibit and showcased e-Chat as one of the established projects. The feedback received is very inspiring and at the same time, we are grateful for the valuable advice from the world-known leaders of Blockchain development movement.

We were happy to receive positive reaction and words of support from the other participants.    The range of projects presented in Moscow was wide. These were startups planning to enter the ICO. Their ideas were thoroughly discussed and counseled by other participants of the battle. The other category of projects presented at the event were startups, like e-Chat, who are already running the ICO and those who have already finished the Initial Coin Offering and managing the funds raised.    Don’t forget to invest in our project by buying the ECHT tokens. There is not much time left, the e-Chat first round of ICO finishes on December 15th, 2017.

Will Caldwell, the author of the article, mentioned that other ways to protect cryptocurrency transactions are: 1) make more wallets to distribute the assets and 2) store the assets offline. None of the mentioned above ways is convenient enough in the speeding pace of modern life. That is why we developed e-Chat. We believe that cryptocurrency transactions should become easier and more convenient to everyone.

Our team has invited people who really know their business and are looking forward to expand the project geographically from native regional markets to the international arena... The total number of funds received is more than enough to keep up with the good work we are doing together!  We would like to remind you that o the first round of our ICO has already started. For the whole month you will be able to invest in e-Chat by buying tokens for $0.75 each. The first round of e-Chat ICO will finish on December 15, 2017. Looking forward to your engagement and support!  The world needs to receive a present in the form of our first decentralized messaging platform. We are thankful to all e-Chat supporters, happy to have you with us!",False

FIRST DECENTRALIZED CRYPTO MESSENGER 📱,"JEFF MARQUASS ELABORATES ON THE HUGE PERSPECTIVES FOR E-CHAT AND BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY    It’s very symbolic that e-Chat is among the sponsors of the Second Annual International Blockchain Conference that is taking place in Hong Kong, a city where it had been established and based. For e-chat Advisor,Jeff Marquass, it is a home environment where he has over 17 years experience of successful work in different companies in Asia as he is really keen on Asian business ethics.    This being said, his talk about the perspectives of e-Chat and participation in the panel discussion, dedicated to the blockchain technology and its international perspectives, was especially interesting for the participants as the number of e-Chat subscribers in social networks has significantly increased. It goes without saying that e-Chat is one of the few messengers that can legally work in such a giant market as China with a population of 1.379 billion people, where more than 600 million people regularly use smartphones.    As we wrote earlier, today the senior figures from the tech and finance world gathered in Hong Kong to discuss how new technologies and blockchain, in particular, are changing our modern world. ICOs and the Token Distribution — are the main topics for discussion on the conference. So follow the updates on our website and don’t miss the most interesting content from the speakers from all corners of the world.    And today, on November 11th, 2017, e-Chat will also take part in two big events: the Leading Conference on Decentralization in Davos, Switzerland and the first Blockchain Conference in Tokyo, holding by Blockchain Labo.

This protocol has the following features: - High-level component (API query language): defines the method whereby the API queries and responses are converted to binary messages. - Cryptographic (authorization) layer: defines the method by which messages are encrypted before being transmitted through the transport protocol. - Transport component: defines the method for the client and the server to transmit messages over some other existing network protocol (such as http, https, TCP, UDP).  When you send a message from one user to another, you connect through a P2P connection. If the instant access to data is not required, all information is being stored to the IPFS-based decentralized storage network (DSN).Thus, all user data remains protected from any interference.

Quote from: e-Chat on October 28, 2017, 10:04:21 AM   As you know, according to the US law, in the case of the Securities and Exchange Commission against Howie, the US Supreme Court has developed a test to determine whether the transaction is related to an investment contract.  An investment contract is a type of security. Thus, the Howie test can be presented in the form of three independent parameters and the token is considered a security if it meets all three criteria:  - There is a fact of investing - Investing in a common enterprise - At the same time, profits are expected to come mainly as a result of the activities of others.  After passing the test, we certify that the ECHT tokens can not be classified by SEC and / or other competent national authorities as ""security"" and can be freely traded in any country of the world, including the USA!  The full probability assessment report is whether the e-Chat (ECHT) token, a security under the United States federal securities law, is available on our website.

FIRST DECENTRALIZED CRYPTO MESSENGER 📱,"   When you send a message from one user to another, you connect through a P2P connection. If the instant access to data is not required, all information is being stored to the IPFS-based decentralized storage network (DSN). Thus, all user data remains protected from any interference. For the safety of sent messages and users, following our principle of the Proof of Storage algorithm, there is a place for the distributed storage of information to be kept safe. Users of e-Chat can independently set the time for storing messages.  To secure the operation of the blockchain, e-Chat stores the «URL» of message or file directly to IPFS.  PROTOCOL OF ENCRYPTION  We are using MTProto - the best encryption algorithm, which was developed by the creators of Telegram. This protocol has the following features:  - High-level component (API query language): defines the method whereby the API queries and responses are converted to binary messages.  - Cryptographic (authorization) layer: defines the method by which messages are encrypted before being transmitted through the transport protocol.  - Transport component: defines the method for the client and the server to transmit messages over some other existing network protocol (such as http, https, TCP, UDP).",False

An investment contract is a type of security. Thus, the Howie test can be presented in the form of three independent parameters and the token is considered a security if it meets all three criteria:  - There is a fact of investing - Investing in a common enterprise - At the same time, profits are expected to come mainly as a result of the activities of others.

FIRST DECENTRALIZED CRYPTO MESSENGER 📱,"   Quote from: e-Chat on October 18, 2017, 04:14:49 PM  Hello.  One of the acutest issues from the point of view of the investors is the monetization of the messenger. Despite the huge user base, modern messengers, for the most part, have not offered pathways to monetize which allow them to generate recurring income. The most common methods for instant messenger monetization are:  • tariffication of calls from the application to fixed or mobile phone numbers; • monthly subscription for additional messenger functionality; • commission for domestic purchases in the messenger (games, stickers, • masks, etc.); • the introduction of a commission for remittances inside and outside the messenger; • inserting banner ads into the application interface; • monetization of the chat-bot platform.  We decided to get away from the traditional methods of making money on users, whether it’s the classical payment for the use of services or the sale of personal data of users. However, the e-Chat team plans to gradually monetize the embedded branded services and introduce commissions from users receiving revenue from the use of e-Chat:  • Commissions for transfers of international and national payment systems (American Express, Visa, MasterCard, China UnionPay, JCB, etc.); • Cash back from offline and online stores for each purchase using the application; • Transfers of cryptocurrency inside the e-Chat wallet, FREE transfers to ECHT; • Commission for bloggers who receive income from subscribers thanks to donations for content and paid private chat rooms.  It should be noted that the monetization of the application will be implemented only after several stages of development and recruitment of the primary user base, which will complete at the end of 2018.  Also you can find this information in the whitepaper",False

FIRST DECENTRALIZED CRYPTO MESSENGER 📱,"    Hello,  When you send a message from one user to another, you connect through a P2P connection. If the instant access to data is not required, all information is being stored to the IPFS-based decentralized storage network (DSN). Thus, all user data remains protected from any interference. For the safety of sent messages and users, following our principle of the Proof of Storage algorithm, there is a place for the distributed storage of information to be kept safe. Users of e-Chat can independently set the time for storing messages.  To secure the operation of the blockchain, e-Chat stores the «URL» of message or file directly to IPFS.  PROTOCOL OF ENCRYPTION  We are using MTProto - the best encryption algorithm, which was developed by the creators of Telegram. This protocol has the following features:  High-level component (API query language): defines the method whereby the API queries and responses are converted to binary messages.  Cryptographic (authorization) layer: defines the method by which messages are encrypted before being transmitted through the transport protocol.  Transport component: defines the method for the client and the server to transmit messages over some other existing network protocol (such as http, https, TCP, UDP).",False

FIRST DECENTRALIZED CRYPTO MESSENGER 📱,"   Hello.  One of the acutest issues from the point of view of the investors is the monetization of the messenger. Despite the huge user base, modern messengers, for the most part, have not offered pathways to monetize which allow them to generate recurring income. The most common methods for instant messenger monetization are:  • tariffication of calls from the application to fixed or mobile phone numbers; • monthly subscription for additional messenger functionality; • commission for domestic purchases in the messenger (games, stickers, • masks, etc.); • the introduction of a commission for remittances inside and outside the messenger; • inserting banner ads into the application interface; • monetization of the chat-bot platform.  We decided to get away from the traditional methods of making money on users, whether it’s the classical payment for the use of services or the sale of personal data of users. However, the e-Chat team plans to gradually monetize the embedded branded services and introduce commissions from users receiving revenue from the use of e-Chat:  • Commissions for transfers of international and national payment systems (American Express, Visa, MasterCard, China UnionPay, JCB, etc.); • Cash back from offline and online stores for each purchase using the application; • Transfers of cryptocurrency inside the e-Chat wallet, FREE transfers to ECHT; • Commission for bloggers who receive income from subscribers thanks to donations for content and paid private chat rooms.  It should be noted that the monetization of the application will be implemented only after several stages of development and recruitment of the primary user base, which will complete at the end of 2018.  Also you can find this information in the whitepaper",False

The product developed by the e-Chat team combines such functions as:  - the possibility of a classic messenger - finance (multi-currency crypto-wallet, with the ability to connect bank cards and other payment services) - quality content - data protection   Let's take a look at the e-Chat application. It's about a decentralized messenger based on the blockchain technology. You will discover a fast and secure messenger with the usual functionality: messages, audio and video calls, group chats, stickers and bots. What makes it so special?   1. When registering your account, you get an access to the multi-currency wallet with a starting bonus in the form of internal cryptocurrency. You will have the opportunity to send both cryptocurrencies and fiat money to your friends and acquaintances directly in the messenger. In addition, you can pay for services on the Internet or offline with the help of NFC and QR-codes.  2. The ability to store funds within the application is justified by a unique security system that includes:  a. peer-to-peer connection b. end-to-end encryption c. double authentication of payments, etc.   3. One of the important components in the promotion of products is the involvement of opinion leaders. In this regard, e-Chat has any chance of success! In addition to all the above functions, an instant messenger with a function of the decentralized social network is built into the messenger. To monetize your content, bloggers do not need to resort to the help of advertisers. Users can put the likes on real money.   According to the developers, in a year the number of messages sent in e-Chat will amount to 1 billion per day. Right now, the experienced team is working on improving e-Chat (at the moment you can download working versions of the application for iOS and Android). In addition, the team received permits to use the application in China, which allows you to get one of the largest application markets in the world!   Read more about the project on the official website - http://ico.echat.io/.  The e-Chat Team Announces the Search for Partners Around the World for a Mutually Beneficial Cooperation   Recently, the e-Chat team announced plans to conduct the ICO presenting a revolutionary product, which will undoubtedly be a hit in 2018. We are talking about a decentralized messenger based on the blockchain technology, the function of which includes:  - voice and video calls, chats and channels; - built-in multi-currency wallet with the ability to make payments from the messenger; - transfers of both cryptocurrencies and fiat money directly in the messages; - end-to-end encryption, private key storage and advanced data protection system; - a photo and video content feed with the ability to earn money on likes!   The validity of the messenger functionality is also confirmed by the growth of the market. The technology of blockchain outgrows from the trend and the necessary basic functionality.  Both instant messengers and mobile payments are experiencing unprecedented increase.  In addition to the breakthrough idea, e-Chat has a working product, which is daily updated by an experienced development team. The beta version of the messenger is already available for iOS and Android. Thus, the team has received permission for the use of the application in China!
