This represents the 1st game on the vDapps platform.  vSlots  The first game on the vDapps section will be our unique take on a slot machine, implemented entirely with Ethereum Smart Contracts.  This is not the official announcement. This is a preliminary announcement for our fans. We will be making the official announcement shortly, once the game is live.  The code is here. It is currently undergoing review and 3rd party audits. Front-end developers and designers are also in the process of completing the APIs, HTML, CSS and Design.     Unique Features  Players can interact with the Slot contract in two ways:  ● They can send a transaction directly to the smart contract address, triggering the fallback function. The transaction will buy one spin.  ● They can send a transaction to the buySpins function. The buySpins accept as argument the number of spins which are to be bough, up to a maximum of 16.  When a player buys a number of spins, an instance of the structure SpinsContainer is created and saved into the contract storage in the mapping spins . The index of the mapping is the myid of the query made to Oraclize.  Solid, secure, code is important. But it means nothing if we cannot hide the abstraction behind a beautiful and intuitive user experience.  We believe the ability to spin in bulk, using only smart contracts and no ‘accounts’ will be a huge leap forward for usability in these type of games.  Release of vSlots  We are looking to have this wrapped up fully and live by the end of next week. stay tuned.  Regards",False

Quote Wallet Lockdown Another issue which we raised internally, it is if we considered appropriate for the wallet owners to be able to have complete access to the funds during the token swap period. If owners are able to withdraw the funds, they could use them to mint token for themselves for free. But due to the fact that the blockchain is transparent, so any strange behavior would be surely be noted and reputational damage would ensue, and that this would lower the overall amount of ether raised by the token swap, we considered this a non-issue since owners have no economic incentives to act in this way. Moreover, accessing the funds could reduce the security risks of having a large amount of ether in only one contract, since owners may want to spread it between multiple accounts/wallet contracts.  Seems like you're trying to say:  ""We will have full access to funds during token swap period.""",False

Does that mean that the total share will be distributed in the 45 millions and thats the total tokens there will ever be? or you will keep the reaming unsold tokens to yourself? in terms of tradable value is not the same to have a total supply of 90 or so millions than to have  half of it.

Firstly, there are no ""unsold tokens"". vSlice issuance doesn’t work that way.  Whenever ETH is sent to the address, new vSlice are created (minted), in this ratio:  Week 1 : 1 ETH = 130 vSlice.  Week 2 : 1 ETH = 120 vSlice.  Week 3/4 : 1 ETH = 100 vSlice.  So we start with 0 tokens and vSlice only come into existence once ETH is sent to that address.  Now, it is entirely possible there will only be 45m vSlice. It could even be less!  We only know the absolute upper maximum is 96m. There can never be more than that. But there can certainly be a lot less.  On December 15th the crowdsale will end. However many tokens there are, that will be all.  Also, check out our FAQ.

I like the game because it is very convenient and simple to Play. It has the potential to make People becoming addicted to it. However, if you could include some visualization effects, like a Barometer, wheels etc. It could make the game much more attractive. Because now, all we can do is to wait the sudden appearance of a number which tells us whether we win or loose, which is not very entertaining.  Also, to address the high-risk taking Gamblers, it would make much sense to increase the max bet (actually I cannot understand why the Max-Bet is so low). At the Moment, I don't really see how peole can win big amount of ETH with this Max-Limit settings.  Another question: do you have plans to develop something like a weekly lottery game, where you can win a lot of ETH from a Jackpot? This would attract a lot of People.  Last question: your Roadmap, can you be more specific with the time schedules, in Terms of 2017 Q1, 2017 Q2 etc.?  Looking Forward to your answer before I invest.

We’re the leading Blockchain Gambling Dapp. Everybody agrees.  Our players want it much faster. Alright, so we’ve been working with our Oracle.  We’re going to make betting process even faster.

You don’t need to wonder.  on November 15th you contribute your Ether (ETH). In exchange, you automatically receive vDice tokens (called; ‘vSlice’) and profits.  Each token is directly tied to the profits of the game.  Everything works right away. Because the game already works.  You can trade the tokens on exchange, immediately. Or keep them. And keep game profits.  It’s that simple.  Nov 16  After the ICO we are moving from PoC stage to Beta Then our priority is:  1. Faster blockchain betting times. We already have them down to 5s on the test-net.  2. More betting options.  3. Site design.  It's all coming after ICO. The funds are now there to make this a truly commercial product. .

Anyone should be able to verify this by looking up the balance of the ETH address 0x8bCCc9BA2E5706E24a36ddA02ca2A846E39a7bbF on any block explorer, I used etherscan, which shows roughly the above amount of ETH received and no ETH sent. This does not mean however that all/most of this ETH did not originate from the devs of this site. The fact that what appears to be an etherum developer is also a dev of this site likely will make it difficult to make any kind of blockchain connection proving that the devs are the ones ""investing"" in the ICO. I personally would not be surprised if most of what has been invested so far is from people connected to the devs, considering just how bad of a deal this ICO is for investors.  I noticed that many people have asked why they are raising money if they are already profitable. The answer to this question is to allow them to grow faster. Raising money (via an ICO, or otherwise) when profitable, is not by itself an indication of a scam/fraud.  Being that it appears that vDice appears to fund their own bankroll, at the end of the day, the only thing that will allow investors to profit is bankroll profits. Based on the fact that your largest max bet is roughly $28, I suspect that your bankroll is currently very small. Based on the fact that less then 40% of funds raised will go to anything remotely related to your bankroll, your investors will start deep in the hole -- your bankroll will need to more then double in size via gambling profits before your investors will even break even! If a potential investor were to decide to instead to invest in the bankroll of a bitcoin (or etherum, or anything else) based gambling site, then they could immidiately divest and receive their entire investment back (plus/minus any gambling gains/losses) immidiately.  Smart contracts are fun and all, however vDice is not decentralized, nor provably fair to your players as pointed out by RHaver here. Additionally, it looks like it would be impossible to detect if you were covertly cheating your bankroll, so your investors will need to trust you, however from what I can tell, you do not presently have this trust -- the possibility of a gambling site cheating their investors exists for all gambling sites, and there is no known solution to this problem.  There is also the issue that vDice is misrepresenting (pg 4, header 2, par 2) that they are ""fully decentralized"" when in fact this is not the case (ref).  If anyone is considering to invest in this ICO, I would recommend that you look elsewhere to invest your money. ",False

Here's my thought process:  If the devs had this sort of money themselves, they would've put it into their own site bankroll. But maybe not. There's perhaps a logical reason that they might not want to do that, (AFAICT) the bankroll itself has no protection from a malicious orclize or random.org. And on top their counter party risk, there's always the looming threat of bugs (that exist in all sites, not just vdice). So it's quite understandable to not risk too much bankrolling it.  So if they had that sort of money, but didn't want to put it in their bankroll, the logical thing to do be inflate the profits to make it more attractive for investors. However, if you look at the ""total amount won"" over the sites history, that's 877 ETH. That should correspond to roughly ~17 ETH profit for the site (they have a 1.9% house edge). Less than a couple hundred bucks.  So if the invested amount is shill-money, it would mean they're a) bad actors and b) have a lot of money. So they logically should've massively bumped up the sites profit, to make it look a lot more profitable than it is.  So my conclusion is that they're probably legitimate investors. I'm guessing there are some unsavvy investors who didn't bother to fact check the site claims and put a little too much money on it, hoping it'd be the next big thing.",False

A more full answer is here:-  The profits being distributed would the house profits from the vDice contracts. This is easily done by setting the houseAddress of those contracts to the profitContainer's address. The profits will come from across all of vDice's games. The current investment functions are unaffected, as tokenHolders receive house profits.  The way the profits are distributed is simply based upon the amount of tokens a token holder holds in proportion to the total supply, and the amount of profit that was in the profitContainer contract at the start of lock period. Therefore, if we assume that there are 1,000 total tokens, and a token holder owns 10 tokens (amounting to 1% ownership), and at the start of the current locking period, there was an exact balance of 100 ETH, when this token holder redeems their profits, they will receive 1% of the profits, or 1 ETH.  We will achieve the objectives listed above with the following architecture:  ● Manual Coin Locking a) Each token holder gets an amount of token proportional to the ETH they deposit into the Crowdsale (ICO), in the ratio of: - Week 1 = 1 : 130 - Week 2 = 1 : 120 - Weeks 3 & 4 = 1 : 100     4. Analysis  b) The profit from vDice is sent to the token contract and is accumulated in its balance. c) The token contract can be in any one of these two states: i. Unlocked: tokens are freely transferable, and profit cannot be withdrawn during this period of time. The length of unlocked time period will be decided at contract deployment: e.g 3 weeks.  ii. Locked: tokens cannot be transferred. Each token holder can withdraw their profit share only during this period of time. The profits which are not collected can be sent/withdrawn to the wallet contract. The length of the locked time period should be decided at contract deployment: e.g 1 week.",False

You can review it. It's all public. There is no need to be aggressive and start making wild, unfounded accusations. Let’s keep it civil please!  We have some of the finest developers in Ethereum on our team. Our coders and game are live, working and can be verified. We are obviously legitimate.  Now, I have no idea why you are posting the same questions, over and over, in EVERY forum.    Requesting to kindly keep this just one forum. It's really annoying to have to go and paste the same answer over and over again.  Anyway, these concerns are addressed in our 3rd Party Audit by Peter Vessenes. You can read that here: https://blog.vdice.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vdice_game_code_audit_october_2016.pdf  For his credentials as an auditor you can google him or go to his security blog: http://vessenes.com  That is on our website. Along with all other documentation.  As an addendum to the audit, in relation to Oraclize and Replay issue (which I am guessing you allude to):  The very reason why the authenticated JSON-RPC APIs of random.org are used, is because of the ""requestsLeft"" field which is returned by each API call response ( https://api.random.org/json-rpc/1/signing ). This field content is tied to the API credentials specified in the query and is there to indicate how many requests are left in a given day.  If we check all the TLSNotary proofs published on the blockchain (which contain the whole API response!), an independent auditor can verify whether any subsequent number in the ""requestsLeft"" fields is missing - when that happens, the auditor has a good indicator that something wrong happened (either on the Oraclize side - which sent more requests than expected - or by any external party knowing that specific API key (vDice itself & random.org)). Of course this doesn't say much about the intent in itself (can just be some failure in the HTTP request, which had to be sent again), but in general it provides some level of security against replay attacks.    Otherwise, perhaps you are suggesting the oracle might have requested random numbers until a matching one >shows up? In which case:  Random.org JSON responses have a consecutive ID, so if we dropped some to advange ourselves in the game, by checking all of the bets and their respective responses it would be evident: at the end of the day, there would be some JSON responses missing, i.e ID 1, 2,3.. 5,6 present but 4 missing.  Further information on TLS notary:  With TLS notary (by the author of it in IRC), the third party has to keep the data to prevent the source from manipulating their data and making it seem as though your captured data is actually not authentic. In other words, a lying ""I never said that!"" from the webhost people.  It actually is secure because it is like when you browse to a HTTPS secure site, you are able to see provably that they are X company (if you inspect the certificates). TLS Notary is essentially able to record those bytes in such a way that you can play them back later so you can authenticate the bytes again! Very ingenious. (But the math of how it does this in the whitepaper goes above my head. https://tlsnotary.org/TLSNotary.pdf)  the notary server used at the moment is the default tlsnotarygroup1 notary - which is an ""AWS oracle"", as described here. So there is nobody having access to the secret, as you can easily verify indipendently by following these instructions and giving a look at the actual code for the pagesigner-oracles.  There are some great videos explaining this further. Here is one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4ukd4I8S9A  I could go on forever about this. But, as I said before, it is an issue of centralization v decentralization.  vDice is fully decentralized in that there is no server architecture. There are 3rd party providers that do run some server architecture. But they are not part of vDice directly. They just give it what it needs. So, vDice is still serverless.",False

They do not have a customer base. Yet they are trying to raise an absurd amount of money. It's a complete money grab. Maybe they turn out to not be a scam, maybe not. This is just like LIR though, where either way you lose. You either buy in at valuation thats so high you have no floor and very short ceiling, or they run with your cash.  60MM tokens = 600k ETH valuation = nearly 9500 BTC (or $6.5MM). Obscene. Even more obscene is your ""breakdown"" of what funds are for. How does legal compliance take up 23% of 9500 BTC? That is beyond ridiculous and it sounds like you are putting down random numbers. And why is so much allocated for salaries? If you have developers on your team (which you should have) you should not need a whopping ~3700 BTC allotted for development on top of salaries.  I love that you also reference the sale of SatoshiDice, which is possibly the worst crypto deal ever seen (Hint: The people that purchased the site will never get close to their money back), and was made back in the heyday of Bitcoin. You are also using today's prices instead of the Bitcoin price back then (which would cut the valuation down significantly).

Though the facts / assumptions are not technically correct.  We are blockchain nerds. We maintain successful applications for Bitcoin at the moment too. We've even written applications for Dogecoin that are very successful for that space, on an ongoing basis.  These are all betting / gambling applications. So we stick to a core competency. As we believe it is wrong to spread yourself too thin. Then nothing gets achieved. That's a core philosophy for us.  So, we don't ""ditch"" anything. These are ongoing projects that are going well, in a commercial setting.  We have a good core team of developers, some of the best. We have guys even on the original Ethereum founding team. We also have an extended team of sub-contracted security experts, and developers.  After the crowdsale, with funds, that team will be increased over time, at a manageable pace.  We realise we live and breathe by the developer talent we attract and keep. We consider ourselves very good at that. It's probably the most important thing. This space has a limited amount of real talent, for how fast the technology is growing.  That will change over an extended period. But it takes time for real talent to re-tool and re-adapt to working with this new technology.  So, it was never a matter of just switching over to Ethereum. It was a platform that allowed us to build an extra application within our core competency.  Please ask further questions if you feel this was not a satisfactory answer. I am not being facetious.

I just went through the contracts on etherscan.io and took educated guesses and googled for things. After spending a bit more time, I actually /think/ cloudflare might not be able to cheat, because the results appear to be signed from random.org (but I have trouble finding/checking  the code which verifies the signature, does it even exist?). My reading of the logic is that the TLS signature from cloudflare is checked, not the random.org signature, which if so, would allow cloudflare to cheat. But I very well might be wrong, as I said I'm not that familiar with this sort of thing  I don't really mean to accuse them of anything, they're just some concerns i have by reading their code. It'd be nice if they address the issue instead of side stepping it calling it ""fully decentralized"" which it obviously isn't.

Our developers work super hard.  If you want to instantly change from BTC > ETH, shapeshift.io is the easiest.  We have built the world's 1st LIVE, FULLY Decentralized Gambling Platform.  Basically, all gambling games are built on some database.  There are 2 types of gambling games:  1). Non-Blockchain (Central Database) Gambling.  It works the same as an exchange service.  You send your ETH to the game owners. They record your ETH balance in their own database.  You have to trust the people who run the game.  2). Blockchain Gambling (Decentralised).  At vDice.io our games use the Ethereum blockchain as the database. So there are no accounts. We NEVER touch your money.  Instead, you play directly from your own wallet. You send ETH directly to the Smart Contract, on the Ethereum blockchain.  The Smart Contract processes the bet, and returns the win directly to your wallet.  You only have to trust the Smart Contract.  Full explanation is here: https://blog.vdice.io/what-is-vdice-ether-gambling/blockchain-gambling/",False

Regardless of whether ETH becomes successful or not, you're making an assumption that 50-60% of the transactions are going to be gambling (it is quite common for initial business plans to fail because of wrong assumptions).   If you think Ethereum has a future, then it needs Dapps. I agree that Dapps are an interesting concept.   We did this on Ethereum 'cause it was so utterly interesting and available. If we can do it on rootstock with Bitcoin, then why not. We'll have to dive into the Rootstock code.

We haven't premined a bunch of tokens for sale.  Instead:  The ‘vSlice’ token Smart Contract will be deployed and people who contribute will receive:     - Week 1 = 1 : 130 - Week 2 = 1 : 120 - Weeks 3 & 4 = 1 : 100 for each Ether (ETH) they send, for the 1-month of the issuance.  So, for example; 100 ETH will get 13,000 vSlice tokens, up until the cap of 700,000 ETH. This cap is a max. upper limit mainly for security reasons.  The Crowdsale Smart Contract is fully decentralised. That is, the sending of Ether (ETH) to the Token Smart Contract will result in the immediate, and decentralised, issuance of the contributors vSlice tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

There are many ways to approach this. We have worked hard to create a smart contract that ties token and game profits together. This is a very important development. It's new and a game changer.  This is a unique opportunity, to show the true power of Ethereum and full scripting. The token holders will benefit and share in the success of the game, through the token and Ethereum technology!

According to your white-paper:  vDice is the leading blockchain­based betting game for the Ethereum network. It went live on June 13th, 2016. It has processed almost 10,000 bets to­date. It is a classic ‘SatoshiDICE­style’ betting game, implemented as an Ethereum SmartContract (Dapp), and exists on the Ethereum blockchain. SatoshiDICE was the world’s first blockchain­betting game, built on Bitcoin’s blockchainand released in April, 2012. As of January 2013, SatoshiDICE had taken approximately US$ 15 million in bets. On July 18th, 2013 SatoshiDice sold for 126,315 BTC (US$ 76,000,000 on today’s market).   Since you are modelling yourself on Satoshi Dice and that you say your are already PROFITABLE, why do you need an ICO???  Why aren't you using your own profits to fund yourself?  Simple Question.  And in case you still don't get it:  There is no need for you to sell ""tokens"" to anyone.  You could just use your profits for your own marketing and then sell off vDICE for massive amount of money, just as Satoshi Dice.",False
