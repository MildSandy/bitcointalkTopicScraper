I doubt we are the first, but hope we will be the best  We are to build decentralized ecosystem, so we will not rate tutors.

Speaking about ranks - there will be a formula determining tutors rank. The higher rank = higher position in students search = more students and lessons. A number of factors will be taken into account, including tutors rating and a number of NTOK tokens on balance. This will motivate tutors to hold earned tokens.

Thanks for your questions. I honestly cannot tell the prices since tutors will set their prices individually. Again, it is about decentralization, so we are not setting any prices on our own  Yet we expect than given high competition inside ecosystem tutors will give their students market prices or below.  Prices will be per lesson. Per student - not really an option, since service provided requires human time, which is limited for every tutor.  Speaking about payment method - all transactions will be made via NTOK tokens and yes, it will be available international.  However, we will provide an option to pay with fiat, we understand that crypto is complicated for some tutors and students.
