I have really no idea why it was ignored so heavily on the first day. It seems investors only care about buzz projects or projects that want to make it easier to make smart contracts while it's already not that hard to create them anyway if you are a programmer.  A token for charity like this has not been done before simple as that. I have talked to a lot of people that really like this idea even some people wanted to advertise for me for free. So we hope the ICO picks up the pace in the next few days.  We worked out this idea for 3 months. Meanwhile more and more icos are coming out and its harder to be unique. A charity token is unique. A token that wants to make it easier to make smart contracts or reinventing the financial structure 10 times is not unique those already exist in the dozens now.  Stop being greedy and start thinking about how this token can help the world about charity. We can help everyone everywhere in undeveloped countries. Be generous for ones.  The good thing is this project only need a few major investors to get it going so we still have hope that some people will invest into it.",False

Two bits of good news first and foremost after a few bumps on the road the pre-alpha demo of the platform is available for you to test the contribution function! The platform works on two parts, the web interface where you can view the projects status info and so on and the smart contract part where you can contribute the amount of tokens you want to the project of your choice, please note that the platform smart contract has been adjusted to allow a maximum of 500 tokens per and the web platforms registration/login is currently disabled at this point of the release, however the platform is going to be constantly updated and expanded throughout the ICO and ofcourse after. Details on how to add the smart contract and how to use the platform in general can be found at our website, and again we are looking for any feedback you may provide.  The demo can be checked here: demo.tribetoken.org and the documentation how to use the demo can be found here: https://medium.com/@TribeToken/how-to-use-the-tribetokens-charity-platform-concept-demo-1d7a24d6c4f6  Any technical questions you may have about the platform direct them, if possible, to our Slack over at the channel #technical the questions there will be answered by the developers as soon as possible. The TribeToken GitHub now has the platform as a project that you can check out code parts that are in essentialy a finished state, some parts are ommited due to them being still under development and are subject to massive changes very often.  The second bit of news is we are now also listed at ICOcountdown! www.icocountdown.com We have been working closely with ICOcountdown for some time now to get the project to a more solid footing so to speak and we very pleased and gratefull for every feedback we have been given and getting listed makes it this even better so.",False

There's a clear difference between re-using libraries (such as the well-defined OpenZeppelin Solidity contract foundation) and blatantly just copying and pasting and changing a few variables. But fine, let's assume this is not an issue.  The next problem is that your 'contribution page' is a blatant rip from SkinCoin's page, now I'm not sure what excuse you want to pull there but as presented by the screenshots above your text is pretty much bang on the same. Can't be a coincidence, you would've thought any ICO worth their salt and serious about it isn't going to start by copying and pasting other people's websites. I can understand the coding, Solidity might be a new language to most (even though it's not and it's just Javascript for the most part), so it's always helpful to see reference code and understand what's going on.  The both added above seems like you've noticed that SkinCoin made some decent money and you literally copied them, which is the only conclusion that makes sense to me as a potential investor (and for the record I have saved all the pages in a quick video in case they're magically changed tomorrow).  The best of all of this is that you want NO escrow and have the public trust you and on top of that you JUST changed your 'minimum ETH goal' to be ZERO. This just screams SCAM to me.  I'd love to hear other people's opinion on this.  Oh and what about LinkedIn (or similar) pages? I'm not seeing any credibility here either, this is just a SCAM to lure people to giving you money and making it off.  All I can say to everyone is beware.",False

Ok, so the chart/diagram so wait can’t create diagrams of how we have the system setup to work because it's similar to what someone else has made? How it makes it a “blatant rip” the diagram was created by us, should we have also provided the psd/ai files of the icons and diagram then?  But let's get down to it no matter what we say you just want to yell scam at this moment and that is your right, but if we would also take a page from your book and just say you make this all up, your account is new registered 18/7/2017 has only 4 posts in this topic no less, this all seems to us that you are just trying to call scam just because, however, we don’t want to go there and we will answer your questions as followed below.  If you want more info we can give you details how to contact each and every person on our team and talk to us and see if we are real, who are we and so on, however out of respect for privacy of each team member we will not be providing LinkedIn or any other social network directly here on this very public forum all this can be done via contacting us on emails we provide on the site, pm here, slack private messages and so on.   As for the escrow, I'm going to assume that you have dealt with them at least once to know they facilitate transactions between parties most notably two parties, in this case the transaction would us giving you the tokens that happens automatically but even in the case that escrow, as a third party, would hold the ETH to start with there is nothing that would stop them from releasing the funds once the crowd sale ends as the condition of the transaction is already met as stated above.  Removing the minimum was recommended by a few prominent people that we talked to as we were doing the promotions, the reason is as stated above we do not require a very large amount of funds to do the platform if its spread over a larger amount of time and essentially less people on the development of it, smaller fund would also mean some cutbacks on other fronts but it would still be enough to make the platform as we envision it, however setting the bar to the lowest point of our theoretical budget for it would still be so low that it might as well not exist. There is still a refund system that will trigger for a set amount of days after the end of the ICO if people still feel that the final amount that was raised is way to low for any reason, actually we would be the first one to tell people to do the refund if we only raised a very small amount, yes it would be disappointing for us but then again we would still try and find a way to continue the platform creation maybe a bit slower paced but it would continue the same way it did begin.  TribeToken is a decentralized charity platform. Look into our demo when we release it and start seeing the good side of the project. That's what I recommend to do.  PS yes wall of text again contact us via pm if you want to talk to us via voice or use one of the other ways such as telegram/slack to chat with the team.",False

We have a set internal minimum based on Euro at around 100.000 EUR instead of ETH, the reasoning behind that we cannot predict the ETH price in a month when the crowd sale will be over and instead of promising certain things for a minimum that essentially can fluctuate depending on the mood of the gods, we have our internal minimum that if we don't reach we will consult with the contributors and tell them the changes in the development times that may occur due to this and based on their feedback we will see if we proceed or do refunds, of course, if the total amount is extremely low the plan is to issue refunds to everyone that contributed.",False

Meanwhile, when more users start using the platform the demand for TribeTokens will increase. We will add more usages for TribeTokens at the platform in the future while developing it. We are just at the first steps of this project as you can understand. Also, you have to remember that this token is focused on charity and creating a portal for decentralized charity. If done well we can have big charities start using the platform and that will cause a huge demand increase in TribeTokens.  More I can't really say about it because we are just in the early steps of the project. Expect more technical information near Monday.

For the transaction to occur from the charity, the address needs to be public, transparent and it should be posted where the charity funds are heading. We could also add an ID verification as an extra verification.  To give a small example:  A person without a registration starts a charity and if that person can't show any proof of a registration. Then he will not get a verified tag. It's up for the users on the platform to trust him or not. There will be a minimum deposit required to start a charity so it will not by spammed with random charities. Abusing people will be removed from this system.  There are many smaller charities that do go to undeveloped countries and already did a lot of work there. They will have official registration and can easily by verified with a tag.  Charities can also maintain their own blog and post pictures about their activities. That way it's already easier to identify a charity. For more details, I recommend waiting for our update documents. Some details are still on the discussion table and I like to put your questions in too.

First, we are making the platform then we are going to other countries to promote TribeToken and cryptocurrency usage. Meanwhile, when more users start using the platform the demand for TribeTokens will increase. We will add more usages for TribeTokens at the platform in the future while developing it. We are just at the first steps of this project as you can understand. Also, you have to remember that this token is focused on charity and creating a portal for decentralized charity. If done well we can have big charities start using the platform and that will cause a huge demand increase in TribeTokens.  I will announce more info regarding TribeToken near Monday. It will give more info how the platform will work technically.",False

In the short term, we want to focus on making the charity platform then make partners with bigger charities and add them to the platform. Like global charities and smaller ones that deliver. The platform itself will start with low fees to promote usage. When TribeToken delivers the tokens will become worth more. TribeToken wants to create more transparency into charity by making it decentralized and that the people who need help get helped.   People talking about escrow and how the contract will work let me answer that question too. Currently, we have no official advisors or escrow. We are planning the following to make a multisig wallet contract of 4 owners and 3 are needed to do any transaction from the assets above the daily limit we set. The owners are spread across different countries. So assets for the project are in safe hands. We will release everything off that 2 days before the ICO. Most code can already by viewed that we have currently on our github page.  When the ICO crowdsale contract receives Ethereum it will automatically send the TribeTokens to the user's Ethereum wallet.",False

What is TribeToken?  TribeToken (TRIBE) is a decentralized charity platform. We use Tokens, but unlike other Tokens, TribeToken is fully dedicated to charity and is decentralized. Unlike most digital currencies, TribeToken doesn’t have its own Blockchain, but it uses Ethereum’s Blockchain, which is more secure and has an infrastructure already deployed. TribeToken doesn’t have any central servers and no authority can control or stop it which means no limits and the Tokens will not be frozen no matter what. TribeTokens can be used to donate or create charities on the TribeToken’s platform and can be traded on exchanges.  How to get TribeToken?  Currently you can get TribeToken by buying it with Ethereum (ETH) at the ICO (1 ETH is 3000 TRIBE). In the future you can get TribeToken by buying it at exchanges with a credit card, a bank or with cryptocurrencies.  Meet the team behind TribeToken   The ICO  We want to hold an ICO to distribute TribeTokens and to get funds, that will be used to develop the decentralized charity platform.    ICO Specifications:  ICO Starting date: July 24th, 12:00 UTC  ICO Ending date:  August 14th, 12:00 UTC  Total TribeToken Supply: 200 000 000 TRIBE  20 000 000 - Team  10 000 000 - Tribe Economy  10 000 000 - Bounties and partnerships  160 000 000 - ICO remaining will be burned  Maximum goal  50 000 ETH  Minimum goal 500 ETH  Token exchange rate: 3000 TRIBE = 1 ETH  Minimum transaction amount: 300 TRIBE = 0.1 ETH  20% Bonus Tokens the first 7 days after the ICO has started.  Our Roadmap  What is the goal of TribeToken's decentralized charity platform?  The goal of TribeToken’s charity platform is to create a decentralized network of charities that can help people in any place in the world. Also we are planning to create a Tribe Economy in later development stages. Our team will be heading to undeveloped countries to create a local economy by using TribeTokens and we will keep updating the platform with new features.  TribeToken Usage After obtaining TribeTokens you can contribute in charities or create your own charity on TribeToken Charity Platform. We will have low fees on the TribeToken’s Charity Platform and 1% in transaction fees. You can also buy or sell TribeToken on exchanges.  Feel free to have a chat with us on Slack or Telegram. If you have any questions or if you want more information about TribeToken then we recommend you to read our White Paper.    Bounty Thread",False
