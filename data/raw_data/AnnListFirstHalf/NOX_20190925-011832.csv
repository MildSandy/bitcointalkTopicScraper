The consequences have been huge and have highlighted a major issue in the games industry today.  For the Few, Not the Many  The large and growing imbalance of power between developers and communities is bringing oligarchical-like consequences; just a few major companies have a say in what gets the quality assurance of a triple A title, and what gamers get to play.  Within this industry; gamers, publishers, developers and financiers all have an investment in the games being released. When one party refuses to listen to the other, or decides to take advantage (which occurs far too often), then the game itself and the other stakeholders may suffer as a result. Introducing NITRO  NITRO identifies these stakeholders as key players, and understands the risks and rewards between the relationships they have with one-another. NITRO’s Blockchain-based project was created to address problems inherent in the industry. But what makes people think that NITRO will have an impact? Well, It’s the first ever project to be backed by the PLC iCandy with a huge mobile gaming network of over 340 million existing users currently playing their games. NITRO has a phenomenal business infrastructure behind it significantly reducing the risk of its execution come launch day. But how does NITRO plan to solve these problems?

It depends on how you look at it, so far, it seems as though it is more complementary as part of the overall ecosystem.  Gizer's token is geared towards enabling people to host and compete in tournaments on a real-time basis as its core. - So this would include functions for player to player matching (on a large scale) - Their platform would naturally be geared more towards competitive types of games  Nitro's token is more geared towards enabling all stakeholders in the industry to participate more:    1. For laypeople, this means having the opportunity to vote for games to be funded (these games need not be competitive and can span a large variety of genres)    2. For promising game companies, this means accessing the funds they need to develop games    3. For all stakeholders, this means more data transparency as transaction data are made visible on the the Ethereum blockchain.  Additionally, Nitro also has the core component of making funding options available to developers (especially those outside of more established funding markets like USA and/or Western Europe) to make and/or finish making their games. And this means that we'll have a lot more awesome games to play, which is great for diversity and culture. 😀 This is the part that we're super excited about as well!",False
