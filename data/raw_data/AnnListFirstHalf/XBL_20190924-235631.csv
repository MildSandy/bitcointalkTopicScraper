We have some private repositories that will be made public at a later date. These repos contain Graphical User Interface data and website data.  Right now we are still pretty much testing and learning EOS features, we will port the token and the Raffle&Burner on EOS, test it, once we have a working model to go with we will create repositories and start working on the production versions of these pieces of software.  We think the wait for the EOS main net launch will be very much worth it. We're looking at Edgeless at the moment, they can't even launch their platform because of ""Ethereum blockchain congestion"". So it could be worse than having to wait until Summer for the EOS launch - we could still be developing on Ethereum.",False

Seems like the Crypto market is run by tech nerds and Nasdaq types who will over value anything with either new tech and or alleged ""business solutions"". ""All companies are going to want to put their documents on random cryptocurrencies from the internet cause muh blockchain and blockchain is the future."" Or some such thinking. The market is oversaturated with this kind of stuff right now IMO.  If I'm going to hold something remotely long term I like a use case and I can't think of a use case more likely to catch on than online gaming. It's arguably one the most likely if not the most likely to see massive growth in the next few years. It's like a lot of people can't comprehend that there are a lot of regular people out there who don't care about the latest in tech, privacy or ""business solutions"" they just want to play poker. And in the not so distant future it's normal people not the crowd that's in crypto right now that will set prices.  The amount of coins here is already tiny at a little over 3milly and only getting smaller from here on out thanks the raffle system you have come up with. I'm very happy with the progress so far. I of course don't know for sure if you guys have what it takes to build the gaming platform you promised but judging buy the progress you've made since I've been here with the raffle and website I feel I have reason to be hopeful. If people want sell for this cheap I'm happy to take their coins. The risk vs reward ratio is rather good here IMO.

I love all the elements and front end development that has taken place. Could we maybe put together a list of forums or relevant online communities for us to start getting conversations going? Maybe even put together some Youtube vids of player experiences once the raffle and games are in full swing. I think the one thing missing from most of the coins is a need for it. I helped with IFC back in '14 and we had lots of cool ideas and even a nice website. I was researching promotional materials such as key drives loaded with IFC to give away at conventions and some other things. In any case, the one thing that was missing no matter how shiny we polished that turd(51% attack recently) was any reason to even have it. All of the coins said they were the next best thing, but why? In the case of XBL, there is a legit use for it and without it people can't participate in the games and raffles. I think a crucial part of its evolution will be a mobile app that allows the playing of the games.  So again, kudos and thank you to the entire team.",False

Someone would have to call this function after the time resets to reset the Raffle.  Smart Contracts can't really do things on their own. They rely on outside stimulation to function. They are passive and not active.  This being said: We can implement a timer, of course.

So apparently ETH can only handle so many computations in a single transaction.  The first iteration of the test Raffle was a success, we had three winners. The second iteration (this one that we're on right now) however, we've had a few more tickets registered and a few more unique players and:    Having to trigger the Raffle Reset function, we sent the maximum allowable gas for a block and we still encountered the out of gas error. A simple computation, that your laptop can do in under 0.5 seconds, the ETH network can not handle due to its sluggish nature.  This being said however, I already have some ideas on how to get a working version of the Raffle:  We can optimize the Raffle code, to loop more efficiently and thus take less processing time, but that still won't give us an unlimited number of players, the ETH Network will still have its limits. After optimizing the Raffle we could go even further and split the winner selection loops into three separate transactions. And then ultimately, we can just have the Raffle auto reset itself after a certain number of tickets have been registered, making sure that we are never in any danger of having the Raffle stuck like we have here. This will increase the player&ticket limit, while ensuring that the Raffle Reset transaction will never run out of gas.  Now... The Raffle will work after a few little programming tricks and everyone will be happy, but I think we have to understand that ultimately, the underlying problem here is that the Ethereum Network is way too slow to have any real large scale DAPPS built on it.  This is one of the key reasons I am such a big advocate for moving over all of our infrastructure to a new, faster Decentralized Application Blockchain - like EOS. If EOS delivers what is in their roadmap, then problems like these will be a thing of the past. We'll be talking about this like we are talking right now about ancient slow PCs (""Remember when they had a 2 MB Hard Drive the size of a truck back in the day?"" - this is Ethereum in its current state a little bit further down the road).",False

So if u can keep 5 percent or 10 percent of weekly incoming raffle entry tickets entry fees as some fiat currency in a seperated wallet, it could be given to the last 3 holders of the coin, I mean the last raffle 3winners get the billion worth of coin, this concept is even suitable to our project name and it also incentivise people to play till end instead of abandoning in the middle of deflationary process.

In the week or so it has finished they have listed on an exchange and CMC, and have had solid progress on their Github. How much progress do you expect them to make in that period of time?  Makes me laugh that people come here demanding an instant product as soon as an ICO has ended like they can just magically make one appear, the point of an ICO is to raise the funds needed to develop the product.  Most ICO's when they finish they don't have anything for months, Edgeless is one I have been following that is in the same market as XBL. ICO finished in March and they have a very simple website that doesn't really tell you anything and they still do not have a finished product. However they have a $70 million marketcap.  I am very happy with the progress XBL has made in a short amount of time, soon they will have a product in the burner and raffle to give XBL a use. Then hopefully by the end of next month the GUI, dice games and new website tying it all together, after that there is Poker by the end of the year hopefully and many more games in the future. So when you compare them to Edgeless they are miles ahead of schedule and their marketcap is tiny so the returns for us on the ground floor of this project will be huge within a relatively short period of time.",False

Oh but wait, they were going to release the Raffle/Burner this week - it didn't happen, more lies. You also have the developer of course telling you a simple website that takes 1 day to finish will be done in November. You want the team? Wait until November as well lol, because you need the website to introduce the team, other ways are dead for this gluedog scammer guy.  Want some more news about those 5-10 members?

I hope we could get some more information about the team. How do you plan on increasing your casino (better say future casino) user base, which eventually drives up demand ? And what are the estimated projected figures for the user base by end of the year? I am just trying to get some info in order to predict somehow the token's future price for investing purposes. The concept of deflation with low supply and high demand leaves no other choice for the token price but to go up! However, this will never happen if you don't have a clear marketing plan in place to acquire and retain customers.  I come from the marketing world and acquiring/retaining online customers is tricky, especially with no previous experience. Hopefully, you use some of the funds raised through the ICO to hire marketing professionals, as I believe that is the fuel that will lit the fire (more users -> higher demand/lower supply -> higher price). Would appreciate it if you had any input in this aspect, thank you!   Quote from: Champion123 on September 24, 2017, 10:06:12 AM Quote from: H055Y on September 24, 2017, 10:02:46 AM It seems to me the only reasons you two (Fatoshi & Champion) are spreading FUD around here is because you guys didn't buy enough at ICO price, are trying to get hodlers to dump it so u can get some more cheap. Go look at your pathethic XBY charts and cry but don't come over here acting like little kids or panicscreechers over a thing called volume which the dev itself already addressed as ""fake volume"" but is nothing he can worry or change anything about. If we lose money on this it's our own fault, we don't need FUD to tell us what we are experiencing. So shut up and take a seat or get your XBL at the price it is and live with it.  I am not associated with Satoshi or XBY in any way. I just joined the forum few days ago, I come from an economics background and I don't like FUDing. I like telling people the truth though because most of them don't really understand how these P&D schemes work and end up losing everything.

A large team? Give us a break, you are just 1-2 developers, probably working in the basement with no office at all. If you were a large team working on several projects at once, you would have revealed yourselves by now, not hiding behind the curtains. But of course since the end goal is to suck in as much money as possible from investors, it does no good to you revealing who you really are in your life.  Oh and to everyone else calling me a FUD-er, take a quick look at the price now - it has crashed so hard EXACTLY like I said it would. You see now why I was selling when I did that it was almost the peak? Because I knew the price would crash down later on. Anyone with half a brain could have predicted that. So, I sold off everything and bought them back 3x cheaper and gonna sell them high again. I wasn't the only person selling off and buying cheaper that day. Many of the so called ""Hodlers"" did that too, because they knew the price would come down to ~ ICO price few days later. I didn't need FUD for that, it happened on its own. Yet, that day I was crucified as a FUD-er by people clearly invested in this so hard they let go of logic for a while and give in to emotions (so biased). The ""future billionaire richness"" has clouded all of your judgments.  Anyway, let's suppose for a moment I am indeed a FUD-er and that I am doing everything I can to bash this project. Let's also suppose this whole project isn't an elaborate P&D scheme to suck in all money from investors (the way I see it this has already been happening in Cryptopia via bots that no one knows whose control they are under). Let's suppose it's real and the developers are really working hard. Then can any enlightened person explain to me why a huge team like this one is still a shadow with no names given at all? There is absolutely NO reason for a company to withhold team info especially in the crypto world, where a team and a whitepaper only receive valuations in the millions. The ONLY reason is if you are going to participate in fraud.  So, here is the deal - answer to me that question with an answer that makes sense and I will leave this thread forever. I actually wanted to, but just returned to tell people here ""I told you so"" about my price predictions a few days ago - I was right and I was called a FUD-er. Answers that make sense also do NOT include:  1) He will reveal himself and his team after the ICO is over - gluedog's words, lies so far. 2) He will reveal himself and his team when he quits his job in real life since this is a side project for him and not sure if it ever will get traction - more lies. The project got more than enough traction (my very reason why I am writing such a long ass post right now) raised almost $200K and according to the developer and speculators here the coin will hit the moon after the games are released, meaning the coins the developer is holding will be worth hundreds of thousands or even millions later down the road. So, you are telling me with all these benefits and since the ICO went better than gluedog's expectations (guess he didn't think there were so many stupid people around), he still has not quit his job?  Put yourself in his shoes. You are given a project like this one, $200K to use as funds to develop the project and you can't even make an effort to show your team because you still haven't quit your job? Is this really an answer that makes sense to each and everyone of you invested in this? It sure as hell doesn't in my book. If it does for you, then I have no doubt your account is just an alt of gluedog's, especially since most accounts posting in here are new (yeah I know including me). No investor in their right mind would never question the team's existence or ask about it, ever! The team is the first thing everyone asks, but here in this thread/ANN/project, it doesn't seem to make a difference at all. Wondering why...  P.S. Let the anti-FUD wars against me continue (because I am a FUD-er for predicting what will happen to the market LMAO), but seriously answer my question above if you can!",False

People have a right to be suspicious until they see a product on the table. However, there are a glut of coins with no product and vague plans, so I think the patience is more likely to be worth it than not for this project since the plans are extremely clear. This is why I took the risk in the first place.  This is an extremely low cap project, so if you are truly not comfortable holding until you see a product then you have very low risk tolerance and I am rather confused why and how you ended up in the coin at this point. If you are all in on it or something hoping for a profit... well then I have no idea why you waited to take your profits. If you bought in at ICO prices, & are not comfortable with holding long, you can do something like take out half and ride out the rest for a while. If you went heavy on this after ICO price and did not understand it can take a while to make games... well look at every other gaming coin lol.  I agree the same few people are doing their best to pump up the product... it started with a $200K cap! Nobody knows it exists. While their shilling is surely in large part self-interest (a self-interest I can hardly deny), but there are not many people to shill so of course it is just the same few people.  Anyway sorry if this post is scattered, I tried my best to address any points I could think of.

This imo is a very good explanation of the mindset of different types of investors. Shoot, if we take the current price of ~8100 sats = .30 cents, that's already a 3x from the ICO price of .10 cents, without the bonus  We have raffle code being worked on, more people added to the team.  A roapmap was typed out by Gluedog a couple pages back.  I'm not sure what else can be done to make it any better at this stage.  Anyone who happened to find this coin early and bought in, just dinged the register.  My only regret, of course, is not buying more    Again, great job!

Only people that had played the raffle the previous week, will be able to register coins to the Burner 2. People will only be able to register to the burner at the most, +5% what they put in the raffle  This is done so that someone with an automated script can't just always take the burner reward. We would then have a lot of unhappy people, and a lot of happy scripters.      Hey,  Raffle and Burner should be implemented this week. If everything goes to plan. We have decided last night to make these last-minute changes, which should delay the deployment but not by much, we should still be able to do it sometime this week. Keep in mind, we will not deploy these until we are 100% sure that they are tested and secure.  For the advertising we have a few things in store.

I never held any for too long though. In 2013 I sold 12 BTC for $100 each, just a few months before it peaked to over $1000. Ever since then I've been flirting with the idea of making my own coin. But this never really became a reality until June of this year when I decided I will actually do it. I've seen way too many incompetent developers, way too many scammers. I've always asked myself the question: ""Why did these people abandon their projects?"" ""There was so much money for them to make if they just... kept on working..."".  Then I realized the truth: If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself. Nothing was going to change the reality, stupid devs will keep on making coins and running away with the money, leaving so much potential go to waste. Something had to change. Too much of my money was wasted on very promising projects with bad developers.  So, I combined my love for programming with my love for cryptocurrencies and my love for games into one idea: Billionaire Token.  It started out as a fun project, just a small experiment. I was curious to see where it would go: So I did it... Now, three weeks into the ICO, we're reaching a point where things start to become serious - it's not just a fun experiment anymore, and I am very much prepared for the challenges that lie ahead. I will do my absolute best to make Billionaire Token great, truly great.  At this point it's not even about money anymore for me. It's personal. Competition turns me on. I always strive to be the best. I truly believe my project has a very good chance of being one of the top actors in the crypto-gambling and gaming scene.  One thing to think about is: I have said before, if the EOS blockchain delivers what is promised: A superior platform, faster, better, stronger than Ethereum and everything else that is available today, then we will most likely become the first decentralized gaming platform running on the EOS network. A member of our team has already started learning EOS decentralized application development. We also have many more games waiting to be announced - so stay tuned for these, they will be entertaining to say the least.

I have seen so many flaky devs this year alone.  Especially when the market started absolutely blowing up.  I have said it before on this thread, but I appreciate the transparency here.  The EOS platform is very interesting.  I need to learn a little more about it, but suffice to say if XBl is able to become the first gambling platform on the EOS network, we are in for a treat and a wild ride.   A question:  I don't know if it was mentioned before.  The ANN is getting quite long lol . . what are your thoughts on EtherDelta?  Any talk of opening up trading there?  I know the volume isn't the greatest and Cryptopia is a much better choice, just throwing it out there to hear what Gluedog has to say.   Thank you very much!

What's up billionaires.  I want to reveal that I am ""the original"" XBL whale. You guess which address is mine.   Other then that, I am a crypto trader/enthusiast/consultant. I don't claim to know everything, but I'm slowly learning.  I would like to fill you guys in on why I chose to hodl this ERC20 token above other ICO's. It's difficult to maneuver through the crypto-space lately. Teams approach investors hat in hand, promising ""moon"" prospects, but end up taking months to get going. Crypto empires are built up or tore down overnight. If you've been in this space for the past few years, I'm sure you've witnessed the growing pains and volatility that seems inseparable to the market.  I can tell gluedog is serious about this project. Just like anything in tech: If you want your idea to succeed, objectives need to be set and achieved realistically. His intentions are clear, without maliciousness.  I just want to congratulate gluedog on having a successful ICO. That's saying alot in the current state of the market. The whole bitcoin/ethereum ""ICO"" community continues to suffer losses due to geo-political intervention. Anyone that invested ETH early in XBL now feels hurt, but that's volatility for you. Unless you held ETH sub 300 USD days, then good for you.  Crypto is all about facilitating economic freedom and anonymity, removing the individual from governmental control. That's what DPR was attempting to create with Silk Road.  Anyways, I hope this gives you guys hope. Don't go into this expecting instant gratification, but invest in the long-term! I already see progress being made with the cryptopia enlisting.  Cheers and God Speed!  ",False

DOT is used to pay the listing fee for Cryptopia.  Most likely Cryptopia will be our first exchange. After getting listed on Cryptopia we will apply for a coinmarketcap listing (so people have time to buy rather cheap XBL before it gets on coinmarketcap).  And after we're listed on Coinmarketcap and Cryptopia, we will apply for HitBTC and/or Nova.  After that we will start the next phase of our project, which should be very very exciting. More info to come. We will be releasing some very important news!  Also stay tuned for this weekend, as we are releasing the Hillbilly ANN and Whitepaper",False

I think that those smaller exchanges are good choices, especially early on, so the coin has a chance to be developed further and gain traction within the greater crypto community.  I personally would like a Cryptopia listing, but they have increased their listing fee dramatically in the last 6-12 months.  And of course, the huge increase in btc price didn't help listing fee cost either . . well, yea, I guess it did for all of us who were already invested.

Basically, the Raffle works in the following way: Users must first call approve() on the XBL Contract Address allowing the Raffle to spend tokens on their behalf. After this, users must call the registerTickets() function on the Raffle Contract Address with the number of tickets they want to register as an argument.  Example:  Code:     function approve(address _spender, uint256 _amount) returns (bool success)  The user will first call approve(RAFFLE_ADDRESS, 20000000000000000000) on the XBL Contract Address. They have just approved the Raffle to spend 20 XBL (+18 zeroes) on their behalf.  Code: function registerTickets(uint256 number_of_tickets) returns (int8 registerTickets_STATUS)  Assuming the price of one ticket is 20, then the user must call registerTickets(20) on the Raffle Contract Address.  Now you're in. You've just registered a ticket to the raffle. You have the chance to become the grand winner!  All of this is easy for a cryptohead but might seem just a tad bit complicated for your average gambler.  We will be aiming to go mainstream with Billionaire Token and as such we will develop a GUI to be used in conjunction with the Raffle and the Burner . This GUI will use Metamask and will be usable through our website initially. We will also be looking into developing stand-alone clients.  Basically, people will play the Raffle, play with the Burner, play Poker and not even know they're on a blockchain. It will be gambling for the masses with all the benefits that crypto currencies and blockchain technology brings: accountability, traceability and security.",False

It was supposed to be constructive, but nowadays I see tens, even hundreds of ICO-s every single month coming out. The first thing an investor sees is the website. To truly differentiate yourself from the other hundred ICO-s, the website needs to be at least on par with the industry standards. If you chase people away from the site, they won't even read the whitepaper or anything else that helps them convince to invest. I don't know, maybe I look at everything from a marketing/UX (user experience) perspective, but that website truly needs a re-design. I can give you some recommendations if you want, but since you are a developer, I guess you already knew a lot of stuff about that.  Anyway, another concern is the fact that if someone buys in more than 15% of the tokens, you will have a problem with the distribution system as you said so yourself. The buy limit however does not resolve this problem. In the banking world, it would. But in the crypto world, all you need is an address to get the money. And in your case, an address + an email. You think an individual cannot create tens of addresses & emails and buy a lot of coins for himself under different aliases?

Using a blockhash means that the miners can influence the result of the random number generator to a certain degree. They could conceivably have a chance at the prize per block they mine.  We can do a few things to avoid anyone from cheating this way (although highly unlikely they will be able to even without the following measures):  1. Change the random number generator to be externally seeded from a source like random.org. This would mean that we would have to trust random.org, though.  2. Make the raffle_bowl mapping private before releasing the raffle - so that nobody can see what position they are in the ticket queue by just watching this variable - they could still however check the blockchain explorer and see how many people called registerTickets() during that week, although they would not see the return value of this function (so they wouldn't know if those tickets got registered or not).  3. Not generate the random number in registerTickets(), but have an external script call a function checkWeek() every week on the Smart Contract so that even if we use the blockhash to seed our random number generator, so it will be impossible to find it and so users will not be able to influence the result of the Raffle.  Just implementing #2 will give us the level of security that a decentralized Raffle system needs, however we'll implement even more safeguards to guarantee a fair game.",False

Once we have this product, advertising and keeping users interested will be our primary concern. At this point is when we will start to dedicate more time and money to the marketing side of our project.

None of the above matters though, if the poker game and the rest of our games will not live up to the hype. Right now our focus is on succesfully finishing the Token Sale, getting the Raffle and the Burner deployed as soon as possible so that our coin has a use-case right away after the Token Sale - which will keep us on the legal side of things (there have been all of these ICO bans in the US, Canada, China etc. and we do not want to be put in the position where we would have to refund our customers and stop the project). After stage 3 and 4 of our roadmap are finished (""Raffle and Burner go online"" and exchange listing) and our deflationary mechanism works flawlessly, and the community is actively engaged in the project (thus creating a network effect where new investors flock in consistently) we can drive our full attention to the Billionaire Hold'em game.

However, we do not believe that Billionaire Tokens are securities. They will have a use-case right away after the token sale via our decentralized Raffle and Burner.  All in all, Billionaire Token is a self sufficient gambling system at the base of which lies an ERC-20 Ethereum Token, that will work together with two other decentralized applications deployed on the Ethereum Network. These two Smart contracts represent the core of the deflationary mechanism at the heart of everything. All of this is experimental, it has never been done before in the way we are doing it. We can not and will not make any guarantees about the future value of Billionaire Token.  None of our team members are from the US or CHINA. This ICO is not based in any one country either. We are a bunch of people from all around the world that are building open source, decentralized software for fun.  We have stated before that we will do our project no matter how many tokens we sell, we do not need these funds to finish our roadmap. Many projects start development after their token sale, we have started it before and are working on delivering the first part of our roadmap and a complete deflationary system by the end of the 31 days.",False

There's nothing to hide, it's just that at this point in time we're not sure we want to go 100% public and show our names.  I'm in the process of quitting my job and because of this, right now I can't show my linkedin profile over here and link it with this personal project of mine. The way I see it is like this: On the odd chance of the market crashing, or any other sort of unpredicted failure I will be in a very bad position had I went public with this. My team and I will still continue the project no matter what happens - however if it does indeed crash I would not be able to go forth with the plan that I have to quit my job and go full time crypto-developer. So I would need it. I would need to keep the job I have to sustain myself.  But I wouldn't be able to keep it if they found out I had any other sort of personal project - it just doesn't work that way where I work.  What I can tell you at this point is that, if we are indeed succesful with the ICO (and by the looks of it - it's going quite great), and we will have enough funds to keep the project going and we go to a point in time where I finally realize my dream of being a full time crypto-developer, then i will link my linkedIN profile here.  About the legal structure, we are in collaboration with a legal representative that will advice us on moving forward. You are absolutely correct, if we will be allowing people to instantly buy XBL tokens from us, or instantly fund their gaming accounts with credits (so they don't even know they're playing on a blockchain) we will need to have the legal structure into place.",False

I have to say I preferred to receive some personal information about your team, but I can understand your decision not to do that.  I have another question for the long term. How do you plan to earn money as a company with this project. I know a part of the coins go to the team, but this is to limited to be sufficient on the long term (I do however like the fact that the percentage of the tokens that go to the team is rather low). Also with these raffels, no money will go to the future development.

However we are dedicated to bringing the lowest and most competitive fees on the market. We are also looking at implementing our own blockchain in the future, doing a 1:1 swap and having masternodes. Holding the premine is just another way we will be profiting from finishing our project.  The Billionaire Hold'em software will be released under an open-source license. We are looking at the idea of allowing community members to run the game on their servers, thus creating a truly decentralized gambling platform. Incentives for this will be in the form of comissions that every community members will gain if they host the game servers - hosting a table or more tables if you will. This will ensure the continuation of the project even if one central authority (like our company) fails because of different legal or environmental factors.

In land-based casinos, much of card counting centers on knowing the deck penetration, or how far into the shoe the dealer is before decks will be re-shuffled. This is very important information to card counters because they need to know how many decks there are before spreading their bets. Seeing as how you’re able to watch the dealer in land-based casinos, it’s actually possible to get an accurate deck penetration figure.  But in our case, the software does all of the shuffling so you don’t get to see this in person. Worse yet for card counters, is the fact that the virtual deck is shuffled every time, meaning they never have an opportunity to get deck penetration. This being the case, it’s impossible to count cards in online blackjack with any sort of confidence.",False

In order to reward deflation this coin was rewarding users with 125% of coins burns as a reward but I believe that bounty campaign has since ended.  Yea, people were quick to burn what they had, depleting the Bounty account.  The raffle will have a burner smart contract implemented.    Quote Another key ingredient to the deflationary mechanism that is embedded into Billionaire Token is the Decentralized Burner Smart Contract. The Burner receives 20% of the tokens that are sent to the weekly raffle.  Quote The weekly Become a Billionaire decentralized raffle will be the basis of the deflationary mechanism for Billionaire Token. Every week, users can send 20 XBL to an Ethereum Smart Contract address – this is the equivalent of buying one ticket, more tickets mean a better chance to win. Users can buy an unlimited number of tickets to increase their chances. At the end of the week, the Smart Contract will choose three winners at random. First place will get 40% of the tokens that were raised during that week, second place gets 20% and third place gets 10%. From the remaining 30% of the tokens: 10% are burned – as an offering to the market gods. The other 20% are sent to another Smart Contract Address that works like a twisted faucet – rewarding people for burning their own coins. The Become a Billionaire raffle Smart Contract will run forever, and will have an internal timer that will reset itself every seven days. The players are registered to the Raffle by creating an internal mapping, inside the Smart Contract, a mapping of every address that registers tokens to it and their associated number of tickets. This mapping is reset every time the internal timer resets (every seven days).  I am sure that a more thorough guide will be created for users who may not be familiar with Smart Contracts.  The way I understand it, is the Burner must be ""called on"" to burn, and must have the tokens (the 20 percent received from the raffle) or it cannot burn any tokens.  So, the more people who play the raffle, the more tokens will be in the Burner.  10 percent are burned immediately, as an offering to the market Gods lol . .  So, over time, the supply will diminish.  With the upcoming poker game, which should be going because the ICO looks like it has been successful already, even in it's third day . . this will create demand.  Demand on exchanges as well.  Demand for the raffle.  And demand for the Burner.  All in all, a good formula for economic gain.  Are the devs going to put a limit in how much can be burned?  Like lets say the supply has burned down to 1m left, will they still keep burning?  I'd like to know the answer to this, maybe your cut off is 100k?  There is no limit to how many coins can be burned. The amount burned will be a percentage of all the coins sent to the raffle.  So obviously as the supply will get lower and lower, this percentage will mean less and less coins getting burned.  We'll let the users decide how many coins will be burned, we won't impose any limits on that.   So what happens if there's only one person to put in for the raffle?  Do they get their money back automatically?  Is their a limit to the number of people who can participate in the raffle?  Like 2 ppl - to a maximum?  Yes, if there are 2 people or less participating in the raffle they will get their money back.  There have to be three or more people (accounts) that participate in the raffle for it to work as described.  So is there a maximum or no?  Does the smart contract allow for their to be an unlimited number of participants?  That is correct. The contract will allow for an unlimited number of participants.  What about security?  How can we be certain that teh integrity of the raffle say from in house cheating?  Well, as we have explained the raffle will be an Ethereum Smart Contract. It will be open-source so everyone can read the code. The code will pass through a series of security audits and peer reviews before being deployed. You can just look at the code and tell everything the contract does. So there is a 0% chance of hiding anything or cheating etc.  The ""house"" doesn't get anything from the raffle.

Or could someone stack the odds in their favor by entering into the raffle with multiple accounts? I'm sorry I don't know a lot about smart contracts.  I am glad you asked.

One of the campaigns was a burning campaign that when you burned your XBL you got that XBL back plus 25% so if you burned 1000XBL you were rewarded 1250XBL from the bounty account. The 1000XBL you burned are now permanently gone from the total supply of XBL. The bounty account is currently empty apart from the 50k XBL reserved for the Lambo bounty which nobody has claimed yet. So have to wait for the bounty account to be replenished from the raffle and other things I think. I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong on any of that.  Hope it helps.,False

The other 20% are sent to another Smart Contract Address that works like a twisted faucet – rewarding people for burning their own coins. The Become a Billionaire raffle Smart Contract will run forever, and will have an internal timer that will reset itself every seven days. The players are registered to the Raffle by creating an internal mapping, inside the Smart Contract, a mapping of every address that registers tokens to it and their associated number of tickets. This mapping is reset every time the internal timer resets (every seven days).  I am sure that a more thorough guide will be created for users who may not be familiar with Smart Contracts.  The way I understand it, is the Burner must be ""called on"" to burn, and must have the tokens (the 20 percent received from the raffle) or it cannot burn any tokens.  So, the more people who play the raffle, the more tokens will be in the Burner.  10 percent are burned immediately, as an offering to the market Gods lol . .  So, over time, the supply will diminish.  With the upcoming poker game, which should be going because the ICO looks like it has been successful already, even in it's third day . . this will create demand.  Demand on exchanges as well.  Demand for the raffle.  And demand for the Burner.  All in all, a good formula for economic gain.  Are the devs going to put a limit in how much can be burned?  Like lets say the supply has burned down to 1m left, will they still keep burning?  I'd like to know the answer to this, maybe your cut off is 100k?  There is no limit to how many coins can be burned. The amount burned will be a percentage of all the coins sent to the raffle.  So obviously as the supply will get lower and lower, this percentage will mean less and less coins getting burned.  We'll let the users decide how many coins will be burned, we won't impose any limits on that.",False

Everyone knows ICO's are used to raise funds for development. If the project was finished then they wouldn't need an ICO and could launch immediately. The point of an ICO is to secure the funding for the development and people buy into the ICO so they can contribute towards that development. In return for their contributions they get tokens at a very reduced rate which many will gain a hefty ROI when the time comes. That's what this entire industry is built on and there are always risks. This project however I feel confident in the team and what they are doing and I am happy to invest as I personally believe I will get a very nice ROI from this project.,False

This is on point.  Many coins have enormous premines and hundreds of millions of coins, many with no real use case at all, except for maybe MN's.  No innovation.  From what I'm reading, it is the aim of XBL to create the opposite economic model?  A deflationary one?    I am not a dev, but the function of the smart contracts is laid out very well.  I like that it is on the Etheruem network, and all functions are transparent and can be checked for consistency at any time.     Users must first call the approve() function on the XBL token address (0x49aec0752e68d0282db544c677f6ba407ba17ed7) with the Burner address as a parameter – allowing the Burner to spend coins on their behalf. After this, they will call the registerBurn() function on the Burner Smart Contract address, the parameter to this function being the amount of coins they have previously “approved” the Burner to spend on their behalf.  If there aren't enough tokens in the Burner address, the coins won't be burned?  I'm assuming that this acts as a sort of failsafe?  Will the Burner address ever run out of tokens?    The reasons for the different functions are pretty clear.  For someone who may not understand how to ""call functions"" are there plans to create a guide or tutorial for people who are less tech inclined to participate?  I think that the gambling aspects of the coin sound great, but to get the ""total effect"" of XBL, it sounds like people should also know how to call smart contracts on the Etheruem network.  I think that a guide or something similar, would help people to get the most bang for their buck out of the token. Are all these smart contracts able to be used through something like MyEtherWallet?  I would assume so, but figured I'd ask, in case anyone else is wondering.   In order to do this, the Billionaire Hold’em open source poker game will ask an Ethereum Smart contract to generate a number. This number will be available for everyone to see after the game ends and will be used to seed the random number generator from inside the Poker Game. Because this data can be sniffed via the network, the Billionaire Hold’em poker game application will generate another number, that will be joined with the first one generated by the Smart Contract with the help of an algorithm. This algorithm and second number will also be public knowledge. This is to ensure that any Billionaire Token poker game can be auditable.  Good.  It is imperative for a successful gambling token to be provably fair.  ",False

XBL will be available for buying only with BTC, LTC, and ETH.  Quote from: fishfishfish313 on August 14, 2017, 03:36:11 AM I read through the whitepaper . . . and I'm intrigued.    Quote Users must first call the approve() function on the XBL token address (0x49aec0752e68d0282db544c677f6ba407ba17ed7) with the Burner address as a parameter – allowing the Burner to spend coins on their behalf. After this, they will call the registerBurn() function on the Burner Smart Contract address, the parameter to this function being the amount of coins they have previously “approved” the Burner to spend on their behalf.  If there aren't enough tokens in the Burner address, the coins won't be burned?  I'm assuming that this acts as a sort of failsafe?  Will the Burner address ever run out of tokens?    The reasons for the different functions are pretty clear.  For someone who may not understand how to ""call functions"" are there plans to create a guide or tutorial for people who are less tech inclined to participate?  I think that the gambling aspects of the coin sound great, but to get the ""total effect"" of XBL, it sounds like people should also know how to call smart contracts on the Etheruem network.  I think that a guide or something similar, would help people to get the most bang for their buck out of the token. Are all these smart contracts able to be used through something like MyEtherWallet?  I would assume so, but figured I'd ask, in case anyone else is wondering.   Glad you liked the whitepaper fish  It says later on in there that if the Burner smart contract does not have enough funds to send the reward, it will throw an exception and not actually burn any coins from the user. So there's not a risk of burning coins and not receiving rewards.  Yes it is possible for the burner to run out of coins of course, imagine if everybody was using it, the burner would run out of coins pretty fast.  But then, also imagine this: the people that had used the burner and gotten their rewards will just go ahead and play the raffle again with the profits that they made (they're profits right? why not reinvest them) - helping to perpetuate the deflation of Billionaire token.  Quote from: Kishan748 on August 14, 2017, 08:17:43 AM Most percentages of the ico are coming in gambling industry Hope this is competitive enough to stay in the market for so long  I believe XBL WILL be competitive, just because the deflation mechanism is something that no other ""gambling"" coin has. It's a little extra, something to differentiate us from the competition.",False

I have talked about Bittrex and Poloniex in our original ANN post:  Quote from: gluedog Exchanges   Shortly after the Token Sale we will deploy the ""Become a Billionaire"" decentralized raffle Smart Contract on the Ethereum Network. The code will pass through a series of peer-reviews and security audits before being deployed. All information will be made public knowledge - we seek to be as transparent as possible.  We believe that after the ICO, people will need another way of safely acquiring Billionaire Tokens, and as such we will personally pay the listing fees for the Exchanges. We are looking at the following three exchanges for initial listing: - Livecoin - EtherDelta - HitBTC - NovaExchange - Cryptopia   After the ""Billionaire Hold'em"" poker game is released, we will be aiming higher.

We love to hear feedback from the community and will constantly be changing in order to make the project more attractive keep the investors happy, and as such we have decided to change the following aspects:  1. The ""Become a Billionaire"" raffle will be changed to include having three winners. This will give people more incentive to play the raffle, will make it more rewarding overall, and will help perpetuate the deflationary mechanism.  2. We will implement a Smart Contract that works together with the raffle and will reward people for burning their own coins.   Our goal, after our poker game is released, is to reach 1$ per XBL token. If the maximum supply is not larger than 1 mil, we would only need 1 mil market cap to achieve this.  The feedback has been so far mostly positive and constructive criticism.  RECAP (TL;DR)  Because of this community feedback we have so far decided to change the following aspects of the coin:  - The token distribution model will be made more fair to all participants, while still rewarding early investors as they are the ones taking the biggest risk. - The raffle will be changed to include three winners instead of just one. - There will be another Smart Contract created that will work together with the raffle, and will reward people for burning their own coins - just another incentive for the deflationary model to work its magic.  Stay tuned for the upcoming updates:  - The Whitepaper is scheduled to be released this week. - We will have a guide over at the bounty section of the forum on how to burn your own coins, so if you have some coins already then you should really look into this because you will receive 25% back. This bounty will be available during the first part of the ICO, so people who invest early can actually make a lot more XBL tokens (provided there is enough in the bounty account).",False

As of right now, there is no price set for the ICO, we're still debating over what the price and the bonuses should be. Have no fear, though, as we are specifically looking for a Token Sale setup that is most fair to all participants.  Our goal is to have the exchange prices never go below ICO price and we hope to achieve this by:  1. Setting a lower price than we originally had in mind. 2. Setting longer bonuses for everyone: In the old distribution model (the one we decided to change) we had an initial 5 hour window with a 75% bonus, after that the bonus would not get any higher than 35%. We felt that this would be unfair for the Billionaire Token buyers that did not have the chance to get in that initial, 5 hour window to get the cheapest available price. 3. Burning the tokens that are left in the Bounty Account (0x23EA016b4EBA78dFC374E99b2F6793f8d2dB3ff1) on 05-Sep-2017, when the Bounty Campaign finishes. 4.

We know this may sound like one of those annoying pop-ups you were furiously closing back in the day, but we're now in 2019 and even though there are still no flying cars around, Blockchain Technology has radically changed the way we think about money, ""internet money"" to be more precise.  Billionaire Token (XBL) is an EOS token, designed and tailored specifically for the gamblers and the smart investors of this crazy crypto world. Most other coins or tokens have some sort of mining system, but Billionaire Token has the exact opposite: It features a deflationary mechanism that destroys 30% of the gambled tokens! In addition to this, another Smart Contract - the Burner - that works kind of like a twisted Faucet, rewarding people for burning their own coins, further increases the burning. The rarity of the coin is what provides intrinsic value to the token and differentiates it from the competition. The Raffle and Burner are playable at this very moment, but this is just the beginning since we have an up-coming Billionaire Cee-Lo DICE game and a Poker Platform that will run on the EOS Main Net.  The Billionaire Token games, unlike other popular gambling platforms, are fully decentralized - We have no house and we do not host anything on our servers (like the seed generation algorithm or any sort of game engine). Everything is as it should be - on the Blockchain. And because we do not host anything on our servers, it’s also impossible for us or any of our games to ""get hacked"".  Even if you're not the gambling type, we think that long-view investors will see the value of Billionaire Token. The gambling industry is one of the most profitable environments for a business nowadays and there is much the Gambling industry can learn from Crypto Currencies.  But you can't make it in the gambling industry without having a top-notch product.  So what exactly does Billionaire Token offer that is new and exciting?    Q: How is the Billionaire Hold'em poker game going to work?  A: Billionaire Hold'em will be a piece of open-source software (a game) running on the EOS Main Network. A classic Texas Hold'em Poker game with a twist - users will be using XBL tokens as the in-game currency. Security and trust have always been a problem in the online poker scene. All the big poker platforms are centralized and thus susceptible to hacks and funds being lost or games being rigged - as the centralized entities have control over the randomness of the whole card dealing and so anyone that has access to their servers could manipulate the games.  The Billionaire Hold'em poker platform will be decentralized and thus users will not be in danger of having their funds lost or the games being rigged because no single entity will have control over the outcome of the game. We will be seeding our random number generator via an EOS Smart Contract - The seed will become public knowledge once the game is over.    Q: What are the coin specifications?  A:   Q: What about the premine ? How will you prove that half will be used for bounties and advertising campaigns?  A: Half of the 8.5% XBL tokens, the bounty funds, were initially located at Ethereum address 0x23EA016b4EBA78dFC374E99b2F6793f8d2dB3ff1, no funds left there without justification. The bounty campaign has now closed as we have successfully given out all of the rewards. Everything including the Lamborghini bounty has been claimed. More information on the Bounty Campaign can be found below. The rest of the premine (4.25%) is the property of Billionaire Token team - we believe that having a stake in the project will align our interests with those of the other token holders and will increase the projects' chances of success.   Q: Ok this looks great, but why choose an EOS token? Why not a regular coin with its own blockchain?  A: Running the Billionaire Token on the EOS network instead of having our own blockchain is better suited for our goals (deploying and running the Decentralized Raffle and Burner is much simpler on a smart contract platform). Also, it makes the whole experience a lot more user-friendly. Instead of having to download a whole new wallet and the subsequent Blockchain, Billionaire Tokens will be usable with any Scatter, the most popular and easy to use EOS wallet.   Billionaire Token roadmap (2017-2019):     A coin's value is determined by supply and demand - we think that we have the perfect plan to solve both of the following issues. We hope that our plan will have the effect of increasing the value of each token:  1: Reduce supply - The deflationary mechanism takes care of this, depending on how much usage the Raffle and Burner and other games (that will also be burning coins) have, the already-low supply of ~4 million XBL will permanently be reducing. 2: Increase demand - Apart from the benefits of the speculative aspects of owning Billionaire Token, people will be able to do super fun stuff with it, like playing the weekly Become a Billionaire Raffle and the upcoming Billionaire Cee-lo Dice and Billionaire Hold'em games. And then they can always burn their own coins for more profits!  Shortly after the Token Sale, the Become a Billionaire decentralized Raffle Smart Contracts were deployed on the Ethereum Network. The code passed through a series of peer-reviews and security audits before being deployed. All information has been made public knowledge in our quest to be as transparent as possible.  Make sure to follow our Twitter and join our Telegram channel for live updates!  - -- ----  Exchanges  On the EOS Main Net, we are trading on NewDex and Chaince.

It is great for the winner but bad for losers(which is the majority). Kthxbye.  The chances of winning the raffle depend on how many people actually register to the raffle that week.  For example: If there are 100 tickets bought for the raffle, and you have three of those tickets - then your chance of winning is 3%.  Investing in this token, I believe, is attractive because of three main reasons:  1. Potential of an extremely small supply (10% tokens in the raffle are burned, bounty tokens will be burned on 5 September 2017 or possibly sooner, and on top of this, all of the unsold tokens from the crowdsale account will be burned after the ICO) 2. The weekly raffles! 3. The ""Billionaire Hold'em"" poker game!
