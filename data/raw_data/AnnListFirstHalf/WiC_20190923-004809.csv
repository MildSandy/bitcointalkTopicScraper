I remember a few months back (I think in August) there was a section on the WiC website which was showing the pictures and names of three allegeded team members (2 male, 1 female).  But nobody was able to find any information regarding these names or pictures, the only thing someone found was that the picture of the female allegeded team meber has been shared on a twitter account which only features pictures of blonde women. After someone pointed this out here in this thread (I am not sure if it has been deleted or not, if it's still available in this thread you will find it somewhere between July and September) he deleted the section about the ""team"" on the website. But it's still available here https://icobench.com/ico/wic/team  Try your luck and search for information about Ronald B. Sao, Catherine Oliver and Deepak Kumar. You won't find any because WiC is just one person who made a good amount of money by scamming a lot of people. It was me I have found this picture and made some post here and in the telegram group. Ahh yeah thanks for mentioning! Now I was able to find the post: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2043933.msg21393478#msg21393478 Looks like I mixed up some things but just read for yourselfs",False

No dev activity shown whatsoever aside from maybe a pasted comment from telegram once in a blue moon. Lambo doesnt even care to log on and post on the thread since the tokensale is over.  He made out with our money and ran is what it looks like at this point.  Hopefully he will turn around and the app will get some use and we will see SOME value from WiC coin.... Maybe one day it will go to the value of ICO again, the initial hope was to go over.. but when people start dumping tokens directly after ""ICO"" for less than they paid it is more than fishy.    Most of ICO tokens could have been bought on livecoin by Lambo/dev from themselves and sold to themselves for cheaper price. Not really losing any of their own money there, since millions were invested in presale before livecoin. That is why presale round 1-3 tokens were locked into deposits for a few days. Couldn't even make a little bit of profit if you tried directly off ICO. That adds to the suspect of the project from the beginning of the ICO finish. Along with the rushed finish for no reason...  Without any active dev reports, support, upgrades, promotion... anything WiC has fallen into the grave.  As I said many other old coins WERE STEADY around 1-2 sat or a little higher for YEARS, then technology picks up and now the coins have exploded. Hopefully that will be the case if people actually adopt WiC and we see movement from the Dev and team.  As of now again it seems like we all were hosed unfortunately. The price in BTC doesnt matter... nobody wants a token that has 0 real world usage.  If there was more development and pushing into furthering the coin and promotion maybe it would stir some interest. But with a dead development team, half working app (only on andriod), this wont be going anywhere anytime soon...  No team, no furthering project, no promotion, and stuck only on LiveCoin with near 0 volume at all, 174$ in past 24hrs   hopefully not all the way to 1 sat.  If its a total loss then its a total loss.. been there done that. Again I'm more then glad I sold over half my tokens straight away for slightly higher than the .008 cents I paid for them.  If theres any furthering on the project, perhaps ill pick up more for the mere fractions of a penny that they are at now.",False

First of all I think it is great that we are sticking to the planned timing and get the app released so early.  It will be important that the quality of the app is right and I hope that new features will be rolled out on a regularly basis. One cruical feature for me would be that you can buy WiC conviently in the app using paypal or similar fiat tools in future. Not all users should be forced to make accounts in crypto exchanges in order to load up WiC. Probably there could be a 5% fee or something like that if you use this service in order to still drive the crypto adption forward.  Also it will be important that we get the roll out of the iOS version soon. Best would be if Lambo could provide us with a roadmap.  Most cruical thing for the price itself will be to get onto more and bigger(paid) exchanges. It will required to use some of the ICO money for exchange listing. And of course we need a lot of marketing. Here we also need an update from Lambo about which activities are being carried out, what is planned and where the user base might be able to support.

I think it will be necessary to take some of the collected money and use it for things like buying into exchanges such as cryptopia.

I'd say as soon as a few people ""sell"" their wifi, in order to compete with these and draw any traffic to your own hotspot your price would soon need to drop to near zero.. furthermore, in a highly populated area chances of people misusing your wifi and causing you legal problems seem quite real..  I've read the devs statement on page 1 that misuse is unlikely since people wanting to commit harm would be more likely to go to a free-WiFi spot at like MacDonalds rather then pay WiC for yours.. this logic however (to me) seems broken. For if there is a free-WiFi spot nearby why would anyone else rather choose to pay WiC for yours? Could be bandwidth/connection speed but the same would apply for scammers etc.. Also, everyone knows that at free-WiFi spots there is usually a ton of logging taking place.. while if you could use someones private WiFi you'd be much more anonymous..  So, as far as I see it.. high risks (misuse of your WiFi causing you legal problems) for small / neglectable gains.  In more remote locations where WiFi spots are (very) scarce it might be profitable to run the app but it would still be (in my eyes) a huge security risk and you probably won't draw a lot of traffic in less densely populated zones (so again, not much to gain..).  If anyone could explain me why I'm looking at this the wrong way round, please explain .  ---  PS: If the price goes to moon because of pure speculation however, it might still be fun to buy and hodl a few and sell at peak..",False

At the moment there is no deposit and Withdrawal available on the exchange so neither WiC can be deposited nor withdraw. So trading is happening among those who bought WiC on LiveCoin only. Nobody is so stupid to sell WiC at so cheap prices because the least offered price was 382 Sat at the exchange for buying tokens. One more thing I considered for these analysis, The remaining tokens which were more than 200,00000, supposed to be burnt 50% and other remaining 50% supposed to be transffered to WiC Dev. As deposit and withdrawal are offline, it means Dev's 50% tokens are still in exchange. It is most likely that these cheap prices are being offered by dev, from 50% untransferred tokens. It is out of question that any of livecoin participants can offer the cheap price upto 202 Sat as nobody bought any token less than 382. There are just my own analysis.

I think the idea is good because it bases the wic/fiat exchange purely on the market.  The only doubt I would have is regarding the simplicity. As far as I understand, other giftcards already contain a code or similar which often needs to be scratched off and then have a fixed amount of something (e.g. ""itunes money"") on it. If I understand your approach correctly now, users can buy wallets on plastic cards and retailers need some sort of terminal in order to load them up with wic. In order to make this work in a bulletproof way I am guessing that you would need provide hardware with pre-installed software to the retailer which would connect to a service you are hosting which allows for quick and easy loading up of the cards using best market conditions. Would that assumption be correct or do you have other plans (like e.g. only having wic cards available at specially trained retailers)?",False

An easier way would be to train them or give manuals on how to buy WiC and load it on to the cards.  You must have heard of paper wallets right? Gift cards can essentially have the same concept as in the public key will be open and used by the retailers to load up the desired amount of WiC and the private key will have to be scratched off by the consumer.  This is not set in stone though and we might have improvements and changes when we are closer on implementing this.  Thanks!,False

Knowing some parts of the retail industry it is hard for me to imagine that most of the people there will be able to handle crypto currencies. Maybe if you don't provide any hardware but if you provide the software as a service for all the retailers that might work. I would imagine that no retailer needs to register at some exchange but that instead they will get a login for your trading portal and you will buy the wic at the various exchanges for them in the background for the best conditions.

Anyways, please read below:  Important Update:  After taking legal advice and speaking with the concerned persons, we would like to inform you the following:  1) As per legal advice we will not be publishing any videos or social links of any of the team members.  2) The profile that was given (@Breanneburke) appears to be of an account that posts pictures of random blonde women as also suggested by its #blondeglobetrotter.  3) We can offer everyone who has second thoughts about our project to claim a full refund of their contribution without any conditions. Full 100% refund with no conditions. You have 48 hours from now to make the claim by emailing admin@cryptowi.com about it.  4) Note that this is not required to be done by us since that is not the terms of the contribution or the escrow. We are still doing this in good faith and because we value the community and our supporters more than the amount we have raised.  5) We have spent a lot of time, efforts and money developing the CryptoWi app and we plan to go forward with the project even if we refund all the contributions.  6) Lastly, if this was not a genuine project, we would never have offered refunds even when we are not required to do so by the terms of the sale. I have never seen any Token Sale refund its contributors after receiving the money.  Again if you have any doubts about the authenticity of the project, please email admin@cryptowi.com within 48 hours and your contribution will be refunded in full without any questions.  Thank You!  Update 1: We have removed the team pictures from the website so that the same issue is not raised again (and create unnecessary FUD) and any future contributors in the token sale on livecoin.net do not face any issues.",False

Every ICO, short of, like, the brainchild of Vitalik Buterin and Da Hongfei, carries quite a bit of risk, and anyone who spends money on them that they can't afford is asking for trouble. You take a risk, and maybe you get rewarded or maybe you lose it all.  But more importantly, what are the incentives for a scammer? If the goal is to take the money and run, there are easier ways of doing it than the path WiC has been on (30+ pages on the original thread this spring, and now almost 90 on this one, active engagement with the community, partnerships with livecoin and reputable escrow-ers, etc.). You're unlikely to go through all that if you don't even plan to send out tokens. And if you do send out tokens, you might as well follow through with the idea at least far enough to pump the thing and get even more $$ out of it. In the latter case, ICO participants likely also do well.  The point is probably 1 ICO in 100 actually succeeds in the bigger picture, but from the perspective of the investor, ICOs are more about short-term profit than they are about finding the next ETH. With that in mind, the standards for judging the merits of an ICO change somewhat. It's less about 'will this really succeed?' and more about 'will this appeal to the extremely Lambo-obsessed crypto community enough to capture their attention and spike in value after release?"".",False

I agree that any ICO is a risk, then it's up to you how do you choose to mitigate the risk and maximize success when making the decision whether to participate - this is what I'm mostly ranting about.  The incentives for a would-be-scammer are money from ICO, and I think there are plenty. Note that I'm not saying CryptoWi is a scam and I'll be happy if in a couple of years I can walk streets of, say, Madrid, as a tourist, while enjoying Wi-Fi access through CryptoWi app. But still.  Possibly, we assess the effort and costs differently, but lets look what we have: 1) thread for 130 pages on the forum where someone would post news, answer questions etc 2) create, host, maintain a website (without any complex functionality and amateurish-looking, to be honest) 3) develop ""application prototype"" shown on videos 4) maintain telegram channel/facebook page 5) promote on steemit, medium, icolert, some other crypto media sites? 6) escrow anything else I missed? My estimate for pp.1-4 is more than $50k. I dont know how much p.5 and 6 cost, but I doubt the total would exceed $200k. Even if I'm wrong and underestimating the costs for 2-3 times, there is still plenty of incentive, and I'm not aware of an easier way of doing a million dollars in a few months (pls PM me if you do )  As for the ICO model you've described - I understood it as a pyramid. Get tokens earlier, sell them later to someone else for inflated price, move on. So yeah, as in any pyramid, some people will make money.  But how do you think, would this make more people put more trust into ICOs/crypto as a whole? Wouldn't it actually harm the crypto industry (still in its puberty, if not childhood) if there are two projects on the similar topic, but one of them is a pyramid? Would scams cause more attention and regulation attempts from the government? I agree that very little percentage of ICOs are successful projects - basically, as any startups - but by participating in pyramid-like ICOs we ourselves are making this percentage even smaller, aren't we?  So, however naive and pompously this may sound, I'm all for investing only in the projects that wouldn't consider a pyramid, to ultimately help mass adoption of crypto and personal gain, rather than personal gain alone.

Here are some thoughts:  - The background animation is very high-contrast and makes the overall page appear busy. Could you tone it down or reduce the contrast? - The top navigation bar gets a bit lost because it's small, and there are so many other things going on on the page. Could you make it more obvious? - The WiC logotype (not the logo itself) also gets lost in all the action. If there ends up being some extra budget to throw at a professional designer, I think this would be something to focus on; having the logotype in a very generic serifed font means it will often get lost when placed against bolder patterns, and makes it look a bit 'Word 2003'. - The horizontal blue bars are indigo-ish (i.e., they are a purplish blue), whereas the background is a dark aqua/teal (i.e., a greenish blue). The two colours clash. Could you change the horizontal bars to a shade of blue that complements the background? - Overall, it looks OK but not 'professional'--like it was made by someone proficient in code but less so in graphical design. Longer term, I think it will be worth considering a more professional overall brand befitting WiC's growth and (hopefully) success.  Not a professional graphic designer by any means, and I'm certainly not claiming to have an expert opinion. I do work in communications and outreach, though, so I'm involved peripherally in web-design and branding work and get to see the pros in action. Anyway, easy to sit here and complain from the sidelines when it's you guys doing all the work, so, again...thanks for all your efforts on this project.

There is too little information on them here or in search engines, can you post their Facebook/Linkedin profiles here and on the website?  2) What does exactly one buys with Wic? I mean, buying password itself is useless.  3) If you buy access to someone's wifi, is it limited by duration, total usage time, total traffic? If it is, can the owner set any or all of these parameters?  4) If I buy a password, use wifi for some time, and then the connection is lost (owner chooses to change password, turns wifi off, a dozen of other reasons), what happens?  5) If I buy a password and find the connection quality inadequate (for legitimate reasons, or because the owner uses traffic shaping, noone knows), what happens (any refund mechanics)?  6) Is there a desktop (PC/Mac/*nix) version of the application planned?   Thanks in advance for the answers, they should greatly improve confidence in the project!",False

We are getting legal advise and also hiring some legal experts because of the complex environment regarding Token Sales and will publish details once we get the go ahead from legal. You might, for example, know that making an app (that too this complex) is not a one man job and Deepak is just the development team lead. There are around a total of 12-15 members in the team including full time employees, independent contractors and interns. Also, we have actually gone ahead, spent money and time and developed a real product the demo video of which has been posted. Also, both the Presale and the Token Sale will also be fully escrowed by highly reputed members of the community for your safety.  2) WiC is the only mode of payment accepted in the app and hence it is used to buy WiFi. Don't see how that is uselss though. In fact this gives WiC a real world use case.  3) At the moment, the WiFi user pays a one time fee for the network but we plan to introduce a feature where the uploader will specify aminimum and maximum time and data limit for the connection and the buyer will be able to see this before purchasing.  4) For the above mentioned reason, the amount paid will be lost as of now. But we will be changing this with future updates.  5)There are no refund mechanics as of now and we plan to introduce features where users will be able to rate WiFi networks and also upload speed test results.  6) No, only mobile apps for now.

Here are some thoughts:  - The background animation is very high-contrast and makes the overall page appear busy. Could you tone it down or reduce the contrast? - The top navigation bar gets a bit lost because it's small, and there are so many other things going on on the page. Could you make it more obvious? - The WiC logotype (not the logo itself) also gets lost in all the action. If there ends up being some extra budget to throw at a professional designer, I think this would be something to focus on; having the logotype in a very generic serifed font means it will often get lost when placed against bolder patterns, and makes it look a bit 'Word 2003'. - The horizontal blue bars are indigo-ish (i.e., they are a purplish blue), whereas the background is a dark aqua/teal (i.e., a greenish blue). The two colours clash. Could you change the horizontal bars to a shade of blue that complements the background? - Overall, it looks OK but not 'professional'--like it was made by someone proficient in code but less so in graphical design. Longer term, I think it will be worth considering a more professional overall brand befitting WiC's growth and (hopefully) success.  Not a professional graphic designer by any means, and I'm certainly not claiming to have an expert opinion. I do work in communications and outreach, though, so I'm involved peripherally in web-design and branding work and get to see the pros in action. Anyway, easy to sit here and complain from the sidelines when it's you guys doing all the work, so, again...thanks for all your efforts on this project.",False

Ethereum is a blockchain platform on which other applications can run. WiC tokens are Ethereum ERC20 tokens--that is, WiC is an independently developed project whose tokens run on Ethereum's blockchain. There is no WiC independent of the Ethereum blockchain (this is not unique; e.g., EOS, GNT, PAY, OMG, 0x, and many other big names are Ethereum tokens).  So, you paid X amount of money to the WiC devs in BTC, LTC, or ETH (in this case, ETH is being used simply as a 'coin'), which entitles you to Y number of WiC tokens. When you bought your tokens, you had to specify an Ethereum ERC20-compatible address--that is, you need an Ethereum wallet that supports tokens that run on the ERC20 standard. Later, when WiC tokens are distributed, they will be sent to this address. Since they are Ethereum ERC20 tokens and not something with an independent blockchain, you will always use an Ethereum wallet to manage them. You would trade these tokens--no additional exchanging. The tokens you receive into your Ethereum wallet are as real as your WiC will ever get.

Hey, we have thought about this and understand that the majority of the people either do not know about crypto or do not want to get involved with it for various reasons. To solve this issue we will be taking several steps to make WiC purchases easy for the average user. Some of the major ones are as below (sourced from the whitepaper):  WiC/Local currency exchange – Another planned feature, aimed at making the end user experience smooth and hassle free is enabling the ability to buy WiC directly from the app using traditional payment methods like debit/credit cards and net banking. The main purpose of this is to make it easy for those users who do not want to get involved with crypto currencies in any way and just want access to cheap and reliable WiFi.  Another thing we intend to do is have WiC reloadable cards available at gas stations and retail convenience stores, so that people even without the knowledge of crypto currencies will be able to use our app without issues. How this will work is similar to how reloadable gift cards work. Users will have the option to use their local currency at local outlets that will give them pre-loaded unscratched WiC cards with private keys that can be used to load the purchased balance in to the CryptoWi app. This way we eliminate the need for the end user to know how crypto currencies work and make WiFi sharing easy and hassle free.",False

The two ideas seem quite different in scope regardless. Ammbr is trying to build its own network from scratch, with users acquiring and deploying dedicated Ambrr routers. It would be huge if successful, but there are a lot of barriers to success, not least of which is the development and roll-out of the router device itself. It's unclear if they even have a working prototype at this time. In that respect, it's more like a self-driving car or SpaceX's Hyperloop--a neat idea that's still a long way from actual mainstream adoption.  WiC is leveraging existing technologies to essentially crowdsource internet access. It may not have the wow factor, but it's very doable in real life. It's more like Uber or Airbnb--simple ideas that disrupted their respective industries. Who knows if WiC can pull that off for internet access, but in the short term I don't see WiC and Ammbr as direct competitors.

We have no idea what WiC will be worth when it hits markets, but it's going to be more than $0.008 unless something goes horribly wrong. As a bounty hunter (and, frankly, as investors in the ICO) you're gambling that WiC will be worth 25 cents, 50 cents, a buck, even a few bucks, at which point getting those 500 or 1000 WiC 'for free' is a pretty tidy return for a couple of hours' work.

But as an advocate of non-crypto-people I have some simple non-crypto questions:  Let's say people like to use this app.  In the whitepaper I read they use Wicoins for this.  Though as an investment incentive for cryptopeople this looks like gold when millions use this app, the price will fluctuate.  Let's say you buy 100 WIC for $100, you'd have some expextations about how long you'd be able to connect.  You don't want to buy 100 WIC and see one year later you can connect 5 mins with that amount?  So price has to be flat, no?  Non-crypto people don't want to buy some coin at some exchange which fluctuates.  They want to buy minutes of online wifi time with their paypal (or MAYBE in some future with some major non-fluctuating cryptocurrency like bitcoin).  Just a coin for one purpose?  So how much I do like the idea, I don't see the coin itself getting much higher price gains (in the end because good ideas & good ico's ALWAYS get you profit in the beginning  ) since it would harm the system/hold back its useability when a non-major currency is used.

So first of all if the non-crypto people want to buy WiC to use it, they won't hold it for a year. If they do they are not really buying for using it but to speculate. Also, the $value that they spend will remain the same. In your example, if someone buys 100 WiC for $100 and pays $5 for a WiFi network and suppose the price/WiC decreases after a year to 100 WiC = $50. Now he will still pay $5 for that network but with 10 WiC instead of 5 WiC he used a year earlier. So the payment is $ value will always remain the same.  We have future updates planned that will allow users to buy WiC with credit/debit cards. Another thing we plan to introduce is have WiC reloadable cards (something like gift cards) that will be available at local stores so that the non-crypto people can buy WiC with local currencies and use them in the app without knowing anything about crypto.  Also, I wouldn't call Bitcoin a non-fluctuating currency. Crypto is new and volatility is part of it and unfortunately no coin today is immune to it. Hopefully in the future when the market matures, we will have less volatility.  Thanks!",False

They are just super hyped! However, with WiC, I can see that this ICO already has a working product that can be used by many people as immediately as possible. They already have a working app. and a very profitable and valuable niche, Wi-Fi.  If I am going to invest on something, I'll look if it will still fill a gap in the market, in some future time or if it already has an immediate impact that people can be used right away after the launch. For me, I'll go for the latter. Look at the most successful launches in the recent times, Omisego and Civic for example. They already have working apps prior their ICO, they are not some speculative product that may or may not work, they are already working even just before their ICO!

So for example if you want to buy 5$ worth WiC with your debit card, we will accept that payment, buy BTC with it, convert it to WiC on exchanges and forward that WiC to the buyer. So in effect, the buyer has paid with his debit card and received WiC. This is just an overview of the service and might change when development is closer.  Also, the price of the token with be volatile but since it is divisible the $ value can be maintained. Meaning if you want to buy 1$ worth WiC and WiC is worth $0.50, you will buy 2 WiC. If the price goes to $1/WiC you will still be buying $1 worth but get 1 WiC now.",False

Hey, so as of now how the app is developed, it will make the payment as soon as you  connect for the first time. So if the WiFi owner changes the password while you are connected you will lose the connection and would have already paid. Although this will be a very rare scenario since the  uploader will need to continuously monitor if someone connected and then change the password when they do. Also, since it will be only a few dollars worth, there is no real incentive to do this. Also, the planned feature update of having the uploader specify a minimum and maximum time and data limit for the connection will solve this issue for good. As for the security part, we gave special attention to it while developing the app. If you see the demo video on our site, you will realize that the end user is not even shown the password of the WiFi and the app handles the connection directly. Also, this is all done in an encrypted an safe manner.  Thanks!",False

You share your 3g/4g via WiC. Your position is given via the map, you can't move while sharing, and it is precised it's a 3g/4g connection that is shared.  Maybe the system could work differently for this type of connexions, like the owner of the connection receive a notification like : Person A wants to use your connection for 10minutes, do you accept the transaction ? 50% Given at the beginning of the contract, 50% given at the end. Like this if the owner moves before the 10 minutes, Person A just paid 50% and can leave a bad rating, and if person A moves before the 10 minutes, the owner can leave a bad rating for the user, saying he moved before the end.

This is because we have already invested a lot of time and money into developing the app and it would not make any sense to abandon the project now. If we get low investments though, it will definitely hamper the speed at which we aim to grow.  As for the maximum, it will be low cap, much less than 5 million USD. Exact details will be announced soon but I can assure you the number will be low enough to get the investors best value and at the same time enough to get the project where it needs to be. Honestly, the other few Token Sales collecting like 50 million + USD are way overbought in my opinion. No startup requires that kind of funding.  Edit: Minimum contribution in the Presale will be low enough for most people to participate. Again exact details to be announced in a few days.

First of all, how do you want to handel Wifi abuse like for example if someone is hand in someone others wifi data and try to get paid for this? I got toled that open wifi spots are not useable, but how about not open wifi spots from for example cafés, restaurants or hotels, which are using the same passwort over a longer time but normaly just for their guests? Someone other than the owener can fill in these informations and get paid for it.

Could one of the developers list out some of the security precautions that are being implemented as part of this platform>? The passwords are described as encryteed.

So firstly, most of the cafes, restaurants etc. that have WiFI for their customers only keep the WiFi open and ask their customers to log in via a web portal and our app won't support this. But yes there will always be a few places which keep the same password over time and intend to make it available only to customers. For a second just forget about the app and think about it. Will you be able to take the password once and share it with all your friends and you all could use that WiFi forever (since the password is not being changed) even when you are no longer customers? So you see that can happen even without the app. But to be on the correct side, we will have a point in our app's terms and conditions that when you upload any password you confirm that you are the owner of that WiFi or have express permission from the owner to upload it.  As for the second question, the first thing to understand is that there is zero incentive for anyone to use our app for illegal stuff since it would create unnecessary issues for him. He will first have to download the app, buy WiC, navigate to the WiFi and then pay for it and do the illegal stuff. it would make much more sense for him to go to a Starbucks and use their WiFi. It is the same logic that prevents 51% attacks on the Bitcoin network, a person with enough resources could do it but it wouldn't be beneficial to him to do so. Anyways, assuming that someone still goes ahead and does it, it will be the same like that person going to starbucks and doing it. The way the owner of the WiFi (Starbucks) is not at fault, the same way the WiFi owner will not be at fault.  Hope that clarifies it. Thanks!",False

Secondly, the password is not revealed to the end user and the app handles the connection. Thirdly, we have an anti-bot mechanism which will detect and ban users trying to use bots to upload passwords. Next, we have also made it so mobile hotspots cannot be uploaded and only WiFi connections are accepted. We have also made the app in such a way that only correct and working WiFi networks get paid and can be connected to.  2) The website is listed in the OP - www.cryptowi.com and the whitepaper will be released along with the Token Sale details in a few days - https://www.cryptowi.com/whitepaper  3) The way the app is built, anybody who knows the password of a WiFi can upload it and earn WiC. However when someone does that he is in violation of the terms of the app, one of the points being that when you upload any password you confirm that you are the owner of that WiFi or have express permission from the owner to upload it.

We decided it would be best if we have something real when we announce this project and not just an idea on a paper. Hence, you will be happy to know that we have a fully developed and working app ready to be launched. You can view the app demo on our website: https://www.cryptowi.com  2) Where will the CryptoWi app be available and when can I download it? We will be launching the app worldwide shortly after the Token Sale is over.  3) Is the app secure enough? I am worried about my privacy! We developed the app giving special attention to the safety and privacy of users. Everything is encrypted and the end user is not even shown the password for the WiFi network he/she is connecting to. The app handles everything securely.  4) What will happen when someone buys a network which doesn't work? As seen in our demo video, when you try to enter a wrong password the app doesn't allow it. Only correct and working networks can be bought or sold! You can be sure that you will pay ONLY IF THE NETWORK WORKS!  5) What if someone uploads an open and already free WiFi network? This is not possible with our app since only networks with passwords can be uploaded. The app won't accept open networks.  6) Sounds like a good project with high potential, how can I invest? The Token Sale details have not been announced yet. Please subscribe to be the first to know when exact details are announced: https://www.cryptowi.com/token-sale  7) Will the Token Sale be escrowed? Yes, both the Presale and Token Sale will be fully escrowed by extremely reputed members of the community. Wait for further announcements.",False

We decided to get a demo ready so that people know what they are investing in and what they can expect. We realized it is not correct and ethical to have a fancy roadmap stretching years and nothing concrete to base it on.  As for your question, the team is actually bigger than what is posted and only the lead from each department is posted. We are getting legal advise and also hiring some legal experts because of the complex environment regarding Token Sales and will publish details once we get the go ahead from legal. You might know that making an app (that too this complex) is not a one man job and Deepak is just the development team lead. There are around a total of 12-15 members in the team including full time employees, independent contractors and interns. Also, since we have actually gone ahead, spent money and time and developed a real product rather than just showing you a 100 page document with complex terms, I would say it is not all that suspicious. The Token Sale will also be fully escrowed by highly reputed members of the community for your safety.  Thanks!",False

We have tough security measures in place and are pretty sure they will not be breakable but like anything in the world there is always a little chance that it can be hacked. Even government agencies, elections, government websites and everything else has been hacked at one point in history so we cannot say it is impossible but it is highly unlikely and unrewarding for anyone to waste resources to break into our app security and do something that he could have done by going to a Starbucks!  Also users don't need to worry about security concerns since if you have seen our app demo, you will realize that the end user does not have to do anything except click on a WiFi and buy it. The app does the rest and connects directly without exposing any details (including the password) to the end user. Also this is all encrypted and transmitted in a safe manner.  Users will be able to register via Facebook, Gmail or traditional email ids.  We have our Token Sale coming up soon, subscribe to stay updated: https://www.cryptowi.com/token-sale Thanks!",False

If WiC's app can be a guardian against all these, this would become a great project.",False

They don't need to worry about security concerns since if you have seen our app demo, you will realize that the end user does not have to do anything except click on a WiFi and buy it. The app does the rest and connects directly without exposing any details (including the password) to the end user. Also this is all encrypted and transmitted in a safe manner. Hence, users don't need to worry about anyone accessing their devices from the shared WiFi.  Also, there is no real incentive for anybody to use our app for wrong purposes as it would be better and easier for him to just use a free public WiFi rather than download our app, buy WiC, then find an available network, then hack our security and do something wrong.  Hope that clears any doubts. Thanks!",False

Another thing we intend to do is have WiC reloadable cards available at gas stations and retail convenience stores, so that people even without the know how of crypto currencies will be able to use our app without issues. Mass adoption is the main goal of the project.  Also, WiC is the only accepted currency in our app and hence anyone wanting to use it will have to buy WiC first, naturally increasing its value.

Suppose you set it at 50 WiC, now if someone wants to connect to that network he/she has to first pay you 50 WiC and then the app connects him/her to the network securely.

The demo is a major selling point here.  Having a working product, especially in our current environment, shows you have put in an investment up front and explains clearly the goal of the project.  A couple questions/concerns for you - forgive me if I missed the answers:  1. Do you have LinkedIn profiles for your founders? Particularly interested in your marketing and sales team since coordination of agreements with gas stations, travel agencies, etc. is a large scale sales project.  2. I have seen you mentioned WiFi sharing as a large industry already, but this is an area that many users will be nervous about.  Connecting to unknown networks or offering up your own network without having an understanding of how to properly set up security is putting not only the computers on the network at risk but also opening up your connection to potentially illegal activity.  Why would a 'regular user' want to take that risk?  When a regular person connects to public WiFi at a Starbucks (for example) they have a feeling of security due to the way those networks are configured.   Overall, the concept is nice and you have a demo which is a huge plus, but looking to understand how you are going to overcome security concerns to gain traction with a less technical userbase.",False

Yes, we decided to get a demo ready so that people know what they are investing in and what they can expect. We realized it is not correct and ethical to have a fancy roadmap stretching years and nothing concrete to base it on.  As for your questions, the team is actually bigger than what is posted and only the lead from each department is posted. We are getting legal advise and also hiring some legal experts because of the complex environment regarding Token Sales and will publish details once we get the go ahead from legal. You might know that making an app (that too this complex) is not a one man job and Deepak is just the development team lead. There are around a total of 12-15 members in the team including full time employees, independent contractors and interns. Also, you are right that partnering with gas stations and retail outlets will be a challenge and that is one of the reasons we are looking to raise money in the upcoming Token Sale.  WiFi sharing is in fact a huge industry with a user base of more than 50 million already. As far as issues regarding illegal activity are concerned, there is no real incentive to use our app for illegal purposes since it would create unnecessary issues for that person. He could easily go to a Starbucks or McDonalds and use their WiFi; no reason to download this app, then buy WiC and then pay for it. Also, since our main aim is mass adoption, we have made it extremely easy and secure for the users. They don't need to worry about security concerns since if you have see our app demo, you will realize that the end user does not have to do anything except click on a WiFi and buy it. The app does the rest and connects directly without exposing any details to the end user. Also this is all encrypted.  If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to post here or PM me.

And you are correct when you think that the reason for this Token Sale is to get capital to fund this project. The reason why there is no minimum requirement is:  1) We have already invested our own money and developed a working product that is ready for launch. 2) The app itself can be monetized and can provide a regular source of income. 3) Why, the Token Sale then? Because we need the capital to expedite marketing and further development of the project. If less amount is raised the project will be less marketed and slow to say. If we sell out on the other hand, we will speed up everything and will not need to wait for the app to generate revenue required in order for us to grow. 4) Also, the max cap will be well under 5 million dollars because we do not need it for R&D related costs but for improving a developed product and marketing it on a global scale. The Token Sale amount will also be used to secure strategic partnerships with travel agencies and convenience store and gas station chains in order to promote CryptoWi.

It will require approval of the world's governments and huge investments which makes it uncertain to say the least.

Now since our app aims to monetize WiFi sharing, the main aim is to market it aggressively to tourists and travelers. Tourists will not know where free WiFi is in the city they are visiting and hence the CryptoWi app will come in handy. Also, there are still a huge number of cities worldwide including in developed countries where free WiFi is not very easily available. Only selected big cities really have enough free WiFi networks.  Also, most of these cafes, hotels and cinemas have free WiFi ""ONLY FOR CUSTOMERS"" which really does not mean free.  Hope I answered your question, please feel free to ask me any more question.

We have worked very hard to get you something complete and real and hence the chances of success increase manifold.  2) We are not asking for thousands of BTCs for our project and that reduces the total initial market cap of the coin. At the ICO price, the market cap of WiC will be well under 5 million dollars (exact price will be out soon) which is around the 200+ mark on coinmarketcap.com. Evidently, our project is better and worth more than most of the coins with a higher market cap than that and hence there is a very good chance that your investment will give you a huge ROI on launch.  3) There is no crypto currency today that has anything even similar to what we are offering with WiC and CryptoWi and hence WiC will be the first and only player in this untapped market. As a result, the potential and room for growth is tremendous.  4) With a potential ready user base of more than 50 million, WiC is very likely to succeed and revolutionize the WiFi sharing industry. As more people start to buy WiC to use it in the CryptoWi app, the early investors are expected to receive the best returns.  5) Since Wi Coins (WiC) is the ONLY accepted method of payment in the app, anybody wanting to use it will have to buy WiC first, naturally increasing its value.  6) WiC is one of the very few crypto currencies today with a real world use case which gives it real value. In the long run, only such currencies are likely to succeed.  Hope that gives you confidence that Token Sale investors have a very very good chance of getting huge ROI with WiC.",False

You mean offline transactions right? Yes that should be available.  - How will you facilitate adoption on the buy side ? In my view, the app should allow the user to buy Wic against USD. To facilitate adoption we have the 100 WiC per correct password initiative for the first 50,000 passwords. We plan to have WiC reloadable cards available for purchase at convenience stores and gas stations later. We also intend to partner with travel agencies around the world who would promote our project to their clients increasing its value. Also, WiC is the only accepted currency in our app and hence anyone wanting to use it will have to buy WiC first, naturally increasing its value. As for trading against USD, that will be possible on launch with one of our partner's services at CryptoDao.  - can't you release the App on the appstore prior to the ICO so that users can test it ? Sorry, but the app will be released after the Token Sale. We have the demo available which is much more than most of the other projects who just have a fancy Whitepaper and nothing real.",False

Today, 99% of the people involved in crypto currencies use it either as a speculative asset or hoard it with a dream of becoming a millionaire overnight. This is the primary reason for the lack of adoption and WiC is a coin that will solve this issue. WiC will give the average person a reason to buy and use crypto in his everyday life. Introducing the killer app of the crypto world, “CryptoWi”, an app which rewards its users in Wi Coins (WiC) for doing what they do every day, use their Wi-Fi! This is how it works:   First, you will need to create an account to use the app and earn and store your WiCs.   Second, the user can upload passwords of the Wi-Fi connections from the ""WiFi"" tab as shown above. The user is awarded 100 WiC per correct password uploaded in order to grow the network initially. The user will also be able to set a custom price in WiC for each of these networks. Anybody who wants to connect to these networks will have to pay this amount and it will be credited to the original password uploader. This gives an added incentive to people for not changing the password and helps the community grow larger. 5,000,000 WiC have been reserved for distribution to the users in the early stages of the app to grow the user base. At 100 coins per password, this will be 50,000 passwords.   The “Map” tab shows the number of available WiFi passwords at any location in the world and can be searched for by the user. The user will also be able to navigate to these wifi spots in offline mode in the future.      We are launching WiC as an Ethereum ERC20 token.  Token Name: Wi Coin Ticker: WiC Total Supply: 100,000,000 coins  The coins will be allocated as below:  Token Sale: 90% or 90,000,000 coins In App Distribution: 5% or 5,000,000 coins Team: 3% or 3,000,000 coins Bounties: 2% or 2,000,000 coins              The Crypto App that will Change Everything  Monetizing WiFi Sharing  Wi Coin - The killer app is ready to take on the world   https://medium.com/@kluce305/monetizing-wifi-sharing-691f79f4d689 https://steemit.com/app/@btcupload/the-crypto-app-that-will-change-everything http://blockchainmag.fr/dapp-gagner-de-largent-en-partageant-votre-wifi-cest-possible/ (French) https://info-modalgratis.blogspot.in/2017/07/wi-coin-monetizing-wifi-sharing.html (Indonesian) https://kokovalko.blogspot.in/2017/07/wi-coin-wic-cryptocurrency-era-baru.html (Indonesian) https://trader-bitcoin.blogspot.co.id/2017/07/memperkenalkan-ico-wi-coin-wic.html (Malay) http://icoaltcoinnews.blogspot.co.id/2017/04/wic-wi-coin-killer-app-ico-karunia.html (Indonesian) http://bitbillions.net/2017/04/16/altcoin-review-wi-coin-for-the-masses/ http://www.news-crypto.com/2017/04/wi-koin-aplikasi-pengembangan-krypto.html http://typebie.com/kenapa-harus-berinvestasi-di-cryptowi-wic/ (Indonesian) https://goanadupabitcoin.ro/stiri-bitcoin/wicoin-wic-ico.html http://cashvit.blogspot.in/2017/07/hai-sobat-semua.html (Indonesian) https://www.minds.com/blog/view/738447689384992768 (Indonesian) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XbzASQXZSI&feature=youtu.be http://freecoin.website/2017/04/21/wic-rent-your-wifi-bounties-2-exchanges-ico-in-2-days-lucky-draw/ http://btcupload.com/bitcoin-news-blog/wi-coin-wic-investing-in-wi-fi-with-cryptocurrency                                                                   (Indonesian)                                                                                   (Russian)             Portuguese: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2045067.0 Russian: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2045418 French: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2057365.0 Chinese: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2051260 Turkish: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2053784 German: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2058593 Polish: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2056409 Romanian: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2047586 Italian: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2047892.0 Spanish: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2045616 Indonesian: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2048728",False

We decided it would be best if we have something real when we announce this project and not just an idea on a paper. Hence, you will be happy to know that we have a fully developed and working app ready to be launched. You can view the app demo on our website: https://www.cryptowi.com  2) Where will the CryptoWi app be available and when can I download it? We will be launching the app worldwide shortly after the Token Sale is over.  3) Is the app secure enough? I am worried about my privacy! We developed the app giving special attention to the safety and privacy of users. Everything is encrypted and the end user is not even shown the password for the WiFi network he/she is connecting to. The app handles everything securely.  4) What will happen when someone buys a network which doesn't work? As seen in our demo video, when you try to enter a wrong password the app doesn't allow it. Only correct and working networks can be bought or sold! You can be sure that you will pay ONLY IF THE NETWORK WORKS!  5) What if someone uploads an open and already free WiFi network? This is not possible with our app since only networks with passwords can be uploaded. The app won't accept open networks.  6) Sounds like a good project with high potential, how can I invest? The Presale begins on August 15 at 4PM EST. Details are available at: https://www.cryptowi.com/token-sale  7) Will the Token Sale be escrowed? Yes, both the Presale and Token Sale will be fully escrowed by extremely reputed members of the community, minerjones, Blazed and the cryptocurrency exchange Livecoin.net.

He could easily go to a Starbucks or McDonalds and use their WiFi; no reason to download this app, then buy WiC and then pay for it. Also, WiFi sharing is already a HUGE industry with millions of users worldwide, we are monetizing it and tapping this huge market.  As far as identifying targets, it is not necessary at all that the app user has loads of crypto with him/her. This app could be the only crypto related thing in his world. Also, its no different than having cash in your pocket. If someone is going to mug you, it is more probable that your phone and cash are more valuable than the WiC inside the app.",False
