People should be careful before investing and seek financial advise from professionals prior.  In order to avoid spending you time in accusing and chasing others for scams and so on , just try to put little small amount of money in each project you believe it. Don't be greedy and dreamer . You need to know that every project involve some risks . It may be scam or just a bad business idea. It may get destroyed by a competitor or just be managed badly .  Scam or not , most of the start-up companies (circa 80%-90% cease activity after 24 months ) Those that stay in the market stay for longer but only a small percentage will reach the success they hope to reach , probably like 2-3% of all the projects here.

Our guess is that you were easily misled by the scam-clone support or smth. Moreover, you just don't know how the project token bank is working. It's completely separated from the personal token bids. Yes, some of our team members are buying and hodling the token, and it's up to them to sell it or buy more. You can't judge a project by that fact, that's completely pointless.   Also a proof that Storiqa manipulated the price In the ico phase, STQ has given no information about how many tokens there will be. Only the information between 7 - 11 billions Finally, Storiqa just took 11 billions to enrich themselves  We have stated the maximum supply from the very start. We suggest that your unawareness is connected to the point that you are trying to make as much FUD as possible after you have been banned for violating the community rules. Community members asked us to block you a long time ago, by the way. Guess we should do that in the first place.    The STQ price has always remained the same for 12 months except for the self-organized pump  That's called stability when there is no product, mr. Beyer. You should learn how the crypto is working before even making a single judging post here.   Also, the promise in the ico phase buy for little and sell for 0.03 That does not count anymore  Of course, this does not count, because this statement has never existed. 0.03 is an internal exchange price, for which you can only buy the token for use it on the platform. Everyone who was staying with us 'from the start' know that simple fact. But not you. Which is speaking for itself as well. --  Dear community members, it's up to you to judge us or not, but clearly mr. Beyer has no clue about the team workflow, our main documents, and milestones. He ignores our posts, statements and newsfeed after he 'lost' his money and now he tries to compensate that fact with the FUDstorm which is posted across the pages.  His attitude and speech are unacceptable in the community and we suggest you ignore him and make your own investigation in case you have any doubts. As always you can join our TG community and ask any questions you need to know. We are ready to cover them and answer you in details about every case mr. Beyer was trying to push.  Thank you.",False

Storiqa aims to create a quick-to-setup marketplace for SMEs with minimal financial borders and global transactional fees. Multicurrency payment solution helps to facilitate the last option. Storiqa Wallet is a mobile application through which clients can make payment both in cryptos (e.g. BTC, ETH, LTC) and fiat (e.g. USA dollar, euro).  Storiqa Wallet is:   Allocating budget among a few currencies simultaneously for sellers: convert crypto to fiat and vice versa.   Cross-border payments for shoppers: purchase a product from any country without thinking of crypto and fiat currencies converting.  All these multicurrency transactions are conducted smoothly and orderly in the application due to lean business processes between banks and crypto exchanges behind.  What’s next?   At a later stage, Storiqa Wallet will be used outside the marketplace ecosystem. It means that paying for coffee with crypto is not a vague idea. Apple has already successfully applied NFC technology for ApplePay. Implementing NFC in Storiqa wallet allows using this multicurrency solution for any payment.  Legal part  EMI (Electronic Money Institution) license assures secure and legal business processes. AML (Anti-Money Laundering) document is an inevitable step before getting the license.

Many people are going to make off like bandits here.   I'm hearing a $0.10 coin list price and if so, you have $1.5B in valuation right there. It doubling or even 10x is not out of the ordinary...

To be more precise, the first step is CIP (Customer Identification Program). We will ask users to provide their identity documents and contact details.  Given to the fact that our company is surrounded by many organizations which we communicate with on different business issues, legal framework requires us to follow industry trends.  It is argued that bounty participants do not have to provide personal data because they are not investors. Yet, the process of token distribution is absolutely the same for everyone. It means that all our tokenholders will have completely equal identification process.  Here you will find the detailed guide for the KYC procedure.

Regarding KYC you can find an information here.     Although the phrase “know your customer” may seem insignificant to a lot of people, it has a very important meaning in the business world. If we want to interact with other partners in the industry, however, we really have no choice. KYC allows companies to protect themselves by ensuring that they are doing business legally and with legitimate entities, and it also protects the individuals who might otherwise be harmed by financial crime.

Your telegram is plastered with deposit issues and everyone is being told that their deposits will take up to 24 hours to show up when your site clearly states after 6 confirmations deposits will show up. In addition these supporters are also being told that they will have to pay a higher price for tokens because they weren't able to buy at the lower price due to your site's inability to handle deposits properly?!?! A live and working sales market would be 100 times more traffic and hectic so if you guys can't even handle a token sale properly and there are tons of delays how in the world will you be able to handle a real world market traffic?

Their site promises a lot and this is the last thing I am looking for, all I need is facts/accomplishments/real partners and so on. So I decided to do so research and I came across this analysis, which is A MUST READ if you thing about investing in Storiqa. It definitely helped me to make my decision. Here are key points: Negatives: • Involving Crypto currencies as a payment mode may not be lucrative if the currency is highly volatile, not sure how the company will figure out the rate at which a product will be charged unless its based in Fiat currency and accordingly converted. • The company would also need a Trust or Bank which is ready to open an account with them for the conversion of Fiat to cryto and vice versa • As opening an online store can be very easy, how would the company verify the authenticity of the seller as there could be possibilities of scam • If a new start up can think of an ides like this, giants like Amazon, IBM are already working on their own crypto currencies and blockchain which will be a threat once they in the field. • They claim to supply all services necessary for expansion including sales, marketing, communication like 24/7 support, IT support for just 18,000 STQ per year. Its hard to believe how the cost is going to be beared by the company • Upon receiving the order the seller supplies the item in question to the special Storiqa warehouse, the Quality Assurance Department, where the item is checked for apparent defects, gets repacked and/or branded if necessary; there we also take pictures of the item. If the item does not possess the stated features or does not meet the quality requirements, it is returned to the seller. In the above case the cost of transportation, warehousing, transportation damage coverage is going to be enormous, not sure how that will be covered The last key is a good research done by the author of this analysis, as it shows to me that is not real life scenario especially when we are talking worldwide. If this would be only in one small country, then opening one small warehouse and running this sort of operation is possible, but worldwide this would be even hard and too expensive for giant like ebay, if they would decide to open warehouses worldwide.  Full analysis can be found here: https://steemit.com/storiqa/@investbuddy/storiqa-ico-analysis  This post is not for current investors/coins holders/bounty participats and anyone who is somehow related and or invested in Storiqa as you have clearly made your mind.

A day ago we received a statement from Bradley Strock that stated that he was not associated with our product. This came as a surprise as University Capital Group LLC was hired to assist with the collaboration and partnership with key advisors to our industry. The company has assured us that Bradley Strock would represent Storiqa and our interests. We are awaiting their urgent response to this matter from UCG.  Also as soon as we became aware of that statement, we contacted Bradley directly. We are currently in direct communication with Bradley and we immediately followed through with his request to take down his profile from our advisor section. Also to not cause any more confusion and to be safe, we temporarily removed Maynard Webb profile as well until full clarification is established from the UCG, we want to be extremely safe on our end regarding this.  From that moment we are also gathering official statements from all our other advisors and will release them as they come in, it may be delayed during this holiday season, we understand you want all info immediately and rightly so, you believe us and want full transparency, and we are working to provide that as soon as possible with the information coming in.  We had a US road show and an Asia Market road show where we personally met and came into agreements with our other investors, for proof of those road shows you can follow our Instagram, Twitter, and other social accounts. Due to the limited time nature of crowd funding we had to diversify our strategy of in person meetings, with funds and already established networks that could get us in contact with key advisors that were out of our reach on road shows. This decision has clearly lead to this miscommunication and in turn false information for you, as our supporters, and we are ceasing this strategy and from this moment will only rely on our direct communication with all of our advisors and team members going forward.  Also to bring immediate and timely proof to the Telegram community you may have noticed advisors such as Paddy Tan, jumping in to confirm their identity and involvement in our Storiqa project. We will follow through with all our advisors as they come online and we confirm their support and identify.  Again, we are investigating the situation at the moment so we'll keep you updated once we have all the information from all the involved parties as the information comes in.  Finally, lets not forget the largest and biggest part of our team, you as our supporters, buyers, sellers, and visionaries that believe in a better platform of global eCommerce and product exchange.",False

Quote from: sinfazat22ron on December 19, 2017, 09:42:25 AM Can you tell me how you plan to secure the transparency of the reviewing system? If you manage cleat the platform of ""purchased"" reviews, it will be very cool. With Storiqa, the option to leave customer feedback will be open only for the actual buyers — as confirmed by the blockchain record of their order. The transactions are public and cannot be falsified — therefore, you need to actually purchase the item to be able to review it. All reviews will be displayed in the store’s profile and affect its standing in the platform-wide catalog. Moreover, posting reviews is beneficial for the customers themselves — they will gain bonus STQ tokens for each review. The article about it is in our Medium: https://medium.com/@storiqa/honest-reviews-thanks-to-blockchain-d7c17ef11ce6  Quote So, that means, that the settlements in the CPA networks will also be made with cryptocurrency. Fiat money there is not provided? CPA networks be made only with STQ   Quote I read that the platform’s services can be paid with tokens. And will there be any other payment options or not?  Platform's services can be paid only with STQ, but sellers and buyers can have a deal with other cryptocurrencies and even fiat money.   Quote How much will cost a single token during the sale?  the Token price is changing during Token Sale according the Token Sale stages. Now it's 0.0048$",False

Crowdsourcing is the foundation of the Storiqa community – our flexible system will let sellers choose the exact combination of community services or a full community package for their store. In addition, requesting presentation content for your items will mark them as verified, showing your customers that everything you sell was tested and approved by the likes of them.  In addition, we also add an option to earn rewards through spotlighting an item: bloggers, reviewers and other people with an audience can review goods sold through Storiqa and earn tokens through referral links for each item bought.

First of all, Storiqa gives an opportunity for small-scale producers to penetrate into international markets passing high barriers.  Combining all the benefits of marketplaces at one platform creates a comparative advantage over other market offers both for customers and sellers. Decentralization and the opportunities presented by the use of cryptocurrency in the project can cover the needs in speed, global market access, and transaction security.  Quote from: seriosman on November 29, 2017, 04:04:04 PM Why should I invest in your token? Is there a benefit to its use apart from exchanges?  After the Token sale, the STQ tokens will be available on the cryptocurrency exchanges. In addition, STQ tokens will be accepted as payment for Storiqa services for sellers (monthly fee and item slot unlocks) and can be used to purchase items from Storiqa-based stores.  1. STQ tokens are the only payment instrument when you need to pay fees or pay for marketplace services. The absolute purchase of STQ tokens every time a customer uses the platform is extremely important, because it ensures quotes liquidity for Token sale investors and permanent demand for tokens on the part of stores, which is the basic principle of the Storiqa system. 2. Purchase goods with STQ. There will also be demand on the part of buyers as numerous stores will offer a bigger cash back and special prices to their clients that pay for goods with STQ tokens. 3. Partner projects will be able to pay with STQ tokens, making their transactions faster and more transparent and also succeeding in marketing and promotion because the system is popular and trendy.

The unique goods from all over the world on Storiqa for cryptocurrencies and STQ tokens  Buy millions of real goods for cryptocurrencies and STQ tokens getting the best exchange rate and maintaining operations with fiat money.  2.    Placing the goods on the platform and paying for all the services of  Storiqa in STQ tokens  Pay in STQ tokens for including goods into a catalog and using professional marketing tools. Pay with the tokens for localization, descriptions and photos of goods which are to be made by participants of a community.  3.    8+ ready for use effective tools for successful sales, business analytics and work with customers at an international level  4.    Honest responses  Smart contract seals the interaction between the buyer and the seller, so this is the reason why only a person who made a purchase can leave a comment about the product.  5. A safe bargain through smart contract  While transferring money the buyer can be sure that the sum will be received on the seller’s account only if the shipment reached its intended destination.  6. Guaranteed quality  We take responsibility for quality management and guarantee that the seller makes a shipment according to a product card and a given description to the buyer.  7. Protecting the buyer’s interests and arbitrating by Storiqa  In case the product was damaged by carrier in the process of transportation the buyer can apply for arbitration to Storiqa, and after consideration of the application we will give a full or partial refund of the product cost.   Why STQ token will be demanded?  •    For STQ the seller can get everything necessary for running a private store: place the goods on the platform and pay for the services of  Storiqa. •    The buyer, in turn, can purchase any preferable products for tokens. At the same time purchasing for STQ tokens will be more beneficial because of the low commission. •    Also STQ tokens will become an instrument of paying referral fees and rewarding for offers in internal CPA network.  Consequently, the token is maximally integrated into the activities of the marketplace having an influence on its cost: as the project grows and the new functions are developed the token cost will be constantly increasing.
