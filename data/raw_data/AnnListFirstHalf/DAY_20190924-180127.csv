First of all, DAY tokens has been in the market for 4 to 5 months now. They are tradable now  to the public that is why the value is low right now because its publicly driven. I have no idea about other competitors that is at the same concept with chronologic.  But DAY tokens offer procedure that schedules transaction in the future . To compensate that ETH will be rewarded. As timeMints halve every 88 days, the production of DAY tokens collectively decreases. As time goes by lesser would be available to the public as DAY holders are using the tokens to earn ETH via EAC. Demand for DAY token will increase as a result of timenodes but the supply slowly decreases making it higher scarcity does putting the price up. Chronologic indeed makes a lot of sense using time-based products and services.",False

There are no ""experts"", speculation about price in dollars in x months from now is more depending on bitcoin than anything else almost. I can give you my take though:  At the end of next month or early july (IF the security audit is done and green light is given) the Ethereum Alarm Clock (EAC) will be on the ethereum mainnet, that's an important starting point by which we will see if the DAY token can shape its own price trajectory or not. Since it's needed as a stake for running timenodes, we will probably see some action i think, probably not with very high volumes though.  The ico price for the DAY token, assuming you were one of the 3333 ico participants, was around $12.5 by the way (when ether was 300$), but keep in mind that for the ico participants DAY is a self minting token that has grown 280% so far with a declining growth rate. To give you an example: if you bought 24 DAY (for 1 ETH) during ICO, you now have 91 DAY, assuming you didn't move them at any time from your original ethereum address.  The people that own DAY since day 1 will most likely wait patiently another few weeks, or in a worst case scenario months even, because finally a use case / utility is coming. That does not necessarily automatically mean price goes up, because the free floating DAY on exchanges (the part that is not locked in timemints (the original ico eth addresses) sets the price, always remember that. When timenodes prove to be economically profitable, demand for DAY will rise.",False

I just read this entire thread in one sitting to get a sense of the project's history. This is the first thread I've read on this forum, and if I knew how to ""merit"" your posts then I would.  I'm really hoping to chat with anyone via DM or private message here, on telegram, or on discord, who has been a Chronologic investor since 2017. I'd love to talk to someone who is closer to the history (if you were in the old slack channel, please let me know, I would love to talk to you!) or anyone who has a very good sense of how this project has evolved. Feel free to send me a direct message.  It's very clear that the team had some issues at the start given the Yesterday tokens and the lack of transparency around the project for some time. I would really love to talk with someone that experienced frustration during those periods of time.  As a new person, I think this is a very interesting project to monitor.  One question about something you said, Obi: Quote At the end of next month or early july (IF the security audit is done and green light is given) the Ethereum Alarm Clock (EAC) will be on the ethereum mainnet,  In an April blog post, the ChronoLogic team seemed to indicate that the security audit is related to ERC20 scheduling but not ETH scheduling. Am I interpreting their post wrong? If I'm correct it would imply they're already greenlit for ETH scheduling but not for ERC20's yet, and the audit is focused on the ERC20 functionality?  Quote in particular:  Quote ChronoLogic partnered with Merriam to continue the development of the Ethereum Alarm Clock and now it has reached a major milestone. One can now schedule ERC20 token transfers on the Kovan Test Network. Pending a security audit, this functionality will soon be available on the main net.",False

A: Unfortunately no.  [edit: below 6 questions are about the conditional scheduling feature as being presented in the first part of the webinar] :  Q: Conditional scheduling can potentially be used for all decentralized exchanges A: Precisely  Q: Nice. Market it as IFTTT (if-this-then-that) for crypto A: That is a valid suggestion  Q: No priorities for timemint holders? A: Claiming Mechaninsm, does that  Q: So will Time Mint holders have an advantage? A: Yes, they will  Q: Also timemint? A: Including TimeMint  Q: or just day amount? A: both factors are put into consideration  [edit: below questions are about timenodes and the EAC in general and the ether/erc20 token scheduling feature as being presented in the rest of the webinar] :  Q: Do I have to use metamask when proving day token ownership to set up a timenode. Can I prove direct from a hardware wallet? A: You should be able to prove using your hardware wallet, from mycrypto. The process uses a signed message from the address holding DAY. So you might be able to do so either way.  Q: Process did not work when signing direct from trezor A: Kindly create an Issue on github, describing your experience, and we would get on it  Q: Can an existing Trezor account set up with MyEtherWallet.com access MyCrypto? My Timemint is tied to a Trezor / MEW address A: Yes, you only need to sign a proof for your MEW address, from your Trezor  Q: When mainnet? A: We are still waiting on the security audit, it might take up to 10 weeks  Q: Often ICOs require to whitelist an ETH address for participation to get the ERC20 token. This problem is unsolvable to EAC, isn't it? A: The process would be to whitelist the generated schedule contract  Q: Is there any EAC V2 timenode version we can test? Especially CLI version... eac-js.cli on github seems to be outdated A: Answered Live !!!  Q: How safe is EAC atm? A bullet-proof security audit would be essential before release EAC to the main net. And even then, declared clearly as BETA with use by own risk. One big issue on main net could kill the whole project. A: We have begun an extensive security audit.  Q: Is there a plan to go out from Ethereum space with chronologic? I mean bring it into a cross chain environment? A: Actually we are discussing this internally  Q: What is the advantage of having a time mint over just holding just 333Day. A: You get priority claiming as a timenode [edit: i think he meant ""as a timemint""]  Q: Looking further ahead - i presume companies could use the eth alarm clock for payment of stock dividends? Would this have to be paid in ETH? or could it be set for any fiat currency? A: Only in ERC20 or ETH at the moment.  Q: Cool! Excited to hear about upcoming partnerships and who is catching on to the value here A: We would update as we have confirmed partnerships  Q: keeping a trezor connected as a time node defeats the point of having a hard wallet A: That is not a planned implementation, presently  Q: Will it be possible to link more than 1 timemint to a timenode? (in order to create a sort of timenode pool?) A: we are looking at ways to implement that   If you've found this useful, merit me please thanks.",False

This timemint has unique chrono power that generates DAY token everyday depending on your chrono power  and your current number of DAY tokens . After 88 days the chrono power halve itself so for example your previous minting power is 0.75% it will be just 0.375% for the next 88 days and so on . Giving lesser power of minting in the long run.  Yesterday tokens were accidentally created from the old smart contract because its minting power are 1 decimal place less than it would intend to mint.

You need Kovan test DAY tokens because the chronologic dapp is still in the testing phase on the Kovan test net, and you can receive them by requesting from the faucet at https://app.chronologic.network/faucet . Once the dapp goes into actual 'production phase', you will need to prove ownership of the ethereum address where you keep your real DAY tokens, but not for now! you want to first get accustomed to the dapp, how it functions, experience being a timenode and perhaps schedule some transactions yourself.  Metamask is a browser extension with which you can access existing ethereum wallets/accounts without the need to expose your private key to dapps/exchanges/websites. The accounts you already own and set up once through MEW or mycrypto you can easily import in MetaMask. Do keep the MetaMask password and seed phrase private and in a safe place of course. While being connected to the Kovan test network you can sign a message with the help of MEW ( https://www.myetherwallet.com/signmsg.html ) or mycrypto ( https://www.mycrypto.com/signmsg.html ) , that shouldn't matter, but the preferred way of doing this is by accessing the wallet (where your Kovan test DAY resides that you requested from the faucet!) through MetaMask. You will get a MetaMask popup to sign the message, the signature you then submit in the chronologic dapp.  If you still have trouble, join the unofficial discord channel and ask for help at https://discord.gg/2tStfUP  or the official telegram channel at https://t.me/chronologicnetwork .",False

They have quickly integrated Shapeshift and have are now partnering with ChronoLogic to implement a scheduled transactions function utilizing the Ethereum Alarm Clock.  The Ethereum Alarm Clock is a partnership project with Piper Merriam of the Ethereum Foundation. The protocol is currently deployed and functional on the Kovan network, the companion DApp can be found at https://app.chronologic.network. Over the coming weeks, the two teams will be working side by side to implement integration and ensure security.  When asked about the partnership, ChronoLogic lead developer Piotr Kosiński stated:   “We’re super excited to partner with Taylor Monahan and her team. They have an excellent vision for MyCrypto’s future and the Ethereum Alarm Clock fits perfectly in it.”   This partnership will allow the mass adoption of scheduling future cryptocurrency payments. Many people will learn about the Ethereum Alarm Clock technology that otherwise might not get exposed to it.  When asked about the Ethereum Alarm Clock, Taylor Monahan of MyCrypto stated:   “I think it just opens a possibilities for a lot of things, one of them is multistep transactions, so when you complete a step and need to wait for something to happen…like ENS for example.”   Below is a video of Taylor Monahan being interviewed about MyCrypto and ChronoLogic at the Ethereum Community Conference in March of 2018.    https://youtu.be/WhLmm5ZmKX8     MyCrypto is one of the most loved wallets in the Ethereum community, we are very excited to have a native integration of the Ethereum Alarm Clock in the works with them. In the coming weeks, we can expect to see much more interest build around the Ethereum Alarm Clock… as scheduling transactions will become even more streamlined for users of MyCrypto.

ChronoLogic is offering an entirely new approach to assigning value to a crypto asset. It is an Ethereum based project which aims to solve time-based problems on the blockchain. Through ChronoLogic’s three core products, the Ethereum Alarm Clock, Debt Smart Contracts, and the DAY token minting mechanism, they aim to solve the problems of payment scheduling, crypto-loan time constraints, and unstable token launches.   The Ethereum Alarm Clock offers a decentralized way of scheduling payments and smart contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain and is currently integrating with MyCrypto. Now a whole variety of use-cases are possible such as recurring subscriptions, scheduled HR payments, and scheduling for traders and exchanges.  ChronoLogic’s debt smart contract platform is currently under development and is planned to become a decentralized, Peer-to-Peer platform that can allow anyone to be a lender or borrower of a crypto loan.  ChronoLogic’s temporal innovations blend into the loan platform to deal with the complexity of loan time constraints.    About the token  ChronoLogic has created a utility token called DAY, DAY has several functions. First of all, the DAY token was designed to reward long-term holders of tokens using a proprietary “Token-Minting” process.  Furthermore, one must own a stake of DAY in order to be a “Time Node” to execute scheduled transactions using the Ethereum Alarm Clock.  As ChronoLogic continues to implement time-based dAPPs, the DAY token will continue to gather utility. You can learn more by reading the ChronoLogic white paper at ChronoLogic.Network",False

Everyone at the conference had input and feedback to give us on the Ethereum Alarm Clock, and we were inspired by the 100+ talks given by the power players in the Ethereum space. We noticed novel use cases, thought of ways to optimize the EAC protocol and blazed forward with many new integration opportunities. Undoubtedly, the team’s first priority is the important MyCrypto integration. However, we have a lot more to share…   MyCrypto Integration  We’ve made a lot of progress, but we are not yet ready to publish our progress into the upstream MyCrypto beta release. We’re really hard at work to finish the code and make this integration a reality, both teams are extremely motivated to bring Ethereum scheduling functionality to the end user. First we aim to enable it for the Kovan testnet and after the testing phase and security audit, we can enable Ethereum mainnet transactions scheduling directly in MyCrypto. We really hope you’re as excited as we are, because this is going to be a huge integration. Take a look at the 28 (and growing) commits in the pull request.     EAC v2 — Solidity + IPFS Research and Development  While pushing integrations and our DApp development we are still researching opportunities to make Ethereum Alarm Clock more scalable. The work done by Logan Saether in Sprint 5 is the result of the two-day brainstorming session he had with lead developer Piotr while in Gdansk.  Currently we’re pushing towards moving storage to IPFS and verifying data integrity on-chain by using cryptographic libraries. This can vastly reduce the amount of gas needed to deploy scheduling smart contracts. But this is only one branch of our research. We’re also investigating State Channels usage in Ethereum Alarm Clock.  We’re having internal discussions on this topic and conducting research, including reaching out to experienced State Channels developers. All of the discussion and research has become tangible. Logan Saether already started to work on GitHub. Below you can see a basic diagram which can help you wrap your head around the concept.    It’s been a busy and rewarding sprint. Also during this time period, developer Logan Saether presented an in-depth demo of the Ethereum Alarm Clock at the TriCity Blockchain Meeting in Gdansk, Poland.

The presentation was well reviewed by the community and the live video coverage is available to be viewed here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScKaYbz0dCk    A big partnership with MyCrypto.com was unveiled during the talk. Users of this open sourced Ethereum wallet will now be able to schedule future transactions directly from a MyCrypto tab.  Insiders of the Ethereum community fielded technical questions about the Ethereum Alarm Clock to Logan after the talk. One community member asked if it would be possible to set up an auto transfer of funds from a wallet in the case that the owner lost the private keys. Logan was happy to answer “Yes!” and discussed this use case, one of many, for the Ethereum Alarm Clock that we jokingly call “Whale Insurance”.    Team members were able to discuss the future of the Ethereum Alarm Clock with Vitalik Buterin, Fabian Vogelsteller, and Stephan Tual at the conference. All of the feedback we received was extremely helpful and positive.  ChronoLogic was one of the biggest and most active teams at the conference and made a big impression by documenting the event through personal video interviews. Those interviews will be released over the coming weeks on our youtube channel. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTAH_8hSgbzd8Mq84zMsZJQ    By interviewing some of the brightest minds in the Ethereum space, we learned some great ideas about how the Ethereum Alarm Clock could be used.  Some of those ideas included backend and frontend trading on exchanges, guaranteed inheritance execution, and much more.  We will be releasing our interviews with Ethereum leaders in the near future. Now we are focusing on our integration with MyCrypto.com and following up on the many relationships which were established at the conference.     The Ethereum Alarm Clock is now fully functional on Kovan test net and is awaiting a security audit before being released on the main net.

FYI: you do not need to own any DAY tokens to schedule, so it's open to anyone.  There are some prerequisits or recommendations before you start though:  a) Make 2 ethereum wallets (through https://myetherwallet.com for example) for testing, one for sending FROM and one for sending test-ether TO. b) Get Kovan test ether from a faucet and let it be sent to your FROM address. Easiest way to achieve that is by making a github account ( https://github.com ) if you don't have one already, then sign in with that account on the following Gitter .im channel: https://gitter .im / kovan-testnet / faucet Request keth (kovan ether) there by typing your FROM address and wait until you receive it. c) Install and use the Chrome browser extension MetaMask ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn ) to add the 2 ethereum test addresses you created earlier. Make sure MetaMask is connected to the Kovan Test Net for your keth balance in your FROM address to show up.  You're all set to schedule transactions with kovan test ether. If you want a walk through on how to schedule in the web application, see https://youtu.be/mPWVBGeJpwI?t=2408 .   Below here is TimeNode related only: [update:  does not function properly yet, can't claim my own scheduled transaction, can't know for certain if other transactions are possible to claim because there aren't any in queue] [update: it works when you follow this guide precisely: https://blog.chronologic.network/how-to-prove-day-ownership-to-be-a-timenode-3dc1333c74ef ]  In order to be a timenode and execute scheduled transactions, for that you DO need to have test DAY tokens. The prerequisits a), b) and c) i mentioned above also apply here before you start.  If you want to test this functionality, get test DAY from the faucet in the web app while MetaMask is connected. You receive 100 per hour, so if you right now have 0 you need to come back a few times to get the minimum required. Once you get enough test DAY, follow the instructions in the web application after you clicked 'TimeNode' in the menu. You need to provide Chronologic with the keystore file of the ethereum address where you hold the test DAY tokens and also sign a message to prove you own that address. This message signing is not possible with MetaMask; you need to use myetherwallet (or one of the other client side tools out there to interact with ethereum blockchain). The 'sign message' button is in the list in the bottom right corner of myetherwallet. [update: my mistake, signing a message through MetaMask is possible and mandatory even]  In the web app you can now click the 'start' button and start claiming scheduled transactions (if there are any).",False

A: It does require gas to call /execute scheduled transactions    Q: is there a way to cancel a scheduled transaction?  A: Yes, it is. You can do that before execution window begins.   Q: What happens if gas runs out?  A: It means the scheduler set an insufficient ga Amount, and as such the Timenode(Executor) will be awarded refund and bounties attached   Q: Who decides amount of bounty? Is there going to be a DEX for the bounty?  A: You set the bounty for the scheduling.   Q: The person scheduling transaction, decides on bounty but how does the time node know to accept the request if the bounty is too low  A: The TimeNode will never loose anything on executing transactions.

Q: are transactions manually processed by the time node, or is there a function to automate it to take certain bounties  A: All automated.   Q: The person scheduling transaction, decides on bounty but how does the time node know to accept the request if the bounty is too low  A: In this iteration, that is not set up. But configurations will be added in future iterations   Q: How can this run with hardware wallets like ledger instead of Web3 wallets  Can the transaction be run on air gapped computer  A: The Timenode address, does not need to have the day tokens, you only have to sign a message with the address that has the tokens.

R: that is correct. Though this problem is mitigated as we have more executioners   P: I've been studying EAC code over the past weeks and I was wondering if at least for chronologic related contracts we could reward executors with a specific token (like DAY), instead of ether.

Surface to say here that this solution may as well be conceived as the future of loan in the blockchain.  For this first version, the Debt Smart Contracts will be means to put into a blockchain the specific terms with a proper set of tools to accrue interest and, of course, the time for that loan.  With a version already working on the Ethereum Testnet (Ropsten), in today’s webinar we’ll be showing all attendants how a debt smart contract can be made directly into the blockchain.  For more info on that, please check out our guide on how to use Chronos’ Debt Smart Contract functionality. If you haven’t already, take a look at our recording from January 26th’s webinar below:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVkecXsUdkU   Top webinar questions and answers  P: Hi all, thanks for your explanation. I m wondering how the contract make sure the loan is repaid at the end of the agreed time  R: The main idea for that is collaterizing the lending contract with tokens.   P: How does day token take part in this?  R: Presently, the DAY token is used as fees to create the Debt contract.Other features are planned also.   P: I'm speechless, got goose bumps. Very very impressive  R: !!!!  You are able to do this right now at this very moment! :slightly_smiling_face:   P: Will it be possible also with Tether in future?  R: That is a possiblity   P: How many days is charged to make a transaction like this?  R: We don't have definitive number yet.   P: Where is the interest earned on the transaction?  R: Interest is accrued after exhaustion of the maturity poeriod, in the contract   P: Will there be a forum where users can find counter parties for their borrowing or lending requirements. Thanks, Craig  R: That is indeed one of the future iterations we're considering.   P: This is the future!  R: Wait until you see what we have coming up next! :slightly_smiling_face:   P: I'm extremely proud to have put my money in this ICO  R: We have some really exciting updates we'll leak each week leading up to something very big in early March   P: Is the date of contract generation properly checked? So no scams with past dates can be made?  R: This is basically decided by Ethereum itself, and uses whatever time Ethereum chain has   P: I guess it will be explained at a later date, How do you go about auditing the loans/interest?  R: Correct, We already have plans and are working on optimizing them.   P: How many day tokens will it cost to do the contract through the platform?  R: The final amount hasn't been decided yet.   P: Can the Chronologic .Network platform be integrated with other contracts, other DApps, across different blockchains using some other synergistic platform?  R: Yes it can be integrated with other contracts, other dapps for sure,  this is exactly what are are working to setup :slightly_smiling_face:     P: How many day tokens will it cost to do the contract through the platform?  R: Presently, it is pegged at 100 Ropstent Testnet DAY tokens   P: How many day tokens will it cost to do the contract through the platform?  R: Currently for the test use you need 100 DAY tokens to run a SDC!   P: Are you the one who is going to define the amount of day tokens to do this transaction? Is this right?  R: As always, we'll decide that as a team.",False

The debt smart contracts portion of the Chronos dApp looks promising from a business use case perspective. This could be the default dApp for big and small crypto investors/speculators (for ethereum and the erc20 tokens at least), but it needs to be marketed somehow around the time it's ready to go live because people will not use it if they don't know it exists. The DAY mint and token holders can at least look forward to a brighter future now, because it was damn depressing in Q3 and 4 of 2017. It's beginning to show in the valuation slowly too, fortunately.  I have some questions that maybe some smart people here have answers for:  a) does anyone know if other blockchain projects are doing something similar regarding debt contracts? There must exist some type of competition somewhere besides what Salt lending looks to achieve (with crypto as collateral for fiat loans) in the long term, right? Or does chronologic have first mover advantage? b) the lender that receives the generated debt tokens, isn't there a kind of naming convention or uniquely generated id attached to those tokens needed? otherwise in a few years there are floating around the ethereum network a lot of duplicate named tokens (i understand the underlying contract address is unique of course). Am i right in this assumption? c) is there any future use case of the yesterday token mentioned by anyone from chronologic? or is it really deprecated forever?    This must have immediate priority, should be integrated within the Chronos dApp. Since the borrower and lender don't need or care to know each other, it's in essence just another marketplace Would like to see anonimity guaranteed though, kyc/aml is not necessary here.   P: This is the future! R: Wait until you see what we have coming up next! :slightly_smiling_face:  P: I'm extremely proud to have put my money in this ICO R: We have some really exciting updates we'll leak each week leading up to something very big in early March This is a nice cliffhanger. I hope the project team keeps delivering from now on. Token holders/minters are not nearly proud enough yet, but the outlook for 2018 is good at least  .",False

Also, if the day tokens are sold, less will be minted next time round.  What that means is it is in reality extremely hard to impossible to sell the time mint, the time mint becomes worthless if the DAY tokens are sold on market and the DAY tokens already are circa 75% down in value from first minting.  To me, it looks like this was designed to be difficult to exit I (at least the time mint), with no reward for investors evident, or do I have this wrong?  There is also no use case on offer at this time to my understanding, other than what suspiciously looks like a future intent to use them to loan out to ""businesses""  Worse, there is almost no retail market for DAY at this time, almost illiquid on Etherdelta. Coinmarket cap has just livecoin and ED trading it, with about $1500 worth traded in the last 24 hours. Yes, you read that right!    Even worse still, from what I can see, Etherdelta was sold to a bunch of Chinese recently and the site was compromised right around the transfer time of the business, ending in people being phished and losing their coins. That's where the bulk of the tiny volume of trade takes place as of the moment from what I can see.  I am not sure what the future holds for DAY holders. I hope for all who ploughed in some ETH there will be a big turnaround for the better.  Someone called me out for a ""fuddy"" comment. I can only say, what part of about 75 percent loss is fear, uncertainty or doubt? It's a bald fact.",False

Performance Global?s business model & focus is in the advertising space & they?re looking to do a contribution period. Although Performance Global is unrelated to ChronoLogic business-wise, certain members of the ChronoLogic team have advisory roles in Performance Global. Additionally, a friendly deal was negotiated where certain private individuals from the ChronoLogic team will loan some funds to help kick start the Performance Global project & their contribution period.  And what better way to do a loan than by using a ChronoLogic smart contract?  Usually financial instruments work in that there are extremely long agreements that govern the terms. The goal of ChronoLogic is to take the most important terms of the debt agreement and put it directly into smart contracts. Since smart contracts are immutable & public, we believe that this will allow some very complicated terms to be discarded and for debt to be conducted purely on the blockchain.  When creating the smart contract it?s first important to lay out the terms of the debt instrument that were agreed upon. Some of these parameters come from Performance Global and were mandated. We decided to not push certain aspects to make this simulation / transaction as real as possible. Terms of the Performance Global Loan      500 ETH     Denominated in ETH (we wanted to use DAY but Performance Global insisted on ETH; the framework is applicable to DAY as well)     60 day term     One fixed payment (in ETH) rather than a daily or monthly interest rate meaning no pre-payment penalties or any incentive to pre-pay     2% penalty of the balance for every 30 days the loan is not paid off     Non-transferable (ChronoLogic cannot sell the debt to a third party)     Un-secured & no collateral  ChronoLogic will now take the token sale smart contract (used for TimeMints & the crowdsale) & add a few features but also strip down a few features to create this specific smart contract.  The mechanics of this smart contract will be as follows:      Performance Global launches a smart contract that will generate a new token denominated as PGLOAN     ChronoLogic?s team will send 500 ETH to the smart contract address which will be immediately liquid for Performance Global to use as they wish     ChronoLogic?s ETH address will in return receive PGLOAN tokens that signify the obligation     Smart contract will have a pre-determined exchange rate at which Performance Global can send ETH back the ChronoLogic?s ETH address     To clear the obligation Performance Global will send back 500 ETH + the fixed payment at which point PGLOAN tokens will be sent back to Performance Global?s address signifying that the debt obligation has been cleared     If the obligation is not cleared then ChronoLogic?s ETH address that has ?TimeMint features? will start minting additional PGLOAN tokens at the monthly penalty rate of 2% per month until the obligation is cleared  New Features      Whitelisting ChronoLogic?s ETH address since this is a private deal so no one else can send ETH once the Performance Global debt smart contract is launched     Restricting transferability of PGLOAN tokens since the debt instrument is non-transferable     Fixed exchange rate system so the debt obligation can be cleared  ChronoLogic will start working on the technology to launch this smart contract this upcoming week. Part of the funds have been furnished in advance for Performance Global since the deal was closed earlier; however, once the smart contract is launched the funds that have yet to be deployed will be done so via the smart contract.  Afterwards, the goal will be to create a system for third parties to launch their own debt smart contracts.  The first phase will be by contacting the ChronoLogic team who will facilitate the process since each debt contract will have additional features that may not yet be developed. Payment will be via DAY tokens.  Please contact us if you are interested in launching your own crypto debt contract.  Please someone correct me, because believe me, I want this to be wrong, but now it seems with this line ""we wanted to use DAY but Performance Global insisted on ETH"" Chronologic is saying fck us the ones who funded them with money and complying to use Eth which renders Day token absolutely useless. Just because they use the contract the token sale used, means nothing for DAY token and now people will just use Ethereum because lets be honest, do I want a loan in DAY token(which has slowly but surely done nothing but plummet) or ethereum, which keep in mind if we had it today instead of participating in this ICO and holding DAY to date, eth was 347 on 8/28 and today it is 470. To get a decent timemint it was 5 eth minimum so 5*347 = 1735 and 5*470=2350. Lets take the lowest sell order on etherdelta .0085 I have 258 day tokens and havent withdrawn since I received due to the minting and .0085*258 ~ 2.19 ethereum. 2.19 * 470 = 1030. Loss if we calculate from investment = 700. If we want to go from Eth price now is $1320 loss. So we funded chronologic, our token was basically a proof of concept and now the concept has attracted a deal but instead of our token value increasing, it is literally worthless due to the fact our token isnt needed at all. Wow! Lessons learned now just the hard way T_T  I pointed this out in August. Please stay safe and don't invest in ICOs that don't so much as provide a viable real world use case before launch =/",False

What could possibly go wrong? It reeks.  What attracted me to crypto was a series I watched in early 2010 called Money as Debt by Paul Grignon. My God that was revolutionary. At the time btc was trading at a few dollars. The conclusion in part 5 was that btc would be 100k to 1million bucks. It seemed wild then but now look. Argentina was a great example of riches to rags through hyperinflationary fiat, though now there is the internet of money, the situation for would be hyperinflationistas has changed. Zimbabwe and Venezuala are showing what happens when small fry countries try to escape the destruction of their unit of account. Their citizens have gone btc.  So, the basic reason for most to go crypto was to have the features of a currency outside of inflationary debt fiat, one which is decentralised.  But chronologic, apart from using chrono this and timemint that in the spiel, is looking moribund in comparison and looks like it is shaping up as a pseudo bank using our eth as the substrate for the loans.

I recommend you to read the articles on: https://blog.chronologic.network/the-future-of-debt-374bdc31c93d  It can help you to understand the first steps of this project. Chronologic is developing the Chronos DAPP (Decentralized App), a blockchain service for mobile and web applications. ""The alpha version of Chronos will be the starting point. We’re happy to announce that users will already be able to start experimenting with mintable tokens very soon. We estimate the alpha version of Chronos to be out within 2017.""  The value of DAY comes from the adoption of using the Chronos Platform. If you read the blog, you will see the first use case that is being developed, which is cryptocurrency loans. The financial solutions are just the first step of Chronos Platform, as you can see that ChronoLogic has a financial company as the mainly partner (Wired Investors). The future for this platform is great! It can be used in several industries: finance, transports, e-commerce, energy production and other time-related projects... In the roadmap you can see that ChronoLogic is planning to launch 6 Proof of Time projects until the end of 2017 and 18 projects in 2018.  The value of DAY will rise depending on the partnership with companies and the number/quality of the projects launched, as they need to use DAY as the currency for Chronos Platform's transactions. Each project launched will push the price up, because the partners and the partners' clients will need to buy DAYs to use the platform.",False

You ask people, community in slack what could yesterday be, what could whole chronologic be, you get informations and ideas from us! That can also be ideas for your coin DAY, why not, you even made a forum for that, so people write down ideas! Let me ask you CHRONO, what is your idea? Do you even have one? Maybe you do? Maybe you don't! How will we know you didn't copy an idea from one of the community, change it a little and boom!!

Just make an auction and you will see what are people willing to offer, from community you can only see and have an idea how much you can sell us your DAYs. From information you get from Us, you can see how much we would pay for DAY! You can calculate!

Dev is in Brazil, partying, that is I joke I hope   ETHERDELTA is slow, that is my problem, but if I new XYZ investor wants to buy DAYs (new to crypto), and he sees ED.. He will turn around trust me.. Price is stable? With 12,313 24h vol. stable price means nothing to me.

Last but not least:  A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS/ADVICE FOR THE CHRONOLOGIC TEAM/DEVELOPERS (I KNOW YOU'RE READING THIS):  1) DAY has NO marketcap, thus NO exposure right now, because the circulating supply is unknown. Can you at least get in contact with the people behind coinmarketcap.com to get that fixed very soon? If you don't do that, you're doing a disservice to the original investors! 2) Give weekly or 2-weekly updates on your blog (publish the cycle you're going to use) on the status of what you are doing and what you achieved that last week(s). If not, i refer to the last sentence of point 1) 3) Not everyone is on Slack, be open about what you are doing on more 'public' channels please. Get a twitter account to start with. If not, i refer to the last sentence of point 1) 4) How nice that you are travelling in Brasil right now ( https://blog.chronologic.network/breakfast-in-rio-recruitment-ee25eec31902 ), nice picture at the copacabana, but besides a couple of possible interviews that might not even happen, WHAT are you doing there for the ChronoLogic company? And how does that benefit the (possible) investors eventually? Again, this comes down to being transparent. A quote: ""We're aiming to have breakfast with a few people to discuss the value they can bring to the ChronoLogic team while we're in Brazil (Rio and Sao Paolo)."" Well, let's counter that with: ""What value can ChronoLogic bring to the original investors?"".  If this question is ignored or bypassed, i refer to the last sentence of point 1) again.  These are normal, reasonable questions, and i think you owe the TimeMint owners and the people that bought DAY on the open market some answers. Transparency is key, that's one of the reasons why people are into blockchain technology, live up to it.  Edit: two more things: a) The main site still shows a button ""join the crowdsale"" (linking to a form to get updates when it hits exchanges), it would be more ethical to rename the button label to ""crowdsale is over"" or ""crowdsale was succesful"". Also there is an element on the right side with ""contribution period begins in"" with a clock at 0. A professional organization updates their site, or lets it be maintained by someone who knows how. b) There is still an advert on etherscan.io that shows up from time to time stating: ""Sponsored Link:    Chronologic - Self-Mining Ethereum token based on Proof of Time. Join the Contribution."" Isn't it about time (pun intended) to get this removed? A professional organization is on top of these things.",False

The precise amount is unknown but a very rough estimate can be given. Skip to ** if you don't follow me or want a quick estimate.  Let's start with what we know: 20278 ETH was raised amongst 3322 participants (including pre-contributors) with a total of  486 693 DAY  (on september 19th 2017).  The average amount of ETH put in per participant is 6.1044 and thus the average amount of DAY tokens per participant is approximately 146.50 DAY.  All those participants also have a TimeMint address and are mining the token with an average of 0.75% per 24 hours (the 'chronopower') in the 1st chrono-era (88 days, ending ~ december 16th 2017). Disclaimer: for the average 'chronopower' i assume the median (halfway between 0.5 and 1% = 0.75%) for an easier calculation, but i know this is not accurate because the majority of DAY tokens in TimeMints is skewed towards the 1%.  Assuming nobody ever sells any DAY tokens ever, we use https://www.timemints.com to calculate the average amount of DAY that can be mined. Inputs: ethereum initial investment 6.1044 ETH, TimeMint 1667 (half of 3333 total).  From that calculation we see that: After about 10 chrono-eras (= 2.4 years) the total amount is more or less reached, so i use the corresponding number in the table under the column 'valor final' on the timemints site as the total (= 545.93 DAY).  ** The total supply (for 3333 TimeMints after 2.4 years) is thus  1 819 584  DAY  There are a few very important 'buts': - be advised that the largest increase in token supply regardless of trading will be in the chrono-era we are in right now; with the calculation example i used it would mean the total supply would be 942 439 DAY on december 16th 2017  (an almost 100% increase). - i have completely disregarded the yesterday token and i assume that one deprecated. We know that the tokens are being traded obviously: - if tokens are bought on the market by a person that doesn't own a TimeMint address, they can't self mine. The impact of this scenario on the total supply will be the largest in the 1st chrono-era (now). The total supply will be less than my estimate. - if tokens are bought on the market by a TimeMint owner with a higher chronopower from another TimeMint owner with a lower chronopower, the total supply will be higher than estimated. - if tokens are bought on the market by a TimeMint owner with a lower chronopower from another TimeMint owner with a higher chronopower, the total supply will be lower than estimated.  I probably have missed some other possible scenarios, but how the tokenomics of this will play out exactly, we will have to see.",False

But, as you can read in the whitepaper https://chronologic.network/uploads/Chronologic_Whitepaper.pdf on page 12, there will be a function (soon live i hope?) called 'TimeTx' where a TimeMint (what you refer to as a 'genesis address') can be transferred to a buyer.  As you can read on that page, the seller needs to bring in 8888 DAY (which will be returned to the seller after the sale) for this to work. To come up with 8888 DAY at this moment, assuming the ico price and being an average timemint owner (let's say having ~ 150 DAY so far), the seller has to first buy ~ $100 000 worth of DAY on the market. After the sale of the TimeMint, what is the seller going to do? Well, i assume most will not just hold on to the 8888 DAY (+ x amount of DAY as the purchase price by the buyer) but sell it back to the market for ETH/BTC/USD(T). Because why sell it in the first place if you're not going to convert it to a currency?  So while this function might go live before this year is out, it will probably not be used until a later chrono-era when there has been enough tokens mined and on the market so when someone is searching for a few thousand tokens, it might be feasible without pumping the token price sky high.  This is how I understand it to be, but if a ChronoLogic team member reads this, please do comment! thanks.",False

I know the tokensale/ico was finished before this news hit, but your headquarters is in Hong Kong (incorporated there?) which is considered a special administrative region of China. Did you get any inquiries by officials into how you handled your ICO and if it was compliant with local laws? And if not, is there a contingency plan in case you still get in trouble retroactively? The thing is: i fear that the DAY token could be considered a security because it does not have utility yet (when it's traded on exchange(s)) until you build a time based instrument that uses the token somehow. Or do you look at the TimeMint as that first utility in the ecosystem?  From an investor's perspective; * Why did you choose for an emission/minting model for the tokens that is logarithmic and not linear? What i mean is: there might be a heavy incentive for the ico contributors to sell off their DAY tokens (they initially get based on their contributed ETH) on the first exchange (probably etherdelta i assume) that lists it. This to me is likely to happen because: a) from the seller's perspective: there is no perceived immediate utilitarian value attached to a token because, as i understand it and correct me if i'm wrong, selling a token you receive initially (before the TimeMint starts mining) doesn't influence the TimeMint's original ETH based minting capacity. b) from the buyer's perspective: the most DAY token 'inflation' will happen in the first ChronoEra (first 88 days), so the knowledgeable potential buyers know this and they might just wait until a reasonable percentage of the maximum circulating supply is reached, which is not until, let's say, the 3rd or 4th ChronoEra. Plus the utility for the early buyer isn't there since they don't own a TimeMint and there is no other time based instrument yet that uses the token.  Or do you think these potential effects will cancel each other out and all the TimeMint owners understand that this probably a long hold if they want to see a return on their ETH?  Thanks in advance for any constructive answers and/or explanations, i appreciate it!",False

Very simple in plain english terms.  No fancy crypto terms.  Just wondering as if something can't explain or be understood by a 3rd grader I have never really invested in it.  I want to invest in your ico but I want to see if this can be explained in very very simple terms so a 3rd grader could understand it.  It seems half the grown ups don't understand the entire concept and only a few so please explain in very simple terms from the ico going on down the line.  The concept in simple terms, the reason to invest in the short or long run and reasons to just hold the coin for value.  Say someone just holds the coin for 5 years without doing a thing should he expect a great return on investment?  I will try.  Basically by contributing in the ICO you are able to mint/self-mine new tokens on your ethereum address (this is called a TimeMint) based on the balance and the amount of time you hold it. Similar to how an interest bearing bank account pays out.  Other time based projects will then be able to run on the same system creating more value for DAY tokens.  As for whether one should expect a great return on investment, people at ChronoLogic obviously believe so but the only person who can answer that is you and anyone else who contributed or is planning to contribute.  Very cool, this is extraordinarily good news. Curious whether people will decide to invest during the ICO or just wait until it gets listed on exchanges.

What are your simple expectations for your company in the future and why would investing in your company be a great idea?  Other than your team which speaks for itself and is good enough to make a company profitable.  But other than that why should one invest with you all over other ico's or even for that matter over potential breakthrough otc companies starting out?  Sorry for the questions but I like very clear and logical reasoning for why I should invest a good sum of money especially in something that is brand new and so volatile.  Thank you.  I know you have answered all of the technical questions for people on this board but I invest in companies that I can buy and hold and watch grow and grow and grow producing large returns in the not to distant future.  Not day trading, etc. but more of a speculative investor with a mix of value in there.  You certainly have a good team but I just want to know other than that.",False

From a legal perspective, that is on the issuer as our main aim is to create the technology & innovate to allow this to happen & let third parties launch their own Proof-of-Time tokens. However, we are also advising on another project that is in stealth mode & there is a potential partnership to use our technology so actually we are in talks with lawyers almost daily regarding how securities (including debt securities) on the blockchain will be launched, how to do the proper KYC & how to ensure that the issuer is 100% compliant. This varies jurisdiction by jurisdiction; however, the demand for these types of products is enormous - the securities market is exponentially larger than all cryptos combined. However, the future of the securities markets is also the blockchain.  Regarding uses, there are a few: 1) Launching a proof-of-time token on the Chronos platform in the future will be done by spending DAY 2) Each new proof-of-time token sale launched on the Chronos platform by third parties will have a contribution period where contributions will be in the form of DAY as our goal is to create an ecosystem just like ethereum did with crowdsales happening on the ethereum blockchain  Hope that helps.

We are basically making a currency pegged to time instead of running on a Proof-of-Work system.   Quote from: spartakkus on August 02, 2017, 02:07:31 PM Quote from: Alexandr Korelko on July 31, 2017, 11:40:05 AM Quote from: ChronoLogic on July 31, 2017, 09:51:15 AM Quote from: Alexandr Korelko on July 30, 2017, 11:09:13 PM Quote from: ChronoLogic on July 30, 2017, 02:03:22 PM  ICO contributors get both.  The ETH address you contributed from becomes one of 3,333 TimeMints (similar to Masternodes) that is able to create new DAY tokens through the passage of time.  On day zero, you will initially receive 24 DAY tokens per ETH. After day zero your TimeMint starts minting additional DAY tokens everyday.  In the whitepaper, the minimum needed to set up a TimeTX contract is 8,888 DAY. This means you need something like a 200 ETH investment to sell your TimeMint at the end of the first chrono era (if you just let the DAY generate more of itself) and 300+ to be able to sell it early on, even for the 1% mints. In practice, since the Mint presumably isn't mining anything while it's in the contract (as your DAY that you were mining with just got locked) it's even worse. There's also no real way to check whether anyone has a mint for sale in the first place (I guess people will wind up posting in here? meh) so it's extremely illiquid.  It's an interesting concept but I strongly recommend revising this point.  Additionally, to be blunt, the use cases in the white paper are anemic. The WP describes a token designed to be as hoarded as humanly possible, but there's nothing to spend it on and anyone without a Mint (remember, they're effectively not tradeable) has no reason to accept it. Investors are dependent on the company to eventually launch a platform that may, one day, do something with those tokens. ""We'll find a lot of use cases later"" is not good enough to send 88 ETH off and get back an asset it will take 300 more to ever trade.  The team's pedigree is beyond solid and the token itself is unique, so I'm puzzled why this ICO had to be now and not two weeks of use case brainstorming / development later, because there must be something better to shoot for than this.  Hi Alex, thank you for your interest in ChronoLogic, your feedback is valuable.  The fact that TimeMint addresses are themselves tradable creates a secondary market. Exiting out of a TimeMint is an option of the DAY token, rather than a core feature. It is premature to analyze that the market will be illiquid or liquid.  You can put in as little as 1ETH during the ICO. You don't necessarily need to pay 88ETH, that was the minimum price for some of the TimeMints still available during the pre-sale.  ChronoLogic expands the use of time on the blockchain, there is a certain level of serendipity that must be taken into consideration for early stage blockchain projects like this one. Being able to explain practical use-cases is important, but we are not here to foresee how the market will evolve, we believe all the different angles empowered people will come out with will be inspiring.  We envision people and businesses being able to create their time tokens with several different logic elements to measure, record, trade, buy and sell time-based activities. There is a lot that can be done with time on the blockchain and we want to expand what is possible right now. We're inspired by connecting the fundamental features of time with the blockchain.  The DAY token is itself a good example of what can be done with time on the blockchain: pegging time to minting or staking a usage or store or value token.  Hi,  As is clear from the WP, a TimeMint is only really valuable during the first 3-4 eras. All Mints will mine >75% of their tokens within the first 6 months and 90%+ within the first 12 months. As such, there is very little point to selling a Mint after 6 months; the market will never have any significant time to develop. Furthermore, if you put the Mint (and/or the tokens used to power it) up for sale in a 2 week auction you waste 12% of its output, and, of course, it takes 300 ETH to sell -any- of them, including the ones the ICO participants pay 1-10 ETH for. With this limitation, even if they weren't already mining less than the pre-sale versions, it is virtually impossible for any of the Mints bought by small-cap buyers to ever be sold. The bigger ones might be tradeable if there was a site or a UI set up somewhere to do that, but I don't see that shown here.  Meanwhile, DAYs are designed to be hoarded as their only use case in the real world right now is to be used to stake more of themselves. After those 6-12 months, the wells will run dry. Then what? You haven't outlined a reason why anyone not connected to a Mint will want one. The team wants to develop other proof of time use cases but that may well have nothing to do with DAY at all.  ""We are not here to foresee how the market will evolve"" is not good enough for an ICO that requires this much to get off the ground. You want to raise 20 million dollars. The token idea is unique and worth pursuing but given the limited amount of time it's worth anything in this implementation, this isn't the way to go about it. If I thought you were scamming on purpose I wouldn't bother making either of these posts, so take this as a sincere request - please go back to the drawing board for a little bit and look for a way to make this work for buyers.   Hi everyone. So, to put it simply, after 12 months, almost no new DAY tokens will be produced by any Mint, right? And After 24 months production of new tokens will be stopped totally. This will make Mint value go to zero, and total amount of DAY to be static in practice. Why not sharing a fixed amount with ICO  members from the beginning? Any advantage of this (much complicated) way you propose? Can't see anyone.  It's correct that DAY tokens will mint at a reduced rate but it will never fully go to zero, it halves every 88 days.  Minting new tokens is the first use case of Proof-of-Time currencies and that can be expanded on further with the financial use cases as defined in our whitepaper. They can be used to make debt securities and have their interest payments done automatically.  The advantage of the minting process is first and foremost in demonstrating how Proof-of-Time works but the value to our contributors won't only be in the form of the TimeMints, but also from the DAY tokens which will act as a currency to use in all future Proof-of-Time use cases.",False

This means you need something like a 200 ETH investment to sell your TimeMint at the end of the first chrono era (if you just let the DAY generate more of itself) and 300+ to be able to sell it early on, even for the 1% mints. In practice, since the Mint presumably isn't mining anything while it's in the contract (as your DAY that you were mining with just got locked) it's even worse. There's also no real way to check whether anyone has a mint for sale in the first place (I guess people will wind up posting in here? meh) so it's extremely illiquid.  It's an interesting concept but I strongly recommend revising this point.  Additionally, to be blunt, the use cases in the white paper are anemic. The WP describes a token designed to be as hoarded as humanly possible, but there's nothing to spend it on and anyone without a Mint (remember, they're effectively not tradeable) has no reason to accept it. Investors are dependent on the company to eventually launch a platform that may, one day, do something with those tokens. ""We'll find a lot of use cases later"" is not good enough to send 88 ETH off and get back an asset it will take 300 more to ever trade.  The team's pedigree is beyond solid and the token itself is unique, so I'm puzzled why this ICO had to be now and not two weeks of use case brainstorming / development later, because there must be something better to shoot for than this.",False

The fact that TimeMint addresses are themselves tradable creates a secondary market. Exiting out of a TimeMint is an option of the DAY token, rather than a core feature. It is premature to analyze that the market will be illiquid or liquid.  You can put in as little as 1ETH during the ICO. You don't necessarily need to pay 88ETH, that was the minimum price for some of the TimeMints still available during the pre-sale.  ChronoLogic expands the use of time on the blockchain, there is a certain level of serendipity that must be taken into consideration for early stage blockchain projects like this one. Being able to explain practical use-cases is important, but we are not here to foresee how the market will evolve, we believe all the different angles empowered people will come out with will be inspiring.  We envision people and businesses being able to create their time tokens with several different logic elements to measure, record, trade, buy and sell time-based activities. There is a lot that can be done with time on the blockchain and we want to expand what is possible right now. We're inspired by connecting the fundamental features of time with the blockchain.  The DAY token is itself a good example of what can be done with time on the blockchain: pegging time to minting or staking a usage or store or value token.",False

All Mints will mine >75% of their tokens within the first 6 months and 90%+ within the first 12 months. As such, there is very little point to selling a Mint after 6 months; the market will never have any significant time to develop. Furthermore, if you put the Mint (and/or the tokens used to power it) up for sale in a 2 week auction you waste 12% of its output, and, of course, it takes 300 ETH to sell -any- of them, including the ones the ICO participants pay 1-10 ETH for. With this limitation, even if they weren't already mining less than the pre-sale versions, it is virtually impossible for any of the Mints bought by small-cap buyers to ever be sold. The bigger ones might be tradeable if there was a site or a UI set up somewhere to do that, but I don't see that shown here.  Meanwhile, DAYs are designed to be hoarded as their only use case in the real world right now is to be used to stake more of themselves. After those 6-12 months, the wells will run dry. Then what? You haven't outlined a reason why anyone not connected to a Mint will want one. The team wants to develop other proof of time use cases but that may well have nothing to do with DAY at all.  ""We are not here to foresee how the market will evolve"" is not good enough for an ICO that requires this much to get off the ground. You want to raise 20 million dollars. The token idea is unique and worth pursuing but given the limited amount of time it's worth anything in this implementation, this isn't the way to go about it. If I thought you were scamming on purpose I wouldn't bother making either of these posts, so take this as a sincere request - please go back to the drawing board for a little bit and look for a way to make this work for buyers.",False

Yes, it is true that 90% of the supply will be minted by month 12. Making TimeMints transferable is of interest but it is not the driver of the contribution period. In fact, all of the innovations have been completed because we wanted to be in development and not just have an ERC20 token with a promise for the future. For us, everything within this DAY token contribution period is an innovation or a feature that we see as having a far-reaching effect for future additional Proof-of-Time tokens that will be launched on what is the ultimate goal of this project - the Chronos platform.  The DAY token is, among other things, the usage token that will enable users and companies to launch their own proof of time token.  Regarding contributions, the hard cap is 38,383 ETH which is less than $20M at today’s current ETH exchange rates. Additionally, if we hit the TimeMint hard cap first then only 15,000 ETH might be contributed. Still it is a significant amount and we do not take it lightly.  That being said, we are open to brainstorming with the community and open to suggestions especially regarding features & innovations that will help third parties launch their own Proof-of-Time tokens on Chronos. We suggest you to join our Slack to keep the brainstorming on, we appreciate your input.  Thanks again!",False

The DAY token is itself a good first example of what can be done with time on the blockchain: pegging time to minting or staking a token.",False

The contribution period is now officially CLOSED.     https://chronologic.network/bitcointalk/header.png   SLACK | WHITEPAPER | WEBSITE  Time is the most valuable “asset” for humans, yet most of mankind measures an individual’s wealth by the amount of resources the person has been able to accumulate, often ignoring the amount of time sacrificed in exchange for these transient resources.  We would like to take part in changing that.  What is it? The first generation of cryptocurrencies have been based on the concepts of mining & staking. ChronoLogic works on proof-of-time. In its first use-case ChronoLogic pegs time to a store of value token named DAY based on the Ethereum blockchain.  ICO details   https://chronologic.network/bitcointalk/diagram.png  The ICO will take place on August 28th and will last for a maximum of 7 days.  There are two types of hardcaps which will trigger dependent on which one is reached first. This will happen after either 38,383 ETH is raised or there are 3,194 unique contributors.  In addition 33 TimeMints were reserved for pre-sale, 18 TimeMints for the team and 88 TimeMints for future auctions. The details of these TimeMints can be found on the whitepaper.     https://chronologic.network/bitcointalk/Img1.jpg  How does it work?  Each ICO participant will contribute between 1 and 333 ETH and their Ethereum address will become one of 3,333 TimeMints. Where 1 ETH = 24 DAY. With a maximum of 333 ETH per timemint. Each TimeMint will create DAY tokens based on time and the TimeMint’s ChronoPower. ICO participants will benefit both from having a TimeMint linked to their contribution address and the DAY tokens they purchase, both of which can be traded. As the Proof-of-Time concept works based on an ethereum smart contract, the minting process will work automatically based on your address and the passage of time. To limit the total supply of DAY in the future, each TimeMint’s ChronoPower will halve every 88 days.  What is ChronoPower?  ChronoPower is the minting power of a specific TimeMint, Each of the 3,333 TimeMints has a different ChronoPower ranging from 0.5% to 1% additional DAY tokens minted per day.  What if I want to trade my TimeMint?  TimeMint holders may sell their TimeMint to a buyer. ChronoLogic has a process called TimeTx that allows the sale/transfer of TimeMints to a buyer/receiver through a trustless smart contract process.  For full details about the process, check out our whitepaper.    https://chronologic.network/bitcointalk/Img2.jpg  What are the real use cases of a Proof-of-Time blockchain?  There are many possible use cases, here are a couple of examples from the whitepaper:  Finance Use Case  In finance, many securities including debt securities are heavily dependent on time. For example, a debt instrument with a 5 year term paying 12% is effectively a smart contract that can be housed on the future Proof-of-Time Blockchain.  The Company launches their Proof-of-Time token to help raise & pay their crypto debt via the issuance of a smart contract. When an Investor sends DAY to the specific receiving address the Investor in return receives the Company’s token COM. Investor A sends 200 DAY and receives 1,000 COM.  Chronologic’s Proof-of-Time technology automatically identifies the sending address as a TimeMint and additional COM tokens are produced as interest accrues.  In order to pay the debt back the Company needs to send back the respective amount of DAY borrowed plus the additional amount accrued.  Interest payments can also happen automatically by the receiving address automatically sending from its DAY balance the respective interest payment to any addresses holding COM.  Because of the interconnectedness of the blockchain, investors can trade COM between each other and repayment then happens across the network depending on who holds COM.  Transportation Use Case  When checking in for a train one supplies their address. If the train is delayed the smart contract is activated.  If the train is delayed then for every minute or 10 minutes that it is delayed the customer receives the company’s Proof-of-Time token. This token can then be redeemed later for cash or used in order to buy additional tickets from the Company depending on the company’s policy, which is modeled in their smart contract.     https://chronologic.network/bitcointalk/Img3.jpg  What are our goals?  We at ChronoLogic want to build a platform through the future Chronos Proof-of-Time concept, on which additional Proof-of-Time tokens & projects will be launched, and can be considered as our current most important driving force. Which will themselves require DAY tokens / TimeMints to function.  ChronoLogic’s 2017 Goals:  • Develop a Proof-of-Time mechanism for the finance space. • Beta test the implementation of a finance Proof-of-Time use case with ChronoLogic’s crypto private equity partner Wired Investors. • Develop an auction functionality for a decentralized exchange of DAY tokens & DAY TimeMints. • Finalize development roadmap for the future Proof-of-Time Chronos Platform. • Partner, support & launch 6 Proof-of-Time blockchain projects.  ChronoLogic’s 2018 Goals:  • Deploy the finance Proof-of-Time use case for the public. • Work with other partners to beta test additional Proof-of-Time use cases. • Develop the open Proof-of-Time Chronos Platform to enable the launch of Proof-of-Time tokens by third parties. • Partner, support & launch 18 Proof-of-Time blockchain projects.
