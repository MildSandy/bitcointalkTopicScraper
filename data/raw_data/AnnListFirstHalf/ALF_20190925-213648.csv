The projects we are looking at are mostly Deep science, start-ups and other modern technological and engineering developments that can become participants of our AETERNUM ""eco-system"".

We invite to our project known researchers and designers, experts and leaders of scientific organizations from around the world. Our project does not repats and not duplicate  the existing Crowdfunding platforms and other projects. We propose to invest our ALF tokens on the principles of IMPACT INVESTMENT in promising projects that are really capable of transforming the situation, serve the development of the Society and ennoble the Human. The launch of the Aeternum Crowdfunding platform is carried out before the start of the ICO so that members of our community can correctly assess their goals and opportunities for participating in the project. Soon the work on the Aeternum Exchange will be completed. This will allow converting ALF tokens into other crypto currencies and financial instruments.

Investing Early is the Key to Financial Success  Investing early is indeed the key to financial success. Let me make it simple for you. If you start investing early, your potential for growth is higher. When it comes to the stock market and cryptocurrency, it is always better to invest when the price of a coin is at its lowest. You gain a higher profit margin each time the value of the coin escalates. The price of Bitcoin was 0.008 USD on the 17th of May, 2010. Its value rose to 0.08 USD on the 22nd of May, 2010. Those who invested five days prior to its rise reaped a profit of 900% in five days! Gauge the potential of a coin and its affiliated project and make an investment decision when its price is low. You can invest a small sum of money when the value of a coin is low and gain huge profits in a period of time. You may invest a large sum of money in the same coin a few months or years later yet yield a small profit margin. It is all about investing at the right time, and now is the best time to invest in Aeternum, the world’s first science and intellectual property driven ICO!  GoFundScience — The Best Crowdfunding Platform  Crowdfunding is quite different from a donation scheme. Crowdfunding allows worthy entrepreneurs, artists and projects the funding they need to chase their dreams. Crowdfunding platforms are transparent and allow a pool of investors to invest in something they see a potential in. You may receive enough money to kick-start your journey and receive great accolades in the future. While there are several commendable platforms on the market, none compare to GoFundScience. GoFundScience allows for science to flourish and caters to humanitarian purposes as well. You can receive funds for the development of your project or start-up and get on with things. They also donate funds to over 1.5 million charities the world over. All this is possible through the Aeternum Fund.  Why You Should Invest in Aeternum Now  Our mission is to empower people to unite around ideas that matter to them and make those ideas come to life. Aeternum is the world’s first science and intellectual property driven ICO. The centrepiece of our ecosystem consists of deep science projects and start-ups in the fields of financial technology, biotechnology, nanotechnology, information technology and artificial intelligence. We intend on empowering these start-ups with the financial push they need. Our goal is to create a platform which will allow individuals the world over with the opportunity to invest in the intellectual property rights of scientists around the world.  While IPOs presented a viable option a few years ago, ICOs are the norm of today. Crowdfunding is our instrument of investment. We intend on maximizing the value of the investment pool and giving our affiliated start-ups with the financial push they deserve. Our investors can invest in the offered pool and cannot choose an individual project to invest in. Aeternum users have voting powers though, and will be able to vote for projects we should invest in first. All projects will be screened to determine their viability and credibility in the long run. We also plan on raising money for over 1.5 million charities with personal fundraisers, events, races and corporate philanthropy.  The use of blockchain technology will ensure full transparency of investments made. Smart contracts will ensure that all qualified partners have their say in reviewing and approving applicants that want to contribute to and join the ecosystem. You can also sell your membership via our affiliated exchange, or at our finance application as our token serves as a proof of membership to the Aeternum Fund. Here is how you can invest in the Aeternum Fund:  BitLats is a new cryptocurrency, backed by science-based start-ups and their intellectual property. This is creating an increasing demand for the cryptocurrency which has led an increase in its value.

The Best Time to Start Investing is today!  There is never a better time to start investing than today. The earlier you start investing, the better it is in the long run. Let me put things to perspective. A bullish market will always yield profits. A bearish market is one to be greatly optimistic of as well. When the price of a coin is low, or when it is newly established is the best time to invest in it. If you believe in a project, why hold back? You waiting for a period of time could seriously hamper your prospects of maximizing profits off a small or large investment. Imagine investing in Bitcoin when it was first established. The price of one Bitcoin is over 6000 USD in today’s market! People bought pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoins in 2010! Gauge the potential of a project and establish its authenticity.

French based Genesis Supply Chain Platform (GSCP) has identified an industry where few blockchain solutions exist; the trillion dollar aviation industry.  With his aviation supply chain experience, GSCP CEO Maxime Legros has formed a new project — Genesis Supply Chain Aviation (GSC Aviation). His vision will bring blockchain based solutions to the aviation industry to increase safety, efficiency and bring down costs. “I have thought of GSCP, from the very beginning, as a way to create a virtuous circle in the relationship between suppliers and buyers by improving trust and efficiency in processes”  Aircraft accidents due to equipment failure are as high as 22%. Accidents due to human error, a pilot fault or an anomaly in the maintenance represents 57%. One way to minimize accidents is to ensure mechanics have parts that fully meet the requirements of the aeronautical regulatory bodies.

This decision is dictated by an important circumstance — ICO participants and potential investors must understand exactly what is the basis for the release of ICO “AETERNUM”. As mentioned in the original draft of the WHITE PAPER and ROAD MAP, our ICO is issued for the specific development (MVP) of AETERNUM, the Aeternum Crowdfunding platform and the Aeternum Exchange. At present, we have started testing the Aeternum Crowdfunding platform — http://gofundscience.com/en and are completing the work on the Aeternum Exchange. This is a joint launch of these our developments, which fully realize the idea of ”Ecosystem” AETERNUM and SMART COMMUNITY. The release of one APP without the other will be inefficient in terms of the completeness and integrity of the project. Therefore, we made this responsible decision. The new Bounty program will begin on October 1st. We will also announce additional information about this important event later. At present, we are expanding the number of our supporters. In the UK, France, Pakistan, Russia, Brazil, China, there were “ambassadors” AETERNUM “. We are negotiating with other potential participants of our project in different countries. We will expand the community of supporters of the project “AETERNUM”, which is a confirmation of our responsible and real understanding of the situation. At crypto-exchange Coinbe.net Europe Exchange — https://coinbe.net/ the successful distribution of our ALF tokens continues.

Crowdfunding is a heaven-sent for aspiring entrepreneurs and dreamers. Rarely do people get the support they need to unleash their creativity. Crowdfunding provides a unique opportunity to all those looking to unleash their creative juices. All you need to do is a present an idea worth its mettle and if investors deem your idea worth investing in, you will receive financial aid to kick-start its development. Some projects raise millions of dollars while others are not so fortunate.  All this said and done, there are a few crowdfunding platforms that are better than the rest. While Kickstarter and Indiegogo are well-known platforms, newer platforms like GoFundScience is the better solution looking forward. It harmonizes science and welfare and provides deserving scientists, entrepreneurs and project leads with the opportunity to fulfil their dreams, not to mention provide funds to over 1.5 million charities! Here are a few of the best crowdfunding platforms on the market today.  Best Crowdfunding Platforms for Projects and Start-Ups  1. Kickstarter  True to its name, Kickstarter is a fantastic option if you have an amazing project you want to kick-start with the financial push you need. It is the most popular crowdfunding site today and is a household name. Inventions and creative work can be funded on this platform. You have to set a funding target you expect to achieve and you can keep 95% of the funds raised if your goal is reached. Kickstarter keeps 5% of the fund raiser for every successful project. The downside is that you do not receive any funds if your goal is not reached. It is also not the place for helping non-profit organizations.  2. Indiegogo  Indiegogo generally plays second fiddle to Kickstarter. However, it provides for several advantages over Kickstarter. Indiegogo will let you keep your funds even if you not reached your target and will keep 9% of the funds raised. For every successful project, Indiegogo will keep 4% of the raised funds. You can also buy funded products in the marketplace of the platform. This allows successful projects to have another source of potential income.  3. CircleUp  CircleUp helps entrepreneurs raise money for their emerging brands. CircleUp has helped over 200 entrepreneurs since its launch in 2011. Talk about impressive statistics! In order to apply, companies must exhibit a revenue of at least 1 million USD. Some promising companies are allowed to apply if they have a revenue of 500,000 USD. The investors have deep knowledge and experience in consumer brands and retail and provide support and strategy based guidance to the start-ups affiliated to the platform. Of course, as is the case with most crowdfunding platforms, CircleUp takes a percentage of the funds raised as commission.  Best Crowdfunding Platforms for Artists  1. RocketHub  RocketHub bridges the gap between artists and buyers. You no longer need to meet one hundred people to get your paintings, songs or photographs launched. RocketHub is a fantastic Launchpad for creative artists the world over. You must set a funding goal you expect to reach and you are charged 4% of the funds raised if you are successful. If you do not reach you target, you are allowed to keep the raised funds and you are charged 8% of the profits reaped.  2. Patreon  Patreon is a popular crowdfunding platform that sets itself apart with a subscription based model. It provides immense support to creative ventures and artists. Long gone are the days when people had to run from one person to the other to get their songs or paintings funded and distributed. Patreon provides for an easier alternative. You can also provide exclusive content to patrons subscribed to your venture through the site itself. A fee is charged per project, but overall, its system is pretty decent.  Best Crowdfunding Platforms for a Social Cause  1. Razoo  Razoo focuses on raising money for social causes. They have a dedicated section for raising money for non-profit projects as well. They have raised a lot of money for thousands of worthy causes. Its fundraisers are divided into four categories: Foundations, Corporations, Individuals and Non-Profits. Compared to other crowdfunding platforms, Razoo charges a minimal service fee. Razoo charges just 2.9% of the total funds raised for cause or project.  2. Crowdrise  Crowdrise is another honourable crowdfunding platform. It specializes on dealing with worldly issues rather than raising money for creative individuals. They fund arts, cultures, diseases, religion, education and animal welfare. It is one of the best platforms to help raise money for charity. You can also raise money for personal causes like birthday parties, college projects and weddings. The downside is their fee. They charge a fee of 4.95% for every fund raising cause along with a separate transaction fee.  3. GoFundMe  GoFundMe has nothing to do with any fancy project, start-up or artist. You can set up campaigns to raise money for a cause or for yourself. If your campaign gathers enough steam or manages to catch the eye of the public, you can raise funds. They charge 5% of the funds raised from the total amount.  Best Crowdfunding Platform Overall  GoFundScience  Why does GoFundScience Stands Out?  Our mission is to empower people to unite around ideas that matter to them and make those ideas come to life. Aeternum is the world’s first science and intellectual property driven ICO.

We intend on empowering these start-ups with the financial push they need. Our goal is to create a platform which will allow individuals the world over with the opportunity to invest in the intellectual property rights of scientists around the world.  While IPOs presented a viable option a few years ago, ICOs are the norm of today. Crowdfunding is our instrument of investment. We intend on maximizing the value of the investment pool and giving our affiliated start-ups with the financial push they deserve. Our investors can invest in the offered pool and cannot choose an individual project to invest in. Aeternum users have voting powers though, and will be able to vote for projects we should invest in first. All projects will be screened to determine their viability and credibility in the long run. We also plan on raising money for over 1.5 million charities with personal fundraisers, events, races and corporate philanthropy.  The use of blockchain technology will ensure full transparency of investments made. Smart contracts will ensure that all qualified partners have their say in reviewing and approving applicants that want to contribute to and join the ecosystem.

Here is how you can invest in the Aeternum Fund:  BitLats is a new cryptocurrency, backed by science-based start-ups and their intellectual property.

They promise a great deal through the dimensions of their project but fail to stand by them. While this frugal behaviour should be weeded out by government officials in the respective countries of origination of the project, there is a lack of regulation with respect to blockchain as of now. Countries like Japan, China and Venezuela are clamping down rules and regulations to ensure fair practise. The President of the United States, Donald Trump, recently announced the creation of a team in the United States to investigate cases of fraud and weed out scammers.  ICOS need to be regulated while other trustworthy ICOs deserve a Governmental backing. If the whitepaper, roadmap, project direction and ICO team are good, the project is good to go.

An Easy to Follow Guide  If you are reading this, you are well versed with the hype surrounding blockchain. Well, what exactly is it?  What is Blockchain Technology?  Blockchain technology is a revelation of sorts. It has provided for a much needed revolution in the systems of record. Its nature has got imaginations running wild! They are essentially distributed ledger systems. What makes it stand out is the fact that its database is not centralized. It is divided into several parts that are stored in an innumerable number of places. Blockchain environments are not a single point of failure. Each transaction is written into this ledger to ensure no manipulation takes place. Blockchain technology eliminates the need for a middleman to sign transactions. The brightest minds in the industry are working towards incorporating blockchain into their systems and making a difference. Why do we need it though, and how can we use it?  The First Cryptocurrency  The first blockchain technology was invented by a person called Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Not much is known about this individual as Satoshi left around the time Bitcoin started garnering fame and acclaim. The value of Bitcoin has fallen a great degree and it is now worth around 30% of the value it reached towards the end of last year (20,000 USD in 2017). One of the biggest problems the Bitcoin network is suffering from is scalability. To put it into perspective, payment processors like MasterCard and VISA can handle a staggering 8,000 transactions per second! In comparison Bitcoin can handle a measly 10 transactions per second. Double spending, 51% attacks and selfish mining procedures do the network no good as well.  Why Do We Need Blockchain Technology?  Rather than question its need, we should embrace its significance and adapt to the changing times! As each blockchain environment operates on a single ledger, each transaction has a single version of truth. Too many cooks spoil the broth. Similarly, multiple ledgers are troublesome and do no good. While privacy and scalability concerns prevail in blockchain systems, the future holds us in great stead.  1. Distributed Systems  Blockchain environments work as a system of record. There is a single ledger and each transaction is written into that ledger.  2. Permissioned Access  Confidential information is only shared on a need-to-know basis. Each member in a network has his/her own access rights.  3. A Secured Consensus  A secured consensus is required of each member in a network. Each transaction is permanently written into the public ledger and no one can delete this.  4. Elimination of Inefficiencies  The beauty of blockchain environments is the constant desire for change. Redundant systems are eradicated and all inefficiencies in old business models are eliminated.  How Can We Use Blockchain Systems?  Watch the movie “The Founder” if you are looking for inspiration to start a new business or make use of existing ideas. Blockchain systems can find their application everywhere! Get your thinking hat on and look for a business opportunity you can model around a blockchain environment. Blockchain has the potential to change the very face of how businesses are modelled.  1. Blockchains eliminate the need for a middleman. All transactions are between two parties. You can earn money through your business without having to worry about a middleman. All you need to do is channel your interests and find a suitable buyer or investor.  2. Blockchain environments are completely public. No transaction can be re-written. Information can be extended but never appended. This provides complete integrity for all parties involved.  3. While everyone is raving about cloud technology, blockchain is the next big thing! Cloud systems may not be fast or secure enough to handle large amounts of information. Blockchain provides for the security we seek. Newer generation blockchain environments are working towards providing ultimate privacy while older technologies like Ethereum are implementing new methods like sharding.  4. Blockchain systems can validate any piece of information. While cloud may suffice the same purpose, implementing a blockchain structure to let’s say, a voting procedure or proof of intellectual property is safer bet!  Governmental Stance  As there is no regulatory committee to govern the actions of blockchain environments, several manipulations and scams have taken place. Users must be careful when choosing an exchange to buy from or a wallet to store their coins in. Donald Trump, the President of the United States recently assigned a task force with the intention of investigating the pervasive fraud existing within the cryptocurrency scope of the country. We need regulations to ensure this gift is not misused and its use flourishes. Blockchain environments have the potential to represent the change we seek!",False

World’s First Science and Intellectual Property driven ICO!  The Simple Reason Why Now is the Best Time to Invest  Every market has its set of ups and downs. Bitcoin is the best example of a bearish market. People choose to invest in the coin when its value is down, optimistic of a rise in its value in time to coin. The value of Bitcoin was 20,000 USD in December, 2017. It is now floundering just above 6,000 USD. Now let us imagine you invested in Bitcoin when its value was 0.008 USD on the 17th of May, 2010. If you invested 1 USD in Bitcoin back then, you would have received 125 Bitcoins. In today’s market, 125 Bitcoins is worth a cool 811,250 USD. This puts into perspective how important it is to invest early. You need not invest a large sum of money when the stakes are low. The possibility of reaping profits is high in the near future and that is all it should take to make you invest in a crypto coin of your liking. Conduct a due diligence on a project and invest in it when you are confident of its potential. Aeternum is a coin you must consider investing in.  Do Not Look Beyond GoFundScience: The Best Crowdfunding Platform!  While crowdfunding platforms come in many shapes and size, all render a pale complexion when compared to GoFundScience. Crowdfunding in a unique proposition. Interested investors can invest in projects, artists or entrepreneurs and allow them to chase their dreams. Getting a financial push is all these people need and crowdfunding serves their purpose. GoFundScience goes a step further and serves science. You can now get your start-ups and projects the funding they need to develop to progress. GoFundScience also donates a portion of its proceedings to over 1.5 million charities around the world! All this has been made possible through the Aeternum Fund!  Now is the Best Time to Invest in Aeternum!  Our mission is to empower people to unite around ideas that matter to them and make those ideas come to life. Aeternum is the world’s first science and intellectual property driven ICO. The centrepiece of our ecosystem consists of deep science projects and start-ups in the fields of financial technology, biotechnology, nanotechnology, information technology and artificial intelligence. We intend on empowering these start-ups with the financial push they need. Our goal is to create a platform which will allow individuals the world over with the opportunity to invest in the intellectual property rights of scientists around the world.  While IPOs presented a viable option a few years ago, ICOs are the norm of today. Crowdfunding is our instrument of investment. We intend on maximizing the value of the investment pool and giving our affiliated start-ups with the financial push they deserve. Our investors can invest in the offered pool and cannot choose an individual project to invest in. Aeternum users have voting powers though, and will be able to vote for projects we should invest in first. All projects will be screened to determine their viability and credibility in the long run. We also plan on raising money for over 1.5 million charities with personal fundraisers, events, races and corporate philanthropy.  The use of blockchain technology will ensure full transparency of investments made. Smart contracts will ensure that all qualified partners have their say in reviewing and approving applicants that want to contribute to and join the ecosystem. You can also sell your membership via our affiliated exchange, or at our finance application as our token serves as a proof of membership to the Aeternum Fund. Here is how you can invest in the Aeternum Fund:  BitLats is a new cryptocurrency, backed by science-based start-ups and their intellectual property.

What’s next?  The first specialized platform for DEEP SCIENCE, the development of IMPACT INVESTMENT and the “Digital Economy”  The creation of the “ecosystem” AETERNUM now not only involves development in all possible directions, but also passes to practical implementation. Each direction is specified and supplemented by specific projects and the emergence of new “ecosystem” partners puts specific tasks for several professional groups. Let us dwell in more detail on the components of the ecosystem that we want to develop further after the successful ICO in September. The AETERNUM project consists of the following subsystems:  AETERNUM EXCHANGE  It is a platform and mobile application developed by the participants of the eco-system and allows the exchange of crypto-currency and fiat money for ALF. The exchange takes place around the clock and 7 days a week. The exchange operation itself is instantaneous at the current exchange rate. Through this platform, the eco-system is linked to external finances, exchanges and other financial agents. The platform is one of the important elements of the “eco-system” and can be supplemented with other applications that allow to carry out exchange operations, including with various financial instruments (shares, bonds, futures, options, etc.)  AETERNUM SCIENCE  This platform allows to offer participants of the “eco-system” various “start-ups”, which are selected by LAN experts for investment. “Start-ups” are represented in the form of legal entities — companies and are regulated by special investment programs, which underline IMPACT INVESTMENT grounds for participating in projects. The selection of “start-ups” is carried out in close contact with the “Reactor of Commercialization” and involves the participation of other innovative teams that can represent their “start-ups” on the platform  AETERNUM SCIENCÉ. AETERNUM TECHNOLOGY  This direction offers search, analysis and proposal for the “eco-system” of new technologies in various areas of development — computer, trade, service, communication, industrial, social, educational, urban, etc. New technologies form the “Bank of AETERNUM Technologies”, which, due to constant monitoring, are replenished and undergo internal expertise. The main task of this unit is to keep abreast of the main technological trends, including in IMPACT INVESNMENT, and to select new technologies for the “eco-system”.  In the future — this project is being developed in AETERNUM TEHNO-PARK  AETERNUM SMART CITY  This direction is central to the development of the “eco-system”. The construction of SMART CITY is a form of materializing the ideas and values of the “eco-system”. The priority direction of development is the creation of a fair concept of “imputed (guaranteed) income” and the construction of digital forms of organization of life and activities of participants in the “eco-system”. In this direction, digital technologies for assessing the quality of management (“voit-koin”) and introducing the “value of participants” system are being developed and implemented. A special development of the SMART CITY concept is required, including the involvement of working groups that are developing similar projects (Singapore, London, Moscow, Toronto, etc.)  AETERNUM SMART UNIVERSITY  This project allows you to inform, explain and explain the details of the AETERNUM project from the very beginning. Performs an exceptionally important function — the formation of participants in the “eco-system” and the search for the most suitable people and specialists for the project. It is supposed to launch Internet-training in all directions of “digital transformation” in the shortest possible time. Training is suggested to be carried out by ALF tokens — in order to implement an important function of tokens from the very beginning — act as a means of exchange among participants in the “eco-system”. The programs of “Internet education” are extremely open and public in nature and are designed for all comers. An important function of SMART UNIVERSITY (SU) is to popularize the project and attract new ideas and people to the project. SMART UNIVERSITY — develops new projects for the “eco-system”, brings ideas to the project level and prepares people to participate in projects.  AETERNUM SMART COMMUNITY  This project is aimed at forming a special community AETERNUM, in which all the advantages of the “eco-system” are realized in the most vital and concrete situations — trade, service, organization of life, raising children, caring for the elderly, etc. In this community, the main means of exchange is the ALF token. Formation of the community — in itself is a special task. This community can include existing groups in different areas and interests. The readiness of people to open communication, cooperation and implementation of the “win-win” strategy should be especially sensitive for this project. It is especially difficult to form a community in a situation of total disbelief and a crisis in the economy. However, it is the new type of community, based on trust and adoption of the “digital transformation” that allows to assert with confidence — that the creation of AETERNUM SMART COMMUNITY — will be a powerful impetus for the development of the entire “eco-system”  AETERNUM SMART FINANCE  This direction of development of the “eco-system” is aimed at ensuring internal payments and exchanges within the AETERNUM SMART COMMUNITY. This is a special project in which the viability of the ALF tokens will be tested and the possibility of implementing the next stage — the introduction of the BITLATS crypto currency. An extremely important stage of the project development. It requires detailed study and preparation. This is the next stage in the development of the entire “eco-system”. It requires a very serious and detailed legal support for this direction — the creation of a special law (LAW)  AETERNUM SMART GOVERNANCE  The system of Organization, Management and Management will be a prerequisite for the viability of the “eco-system”. The preparation of this switchgear unit is an important stage in the launch of an integrated “eco-system”. For a workable ERP system, it is necessary to train people who would see the integrity of the “eco-system”, they were able to analyze the situation and identify problems, make decisions and take into account both external and internal factors. A special direction of this block is the special work on the construction of the project of the future and its implementation. Special requirements for people working in this area, require the launch of a special education management system in SMART UNIVERSITY",False

Particularly fast there will be cardinal changes in connection with the ""digital transformation"". These changes will affect basic life, production and organizational technologies, public administration systems and, most importantly, require new staff qualifications and the willingness of decision makers to make changes.  But first let us dwell on the peculiarities of the current situation, which must be taken into account: 1. The requirements for the speed of decision-making are growing - plans become obsolete at the time of their writing, and the management system is still focused on the speed of the twentieth century: the full cycle from adopting a strategy to the moment of all the documents required for its implementation of a lower level may take several years. The arrival of new generations leads to a change in public consciousness - for the new generation, ""online life"" and getting services, solving their tasks through the use of mobile applications are habitual. 2. The ""belief"" of the economy grows (use of ""blocking"" technologies) - the elimination of intermediaries, the transition to direct transactions between the citizen and the state, the supplier and consumer of goods / services, between different legal entities and individuals. Thanks to the wide introduction of modern information systems, the speed and accuracy of interaction among all participants in the system of state relations is radically changing and accelerating. New technologies - Internet, cloud technologies, distributed registry, ""smart contracts"", artificial intelligence, large data (BIG DATA) - radically change management models, and modern information technologies become the basis for growth and growth of whole global markets, the main feature, the transition from linear technological chains to multilateral partners on the basis of new principles of the international division of labor and network organization. 3. To improve the competitiveness of the economy, a new quality of the management system is vitally important. It can be achieved only with the transition to new models of process and data management. And this requires a completely different class of managers (LPR). 4. As a result, ""digital transformation"" minimizes the human factor, accompanying corruption and mistakes, automation, collection of management (statistical, tax and other) reporting, will provide objective decision-making based on analysis of the real situation and modern technologies. Its open interfaces to a wide variety of interactions, including independent ways to increase access to system management (for example, citizens with the state) by creating their own applications running on this platform. 5. The problem of the language of communication with management structures is solved in the usual way. 6. Qualitatively changed the decision-making process - in isolation from the slow ""human-dependent"" collection and processing of data from various decision-making sources in large degrees, fast, system, system, reliable and reliable data and ""human-independent"" algorithms, including artificial intelligence .   ""What is needed to understand the modern technological level of"" digital transformation ""should accurately represent the main directions, possibilities and results of this global process. For clarity of understanding, further we will reveal the main directions of the transformation - ""WHAT will be transformed"" and ""HOW there will be a spin"".

First of all we want to thank everyone for the amazing support in our ICO development.  In less than 12 hours we received more than 5000 airdrop applications successfully reaching our set target. Thanks to your active support we became the fastest growing Telegram group on the day of Airdrop campaign.  As the response activity was far greater than we expected and we received more than intended 5000 applications we have decided that we will issue tokens to everyone that filled out the Airdrop form properly while it was still active and followed the rules of Airdrop.  As the result the total amount of tokens that will be issued to Airdrop participants is 8'515'000 ALF tokens.
