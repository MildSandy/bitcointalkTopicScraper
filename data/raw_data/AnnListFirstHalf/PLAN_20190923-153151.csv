What is Loan feature?  Loan feature at Plancoin could be a completely new trend. This feature will help minimize the risk of facing the big loss of the money they invest. It will also increase the daily trading volume on the Exchanges and help increase the PLAN price.  In general, Loan feature at Plancoin are referred to as margin trading, which is a way to use your BTC or ETH to borrow PLAN directly from the Plancoin website and then trade for profit. It is also a form of “leverage” to help Plancoin develope.  Loan instructions:  Step 1: To start borrowing PLAN, you firstly need to deposit BTC or ETH. The BTC, ETH and PLAN exchange rates will be updated in real time.  Step 2: To apply BTC or ETH deposit to borrow the corresponding PLAN number.  Step 3: You will get PLAN immediately! The fee of borrowing PLAN will be announced in the control panel at Loans and Loans history section. This fee is charged at a normal PLAN of 0.4% per day. You must borrow a minimum of 3 days, and you must pay a fee plus the PLAN you borrowed before the end of the loan period to receive a deposit of BTC or ETH. If the time ends, you don’t pay PLAN, you will not be able to get back the deposit, and then this forces you to own the PLAN.  Why do I have to pay fee for borrowing PLAN?  Normally, any users owning the PLAN can perform staking to get daily interest, so it forces us to charge a fee on the total PLAN you borrow each day. This fee is equivalent to % of staking. In addition, fee collection also increases daily trading volume causing increase PLAN’s value. (Fee of borrowing PLAN may be reduced over time depending on the degree of difficulty or % of profits from daily Staking)  Example: If you make 1 BTC deposit to borrow PLAN within 5 days and the PLAN rate at that time is $ 1.2 / PLAN, then you will receive 7424.675 PLAN. When the loan expires, you need to pay 7424.675 + 2% of fee = 7573.1685 PLAN to receive a deposit.  If you have made a loan, but you didn’t want to trade, or you were experiencing some other problems, you would need to get back the initial deposit. Firstly, you need to withdraw PLAN from the website wallet to wallets on the operating systems to start staking and get daily interest, then about 5 days, you can withdraw the PLAN back to the website wallet to refund the PLAN and get back BTC or ETH that you deposit.  https://medium.com/@plancoin/loan-feature-f4c2d2b1cf66",False

For instance, you buy PLAN at this time at $ 0.5 / with 2000 PLAN = $1000. We make a strong marketing campaign, when the PLAN increases to X10, you make Lending. 2000 PLAN x $5 = $10,000.  You will receive a lending rate of $ 600 per month, and after two months it is $ 1200. At this time, you have got the original amount. At that time, you can keep the PLAN to receive interest or sell 2000 PLAN to get $10,000.  In particular, PLAN is very little in the market, even not many people own PLAN. This is a good thing when everyone keeps PLAN to help PLAN increase the price and create scarity for buyers.  We also have to inform you that anyone who sells PLAN 10% lower than the price we list on the website, they have to wait 2 months to get back your BTC or ETH at the internal exchange.  2: Strong marketing campaign on Facebook: Anyone who creates a group to discuss about Plancoin will receive bonuses by BTC or ETH. This amount is deducted from the % profit from Plancoin. For example: 10%.  10% of profit is paid once a month or 2 times (10% will be divided equally to the total number of groups in the market). You just need to prove that you are the owner of that group. These groups definitely have to have people discussing about our project, and the more people discuss, the more you will get BTC or ETH. ( We limit only 40 groups to get bonuses. )",False

Lending will bring you daily profit as well as monthly profit. And the profit from the package you made the lending will be converted into BTC, ETH or PLAN. Then, you can withdraw this profit to your wallet.  At the end of the lending, you will receive USD automatically transferred to the PLAN at the price at that time. For example, if you have 2000 PLAN and you make Lending, PLAN will be converted to $ 2400 at the price of $ 1.2 and after the Lending ends, when the price of Plancoin is $ 2, you will receive 1200 PLAN, and if you continue lending, 1200 PLAN will be x for $ 2 and converted to $ 2400.
