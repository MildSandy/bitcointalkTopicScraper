We plan first ETO to be 7-8 digits, more than 1 mio, from a well established company with solid product, team and user base  Ok so between 1 and 99 million thats a bit vague i was more hoping for an answer if it --in all likelihood-- will be below the 12 mill that you collected (so new investors can join) or at or above. Than the first ETO is more the first investors  and i don´t have to stress to much to get in then its more the 2nd ETO or so...  But i understand if you can not tell.

End-to-end asset tokenization and issuance. 🚀🚀,"   Well i really like this project. But it would be nice if your lawyer could answer shortly 2 questions. Because in the Whitepaper and with your answer here you (as a company) always dance around 2 questions.  1. What classification under the german laws do you guys hope for how the ETOs (not Neumark) of the companies that you plan to fund will be treated from Bafin? As ""Finanzinstrumente"" (financial instruments is a legal term in germany), ""Wertpapiere"" (securities) or what else and under which of the many laws do you *want* to be classified (WpHG, WpPG, VermAnlG)? What would be your goal?  2. In your whitepaper you write that you plan enabling trading of the ETO tokens on your patform. So what kind of license do you think you require from Bafin to do this? No law essay just an answer whether you think you are ""multi lateral trading platform"" (thats a legal term in germany) or a fully fledged Exchange? A LOT depends on those things.  The Bafin starting with the end of last year has issued a series of some sometimes quite severe warnings: the Nov statement is a especially worrisome for this project:   Therefore, undertakings and persons that arrange the acquisition of tokens, sell or purchase tokens on a commercial basis, or operate secondary market platforms on which tokens are traded are generally required to obtain authorisation from BaFin in advance. source:https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/EN/Fachartikel/2017/fa_bj_1711_ICO_en.html  so the Bafin states that BEFORE you launch the platform you need to have a permission from Bafin.  When are you planning to apply for this license? I could not find ANYTHING on the web that you have applied. How long do you think it will take to get the license? Do you think you can start with the ETOs this year, or do you think it will take longer?  The statement then continues:   If BaFin receives information indicating dealings which might be prohibited, it investigates them and, where necessary, intervenes by administrative means. Independently of this, trading without the required authorisation is punishable by law and the law enforcement authorities are responsible for the prosecution of such criminal offences.  So to sum up you really need your permission before you can start your platform. And therefore you need to think about as what you want to be seen (legally).  And the End of the statement sounds like they literally address Neufund, which is no wonder, since you guys have a lot of attention here (which is good!):   Therefore, commercial offerors of token sales and operators of brokerage platforms in Germany also face substantial risks   I talked to some people here in the last 2 weeks and more and more people are getting worried about this. Since you never covered this in the right way giving a clear answer what you try to achieve It started with the Whitepaper having just 1 Sentence about it: ""Equity tokens are deemed securites under German law"" ( I think you used the word ""securities"" here in a lax way and it would be much better i you weren't treated as securities)  And the Bafin is getting more and more active in the recent weeks sending more and more warnings, some serious in tone. And i think that is what is behind the falling prices...The radiosilence regarding a real outlook is getting awkward. After the recent ""Hinweisschreiben"" from Bafin it is clear that this is not going away from alone or solve itself!!  Could your lawyer just write 2-3 sentences about what you guys hope to get classified for? Your laywer looks very good, is invested in the company (which is good). I am sure he has some substantial thoughts about this. And i think this project needs some public support from the communityto go through, to many projects have been killed by the Bafin. so it would be good if you could give some ""Amunition"" to do so.  You would absolutely lose nothing by giving your outlook of how you feel this issues should be treated, instead of the same old answer with yes we have a lawyer and everything is fine...  After 3 months this is getting a bit worrisome...",False

End-to-end asset tokenization and issuance. 🚀🚀,"Of course we can respond to your questions. Please find responses from our lawyers below in the text.     We expect that equity tokens are qualified as Finanzinstrumente (financial instruments), but not as securities (Wertpapiere). Instead we believe that equity tokens in the current structure are Vermögensanlagen (investment assets). In this case the offering would be subject to the German Banking Act (KWG) and the Investment Asset Act (VermAnlG).  Quote 2. In your whitepaper you write that you plan enabling trading of the ETO tokens on your patform. So what kind of license do you think you require from Bafin to do this? No law essay just an answer whether you think you are ""multi lateral trading platform"" (thats a legal term in germany) or a fully fledged Exchange? A LOT depends on those things.  Currently, we are not planning to enable trading of equity token on our platform. We are focusing strictly on primary market. We plan to organize secondary trading with our partners. However, we think that any platform that allows trading of tokens - regardless whether equity, utility or currency tokens - requires a license as a financial institute (not as a bank).    Quote The Bafin starting with the end of last year has issued a series of some sometimes quite severe warnings: the Nov statement is a especially worrisome for this project:  Quote Therefore, undertakings and persons that arrange the acquisition of tokens, sell or purchase tokens on a commercial basis, or operate secondary market platforms on which tokens are traded are generally required to obtain authorisation from BaFin in advance. source:https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/EN/Fachartikel/2017/fa_bj_1711_ICO_en.html  so the Bafin states that BEFORE you launch the platform you need to have a permission from Bafin.

Do you think you can start with the ETOs this year, or do you think it will take longer?  We are in discussion with Bafin about this and are in ongoing conversations which exact license is required for the platform in the type and form we are intending to run it. We are confident that we will be able to launch ETOs as planned.  Quote If BaFin receives information indicating dealings which might be prohibited, it investigates them and, where necessary, intervenes by administrative means. Independently of this, trading without the required authorisation is punishable by law and the law enforcement authorities are responsible for the prosecution of such criminal offences.  So to sum up you really need your permission before you can start your platform. And therefore you need to think about as what you want to be seen (legally).  We believe that equity tokens are investment assets (as above). Offering those will be similar to crowdfunding and is exempted from the requirement of a permission as a financial institute. However, we are in discussion with Bafin to get this view confirmed. Since the inception, Neufund’s mission has been to bring the Blockchain fundraising out of the regulatory grey zone, and enabling a fully compliant Blockchain-based investment process. For the protection of investors and companies and, last but not least, our platform will be launched only in a fully compliant setup and framework.  As you can also see from yesterdays European Commission meeting (http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-18-1242_en.htm) where France and Germany already issued common letter on cryptocurrency understanding everything is heading in the anticipated direction. Setting regulations and directions for the future development is all in progress and that's why there is a lot of uncertainty.

One more question about this. Lets say the Bafin says the ETOs are securities, how difficult /what problems would this cause? I googled this a bit and read in the law/statements from Bafin and i must say it doesn´t even sound that bad if it would be a security and you would be classified as ""Finanzdienstleistungsunternehmen"" (financial service enterprise). For examplef the minimum capital requirement to be an ""Investment bank"" (""Wertpapierhandelsbank"") was a staggering LOW number of unbelievable 730.000€. You might need 2 CEO´s with experience in banking tho. For companies that are in the placement business the minimum capital requirement is just 50.000€ - what is basically nothing.  And since your Fifth Force GmbH raised 12 Mill. euro and is backed by Private Equity giant KKR, you have good access to capital. I was really surprised how undramatic this all sounded.  Am i overlooking something, or why is it from your perspective important/or better if the classification is ""Finanzinstrumente"" over securities?",False

End-to-end asset tokenization and issuance. 🚀🚀,"   The answer is a bit “legal”. Securities and Finanzinstrumente is not necessarily something different. Actually, securities (Wertpapiere) are a subcategory from financial instruments (Finanzinstrumente). Investment Assets (Vermögensanlagen) are a further subcategory from financial instruments. Hence, we do not mind if equity tokens are classified as financial instruments, we even advocate this. The issue is not so much the license to obtain, the issue is more that securites come with a lot of other obligations. Many of those we also do not mind, anything that is related to prospectus, publishing information etc. we even very much favor as we stand for transparency and compliance. But one requirement blockchain cannot fulfill and that is a required connection to Clearstream which is the central settlement agency for any transfer and trade of securities. Not only would it contradict the basic philosophy of blockchain of being decentralised, but it would also not be technologically possible.  One more thing - 12Mil Euro was not raised by Fifth Force. It's a capital which still belongs to investors to further use on the platform (it was just commited in the smart contract). Fifth Force is in any way in control to commited funds.",False

Try to meet regulatory demand as far as possible. And the for last 20%, trust that regulators will have a friendly look on this. They did with crowdfunding and i think they will with tokens.

Say no to this BS hyping and keep building this up in a calm and collected way. This project has enough potential and does not need hyping.  For the people here always asking for ""PUMP IT MORE BRO"" a little story from my experience of the potential of this idea: I was 18 when the ""german Nasdaq"" (""Neuer Markt"" ~ New Market) launched. I remember it well how it started and it became a HUGE success in 2 years. I was immediateley hooked, even started managing funds for other people. I never had a summer of 69 but i sure had my summer of `99 there was an unbelievable energy and optimism. Companies from all over the world wanted to get listed here. 2,5 years after the segment startet they had around 120 companies with a total worth of 56 billion market cap (imagine you get a 2% cut of this) 3 years later at the All-time-High they had over 200 companies listed with total worth over 230 Billion €. Larger than the GDP of many countries. This project reminds me a lot of the New Market, its even better in many ways.... (earlier financing, first mover advantage, new technology with clear advantages, creating an new asset class...)  Not that you guys would need it but there are 2 lessons one can take away from the cometic rise (and fall) of the new market:  If the first 2 emissions are a homerun there is no holding back, segments that provide capital to new promising technologies tend to explode in unbelievable ways.. The first Company that got listed on the Neuer Markt was Mobilcom. If i remember it correctly they trippled in the first month or so. After that the ball got really rolling: Investors flocking in in hordes, companies would ""chopp of an arm"" to get in (on a side note the 3%/2% fee is nothing, companies would pay 9%/4% in an blink of an eye if they see that they raise large amounts of capital quickly), first germany, than it spread over europe, than companies even from overseas wanted to get a listing. Why did it end? Well the quality of the companies that got a listing detoriated over time tremendously. Scam artits entering the scene, false bookkeeping, market manipulation. Some of the CEO's got prison for this . It was a huge shock for the public, that the CEOs that were treated as rockstars, now sitting in court sounding like total idiots (The CEO of ""Comroad"" got inglouriously famous because he could not explaing in court what ""Sales"" are), and going to prison later. The public image of the New Market got so bad the ""Deutsche Börse"" (German Exchange) had to close the segment and rebrand the index to ""TecDax"".  So what to take from this: Imho quality does matter. Hype can make anything a giant for a short period of time, but in the end only quality passes the test of time...  O.K. i got a bit carried away with memories - i hope it wasn't boring for anybody.  To sum it up: I must say my point of view on this project has quite changed from ""yeah hell of a potential, but how to make this legal"", to ""damn i really should have gotten in this earlier at ICBM time""  Everybody have a good one!",False

End-to-end asset tokenization and issuance. 🚀🚀,"@panor: could you or somebody else shortly answer those 3 questions, since i want to participate now, so that i can mentally mark this done for me. Thx.  First question would be on which communication channel will you communicate first when the plattform opens for investors (i mean the ones that come after the ICBM like me). I am usually quite busy and need a secure mechanism to remind me when this thing launches. This thread here? Reddit any other option better`?  in the whitepaper it states:   Lets say gina locks up during the ICBM funds worth 1000€. The first ETO of the SUPER CORP she likes so much that she wants to invest more than the 1000€ she deployed originally, it is still 1 week till the launch of the ETO, so she decides to send another 1000€ to her account.   Tim who has not participatd in the ICBM sends his funds the same day but many hours earlier then Gina.  Now the question: For the first 1000€ of Gina´s account the case is clear she has participated with them in the ETO, so she gets served before Tim (first look right). But what about the 1000€ she deployed later who gets the ETO´s shares first Tim or Gina? The question boils down to whether only the funds originally deployed have a first look right or the person participating can refund unlimited and those funds still have first look right. Which from my perspective would be really sad because than it probably makes no sense to invest as a ""latercomer"" (aka ""me"") So lets say the first ETO successfull, Gina invested her 1000€ in the SUPER CORP. Now comes the 2nd ETO the EVEN BETTER CORP. She likes it so she sends another 1000€ and bids for the 2nd ETO. Does this 2nd batch still have first look rights or is she processed in the qeue of investors who didn´t partake in the ICBM on a first come first served basis like everybody else. Or to put it another way do investors that partake for e.g. 1000€ in the ICBM have a lifetime first look right to invest 1000€ in every ETO there is (given that they ""reload"" the capital every time) or is it only the original capital that partook in the ICBM that has firstlook rights ? Then againg i don´t need to bother with NEU to long since the first 12mill have ""unbeatable"" adavantage  thx! And good luck with everything...",False

Quote in the whitepaper it states: Quote Funds locked during the ICBM gain priority access to company ETOs, so investment tickets acquired for those funds will be executed before tickets coming from the general public ( first look right ).

No ""new money"" is whitelisted and it does not matter who holds the funds - ""old investors""'s ""new money"" is not privileged in any way (in other words we give first look right to funds not people). Please also note that whitelisted ""old money"" will not receive new NEU for the investment. They already got them during ICBM. They are still incentivised or to skip whitelist or do add new money later to get more NEU.  You are right that having unlimited whitelist would discourage new investors from coming.  Considering this (long time ago) we had same conclusions as you are. I'm sorry for the confusion, when talking here with Panor we indeed used ""forever whitelisted"" but this means ""forever for icbm funds - until you spend them"" not ""forever for certain investors"". It's like communication in aviation, we constantly improve how we talk about platform but sometimes some inconsistency slips in",False

Fundraising in an unregulated manner when everybody is trying to say that they release utility tokens can't stand. Neufund stands that it's a kind of security (depending on jurisdiction there might be different classification) if you use tokens for funding of the company (which was exactly said in the latest Swiss regulatory publication). It doesn't matter if your token has a utility function or not.  Tokens that Neufund platform will create are by design regulated and classified in form of securities. Companies that will fundraise on the Neufund platform will have to file a prospectus (which type depends on the funding schema). Normally it's a hard process but that's the point where we have a predefined forms and templates and it becomes fast and fairly easy. Neufund never tried to avoid regulations but to comply with them from the very start.  So to make the long story short - this was anticipated for a long time and we believe that the future is with the Equity Tokens.,False

Sorry, english isn´t my native language.  1. i particapate the ICBM an transfer 10 ETH and in return i get approx. 9100 NEU. 2. Alltogether 18200 NEU getting created, 9100 into my wallet, 9100 into the plattform wallet (Company Fifth Force , Platformoperator) 3. ICBM ends, NEU tokens are transferable, maybe secondary markets are open to trade NEU tokens     My internal account has 10ETH and 9100 NEU 4. within the next 18 Months it will be possible to invest the 10ETH in companies and in exchange i will get companie tokens ( additionally new NEU tokens will    be created and distributed within the community and to fifth Force )    meanwhile my NEU are not affected from this action ( or are they accected in any way for example by getting burnt ) 5. If i do not want to spend all my ETH to invest i can get them back with sending NEU Tokens to the contract and have to pay a 10% fee. 6. After 18 months i can get back ETH without paying a fee of 10%.  Questions : 1. after 18 months am i forced to withdraw or invest ? 2. after 18 months will i get new issued NEU tokens even if i did not invest anything and leave my ETH untouched ? 3. What happens if all NEU are created ( 1.500.000.000 ) 4. Whats the reason anyone should buy NEU tokens on secondary market ?     i can´t see it. Neu tokens are used to pay dividends to investors and covering cost of running the platform by Fifth Force.     Where is a demand for all this tokens which have the goal to create income for holders.     Where is a benefit for potential buyers ?

End-to-end asset tokenization and issuance. 🚀🚀,"   1. After 18 months you can still do whatever you want. You can still keep your money in the contract, withdraw or invest in ETO 2. When platform starts you get NEU only during the investment. ICBM is the only moment when you get them during the commit process. If you invest after 18months ETH that you commit during ICBM you are not getting NEU for the second time. If you put more ETH when platform is operational then you will get NEU for this new money. 3. After max NEU are created there will be no more NEU issied. You will be able to get them only on secondary market. You will be getting tokens from companies you invest into, but not anymore NEU. 4. NEU tokens are giving you coownership of the platform. This way you are able to participate in fees from the platform and get additional stream of revenue. NEU are not covering costs of Fifth Force currently. We are financed with VCs and Angel investors. We also hold NEU as at the end this is our only stream of revenue. Since there is a limited amount of NEU to be generated (1.5B) after the supply is maxed out the only way you can co-own the platform is through purchasing the token on the secondary market. When more and more ETOs will be performed on the platform this token will have bigger demand and less of the tokens will be created, so it will be harder to get. Besides that you can also invest on the platform but not want to be a NEU holder in this case you have the fully freedom to sell it on the secondary market. It allows us to create a motivated investors network who believe in the platform. On one hand you are co-owner of a platform, on the other hand you also start earning by holding NEU tokens so this token is giving you actual value.",False

We have also a very strong position in non-crypto media.  Our goal is to build a legitimate and strong network of investors who are fully committed to the vision of the platform and herewith investing in companies on the platform. So, we do not aim to ride on a hype and collect any kind of funds from e.g. speculators but mostly from serious and conscious investors.

Here is the status, devs from the team will elaborate on some other interesting stuff below.  1. we deployed extensive smart contract system with a code base on par with other big Ethereum projects like Aragon and Melonport. where we pushed forward is testing: we have 1 test per 7 lines of code and some tests are really elaborate: for example simulating whole ICO process with 1000s of participants. there are 430 tests, and I feel we did our engineering properly 2. there are a few interesting coding patterns for Solidity, we also want to propose extension of ERC20 token standard that we want to use to distribute revenues from NEU and equity tokens 3. we had to totally push forward the toolset. it simply didn't work properly with our code base and number of tests we have. that includes truffle (we have own mod), solidity-coverage (many bugfixes around large number of LOC tracked), solium (solidity linter) 4. our smart contracts are paired with legal agreements that are generated from on-chain data. this protects our investors' rights both on-chain and off-chain. Here is nice summary of what we deployed with links to github, etherscan and description of code base and tests  https://blog.neufund.org/tech-update-neufund-icbm-smart-contracts-are-deployed-and-ready-f27695e7fcaf  5. there is a nice D-APP at https://precommit.neufund.org that allows you to directly participate in the ICBM via any web3 injected wallet, Nano Ledger S or external wallet. We had to develop our own support to Nano Ledger S, smart contract ABI to typescript converter etc.  6. as there are no tools to monitor smart contracts now in a proper way, we developed our own (and it is open source) basically we decode all transactions and log events and pushes it to greylog. it is so simple but extremely useful.  https://blog.neufund.org/keep-your-private-keys-close-and-keep-your-smart-contracts-closer-introducing-the-smart-contract-e3bd1fcad204  Some interesting deployments are also coming tomorrow (for example to https://icomonitor.io).

Most important fact: If Neufund will show that it's possible to put real company with solid revenues and solid growth as a token then it will start a wave of private companies doing ICO instead of IPO - that will mean massive liquidity gains and access for more early stage companies - so skilled investor can invest in things like uber or spotify before IPO",False

Is the money stored in a smart contract and will the re-payment happen automatically?  Your money is stored in smart contract and company doesn't have access to it. Thats the beauty of smart contracts written correctly. It won't happen automatically as smart contracts do not work on their own and every action has to be initiated from outside but thats technical detail. Even if company and employees do not exist after 18months you can use method on contract and it will send you your money back. You don't have to do it through company dApp (website) you can use any ethereum client and it will cost just dollar or two in gas.,False
