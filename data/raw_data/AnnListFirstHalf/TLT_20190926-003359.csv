Some more detailed informations, and answers to your questions: TALENTER.io is revolutionizing the service market and is a unique solution to create new markets. However, TALENTER does not only redefine the service but also organize it with an unprecedented efficiency.  Smart contract and TALENTER app fully automates the processing of service orders, billing and payment. In fact, just one button is required for service ordering, billing and payment. After this, neither the purchaser nor the provider has to take care of the payment process.  But that's not all: If a service is not provided, payment will be automatically denied. On the other hand, if the service has been provided, paying is garanteed. Both service providers and contractors are on the safe side!  Payment and billing are already regulated in Smart-Contract (blockchain technology). The payment is triggered by a combination of codes and calendar data provided by the TALENTER smartphone app and the TALENTER bracelet.  TALENTER revolutionises the working world worldwide and frees millions of people from the fetters of traditional professional categories. Talenter counteracts the increasing automation and the associated release of labor with the opening up and organization of new services that can not be foreseen in their diversity.  Not only personal talent, but also the blockchain currency TALENTER, in short TLT, will be a sure guarantor of success. All offers, bookings and transactions as well as the service are shown in the TALENTER-Blockchain and the corresponding smartcontracts.  TALENTER (TLT) is a fully tradable cryptocurrency that allows access to any type of service and course. From low-specialized services such as lawn mowing or dishwashing to highly qualified services like Translation or wood carving.  Together with reliable blockchain technology, this new and open working world will succeede on all continents. It offers flexibility, freedom and the chance of prosperity to an unprecedented degree.  TALENTER knows no gender, no skin color, neither thick or thin. TALENTER becomes worlds first service currency!

In a way, it´s also a labor exchange. But even more. Tomorrow‘s working world is a world where we do something because we want to do it. And yet it will also remain the world in which we look for recognition and earn income to fulfill our desires. Self-realisation becomes more easily possible, but making a living remains important. Talenter.io is the platform for this.  Much faster than everyone thinks, the artificial intelligence will do all the jobs. And we really mean ALL(!) jobs. Doctor, truck drivers, pilots, managers, Tax Consultants, Lawyers, Authorities-employees, Officials and even CEOs. AI is always more efficient, faster and always makes the right decisions.  In this way, the AI replaces us in just a few years and takes away what constitutes ""humanity"": To be used. This creates a unique need and a gigantic business. This profound social change has been our concern for a long time. We have found a solution: Talenter.io  Talenter.io is a platform that functions completely independently of banks. We have recognised the problem and this is indeed a core problem of society for freedom and self-determination. However the genius blockchain - and what Talenter. io does with it - provides the solution. Every user gets his own Talenter account, with which he can offer and buy his services. This is even possible anonymously.  Of course, tax regulations must be complied with. Talenter.io, and anyone who offers their services and generates income from it must of course do so within the fiscal framework in which they live. In a further step, however, we can well imagine that we will also help everyone to meet the requirements of the authorities. We have already discussed this matter.  A new world order for the distribution of tasks between people is needed. Soluted by Talenter.io. Supported by You.  We need every helping hand to give this great idea to the world.
