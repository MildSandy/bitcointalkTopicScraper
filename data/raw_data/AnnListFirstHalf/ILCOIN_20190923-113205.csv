Sometimes people don’t like to reveal themselves fully, especially if they are involved in the creation of something groundbreaking. But if we are talking about cryptocurrencies, then there’s another critical factor – decentralization.  If you are creating a technology that must be decentralized, then ideally the company shouldn’t be public at all, because otherwise, this fact creates unbearable risks of third-party influence that can easily harm a technology. With this motive in mind, a group of people has decided to create a unique cryptocurrency called ILCoin back in 2015 that is slowly paving its path to becoming the bitcoin alternative.  ILCoin is managed by an executive director Norbert Goffa, a professional who is very experienced in sales and marketing. Also, he plays the role of an official ILCoin’s representative, who is responsible for the project’s business and strategic development. He helps the team to drive the project, cooperatively taking important decisions with them on technological development and strategy.

And near-future quantum computing mass-adoption may dramatically increase those potential damages which will be accounted to billions of dollars. There was no working solution to this devastating problem, until now.       The certificate from Palo Alto Networks Partner that the innovative C2P (command chain protocol) has successfully passed a cyber security audit, which confirmed 51% attack and quantum resistance. The certificate from Palo Alto Networks Partner that the innovative C2P (command chain protocol) has successfully passed a cyber security audit, which confirmed 51% attack and quantum resistance. More      A team of professional developers from ILCoin project are on a mission to end any possibility of quantum 51% attacks in this industry. Recently, their innovative C2P(Command Chain Protocol) has successfully passed the cybersecurity audit, which has confirmed the quantum resistance. ILCoin's Executive Manager, Norbert Goffa has expressed his thoughts on this matter:       ""It is very hard to overcome the possibility of a 51% attack in PoW algorithm. So, we needed to rethink everything from the bottom up. We knew that the blockchain itself needed to be significantly improved so we could reach our goal. We wanted to create a unique technology that had never been made before, but at the same time, not over-complicated yet very functional. The solution is simple, elegant, and secure.""       Palo Alto Networks Partner was testing the C2P technology 4 weeks in a row in a desire to take enough time to find any possible vulnerabilities. During this period, their team has run tests on 51% attack, Fork Attack with a Rollback Attack, Design Flaw Type Attacks which directly affect smart contract's functionality. Considering the fact that quantum technology is capable of taking over many existing consensus protocols, all tests have shown that the C2P protocol successfully eliminates all risks associated with quantum computing 51% attacks.       ""We tried several blockchain attack techniques, but none of them have worked. Due to C2P, ILCoin's blockchain is resistant to 51% and quantum computing attacks, and it's definitely incredible. We claim this and prove it. Even an infinite amount of hash power is useless to form an attack,"" states Peter Boros, General Manager at EURODIGITAL, an official partner to Palo Alto Networks.       The ILCoin's consensus protocol has resolved the problem associated with 51% quantum computing attacks. It's first in its kind and creators are planning to enter confidently into the market providing cutting-edge blockchain technology.       Further details about the certification can be found on the project's website and through the dev team in their Telegram channel.      ILCOIN Development Team",False

Now, let’s discuss a few ways to keep that investment secure. You can never fully trust online security with your money. We are living in a technological age. Perhaps the security is near flawless, but even your own computer can betray you. Anything from cookies, keyloggers, or maybe even an unintentional click could land you in some hot water. For purposes of this article, let’s assume your computer is safe to use (no malware to steal your data and you have a good firewall/antivirus).  The thing you must always remember is this: It can be convenient, or it can be secure. Convenience and security are complete opposites. If it is easy for you, it is going to be easy for anyone who wants to steal FROM you. It may be convenient to store all of your passwords in one file stored on your desktop, but it will also be easy to retrieve all of your passwords if a hacker put forth the effort to get just a single file. Remember, convenience is not secure.  The first step to financial security is always going to be Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). I know. It’s an absolute pain… but a necessary pain. 2FA is when you have a second, completely unrelated, account somewhere else that is tethered to your primary account for confirmation of changes made. The next article will be written regarding 2FA.  Another piece of sound advice: Don’t keep money on exchanges. People are losing millions and millions keeping money on exchanges that become hacked. I can hear the rebuttal now. “But if I don’t keep the money on the exchange, I have to pay the transaction fee twice and wait twice as long to make a transaction because of the mining confirmations.” Convenience is not secure. Keep a small amount you could potentially stand to lose on the exchange. The majority of your money should be kept on a wallet that is offline, or at the very least, not related to the any exchange; such as our ILCoin web wallet. Send increments to the exchange’s wallet when you need to recharge it a little.  Never share your private key. I know this one sounds obvious, but you’d be surprised how much this occurs. I wouldn’t even give a back up of my private key to my wife. Why, you ask? You know the importance of that key, but she may not. Also, keep your finances stored on different devices within different wallets. “But then I can’t see how much I have in total. Or I will have to make many different transactions from many different wallets on many different devices to make different purchases!” Convenience is not secure.  Use a hardware wallet or another cold storage option. Keeping your money connected to the internet at all times keeps your money connected to potential hackers at all times. If your money can not be transferred electronically without first connecting a device physically to your computer, you are eliminating a huge possibility for anyone to steal your hard-earned assets. Only someone there in the flesh could be a potential threat. This is where you store your investments; the cryptocurrency you plan on saving and watching grow.  One more piece of advice: Don’t click on Google Ads. Google Ads are usually the first search result at the top of the list in a search utilizing the Google Search Engine. They are paid ads that are disguised as search results ensuring they will appear at the beginning. Most people believe that the search results are in order of relevance, and the ads take advantage of this fact. Convenience is not secure. Double-check the URL of any search result before accessing the web site. It could be linked to a site that installs malware just by visiting the domain. In fact, don’t click on anything that you aren’t specifically using or aren’t sure where it goes to. This includes banner ads, search results, and other kinds of re-direct hypertext links.",False

Let’s look at an example:  Email 1 is used to create an exchange account. Email 2 is set for 2FA. Every time a change is made to the exchange account email 1 was used for, a message is sent to email 2 requiring extra action to confirm the change was intentional. Changes could be sending coins, purchasing coins, logging in, logging in from another IP address, or a variety of other reasons; usually 2FA is configurable.  The trick to making a secure 2FA account is to combine 3 different elements: knowledge (something only you know), possession (something only you have), and inheritance (something only you are). A smartphone (possession) that unlocks using your fingerprint (inheritance) and utilizes an application that gives a random 2FA code (knowledge only the person observing the phone will have) can combine all three of these factors.  Practically any type of account can be tethered to the account requiring two-factor authentication. In fact, the further derived the secondary confirmation account is from resembling the primary account, the better. It is more secure to have a mobile application for 2FA if the primary account is connected to an email and vice versa.  However, there is a dark side to this security. If you have been reading all of the other posts, by now you will know that convenience is not secure. Be forewarned that making an account too secure may cause it to become an inconvenience. You should investigate the recovery process for a 2FA-secured account before doing business with the exchange. If you lose your smartphone (or it becomes otherwise inaccessible through theft, destruction, or other means) and the only 2FA tether is by means of an application within said device, you may have a difficult time convincing the exchange that you are the owner of those cryptos contained within their exchange.",False

Those tokens are only good for attractions at that particular fair and are non-transferable for the fair in the next state. They are not worth anything at the nearby theme park nor are they valid at the subway. They serve one purpose and one purpose only at a single location.  In most situations, you cannot even return the tokens you did not use for a refund of your money. You could, however, sell the tokens you did not use to another buyer. The buyer should be well aware that they are only worth something at that event and their value is not translatable to anything else outside that location.  Using this example, we can see that the currency has value even without the token; it may be used in many places. The token only has value in a specific place, but that value is totally dependent on the value of the local currency. With this in mind, you can easily see the difference between cryptocurrency and tokens. Many times, even on cryptocurrency exchange applications, the difference erased and the terms are used interchangeably.",False

The blocks of a cryptocurrency are encrypted (hence the name cryptocurrency). To overcome that encryption and forge the block, which also produces new coins, a certain amount of processing power must be applied. This processing power is called the hash rate. The difficulty of the block is called the hash. The hash adjusts automatically after a certain number of blocks have been forged depending on how much hash rate is applied to solve the hash of the blocks. The amount of hash rate needed to solve the hash of a block is called the mining difficulty.  As more miners want to mine a cryptocurrency, more computers are connected to the mining node causing an increased hash rate to be applied to solving the blocks. This causes the blocks to be solved very quickly, but also causes the mining difficulty to increase accordingly when it adjusts automatically. As mining difficulty rises, the value of the cryptocurrency needs to rise at the same time so miners can retain the same value for their hashing power. If the value doesn’t raise, miners begin to gain less and less money mining the same cryptocurrency with the same hashing power.  What does this mean for you? Nothing! You use only ILCoin, remember? Sit back and relax: The ILCoin Development Team takes care of this for you because we do not share mining privileges. This is for your information only.

If you look online, you will find a bunch of information that will tell you, “Yes, you should invest in an ICO.” Websites will just give you the positive aspects of investing in an ICO without telling you the risks involved. Then, perhaps they will even go on to give you a short list of ICOs they recommend. ICOs are like any investment risk; you may lose. Whenever looking at an investment of any kind, you always want to look for the ideal standard: Low Risk, High Return of Investment. Even if you were to find a potential investment opportunity that appeared to be in such pristine circumstances, there are still other factors to consider.  Underfunding can, for obvious reasons, cause you investment to become a poor one. If underfunding is extreme, the project will fail. However, there is a hidden benefit to underfunding; if the ICO is successful, less people will receive the tokens which (if the tokens are interchangeable) could drive up the price in the marketplace as few people will possess them. This rarity is the core principle behind the cryptocurrency Unobtainium.  Overfunding can be a bad thing also. An ICO that is too successful could have the opposite effect and could potentially cause the value of each token or coin to reduce as the market could be flooded with everyone wanting to trade massive quantities of a token everyone already owns.  Fraud, while not quite as prevalent in today’s ICO market, is still a factor. Will the company I want to invest my money in complete their end of the deal once the ICO is over?

Through private-key cryptography, the miners are able to assure that the amount sent is from a wallet that approves the transaction. If this process wasn’t included in the transfer, anyone could send coins from your wallet to another wallet just by knowing your public key (wallet address). For this checking process, the mining fee is charged. It is more than a fair trade for keeping your investment safe and making sure no one is spending your hard-earned cryptocurrency.  Most services that receive cryptocurrency as payment require a certain number of verifications before they consider the cryptocurrency to be securely transferred. This is because for every verification, a block has been mined. If a transaction has 6 verifications, 5 blocks have passed after the block that contained the transaction. This assures that the block that contains the transaction wasn’t soft-forked and orphaned (see our post “Forking Cryptos”).",False

When, in reality, they participate in a pyramid scheme on a daily basis; it just works differently than they are taught. I can’t speak for anyone else, but when I was growing up, I was taught that you go to work and you get paid for doing so: That’s how the world works. …And it does work, to a certain extent. However, there is one catch. Time is a limited resource.  Money works like a pyramid; it starts at the top and flows down to everyone else. In fact, there’s a pyramid on the dollar itself. That’s the irony of it. Printed money is more of a pyramid scheme than cryptocurrency. The money is minted at the top of the pyramid by central banks and then slowly trickles down to everyone else. The problem being, it is well-filtered many times before you receive any. In fact, the only reason you have any money at all is because you had to labour for it or take out a loan (not including illegal methods such as theft).  Think of economics as you would any game in life. You want to maximize the advantages for your team. Those who control the flow of money do nothing different; maximizing the advantages for those on their team and keeping it for as long as possible. This is why every economic system of the world has distributed money from the top down. This means most of the money never really leaves the top. Since money is power and power is an advantage in the game, no one wants to willingly give it up. Today, the richest 1% of the world’s population own more than half of the world’s wealth.  I’m not suggesting a solution. Up until now, this is how life has been and is currently. Don’t believe in the allusion of fiat currency being any more fair than a cryptocurrency.",False

That depends on the cryptocurrency you want to use.  Matt Weinberger wanted to purchase $1 USD from a Bitcoin ATM in Las Vegas, United States of America. (2) After putting $11 USD into the ATM, he was told it still wasn’t sufficient enough to process the transaction. Due to the value of Bitcoin, the mining/transaction fee was about $40 – $45 USD at the time. Because Matt Weinberger wasn’t familiar enough with cryptocurrency, it caused him a bit a grief and a loss of $11 USD.  A commonly parroted phrase within the cryptocurrency community is that Satoshi Nakamoto intended for Bitcoin to be “a fast, secure and inexpensive means of making payments without using the traditional financial system.” Although not entirely true, I can understand where the basis for this assumption comes from considering the original Bitcoin whitepaper states “The cost of mediation [of third parties] increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions.” (3)  This would have been feasible to digest when Bitcoin was around the $100 USD value for each coin. Now, with the value soaring above $10,000, it doesn’t seem likely that Bitcoin can fill the niche for which it was created. ILCoin, while not yet distributed through ATMs, could be the perfect solution for filling every day transactions with mining/transaction fees averaging in the factions of a US Cent.

In a traditional economy, the governing body prints bills so that people have money. In currencies like ILCoin and Bitcoin, it is necessary to mine them to obtain them (SHA 256, POW). To do this, miners use a special software that solves complex operations and, in return, they are compensated with some cryptocurrency. This is the reward from mining (the block reward) and what causes more people to want to mine the currency.  But it is not as easy as it sounds. Each time a block is forged, the mathematical difficulty of a block’s encryption increases. A PC or laptop - like the one you have in your house - doesn´t have the necessary power to mine cryptocurrencies for long. That´s why miners use special devices for this process. Avalon Miner, Antminer, or Ebit Miner are example names of special mining equipment. These devices produce a lot of hashing power and require a lot of electricity to work; making them expensive to maintain.  This is the reason why cloud mining emerged. Cloud mining is the process of mining Bitcoin, or any other alternative cryptocurrency, utilizing a remote datacenter with shared processing power between any number of individual computing devices. This type of cloud mining enables users to mine Bitcoins or alternative cryptocurrencies without managing the hardware. In most circumstances, the mining rigs are housed and maintained in a facility owned by a company specializing in mining and cloud mining.  Types of Cloud Mining  In general, there are three forms of remote mining available at the moment:  •   Hosted Mining Lease a mining machine that is hosted by the provider.  •   Virtual Hosted Mining Create a (general purpose) virtual private server and install your own mining software.   •   Leased Hashing Power Lease an amount of hashing power without having a dedicated, physical or virtual computer. (This is the most popular method)  What are the benefits?

In times past, the US Dollar was a commodity money; meaning, it had a physical backing of gold. If you wanted, you could even decide to exchange the currency for actual gold. Since about 1971, the US government stopped this policy due to the fact that, when times are tough, people horde valuable resources. If your currency is backed by a precious resource, such as with commodity currencies, the flow of economy slows drastically as people don’t want to let go of their money.  Since the 1970’s, the US Dollar has been a fiat currency. As mentioned in the first sentence, it is backed by the value of the issuing party and the trust that it is worth something; not its worth in gold or silver. Since the Federal Reserve has more flexibility to control supply and demand of currency, it is more able to limit the impact of major economic shocks, such as the financial crisis of 2008-2009. It's fair to argue that the Federal Reserve's efforts to limit the impact of economic crisis could have unforeseen long-term effects, based on the additional money that has been put in circulation, versus a gold or silver standard that limits how much money circulates. However, using a commodity standard has historically had a much worse, opposite effect during crisis as people horde it. So long as the government can keep the balance of supply and demand stable, fiat currency is the better choice between the two.  As cryptocurrency enthusiasts, we can take key factors away from this information. Cryptocurrency is much like fiat currency in that its value is backed by the issuing party and the trust in its users that it is worth something. It has yet to been determined whether its limited supply is a strength or a weakness in comparison to its fiat relative. In the beginning, ILCoin was backed by gold; following the golden standard. Now, it has severed that bond and has its own independent value and is backed by its community, development, and development team. We strive to make ILCoin revolutionary.

How can you tell if it’s worth your time/money? The market cap of cryptocurrency as a whole has grown in the past year; it now stands at over 400 billion dollars. As that cap grows, the number of scammers has grown with it. More and more people are falling victim to cryptocurrency scams due to the amount of crypto newbies that are just getting started the cryptocurrency world. As such, it is difficult to decide which cryptocurrency or token is a good investment.  The internet is full of people who believe they know a scam coin when they see one. Do some quick searching and you will see that when it comes to scams, everyone is an expert. There are even people who say every cryptocurrency is a scam, and they won’t buy anything unless it is with cold, hard cash. At the time of writing this article, there are over 1500 cryptocurrencies listed on coinmarketcap.com and not even ILCoin (it’s a conspiracy) is one of them. While it isn’t always clear which are scams and which are true cryptocurrencies, it is fair to say there are a few general guidelines which you should always take into consideration.  Company name changes are a huge red flag. Some developers/development teams change their company or product name to accommodate for the latest news trend. ILCoin, in the past, was a commodity currency. Hey, it seemed like the right thing to do in a time when cryptocurrencies didn’t have anything backing them except someone’s promise that it was real. However, even though we have since-then changed our policy, earned an independent value, and undergone an internal shift in managerial structure, that doesn’t mean we change our name. ILCoin bought two years ago sold by ilgamos is still the same ILCoin today.  When a company spends more on its public relations (PR) and marketing than it does on its development, you need to watch out. This is the kind of cryptocurrency that will have a website to sell you the crypto but will not even have a wallet online; much less an offline, mobile, or desktop wallet. ILCoin isn’t very widely publicized. While a heavy dose of PR is in our plans, we firmly believe that the development should be sound first. What would we promote? Promises? It is better we boast about our developmental achievements.  Any time the investment strategy of a token or cryptocurrency heavily promotes recruiting your friends/family and promises to reward you for doing so, beware. There’s nothing wrong with a company wanting you to share the information about the company with the people you know. Word-of-mouth advertising is an incredibly effective way to spread news of your product. When you get guaranteed rewards for recruiting, that’s when it smells of trouble.  As a developer of ILCoin, this author can testify first-hand how difficult it is for a cryptocurrency exchange market to put attention to your application to become a part of their site. There is an article written on that very subject called “Becoming Part of an Exchange Site.” However, not being part of an open exchange is considered a red flag. This is because the self-proclaimed cryptocurrency may not even have enough back-end development to be compatible with an exchange. An investigation should be undertaken before deciding whether or not you should place your trust in a cryptocurrency with this limitation.  If you cannot find simple information about a company? You may be heading for problems. Without finding a company’s street address or information such as where they registered the blockchain, it would be unwise to become involved financially. Any time basic details are missing, there is a red flag.  Depending on who you speak to, there are TONS of reasons more why you shouldn’t trust a cryptocurrency. Most of those reasons are grey areas and subject to bias. Others, are situationally-based or conditionally-based. For example:  •   Big Premine    -ILCoin is a centralized, decentralized hybrid and we do not allow outside mining. There is an article about it called “De/Centralization.”  •   Owners/Devs have big wallets    -A lot of times, the development teams are early investors in their own work purchasing a lot of their own coin for next to nothing when it is first released. Is it wrong to believe in and invest in your own product?  •   Daily trading volume way bigger than market cap  •   Lack of website, or website down for days  •   Owners/Devs failed at one coin, created another    -Depends on the previous cryptos they were working on. Were they legit or scams themselves?  •   Coin uses same exact source code with same parameters like another coin    -Starting out with a source code that resembles another cryptocurrency isn’t a bad thing. An exact copy of said cryptocurrency probably is, but even ILCoin is based from the code of Bitcoin; highly modified, but based off of Bitcoin.  •   Scam warnings posts being deleted from the forum  •   Invisible team, No project    -Members of our team can be viewed on our website at ilcoincrypto.com. You may notice there are only three shown on the website. Not everyone who wants a job wants to be in the limelight. This author chooses to remain anonymous and go by the title ‘ILCoinDev’ because fame of any type does not suit me.  •   The company professes to be dedicated to a noble, altruistic cause    -There can be great causes out there, but make no mistake: No one works for free without expecting some kind of beneficial outcome. Cryptocurrency is a great idea and has changed how money works, but it is also a business.  •   The company’s operations are located in a foreign country    -It is hard to believe people put this on their list of red flags for a cryptocurrency.

Depending on where you are from on this planet, different gifts are considered acceptable for different occasions. On most of these occasions, money is a completely acceptable, if not impersonal, gift.  Giving the gift of cryptocurrency would be, in this author’s opinion, a step above a monetary gift of another kind; especially if the recipient does not know how to use cryptocurrency. It could spark an interest in them. They may want to learn all about how to use it if not just for the moment so they can convert it into a governmentally issued fiat currency. Even still, this creates more fluidity and daily volume for your preferred cryptocurrency thereby helping to increase its value.  Or it could be that their gift of cryptocurrency suddenly doubles in value; effectively increasing the value of the gift they receive. This could, in turn, also stimulate the recipient to want to invest even more into their account. Watching their invested gift grow even further could motivate them to also give cryptocurrency to others. Advertisement by word-of-mouth is one of the most powerful ways to spread information about a product.  Some words of wisdom for those considering giving the gift of cryptocurrency this year:  Don’t give wallets to people you aren’t willing to teach about cryptocurrency. If you give the gift, be prepared to follow through with the learning experience. In the end, we all benefit from more people knowing about cryptocurrency.  Regardless of who you give the cryptocurrency to, place an expiration date on the gift. Tell them they need to transfer the cryptocurrency to another wallet before a certain date. This will ensure they know enough about the money to create a new wallet and make a transfer. This will also ensure that anyone without an interest in the product won’t put to waste perfectly good coins.  How will you prevent the coins from going to waste? Keep back up information (including the expiration date) about each wallet you give. If by that date they have not completed their end of the gift giving experience, there is a way for you to recover the funds. No, I’m not saying steal from your loved ones. I’m saying some people just don’t have an interest in cryptocurrency. This also helps to prevent a lost wallet if they lose the back up information. Remember, they are newbies just learning how to use cryptocurrency.  This year, share your love for cryptocurrency with your loved ones!",False

While originally designed to be used as an alternative to traditional currencies, we find that a lot of users involved with cryptocurrency do not spend it; instead, holding on to it as a means of investing money similar to the stock market. Investors will purchase them and follow their trends and market value just as they would the items in a stock portfolio. Most cryptocurrency users will utilize cryptocurrency as both an investment and a money; saving a large portion for investment purposes and assigning another portion to be spent freely.  Some cryptocurrencies have seen the investors (not the spenders) as a dilemma. Not that it’s a bad thing to only invest in cryptocurrency, but without contributing to the liquidity of a currency, the overall value and usefulness can be affected significantly. To counter this, some cryptocurrencies have implored added features or gimmicks that promote spending and not saving.  Recently, ILCoin has become a part of the FreiExchange market for cryptocurrencies. Freicoin is their resident currency and has a demurrage fee (1). “Demurrage forces freicoins to circulate at deliberately high rates. Separation of money's roles as store-of-value and medium-of-exchange allows money to flow when it is needed, in good times and bad.” The demurrage fee for Freicoin is a flat 5% yearly fee which is automatically deducted from each currency owner and is used to help reimburse miners.

There are 2.5 billion ILCoin available. Over 80 000 people use ILCoin; mostly residing in Asian countries such as Vietnam and S. Korea. We are looking to expand this audience greatly.  ILCoin Official Website: https://ilcoincrypto.com/  What makes us different?  In a market saturated with forgotten altcoins, ILCoin is always upgrading its source code with the latest technologies and developments to offer users the newest, most secure version of software possible.  The SHA-256 Smart Contract system is in development and will be released sometime in 2018.   Our Blockchain and Consensus Model  ILCoin Blockchain Explorer: https://ilcoinexplorer.com Average Block Time: 6 – 15 minutes We have enough hashing power to make block time much less, but as we will now explain, we choose not to forge blocks necessarily.  ILCoin uses Proof-of-Work consensus, however, we do not open our doors to let anyone mine. Why? By refuting other miners, we eliminate many of the negative aspects of the normal POW model.  Cost Effective – Our closed mining network is what allows ILCoin to ease off of the processing power if few transactions are being made and to amp it up in times of high traffic. More power means more blocks being processed in less time. Even during times of low traffic, our transaction processing time doesn’t average more than 15 minutes. Cost Stability – For that same reason, we do not greedily burn through our mining equipment trying to compete for new blocks and their rewards. Then, take those block rewards and sell them to the highest bidder trying to gain back the money we spent on electricity and equipment maintenance. 51% of What? – One of the biggest debilities of Proof-of-Work is considered the 51% attack. If there are no competing miners, there is no one who can corrupt the Blockchain by using more processing power. Developing and maintaining a cryptocurrency requires a huge investment of time and money. By centralizing the mining, there isn’t a distributed consensus, but to falsify any aspect of a block would be to harm ourselves, our coin, and our investment. Security – One of the biggest disputes of POW vs. POS involves the security of the cryptocurrency. As mentioned above, without a 51% attack, there isn’t a risk of any entity inserting incorrect information into our data. Green POW – As mentioned, we only process transactions with as much mining power as is necessary. This severely lessens our environmental footprint versus other Proof-of-Work communities. We have also been researching the best forms of solar and wind energy for implement in our mining installation and lessen our footprint further.  As you can see, ILCoin uses a Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm but by restricting mining nodes, we make our cryptocurrency secure, cost effective, and stable. In doing so, we are able to take many of the positive aspects of Proof-of-Stake and apply them to our system of forging blocks.  Thanks to the centralized nature of ILCoin mining, developmental work on the blockchain, the wallet and the explorer is a continuous effort kept under tight control. We will be the first blockchain with SHA-256 technology to be able to create Smart Contracts. The ILCoin development team has successfully increased the block size to 200 MB making it possible to execute an almost inﬁnite number of transactions in seconds with virtually no costs or fees. The system is already capable of handling up to 5.9 million transactions per second, and it is compatible with today’s crypto platforms.  ILCoin’s Blockchain is completely anonymous.

The Goal for ILCoin  In an ever-increasing market of cryptocurrencies, what sets the different cryptocurrencies apart (disregarding sales marketing) is the amount of development that goes into each technology. The majority of cryptocurrencies are next-to-forgotten when it comes to developmental and technological improvements. ILCoin is one of the minority of cryptocurrencies that continually improve upon the technology.  ILCoin is being developed into a globally recognised cryptocurrency which will be accepted by tens of thousands of merchants - product and service providers - in different regions and countries at an international level. As ILCoin is supported by a fast-growing number of customers, merchants and investors, its price on open exchanges is set to grow signiﬁcantly.  We have the goal of making ILCoin available all over the world through ATM services. Our intention is to allow small and medium business to trade easily and cost-effectively using our cryptocurrency. The vision is to make ILCoin available to everyone in the world so that they can enjoy privacy and proﬁt from economic opportunities. The foundations of this new economic community have been laid.

What determines the value of a cryptocurrency (or any fiat currency, for that matter)? Supply and demand… it is worth what people are willing to pay for it.  So why use cryptocurrency and not a traditional, physical fiat currency? It has many advantages over traditional money. To name a few:  there are no central banks determining its value and controlling the flow of its creation; countries are not involved in determining a cryptocurrency value so one nation’s economy cannot affect it dramatically; it has the lowest transfer fees which are unaffected by country borders or distance.  There are even many more advantages to having and using cryptocurrency. Like it or not, cryptocurrency is the future of money. What is the disadvantage?

Remember in 2010 when the first pizza purchased with cryptocurrency was bought for 10 000 Bitcoin? That was a major turning point for Bitcoin because everyone who, before that purchase, only saw Bitcoin as being ones and zeros on a computer screen now realized that cryptocurrency could be used.

They were processing more than $2 Billion USD (each!) worth of spends annually before their demise. So how did Bitcoin succeed as a cryptocurrency where e-Gold failed? Money is power. It always has been. The great rulers of the past knew this and, therefore, controlled the money. They only gave permission to themselves to mint the money, gave wages to insert the money into society, then charged taxes to recover the money back into the royal coffers; thereby, maintaining the power and the control of availability of money. When the USA government saw another entity controlling the power of their kingdom, it was time to cut the head off of the snake. E-Gold had four easily-identifiable leaders; it was just a question of finding a believable, legal way to enact a coup.  The USA Patriot Act gave them the answer they were looking for. It required e-Gold to have a state money transmitter license to continue operations. E-Gold did not fit under this new statute. The US government then stretched the definition even further to include any system that allows transfer of any kind of value from one person to another, not merely national currency or cash. Then, they “proceeded to prosecute the USA-based gold systems, e-gold (and later e-Bullion) under the USA Patriot Act for not having money transmitter licenses, even though these companies had previously been cooperating with regulatory authorities.” (1)  And, thus, the head was severed from the body in one fell swoop of USA’s sword. But Bitcoin isn’t a snake; it is a Hydra. Everyone who has a Satoshi or more is the owner of Bitcoin. Where one head is cut off, two more grow back in its place. More and more Hydra are born with the passing of time; ILCoin is one of them. Bitcoin (and all other cryptocurrencies, such as ILCoin) is giving power to people.

The easiest way to describe a Blockchain is to imagine an open ledger (also called a distributed ledger technology). Everyone can view all of the transactions made on the network which the Blockchain resides. As more and more transactions are completed, Blocks are added in a chronological order (chained) as records of those transactions. “Currently, the technology is primarily used to verify transactions, within digital currencies though it is possible to digitize, code and insert practically any document into the blockchain. Doing so creates an indelible record that cannot be changed; furthermore, the record’s authenticity can be verified by the entire community using the blockchain instead of a single centralized authority.” (1)  Actually, the Blockchain is the invention of the 21st century with the most potential thus far. It could be applied with slight differences to be applied to voting systems, registrations, medical and legal records, or ownership certificates for valuables. It is the system on which ILCoin’s Smart Contracts will be built. It will provide an open, transparent way for all parties involved in a Smart Contract’s signing to see the conditions become fulfilled and the contract realized.  “The first blockchain was conceptualized in 2008 by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto.” (2)  (1) https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp  (2) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain",False

There are many services, including ILCoin, that do not require any information from the user to create a wallet and to begin trading. Many cryptocurrency exchanges only require an email and a wallet number to begin trading. If you were to look on a cryptocurrency’s Blockchain, you can see the transactions within each block. Each transaction has a lot of information regarding its involvement within the block it was processed, however none of this information is directly pertaining to the sender or the receiver of a transaction except the wallet addresses (sender and receiver) and the amount sent. Unless someone knows you are the owner of a particular address, it is anyone’s guess as to who the address belongs.  How then, can you keep your transactions private once someone knows your address? The number of addresses you can create is practically infinite (296 possible combinations). You could, if you wished, create a new wallet number for each and every transaction. Or, a simpler method would be to create a wallet for each person with whom you do transactions and/or business. Some wallets, such as the ILCoin QT Wallet or the Bitcoin Armory Wallet can create a new address for you automatically each time you receive or send a transaction.  There is a new technology called “bulletproofs” being released that can be implemented into the Blockchain’s code that allows all normal Blockchain information to be viewed except for the amounts being transferred.

Once all of the coins are mined, no more coins may be produced and the computers that once mined simply produce “phantom” blocks with just the transactions but without new coins. The more well developed a cryptocurrency becomes, the sweeter the taste its coins will have.  This is why ILCoin dedicates as much effort as is possible into its development.

Requires many physical computers and a lot of processing power to decipher the encrypted block to forge the Blockchain. Arguably less corruptible.  -Proof-of-Stake (POS) – “Centralized.” Requires much less resources since you only need to own the coins to ‘stake’ your mine. More price stability due to miners not selling coins. Arguably more secure.  ILCoin uses Proof-of-Work consensus, however, we do not open our doors to let anyone mine. Why? By refuting other miners, we eliminate many of the negative aspects of the normal PoW model.  -Cost Effective – Our closed mining network is what allows ILCoin to ease off of the processing power if few transactions are being made and to amp it up in times of high traffic. More power means more blocks being processed in less time. Even during times of low traffic, our transaction processing time doesn’t average more than 15 minutes. -Cost Stability – For that same reason, we do not greedily burn through our mining equipment trying to compete for new blocks and their rewards. Then, take those block rewards and sell them to the highest bidder trying to gain back the money we spent on electricity and equipment maintenance. -51% of What? – One of the biggest debilities of Proof-of-Work is considered the 51% attack. If there are no competing miners, there is no one who can corrupt the Blockchain by using more processing power. Developing and maintaining a cryptocurrency requires a huge investment of time and money. By centralizing the mining, there isn’t a distributed consensus, but to falsify any aspect of a block would be to harm ourselves, our coin, and our investment. -Security – One of the biggest disputes of POW vs. POS involves the security of the cryptocurrency. As mentioned above, without a 51% attack, there isn’t a risk of any entity inserting incorrect information into our data.  As you can see, ILCoin uses a Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm but by restricting mining nodes, we make our cryptocurrency secure, cost effective, and stable. In doing so, we are able to take many of the positive aspects of Proof-of-Stake and apply them to our system of forging blocks.",False

The scaling problem is explained simply as: Bitcoin wasn’t designed for so many transactions per minute.  Each transaction consists of important data such as: the sender, the recipient, the amount of Bitcoins being transferred, etc. That data takes some space, which is quite insignificant when talking about a single transaction; however, it adds up when there are hundreds of transactions taking place every minute. The signing of a transaction essentially confirms that the person sending an amount has that amount to send and is, indeed, the person who owns that quantity of cryptocurrency.  The SegWit solution has two parts:  -It allows for more SegWit transactions per block because it removes (segregates) the signatures from the block and places it separately following each block -It enables the use of a “Lightning Network”  The Lightning Network is a second layer to run on top of the base blockchain layer, hypothetically resolving the scaling problem by enabling virtually unlimited numbers of instant, low-fee transactions to occur ""off chain"" on a separate channel. Then, once the channel is closed, the final status of the transactions that occurred through the channel is written on the Blockchain.  As of the writing of this article, the Lightning Network is not in use, but is in developmental stages being tested on the Bitcoin’s Test Network.  There was a “SegWit2x” proposed that would have also increased the size of the blocks on the Blockchain to 2MB; further allowing for more transactions to be processed on each block. It did not receive the voting consensus needed to pass.",False

But what causes a fork and what is it?  When the Blockchain is forging blocks and it finds two blocks that have different information, the Blockchain always chooses the block with the most sequential blocks chained behind it as the correct one; this is where the Blockchain forks. Most forks that occur on the Blockchain are automatically solved in this way. Transactions that occurred on the blocks attached to the shorter chain are dropped off. These transactions are usually stuck at “processing” or “waiting for confirmations” for a few days and then the funds are normally recalculated to their sender’s amount. These are called Orphan Transactions.  A hard fork occurs when a different rule set for a Blockchain is implemented. This has inadvertently created new cryptocurrencies as not all of the users of a cryptocurrency have to be in accordance with this new rule set. Examples of this are Bitcoin Classic (BCH) which forked in 01 August 2017, and Bitcoin Gold (BTG) which forked 24 October 2017. The resulting cryptocurrencies are completely legitimate in their own right; they just follow a different rule set and, because of it, have their own consensual Blockchain network for verifying transactions made by the subsequent cryptocurrency. Essentially, everyone who wishes to change to the new rule set (miners, users, and merchants) will have to upgrade to the new code.  With a soft fork, only the miners have to upgrade to the new code. If they do not, and they have less than 51% of the hashing power to create new blocks, they would eventually be overtaken by the chain fork created under the new rule set standard.",False

Hiding, guarding, placing behind obstruction, and other methods have been solutions to security both in our daily lives and on our computers. For example, you might hide a file inside of a hidden archive. You could guard information using an antivirus or could keep your information behind obstructions such as firewalls.  Knowing what security is in place would help facilitate an entry to such defences. If you know a house has a fence two meters tall, three guard Dobermans, an alarm system with an average police response time of seven minutes, and a heavy grade safe with the information inside, you could better prepare for the task of obtaining access to such a place. The same holds true for internet security.

However, if the combination of characters, symbols, numbers, and letters was known (even without knowing which ones they were) the process to brute force the encryption could be relatively quick. It would be much easier to access a restricted asset if you knew the password had 15 letters, 4 numbers, and 2 characters.  Web application firewalls (malicious script protection), access controls (backdoor protection), bot protection (distinguishing bad bots from good, helpful ones), login protections (two-factor authentication), intrusion protection systems (abnormalities with logins), and secure socket layer (encryption between web server and browser) are all crucial in maintaining a website safe. Most professional websites have all of these and an ace or two up their sleeve. A hacker would want to know exactly which of these products are in place and would prefer to know which service provider is being used.

ILCoin (ILC). Invest in ILCoin.  Thanks for reading.  See you next time.  Ok, ok. In all seriousness, this question deserves a bit more attention. There are several factors that one could look at when judging whether or not to invest in a cryptocurrency; technological advances, market cap, supply and liquidity, network security, usability, ect…  There are so many factors when looking at a cryptocurrency, the answer is always the same assured one:  ‘I don’t know. No one knows.’  If you are considering investing into a cryptocurrency, you should look at the factors mentioned above. Look also at the movements (present and upcoming) that a company isn’t just planning on making, but rather movements towards beginning or completing.

What makes a wallet a wallet? You need at least two crucial parts:  -Public Key: The address of the wallet that allows you to receive cryptocurrency. -Private Key: The secret alphanumeric key that you should never show anyone.  In essence, a ‘paper wallet’ is a back-up of your digital one; thereby allowing you to destroy the digital one without losing any cryptocurrency. Unless something happens to that paper, you should be able to recover your wallet any time using the wallet information on the paper.  Personally, I back up my wallet with many points of information:  -Public Key -Private Key -Brain Wallet Hexadecimal -Recovery Phrase -Wallet URL (If Online)  It is important to consider how you are going to handle/store the information as a paper wallet is, quite literally, usually made of paper. It would be wise to place the paper into a plastic bag to protect it from moisture. Another good idea is to store a couple of copies of the information in different places such as a fireproof safe or with a trusted family member. I keep one of my copies hidden inside of an unostentatious book on my bookshelf.",False

One of the easiest ways to accomplish this is by applying for and becoming part of a cryptocurrency exchange site that is already in existence and operational. This is also a great way to publicize our cryptocurrency as most of these exchange sites already have their own active community. More people who weren’t aware of our cryptocurrency would be able to see it as a potential trading pair. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done. ILCoin is branching out in a big way and I wanted to share with you some of my personal experience with exchange applications.  It is somewhat of an understatement to say there are a LOT of cryptocurrencies circulating; everything from Monkey Project (MONK) to Ammo Reloaded (AMMO) to FuckToken (FUCK) and a whole mass of others. At the time of this article, coinmarketcap.com, alone, has 1400 cryptocurrencies listed. That number increases continually, and every one of those assets are looking for market depth.  This causes exchange sites to become increasingly stricter with which cryptocurrencies they accept. Implementing a cryptocurrency into an exchange takes resources such as time, money, and human effort; all three of which are highly prized in this life. The application process could be anywhere from “Give us a bunch of money and we still won’t guarantee you’ll be added” to “We will perform a complete background investigation and won’t charge you. But if one thing is out of place, forget about it.” Usually, most exchanges fall somewhere in between. That is, if they even respond to your inquiries. With so many inquiries of other cryptocurrencies, many times your inquiries just get lost in the spam folder or among the masses.  While it isn’t easy-going, ILCoin will not give up the struggle to see our cryptocurrency a highly-valued asset in the hearts, minds, and digital wallets of individuals everywhere. We want to see ILCoin in forum publications, chat boxes, exchanges, and eventually ATMs. This year will be a grand year for ILCoin.  You can find ILCoin freely traded in the following places:  -CoinsExchange.io: https://www.coinexchange.io -C-CEX: https://c-cex.com -CrypTrader: https://cryptrader.com/",False
