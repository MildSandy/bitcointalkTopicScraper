Services promised in whitepaper are not yet implemented and probably will never be implemented due effictive management from founders and hired managers. Previous businesses (workle.ru, payqr.ru) from the same founders were not successful and now in freezed mode. I suppose this is due to their management style and competencies and probably much significantly because one of the founder's father's influence (who don't have any competencies and experience in online and crypto business) on all business decisions. The team is not really international: the founders and all managers are russians. Formal CEO, COO, CFO are only a showcase and don't make any decisions. London office doesn't really exists - these a few people are working from home. So the management is russian which reflects on how the company is doing. The company has too few best practices implemented not only in development but in management , too. Micromanagement is the only approach practiced there. They usually don't know what they wand and don't have any agreed position because of constant race for power and political games. As a result there is lack of trust and constant staff turnover - professionals don't want to work there. People are considered as resouces only. The most terrible thing - you can be fired at any time and without any fault from you side. For example, there was a case: managers suddenly decided the need to change technology and bought ""almost ready"" solution with a couple of developers. More than six months development results have been trown as a trash and recently hired developers left without tasks as programming languages has been changed , too. They have been fired without any compensations. Management has a good leverage because of ""gray"" salary. Another details: - Significant part of the salary is ""gray"", not official to be hidden from taxes. - Despite office hours are flexible - you must sit there not less than 9 hrs every day. And it doesn't matter how long your lunch is. - Work from home paid 25% less - Overtimes are usual and not compensated according to the law - Social package is absent - Sick leaves are paid only 50% - You must use spy software in case of work from home Don't recommend to work there",False

Ordered a card on the 15th june and till now no sign of the card.Since 2 weekd been told to remain patient and my card is on the way.  Card was posted on the 25th of june according to telegram group admin.  When i complained the the public i was told to be patient again after 7 weeks.I told them their service was a joke and also another remarks i made was ‘ bla bla bla’ got blocked from the telegram group .  Last friday posted on twitter and was told to contact support by email which i did. Got a response after 10 mins and was told a team of ‘specialists’ was double checking my card order and they will revert back.  To my surprise this morning saw that i was blocked on twitter too.  Since 60 hours no response from the ‘specialist’ .  Crypterium has alwayd been very late from its roadmap. Now i see that they doesnt care about the frustration of their customers and banning people from complaining when they are completely at fault.  Just a reminder that card and postage waid paid . I am not asking for a favor. Treating people like shit is the way to go even in crypto.  Hope some here echoes my voice .  Regards. Ilane",False

How can you judge a project off of it’s price when they set their ICO as per the market values at THAT time?  Their price was set off of the ICO price based off of SAT value. Since then, the ENTIRE altcoin market has shed $600 BILLION. There’s not a single altcoin that launched in late 2017 or early 2018 that is anywhere near it’s dollar price and judging Crypterium on their current USD price is retarded.  Climbing to 194 yesterday from being in the 330’s is great. Holding in the 200-210 area after spending weeks in the 300’s, is great. Holding much larger volume on the exchanges, is great.  Please, pull up ANY ico that launched in December 2017 through March 2018 and show me it being at it’s ICO price or better lol",False

A typical wait time from any package being shipped from Asia, even with Amazon, is typically around a month. Delays in Customs is also a possibility, for any number of reasons. It is not as simple as sending a letter to a friend or family member a few states away.

Feel free to research international shipping at your convenience.  So do we know the exact date it will arrive to your door? No. We do not work for your postal service, DHL, Customs, nor Fed Ex.

Stop looking at specific projects and look at the ENTIRE MARKET.  January   6th, 2018: Crypterium ICO completed. January 17th, 2018: Crypterium's CRPT distributed to holders.  Crypterium's CMC Rank when FIRST tracked on Coinmarketcap: Rank #249 - Market Cap of $35,700,000  If Crypterium beat out 100 projects and was sitting at the #150 rank TODAY, their market cap would be $35,800,000! The price would be $0.41 if they CLIMBED 100 rank positions from the time they released at rank #249 to if they were #150 today. They would have gained ONE HUNDRED SPOTS and BEAT 100 projects, and the price would still be DOWN 70% TODAY - BECAUSE OF THE OVERALL MARKET FIGURES.  Crypterium launched at rank #249. If Crypterium was the #100 coin on coinmarketcap RIGHT NOW - the price would be $0.695 - STILL LESS THAN HALF OF THE ICO PRICE.  Why? Because of the MARKET. That's not Crypterium or the team's fault you imbecile.   January 6th, 2018 - Crypterium ICO completed. So let's use January 6th, 2018 to show how the market is performing and how it's not project's fault.  January 6th, 2018: Total Crypto Market Cap: $816.2 BILLION #100 Ranked Market Cap: $336,972,625  January 6th, 2019 - One Year Later: Total Crypto Market Cap: $138.1 BILLION #100 Ranked Market Cap: $35,765,450 - Down more than TEN TIMES for the SAME RANK!  If Crypterium was the #100 coin when it launched, and it performed AMAZING and HELD it's rank of #100 - the price would be DOWN MORE THAN TEN TIMES just because of the OVERALL MARKET SPREAD!  Lets look at TODAY vs one year ago today:  June 10th, 2018: Total Crypto Market Cap: $297.1 BILLION #100 Ranked Market Cap: $111,373,175 BITCOIN DOMINANCE: 38.7%   June 10th, 2019 - One Year Later: Total Crypto Market Cap: $253.5 BILLION #100 Ranked Market Cap: $60,183,702 - Down DOUBLE BITCOIN DOMINANCE: 55.6%  The overall market today has $40 BILLION LESS THAN ONE YEAR AGO, and BITCOIN'S DOMINANCE is almost 20% HIGHER!!! We have LESS total money in the market and Bitcoin owns 20% MORE OF IT THAN LAST TIME!  How are you not understanding this? Are you brain dead? Are you slow? Are you uneducated? Is that why you're obsessed with the money you lost, because you're poor due to being stupid?  Crypterium is legitimate and will continue growing, continue climbing, and continue producing. The circulating supply NEVER CHANGED - it's been the EXACT SAME SINCE THE WHITE PAPER WAS FIRST PUBLISHED!  To the audience - if you're curious about Crypterium and CRPT, but you have concerns, doubts, or questions due to the constant spamming of FUD by the morons above, feel free to send me a direct/private message. Do not let these broken English, incapable of proper spelling imbeciles discourage you from buying an excellent project. If you're worried about the price performance, do yourself a favor and go to CoinMarketCap and compare today's market price to a year ago, or compare the ICO's completion date to a year later. You'll see that the overall market lost hundreds of billions of dollars and the remaining money dumped ALL alts and went back into Bitcoin for safety - hence why Bitcoin's market dominance is back to all time high's of the past two years.color]  Crypterium's CEO Steven Parker is a well-established leader in the financial sector. Do you think he would risk associating his name and damaging his professional resume by becoming the CEO of a project if he thought there was even a SHRED OF POSSIBILITY that it was a scam? Steven Parker made sure the entire team was legitimate and that ALL funds are in escrow and accounted for before he put his name on the project.color]  Circle is one of the largest cryptocurrency companies on the planet - with a valuation of $3+ billion. They're backed by and invested in by the largest names in global finance (Goldman Sachs, and more). Crypterium had to SEEK Circle's approval to list and support Circle's stable coin - USDC - on the Crypterium app. Circle evaluated Crypterium, did their research, and gave Crypterium permission to do so. Why? Because even Circle see's that Crypterium is legitimate. .[/list][/list][/list]",False

The ENTIRE crypto market is down $600 BILLION since the Crypterium ICO completed! The ENTIRE alt coin market cap as a WHOLE - is down 85% from when crypterium’s ICO finished’  There’s literally only like 6 projects out of the top 300 who’s price is UP since January of 2018 and they’re practically ALL exchange tokens.  Do you realize that if Crypterium actually went 30 ranks BETTER than when when it launched, the price would STILL be heavily down?  Nobody behaves like you. Your ridiculous, spamming, OBSESSION with trying to hurt the team is NOT how a normal person behaves. Every single trader has winners and losers - NONE of them make numerous accounts EVERYWHERE to harass and spam the team EVERY DAY. Your behavior is absolutely insane and shows blatant immaturity and desperation. You clearly gambled with money you couldn’t afford to lose - like a moron.  You bought an ICO at the PEAK of the most significant bull run in the history of crypto! And you’re mad at the team that the price is down?

However, what makes us different is that I’m realistic and understanding. I knew that Crypterium’s goals would take longer than they were hoping - I still spent $380,000 on the ICO.  I’ve been in crypto since late 2010. I’ve seen many companies try and fail to bridge the gap between holding crypto and spending crypto. I’ve seen Visa and others take their time only to refuse to serve as the processor. I’ve seen many have astronomical fees and no support. I’ve seen billion dollar companies take 2-3 years to deliver their first cards. So despite Crypterium's roadmap - I knew these goals would take longer than advertised.  You refuse to acknowledge that all of these features require third party facilitating and support. It’s not Crypterium being late or taking their time - it’s a lot of delays from third party servicers and compliance approvals.  The cards are coming, the roadmap will be attained.",False

Investment attracted: NA  Summary The documentation for the project is elaborate, and we believe that Crypterium may be interesting to the community. Since the project is still finalizing its strategy, we believe that the team should complete the strategy for building a cryptobank and implement measures to attract commercial customers.  RPT tokenholders will be able to receive up to 30% of the profit from Crypterium transactions via a monthly loyalty fund (MLF).     Conclusion The project includes experienced specialists and advisors among its staff. Currently there is an active marketing campaing for the crowdsale. We believe that the project’s theme will be interesting to the community.  Strengths of the project:  The team have chosen an actively developing market area. The project is based on experienced specialists and advisors. The project has sufficient developed documentation, and an MVP is presented. Weaknesses of the project:  There are risks associated with underinvestment in the project, which may prevent the team creating a cryptobank.    Market and industry According to a PWC report:  The volume of transactions in the global market for mobile interest-free payments was estimated at $4.6 billion in 2014, and it is expected that this will exceed $300 billion by 2020, with an increase of 85.9%. QR codes are expected to remain a niche method and will amount to only $9.3 billion of transactions by 2020 with17.9% of 5-year CAGR. Currently the volume of daily transactions in cryptocurrency exceeds $2 billion (Juniper Research). Consequently, the volume of transactions in cryptocurrency with the help of interest-free payments will amount to $130 billion by 2020, an annual growth rate of 16%. According to the white paper:  The volume of global transactions increased by 11.2% during 2014-2015, up to $433 billion. It has been enhanced over the past 24 months by the introduction of mobile contactless payment solutions such as Apple Pay, Alipay, Google Pay, etc. The volume of mobile contactless payments (NFC and QR codes) is expected to increase between 2015-2020, and the annual growth rate (CAGR) will grow by 80%, which will lead to an increase in payments to $4 trillion by 2020. It is estimated that the cryptoeconomy will exceed $3 trillion by 2020, and it could achieve 10% of world GDP by 2022. Processing of transactions for cryptocurrency in respect of goods based on fiat hardly exists. This is the unmet demand for cryptocurrency capitalization, which has already exceeded $150 billion. There are already 3 million people who make daily payments in cryptocurrency; this number is expected to exceed 200 million by 2025 Comments: The white paper presents a market analysis. According to data, the market is developing quickly enough so it is possible to occupy intended market share.  Competitors The following competitors are represented in the white paper:  TenX (http://www.tenx.tech/) - a platform that converts cryptocurrencies into fiat and issues debit cards. Tokencard (http://tokencard.io/) - platform that enables payments, transfers and conversion of currencies. BitcoinTalk identified the following competitors:  Polybius (https://polybius.io/ru/) - cryptocurrency blockchain bank. Everex (https://www.everex.io/) - a platform that enables payments in cryptocurrency and exchange microfinance services. Utrust (https://utrust.io/how-it-works) - platform that enables payments in cryptocurrency, transfers and instant conversion. Other competitors: Rpay, Meridian, Pundi X, Bankex. Summary:  Unlike TenX and Tokencard, Crypterium uses not plastic but virtual cards. In addition, the services of traditional banks (lending) are added, and exchange of currencies within the platform is available.  As for the other competitors, unlike payment systems, Crypterium has added the functions of a regular bank (lending), and unlike banks (Polybius) Crypterium introduced payment for purchases using a virtual card via a mobile application.  Engineering features of the platform The platform is built on blockchain using smart contracts.Crypterium uses NFC HCE protocols to pay tokens from a virtual payment card via a POS terminal.The Crypterium API can display a QR code that can be read by a Crypterium client.  Technical descriptionCrypterium is building Cryptobank 2.0, where people can store, spend, exchange and use almost any crypto or fiat currency. It will be available for download on iOS and Android. There will be an opportunity to make contactless payments via NFC. To assess creditworthiness, a digital identity card will be used from partnerships with leading third parties that provide regulation of KYC and AML and reputation for uPort (a self-service system based on Ethereum, Amazon, etc.).  Crypterium OpenAPI:    CrypteriumSX (Smart eXchange):    Comments: The main feature is the ability to convert directly on the platform (smart exchange) and pay for purchases with a virtual card (NFC).  Technical Roadmap  In the future, with the development of technology and data capacity, it is planned to implement:  - December 2017 - March 2018 - development of the Crypterium mobile bank.  December 2017 - April 2018 - development of an OpenAPI platform. January 2018 - September 2018 - development of Credit protocol, installation of self-regulatory algorithms for token exchange, integration with scoring platforms. March 2018 - June 2018 - launch of cryptocurrency acquisitions, development of Crypterium smart exchange. May 2018 - June 2018 – an Appstore for software based on the OpenAPI.June 2018 - September 2018 - grants for the development of OpenAPI products. June 2018 - September 2018 - grants for the development of OpenAPI products. Comments:  Step-by-step development of the product is presented in the roadmap. The description of all functions to be added is present in the white paper. An MVP is ready (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3ILm8of6Y). The application will be public accessible by the summer of 2018.  It is not clear why a grant is being attracted (in June 2018) for the development of OpenAPI, if the development phase is over in April 2018. According to the roadmap, the team will work on creating a cryptobank from 2018 till 2020 (for more details, see the corresponding section).  Crypterium Products Financial Goals and Corresponding Results:    Comments: According to the plan above, there are risks regarding underinvestment of the project. The underinvestment will prevent Crypterium conducting a strategy for creating a cryptobank. Currently the project does not have an open repository; however, a representative of the project team noted that they will create an account in the near future.  Summary:The project provides a detailed description of the platform and MVP. This speaks of the extensive preparatory work carried out by the project. However, we believe that the team strategy should focus on creating a cryptobank and appropriate technological stages to attract business, rather than attract grants for development. Also, the project strategy has a risk of underinvestment, which can prevent the team creating a cryptobank.     Documentation We have analyzed the Crypterium site and documentation for sufficiency and consistency in order to make an investment decision.  The documentation consists of the white paper, presentation, and privacy policy. The white paper is available in English only. Crypterium is described in sufficient detail in the submitted documents. The main focus is on the platform’s services, the product’s advantages, and the ICO and token characteristics. The project development strategy and strategy for entering the market, however, are not covered in the documentation.  The website also presents information on the project, the public ICO, the team, the partners, distribution of tokens and funds, and the answers to the most frequently asked questions. The site is available in English, Russian, Chinese, Spanish, Japanese and German.  Summary: The documentation gives a full insight into the project.  ICO Tokens to be issued for sale - 70%  Public ICO start: October 31, 2017  Token type: ERC-20  Accepted payments: BTC, ETH, LTC,ETC, DASH, XRP, USDT, Cash, Visa/MasterCard  1 CRPT price: 0.0001 BTC  Crowdsale period: 10 weeks, through January 13, 2018  The CRPT token is a utility token which serves as “fuel” for carrying out transactions, which stimulates the transaction activity and increases the demand for the token; with each client payment carried out through the Crypterium cryptobank, a small charge of 0.5% will be added to the fee, which, in turn, will be automatically used for buying CRPT from the open market and will later be burned. As a result high demand for tokens is expected.  Token Issue Limit: 300,000,000  Advantages for tokenholders: The number of tokens is limited, 30% of income for Crypterium transactions (trading commission) will be used to reward CRPT tokenholders and the most active platform users by means of a distribution of CRPT from the monthly loyalty fund (MLF). The CRPT tokens are divided between existing tokenholders depending on whether they use the Crypterium bank. Filling the MLF also creates constant demand for CRPT tokens. Cash back will also be implemented  Max goal: $47,000,000  Minimum goal: $3,000,000  The token sale is carried out in several stages:    Comments: All unsold and undistributed tokens will be burned, and no additional tokens will be issued.  Bounty program  Distribution Scheme:  The project has reserved 9,000,000 CRPT for the bounty program. The program is active using the following methods:  Bitcointalk signatures — 50% Transfer & Moderation — 25% Media, Videos & Blog posts — 15% Twitter — 10% Summary: The project has already implemented the first wave of the bounty program. All the terms are specified under the link above.  Token and capital distribution Tokens and capital are distributed according to the following scheme:    Summary: Tokens do not affect the distribution of shares in the company. The reward system is set up so that it is more beneficial to buy tokens earlier.     Development plans     Summary:  The project team has compiled a sufficiently detailed roadmap where past achievements and future plans are analyzed.  We believe, however, that apart from the technical aspect, it is necessary to demonstrate a marketing strategy for market entry. This feature of the project is unfortunately not presented.

It NFC processing is such an easy, quick feature to deliver on - how come there’s not one single project in the entire market that’s delivered it yet in the ten years since Bitcoin has been active?  You got Flexa/SPEDN and it has limited use, national restrictions, and required a multi-billion dollar venture capital group and multi-billion dollar exchange to deliver it after THREE YEARS in the making.  But Crypterium was supposed to deliver it in a year - during one of the worst bear markets in the history of crypto - where financial servicers and traditional processing companies halt their crypto-related activity after seeing the entire market tank? Lol.  The team is not selling their fucking tokens and the more you claim so, the more you lose credibility. Tens of thousands of people got in on the ICO for instant profit lol. When they didn’t get the 100% gains after distribution like they expected, they started dumping. That’s crypterium’s fault? Everyone who bought into ICO hype was buying up every single ICO in December and January in hopes of 100-300% instant profits. When Crypterium didn’t yield that result for them, thousands of people dumped who had NEVER had the intention to hold Crypterium more than a few weeks, or months if that.  January 6th, 2018: Crypterium ICO END                        - Total Crypto Market Cap: $818 BILLION January 17th, 2018: CRPT Tokens Distributed                 - Total Crypto Market Cap: $514 BILLION February 17th, 2018: One month after CRPT tokens sent - Total Crypto Market Cap: $504 BILLION March 17th, 2018: Only 8 weeks after CRPT delivered.     - Total Crypto Market Cap: $300 BILLION  January 17th, 2018: Bitcoin Dominance - 36% March 17th, 2018:    Bitcoin Dominance - 44%  When Crypterium ICO ended, the ENTIRE crypto market cap was $818 BILLION. Less than two weeks later - ONLY TWO WEEKS - the entire crypto market dropped almost in HALF. 8 weeks after that, it dropped a total of $518 BILLION and MOST of the remaining money started to panic sell back into bitcoin, hence the fucking dominance increase.  NOBODY IN THE MARKET WAS STAYING IN NEW ICO’s. NOBODY IN THE MARKET WAS TAKING RISKS ON 150 ranked coins when the market was TANKING THE MARKET WAS TERRIFIED DURING THIS PHASE AND SELLING ALTS EVERYWHERE - HENCE THE ABOVE NUMBERS.  Your claims are bullshit. The team wasn’t dumping, the  entire fucking market dumped!",False

Market making and exchange wallet aggregation is NOT team dumping 😂 Hence why the volume is higher, marketcap rank climbed, and price spiked. How would that happen with team sized dumping for as long as you’ve been claiming? Lol.  These people spreading FUD and making these FALSE negative claims - are the same person. He’s the same person posting the same FUD on twitter and has said several times he’ll never stop and his goal is to try and cost the team money lol.  He keeps using the cards as his reason for saying the project is a scam. So when the team delivers cards and we have proof of customers using their Crypterium debit cards - he’ll apologize and stop making false claims, right?  If cards are delivered and he (or magically new accounts) start spamming more FUD and new complaints (probably NFC or exchange listings) - you’ll know that this person has been using these accounts to spread FAKE fear and FUD just to try and hurt the team by scaring off buyers.  If he’s genuine, since his entire complaint and reasoning has been the cards - claiming they’re fake and never coming - then he would certainly stop and apologize for being wrong once the cards begin arriving, right?  He won’t though. He’ll use the same fake accounts he has here and on twitter and he’ll keep making false, malicious claims to try and hurt the team. He’ll switch from the cards once everyone sees they’re real and delivered and he’ll probably make the same posts; but about the next goals ( NFC & a top 10 exchange).  Crypterium is legitimate - do your own research and you’ll see that. Check out the twitter and news updates, check out the app features and check out the marketing’s attendance/networking at the largest crypto events in the world. What scammers would plaster their names, faces, and live video at the largest conferences in the world if they’re scamming? Lmao.  Don’t believe these fake accounts spreading FUD. Buy CRPT while it’s cheap from the card delays and bear market.",False

It may seem from the outside that this week hasn't been very eventful, but that's totally not the case. We at Crypterium have been working hard in silence to let our further success be the noise. Here're some small hints on huge surprises we're preparing for you.  Epic App Update Coming Big releases take time, and we're very close to our new killer-app feature. The one we can't wait to introduce you to. The one that will help us bridge the gap between the world of crypto and traditional finance. The one that will allow you to... Sorry, got carried away, can't tell you more at this point. Let it be a surprise, okay?  Demoing at Finovate What we can tell you is that this new feature will be first presented at Finovate, one of the most influential fintech events in the world. We got this opportunity to present our products in front of hundreds of C-level execs, top blockchain experts and journalists. We're not going to give away spoilers, but this demo will be legendary. While you're waiting for it, you can as well listen to Marc O'Brien's interview on the most popular fintech podcast in the world - Breaking Banks (starts at 45th min). Break the banks!  New exchanges The upcoming agenda already looks exciting, doesn’t it? And there is more to come! We are getting listed on one of the top exchanges by the end of the month. Again, we can’t tell you its name yet, but there is no doubt that you’ve heard of it many times!  New Look Last but not least, we are redesigning our website, and we love how the new one will looks like. It will now have new sections dedicated to each of our products, interactive Roadmap, improved navigation and other useful features. We are planning on featuring some of your reviews on the front page. So feel free to give us feedback, share your thoughts and opinions, on any of the following products:  Cards (both virtual and physical cards) Bank Transfers (IBAN, BPay, etc) Wallet (crypto transfers, holding, import/export of private keys, etc.) Crypto Purchases (vouchers, top-ups, etc.) Loans Investing tools (Portfolio, following strategies of traders, etc.)  Follow us on social media to stay in touch and be the first to receive all the breaking news from the industry.

They haven't lied about anything lol.  1.) The app has been substantially updated & upgraded since it's initial release and has had a multitude of updates quite frequently.  2.)

They're supposed to adhere to a top ten exchange listing in their roadmap regardless if those exchanges decide they want seven figures or more in listing fee's? And with the BitWise report exposing how many of the 'top' exchanges have fake and spoofed volume, I'm glad they didn't put a ton of money out for one of those exchanges at this time lol.

They can't just pull a card out of thin air to deliver it on time when the card & bank to bank needs a processing network and legal framework. There's immense governance and regulatory barriers to all of these features, and phone manufacturer support for NFC functionality - especially if intending to utilize Apple/Google pay API's. Why do you think most of these cards on the market have country restrictions? Why do you think it took Coinbase and other card vendors 2-4 YEARS to finally deliver their cards? Crypterium is finally about to deliver a GLOBAL card and it will have taken them less than a year and a half.  It's ridiculous, you act like ""well they said it, so they have to do it when they said!"" when nearly every key feature is dependent upon third party approval and governance to make happen.  Look at Bakkt! Bakkt is owned by one of the LARGEST FINANCIAL POWERHOUSES IN THE WORLD.

The ICO had massive involvement - as milestones were late and when the first CEO was replaced, tons of noob moonboys - people who bought the ico solely for expecting instant profits shortly after ICO completion - dumped their CRPT as soon as it landed on a reputable exchange - Kucoin.  The ICO took place in December - the PEAK of FOMO and ICO hype. Everyone was buying ICO’s ONLY with the intention to make large profits RIGHT AWAY.  Instead, the ICO completed right when the entire market started to crash! The ICO completed on January 6th, the all time high of the total market was January 7th - which means the entire crypto market began dropping every day since the day after ICO completion.  Which means NOBODY was getting the instant profits they expected like in October, novermber, and December of 2017. So yes, thousands of people who had no plans of holding CRPT and expected to dump for profits after the ICO - weren’t able to since the market was crashing. Those people all dumped.  Then, since the market was crashing - people began selling alt coins and buying bitcoin to be safe.  So yes, when Kucoin listing came, all of those people above, dumped.  That’s not a reflection of Crypterium lol.  Then, when the cards were first late and the CEO was replaced, people panic sold that too.  You’re mad at the team for things that aren’t the teams fault lol.  You should have sold the first time cards were delayed if you’re not happy. Instead you held on all the way down through a bear market and want to blame the team? You can only blame YOURSELF for not selling.  Crypterium is legit. When the cards are delivered you will find something new to spam and complain about. You’ll never stop no matter what the team delivers because you’re a fraud.",False

Always expressing the same complaints? Always using the same, improper English sentence structure and typos? Despite the updates, post nothing but negativity and blatant claims of scams? They claim to still be holding and not selling - what person holding coins, angry about a loss, would bash the project and obsess over trying to destroy the project's image so they never get even again?  For the REAL hodlers & traders... Any real investor and trader knows the nature of investing - even the greatest trader has losers - even Warren Buffett Why are these 'three' posters so angry, fixated, and obsessed over a bad buy that 'they' post every SINGLE DAY. (I say they because it's one obsessed troll/fired employee). Is that normal behavior for making a bad buy? Products fail, projects fail. Real investors and traders move on. Yet these 'people', are fixated on Crypterium and steering people away. Is it normal for a real investor or trader to make multiple fake forum accounts and multiple Twitter accounts to spends HOURS every single day of the week to bash a project and steer others away?  These posters are the same person - who is the same twitter account known as FightingFrauds The twitter link is https://twitter.com/FightingFrauds Do the tweets look familiar? It's the same guy who's here almost every day, making the same posts and same FUD. Is that not absolutely psychotic? Is that how an investor/trader who made a bad purchase acts? Nope. This is clearly personal and vendetta driven. It's literally an obsession.  Addressing his distorted, fake, invalid FUD about Crypterium - Their CoinFalcon claims CoinFalcon was NEVER an approved exchange for Crypterium's CRPT - ever. Seriously, go try and search for an announcement anywhere on the internet by Crypterium - it doesn't exist, CoinFalcon never had permission. CoinFalcon did NOT delist Crypterium. CoinFalcon is a shit exchange - it's ranked #170 out of all crypto exchanges. Their TOTAL daily volume as an exchange is less than $350,000! That's INSANE! Not only is that volume absolutely pathetic and non-existent in terms of an exchange open to the whole planet of buyers - they spoof their orderbooks. Their $350,000 is enough of a joke, but theirs isn't even that high! CoinFalcon creates downward pressure via spoofing and other means, buys as many of a small cap project's coin as they can - and then they list them on their exchange. Crypterium FORCED CoinFalcon to remove their unauthorized listing of CRPT.  Addressing the fake claims of the team dumping tokens The addresses and transfers this obsessed, fired employee is spamming about are the EXCHANGE'S wallets for TOKEN AGGREGATION & LIQUIDITY! Go look through the contracts and the wallet transfers for yourself, and look through alllllll the pages of prior activity as well. Anyone with half a brain can see that these are not team tokens. The largest wallets holding CRPT - have not dumped any CRPT - you can see this yourself on Etherscan and look through all of the wallets, when they received tokens, and when they last moved tokens.   Addressing the 'fake payment videos': Anyone who has been involved with Crypterium and has been using the apps since they've been released, including the beta releases, knows that they often have user-interface glitches that get resolved quickly in the following patches/releases. The example that this FUD-posting, obsessed individual is citing is the coffee purchase video in which the calendar year display is wrong and shows 2018. Despite this video NEVER being released before, not during last years bear market, and not when the project began falling in rank - he claims it's from early 2018 lol. Hey, for anyone with a brain - if the team was sitting on this 'old video' from 2018, why wouldn't they use it back then to help keep the price and rank much higher? Oh, I know - because the video is brand new and the '2018' in the video is what the team said it was when released - an error on their part in the BETA RELEASE. Say it with me - BETA RELEASE - you know, the rushed version that is used for rudimentary testing of features and not intended for final use and delivery to the consumer.  Addressing the 'cards never coming' FUD Yet again, more fake FUD. However, the Crypterium team is a LITTLE guilty here - but I'll explain why and I'll explain why I agree with the Crypterium team. The debit cards were Crypterium's initial, and strongest selling point for the first portions of their roadmap - NFC payments were NEVER promised to be an EARLY delivery. Crypterium's ICO reached it's hard cap on January 6th, 2018 - proof: https://medium.com/@crypterium/now-officially-its-the-hardcap-5b4df9546261 The ALL TIME HIGH of the entire crypto market was January 7th, 2018 - ONE DAY AFTER THE ICO COMPLETED. What does this mean? It means the 18-month bear market we all just suffered through, started TWO DAYS AFTER THE DAMN ICO ENDED! After a few months into the bear market, after the end of Chinese New Year failed to turn the market around, and after Consensus and other historically bullish events failed to turn the market bullish again, we ALL settled into the long bear market we just saw. This is where I say Crypterium is 'guilty' - but I support why they did what they did. The bear market was BRUTAL - nothing flourished except for exchange tokens like BNB and stable coins. No amount of great news, no amount of new releases, no amount of new futures could move a project UPWARDS and keep it sustained. When the bear market is so powerful that nothing is thriving, everything is dropping, and Bitcoin's future is uncertain - why would a team WASTE their most significant selling point and release it during a painfully brutal bear market? The team won't admit it, but I spoke with UnionPay representatives - the card processor who is servicing the Crypterium cards (UnionPay is massive, they're the Asian equivalent of VISA and they're accepted globally. They have been in agreement and servicing the Crypterium card since the middle of 2018. Feel free to e-mail any UnionPay representatives and ask them yourself. It's a brilliant and crucial move to have delayed the card release. It's obvious isn't it? The market turns bullish, the technical analysis everywhere is confirming the bull reversal, and suddenly the cards are ready? That + UnionPay stating they've been in agreement with Crypterium since mid-2018 shows that the team purposely stalled the releases - and that's a GREAT thing. If they were released during the middle of the bear market, they'd have no profound effect on market sentiment. Nobody would buy Crypterium regardless of the cards when they're worried Bitcoin is still breaking down and carrying altcoin prices with it. The market audience spends more, significantly more, during bullish sentiment and euphoria.  To all of my real crypto HODL'ers, traders, investors, OG's, cypherpunks, speculators, moonbois, lambros You know the rules - DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH! I'm not telling you to buy Crypterium, but I'm buying CRPT myself and I've been since the ico. The cashout feature works flawlessly Want to test Crypterium's legitimacy yourself? Download the app, load a few bucks to it and cash out to your debit or credit card. The card has to be a MasterCard serviced card - they will add Discover and VISA support in the near future. Don't take my word for it, but do it yourself. Once you see it's legit, ask yourself, does that seem like something a fake team could pull off? My cashout was in my checking account via my debit card in just over THREE MINUTES. The chief marketing officer was just at the Malta blockchain event, networking with the biggest names in crypto: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxGPTpLTWqE&feature=youtu.b.

For the REAL hodlers & traders... Any real investor and trader knows the nature of investing - even the greatest trader has losers - even Warren Buffett Why are these 'three' posters so angry, fixated, and obsessed over a bad buy that 'they' post every SINGLE DAY. (I say they because it's one obsessed troll/fired employee). Is that normal behavior for making a bad buy? Products fail, projects fail. Real investors and traders move on. Yet these 'people', are fixated on Crypterium and steering people away. Is it normal for a real investor or trader to make multiple fake forum accounts and multiple Twitter accounts to spends HOURS every single day of the week to bash a project and steer others away?  These posters are the same person - who is the same twitter account known as FightingFrauds The twitter link is https://twitter.com/FightingFrauds Do the tweets look familiar? It's the same guy who's here almost every day, making the same posts and same FUD. Is that not absolutely psychotic? Is that how an investor/trader who made a bad purchase acts? Nope. This is clearly personal and vendetta driven. It's literally an obsession.    you said it s not and investment. and now you are showing the REAL hodlers & traders how it should be. there is only one trader in this coin and its the team , many times people showed the movement of the token from old sleeping accounts. you have done nothing except dumping the token for the last 1.5 year..  at your white paper , it was written that if you hold the token , you will get % x of the total commition fee , why did you offer it that ? if its a utily token ? why did you need to notice it ?  you said you will burn token after ico , but you didnt ..  your trading contest winners are the teams account. if you follow them its obvious..  I dont have any vandetta feeling. just give me back my investments and i will be gone .. i lost huge amount of money in this token .. if its a service as you said , and i dont had the service for the last 1.5 year , i want my money back. this is what i was asking. if you trust your product you can give the money back of a customer right ?   ı want to say even we (ıco supporters who gave thousands of dollars to you)  are not trusting you because of what you have done last 1.5 year , why the other people trust you ?  why people use your product ? why they keep their coins in your app after all the things you have done ? i m sure you will steal the coins in the app soon ..  you see when there is no trust you are nothing. you dumped that trust with the token dumping .. you have scammed to the people who trusted you..  i will write here untill i get my money back .. if i cant , i will warn people about you .. maybe i can save 1 person who will be scammed in the future..  Circulating Supply ws 70 million after ico. now its 83.971.026 CRPT  who created 14 millions of token ? where are theese tokens ? are there any relations with theese token and trading bots on hitbtc and kuqoin and liquid ?  you were telling all the tokens remain will be burned after ico .. how the fck its possible that there could be 14 more token after 1 year ? team is the manupilating the token price , maybe not the developers but the guys on the head are doing it ..",False

Sorry is don’t look like that Maybe you don’t have read the first white paper right if is still exist? 3)mlp will come stay tuned !!!(any way with out fair crpt burning process don’t expect a lot . They have to show the fair burning process transparent!) 4)nfc at the moment is not possible low restrictions that maybe the team will finally be ready in five years sure will be not the first team  that get it.is exist teams in financial market with more money much bigger teams and more professionals, that can steal the idea and make it work before them. 5) qr payment is easy for them I can’t really understand why is not ready ? That was thems ready project (if really was ?)I hope the crypterium will be implemented  fast on thems next projects! 6) more coins are coming let them first complete the crpt burning is more important ! Any way we are not going to use the app soon before the fair crpt burning will start , we the preregistered users from ico fell like be scammed with out that .  7) new exchanges? At the moment we are going to less why is no volume !  8)Yes they translated tokens , just think crypterium sx should to make transactions in best price they should to have in all exchanges money all the time for the transactions to be completed in the right moment! Maybe is that? We are near to a moment that crpt will start to be useful is stupid to sell them now.  Maybe if you are 100 percent sure for the opposite . Any way we are not going to sell them we will see why they was acting like that very soon! 9) I think I have answer that already why we are not going to use crypterium soon , why we invested in ico give them start up money , they start to see us like preregistered users , yes of course we waited that moment to start to use it long time . Some where in the middle they started to use the icos money not to make crpt useful and must wanted they are possible going to restrict it only for a small category of transactions like nfc payment that don’t exist . Any way to make crypto fiat payment in crypterium you don’t need any more crpt tokens you can use btc are eth.( I was believing after the cryptofiat payments be available that every one will run and buy crpt why is the only token that is used for gas with out that you can’t use crypterium app)",False

Today’s announcement marks the first step towards an offering that Founders Bank will conduct through the blockchain-based equity fundraising platform Neufund and issuing its own legally-binding equity tokens. Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, is one of the first and major investors in the company.  Once licensed, Founders Bank will become the first stable and high tech banking solution not only focused on founders, but also owned by them, bridging the gap between traditional financial world and innovative crypto companies.  The equity token offering to be conducted on Neufund under German regulation in collaboration with one of Europe’s major stock exchanges later this year, will allow all market participants to become co-owners of Founders Bank. This is pioneering as it will allow our clients to decide on the development of the solutions they are using with blockchain-style governance model based on smart contracts.  Once licensed, the Founders Bank would be the first decentralized and community-owned bank in the world, signaling the possible future of the banking industry.   “We are not only excited to be one of the first investors of this inclusive community for this pioneering initiative, but also look forward to explore the full range of its banking services. We continue to be delighted by the vibrant blockchain opportunities in Malta, and look forward to launching more partnerships in the region.” — says Changpeng Zhao, Founder & CEO at Binance. Founders Bank will focus on serving tech and crypto businesses and will offer top-tier banking solutions. Users will be able to access their accounts from both the mobile and desktop web application and use them directly with credit cards issued by Founders Bank. We are currently awaiting banking license in Malta. We estimate our launch to be in the first half of 2019 and we will host our Equity Token Offering through Neufund’s platform later this year.  Founders Bank is the missing piece of #BlockchainIsland on Malta. We are proud to announce our progressive banking solutions tailored for the needs of decentralised companies, with already existing support from the leaders of the blockchain industry, including Binance and Neufund. I am excited about the upcoming equity token offering when everyone will be able to become the co-owner of the company and shape the future of banking with us! — Mr Michael Bianchi, Chairman and Co-founder at Founders Bank. The supervisory board and management of the company includes experienced entrepreneurs and industry experts with Mr. Michael Bianchi serving as Chairman of the Board and including Dr Abdalla Kablan, Martin Bruncko, André Eggert, Pavel Bodark, Sonal Kadchha, Paula Pandolfino and Jonathon Gowen with previous experience working in blue chip companies and institutions such as Barclays, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, the European Commission, the World Bank, Deloitte and the OECD.

Investment implies security. CRPT is not a security token, but a utility token used as gas, to fuel transactions. Much like a unit of service. The white paper was quite clear on this.  No ICO funds were used in the development of Instachange or C-Lever, they are separate projects. We don't ban people on Telegram for asking legitimate questions. We have chat rules in place to create a friendly user environment. Users are given plenty of warnings before their chat privleges are restricted or they are banned. Our chat rules are as follows:  ""📢Our community Chat rules: Please refrain from using foul or unpleasant language and be kind to your fellow token holders. Do not spread FUD. Do not post inappropriate content or personal links of interest or personal gain. No shilling will be permitted. This is an English only chat, so please use English. Many of the support are not multi-lingual. Audio replies and command links are not permitted, as it is too difficult for the administrators to monitor these in a timely manner. Avoid discussion of illegal activities. Do NOT harass support. They are provided as a courtesy to Crypterium customers. Violation of chat conditions could lead to restrictions and banning.

Something to keep in mind when considering card fees: - It's global solution and there are no competitors.. - The best rates will be provided by Crypterium SX - Competitive limits of $10,000 daily limit / $60,000 monthly limit - It's private, as no info will be shared with other jurisdictions around the globe - It's our first card solution, the fees will be lower in future. For example, local payment solutions can be cheaper - and we plan to develop regional partnerships with local payment providers.  As for CLever and Instachage, these are not a direct integration just yet and are considered separate projects.- feel free to browse around the websites.  Keep in mind, we are establishing a global business and believe it or not, establishing a global business takes time. Crypterium continues to maintain it's course on project development.  As it was mentioned before, for NFC functionality, many things depend on third-party agreements, so we cannot set the strict deadline for it. Intense negotiations, making contracts and other bureaucracy on partnering with banks could take some considerable time. It is a highly complex and demanding process. Those are complicated and challenging agreements on partnerships. Our users need to understand that is it not a simple process. We also need to be certain we follow regional regulations and delays are possible. This is not a matter of our failure or that we postpone announced deadlines. The first digital currency- to-fiat features have already began with our recent IBAN/Bpay, top up with BTC option etc. As for app functions, these things need to happen in stages and everything is planned accordingly. Everything which we have done, including exchanges chosen, has been done with the upmost caution and attention to detail to ensure the success of the project. Our users must have faith that with the teams previous success in multiple fintech projects and that they know what they are doing. Everything will continue to roll out according to our white paper and goals. It is about the success of the project.  Thanks for the questions!",False

We have never promised and today we do not promise to increase the token in its value because it can not be guaranteed. But we believe in it, everything tells about it.

Crypterium continues to maintain it's course on project development.  As it was mentioned before, for NFC functionality, many things depend on third-party agreements, so we cannot set the strict deadline for it. Intense negotiations, making contracts and other bureaucracy on partnering with banks takes considerable time. It is a highly complex and demanding process. Those are complicated and challenging agreements on partnerships.  We had a very big partnership lined up, but for reasons outside of Crypterium, that partnership did not come to pass, so we weren't able to launch the services that we hoped for in the second half of the year. Unfortunately, that partner had a complete change of vision and decided that not only did they not want to be in crypto, but they didn't want to be in payments at all. We were just a casualty of a wider decision that the company took, but it is guaranteed that we will deliver what we promised and what our users are looking forward to in a very short period of time. The partners we are working with will be for both physical cards and NFC.  Our users need to understand that is it not a simple process. We also need to be certain we follow regional regulations and delays are possible. This is not a matter of our failure or that we postpone announced deadlines. As for app functions, these things need to happen in stages and everything is planned accordingly. Everything which we have done, including exchanges chosen, has been done with the upmost caution and attention to detail to ensure the success of the project. Our users must have faith that with the teams previous success in multiple fintech projects and that they know what they are doing. Everything will continue to roll out according to our white paper and goals. It is about the success of the project.  CRPT is a utility token, not a share of a company. We are building a product, and when we see an opportunity, we try to make the most of it. If that's not the approach that you expect, we're probably not the type of company you should be involved with. No one is forcing you to be a token holder. Please remain patient. We will provide our vision.",False

As it was mentioned before, for NFC functionality, many things depend on third-party agreements, so we cannot set the strict deadline for it. Card pre-orders will begin very soon and we have a very exciting update coming, this month, that will surely please our users. Intense negotiations, making contracts and other bureaucracy on partnering with banks takes some considerable time. It is a highly complex and demanding process. Those are complicated and challenging agreements on partnerships. Some of the agreements are in their final stage which Rafael recently spoke on.  We are now talking to 7 and 3 card card providers (Visa, Mastercard and UnionPay) to enable those same services. It is guaranteed that we will deliver what we promised and what our users are looking forward to in a very short period of time. The partners we are working with will be for both physical cards and NFC.  Our users need to understand that is it not a simple process. We also need to be certain we follow regional regulations and delays are possible, as with any business. It is not a matter of our failure or that we postpone some announced deadlines. The first digital currency- to-fiat features have already began with our recent IBAN/Bpay, top up with BTC option etc. As for app functions, these things need to happen in stages and everything is planned accordingly. Everything which we have done, including exchanges chosen, has been done with the upmost caution and attention to detail to ensure the success of the project.

Crypterium continues to maintain it's course on project development.  As it was mentioned before, for NFC functionality, many things depend on third-party agreements, so we cannot set the strict deadline for it. Intense negotiations, making contracts and other bureaucracy on partnering with banks could take some considerable time. It is a highly complex and demanding process. Those are complicated and challenging agreements on partnerships. Some of the agreements are in their final stage and Rafael will tell about them very soon.  We had a very big partnership lined up, but for reasons outside of Crypterium, that partnership did not come to pass, so we weren't able to launch the services that we hoped for in the second half of the year. Unfortunately, that partner had a complete change of vision and decided that not only did they not want to be in crypto, but they didn't want to be in payments at all. We were just a casualty of a wider decision that the company took. We are now talking to 7 and 3 card card providers (Visa, Mastercard and UnionPay) to enable those same services and approaching these services by not ""putting all of our eggs into one basket."" Some tough lessons were learned this year, but it is guaranteed that we will deliver what we promised and what our users are looking forward to in a very short period of time. One of those payment solutions will be launched in a few weeks. It probably won't be the perfect model we originally intended, where your card is 100% directly connected to your wallet, but there are solutions that are 95% as good as that and that is what we will launch. The partners we are working with will be for both physical cards and NFC.  Our users need to understand that is it not a simple process. We also need to be certain we follow regional regulations and delays are possible. This is not a matter of our failure or that we postpone announced deadlines. The first digital currency- to-fiat features have already began with our recent IBAN/Bpay, top up with BTC option etc. As for app functions, these things need to happen in stages and everything is planned accordingly. Everything which we have done, including exchanges chosen, has been done with the upmost caution and attention to detail to ensure the success of the project. Our users must have faith that with the teams previous success in multiple fintech projects and that they know what they are doing. Everything will continue to roll out according to our white paper and goals. It is about the success of the project.",False

We are writing to you to announce an extension of the Cryptoindex Token Sale. We have taken this decision due to a number of factors. Firstly, a token sale process is correlated with the situation in the cryptocurrency market. The fall of Bitcoin is making the token sale process for both crypto projects and token sale participants much more complicated. Due to the market conditions, we have received significant feedback from our community members and participants that the Token Sale timing had to be extended. In communication with funds, we came to the conclusion that the extension would produce the best results in terms of work with institutions, allowing them time to manage their positions in the volatile market and complete their due diligence on the various products they are reviewing.  As of this moment, the project has raised more than $10 million. The index has showed its high potential to occupy a niche in the crypto market. Cryptoindex has the ability to become an industry benchmark and at the same time a tool for combining the best characteristics of multiple coins.   ",False

CRPT is used to fuel digital assets to fiat for purchases, bill payments, transfers, etc. CRPT is your ticket to our cryptobank services.  For our users who hold their CRPT in the app and make crypto-to-fiat transactions through the app within the time period.  Up to 30% of Crypterium’s transactional income is used for MLP. It is about 0.15% from each crypto to fiat payment to merchants. If we are talking about payments via payment systems(Visa/Mastercard/etc), there is an acquiring fee which merchants pay for transactions processing. Some part of this fee is shared with the bank which has issued the used card (interchange fee). As our partner that issues cards for Crypterium app users, we're getting that fee. It's about 0.5% from each transaction. as an example (so, 30% of 0.5% is about 0.15%):  MLP assumes 4 categories on the basis of the CRPT balance in the users Crypterium app*: 1) Bronze – less than 1 token 2) Silver – tokens amounting from 1 to less than 8,000 3) Gold – tokens from 8,000 to less than 25,000 4) Platinum – 25,000 tokens or greater  On NFC: We had a very big partnership lined up, but for reasons outside of Crypterium, that partnership did not come to pass, so we weren't able to launch the services that we hoped for in the second half of the year. Unfortunately, that partner had a complete change of vision and decided that not only did they not want to be in crypto, but they didn't want to be in payments at all. We were just a casualty of a wider decision that the company took. We are now talking to 7 and 3 card card providers (Visa, Mastercard and UnionPay) to enable those same services and approaching these services by not ""putting all of our eggs into one basket."" Some tough lessons were learned this year, but it is guaranteed that we will deliver what we promised and what our users are looking forward to in a very short period of time. One of those payment solutions will be launched in a few weeks. It probably won't be the perfect model we originally intended, where your card is 100% directly connected to your wallet, but there are solutions that are 95% as good as that and that is what we will launch. The partners we are working with will be for both physical cards and NFC.  You can currently buy crypto via credit card with our InstaChange service, which can be found here: https://instachange.net/  We have no control over the price of the token. Unfortunately the crypto market has fallen dramatically over the last few months. Our token follows the path the market wants it to follow.

In this case, we will use the minimum fee of 0.5%. 0.5%  merchant fee = $15,000,000 Crypterium's transactional income. 30% of this income will go to the MLP = $4,500,000.  5% to Bronze holders = $225,0000 10% to Silver holders = $450,000 35% to Gold holders = $1,575,000 50% to platinum holders = $2,250,000 $2,250,000 split between 350 platinum holders = $6,429 per Platinum holder.",False

This situation led to the change of attitude from exchanges, now they are more talkative, and they are willing to list solid coins with big communities. However, we did comprehensive research and found out that listing on a falling market is not the best solution, it might even trigger a negative effect on our token.  Crypterium is already on 3 exchanges and will be on more in near future. However, because of a overall negative atmosphere, we might not list our coins anywhere right now. It's not good or sensible timing in any sense. At the same time, we did a lot of research and paperwork and have 10 exchanges lined up we can list on.",False

I think the main stumbling block is a lack of information in mass media and low-level education. People always was scared in front of any new things. The most people like sitting afore the TV, walking to a job, think about kids, bills and hypotheca. The crypto is for the next generation at most and for us) insiders with open minds.

Our application security is strong and it fulfills the most modern security requirements to mobile banks. Private keys are not stored within the app, so it is impossible to get access to them by just hacking the phone. Databases are backed up on a regular basis. We use a ""hosted wallet"" solution for transactional wallets. There is a minimal identification available in the Crypterium App (KYC0, which is first and last name, date of birth, gender and citizenship) which is required for CRPT token remittance and gas payment. Other levels of KYC will depend on agreements with our third-party partners and 2FA within the app will be implemented later.

Crypterium chose Qryptos for many reasons, such as based location and liquidity. They also took into account all HitBTC fee complaints they received and so they wanted to offer their users an exchange with very low fees. Qryptos was an exchange that provided what both Crypterium was looking for in an exchange and the fees their users would be pleased with.  In 2017, QUOINE, Japan’s current largest holding company and the owner of QRYPTOS, became the first global cryptocurrency venture to be officially licensed by the Japan Financial Services Agency. Being officially approved by the Japanese government while state control over cryptocurrencies is getting more and more strict, QRYPTOS has all the chances to become one of the largest crypto exchanges in Asia.

Intense negotiations, making contracts and other bureaucracy on partnering with banks could take some considerable time. It is a highly complex and demanding process. Those are complicated and challenging agreements on partnerships. Some of the agreements are in their final stage. Our users need to understand that is it not a simple process. We also need to be certain we follow regional regulations and delays are possible. This is not a matter of our failure or that we postpone announced deadlines.

Intense negotiations, making contracts and other bureaucracy on partnering with banks could take some considerable time. It is a highly complex and demanding process. Those are complicated and challenging agreements on partnerships. Some of the agreements are in their final stage. Our users need to understand that is it not a simple process. We also need to be certain we follow regional regulations and delays are possible. This is not a matter of our failure or that we postpone announced deadlines. The first crypto to fiat functions have already began with our recent tests in Australia, which had 100% success rate. As for app functions, these things need to happen in stages and everything is planned accordingly. If we tried to pacify every little complaint people had, it would create chaos. We cannot and will not sacrifice our working business model to placate the few complaints. Everything which we have done, including exchanges chosen, has been done with the upmost caution and attention to detail to ensure the success of the project. Our users must have faith that with the teams previous success in multiple fintech projects and that they know what they are doing. Everything will continue to roll out according to our white paper and goals. It is about the success of the project. CRPT price is directly attributed to the price of the market as a whole. We firmly believe the driver will be once we launch our services, the subsequent burning of CRPT and supply and demand. Please remain patient. We will provide our vision.",False

Qryptos is owned by Quoine, which many of you may recognize is the company behind Quionex. We chose Qryptos for many reasons, such as based location and liquidity. We also took into account all HitBTC fee complaints we received and so we wanted to offer our users an exchange with very low fees. Qryptos was an exchange that provided what both Crypterium was looking for in an exchange and the fees our users would be pleased with. Also remember that exchange listings are heavily dependent on the exchange to list at their conveinence, not ours or our users. We are in the process of listing on some major exchanges but understand that is it not a simple process. We are working on listing on exchanges that will have the most impact, so each exchange chosen, is chosen for specific purposes. We have some major exchanges are already ready to list CRPT and we will be listing on these major exchanges eventually, but we have to make sure that our timing is right. We are expect at least 4 more exchanges by the end of this year. Crypterium continues to maintain it's course on project development.  As it was mentioned before, for NFC functionality, many things depend on third-party agreements, so we cannot set the strict deadline for it. Intense negotiations, making contracts and other bureaucracy on partnering with banks could take some considerable time. It is a highly complex and demanding process. Those are complicated and challenging agreements on partnerships. Some of the agreements are in their final stage. Our users need to understand that is it not a simple process. We also need to be certain we follow regional regulations and delays are possible. This is not a matter of our failure or that we postpone announced deadlines. The first crypto to fiat functions have already began with our recent tests in Australia, which had 100% success rate. As for app functions, these things need to happen in stages and everything is planned accordingly. If we tried to pacify every little complaint people had, it would create chaos. We cannot and will not sacrifice our working business model to placate the few complaints. Everything which we have done, including exchanges chosen, has been done with the upmost caution and attention to detail to ensure the success of the project. Our users must have faith that with the teams previous success in multiple fintech projects and that they know what they are doing. Everything will continue to roll out according to our white paper and goals. It is about the success of the project. It is not about pacifying the doubters or every time they want something to happen. CRPT is a utility token, not a share of a company. Please remain patient. We will provide our vision.",False

Yes, it is within our white paper.  Crypterium users tokenback shall be distributed through an independent Monthly Loyalty Fund (MLF). A specific part, based on Crypterium’s margin generated by a specific merchant, of every crypto-to-fiat payment made via Crypterium in the currency of payment shall be allocated to the general loyalty fund. Crypterium shall then openly acquire CRPT tokens available in the secondary market for the funds generated during the month. These are our marketing expenses used to promote and improve user payment activity. Subsequently, the Monthly Loyalty Fund shall be split into 4 parts based on 4 user groups (Bronze – 5%, Silver – 10%, Gold – 35%, Platinum – 50%). Finally, tokens will be transferred to the Crypterium’s user account as a proportion to his/her user group fund. The proportion of tokens will be measured as follows: The proportion of all crypto-to-fiat payments made by a specific user within a specific month, from the amount of crypto-to-fiat payment generated by the entire user group for a particular month. In total, up to 30% of Crypterium’s merchant generated income will form the Monthly Loyalty Program Fund, designed to motivate our users to make more transactions in the app and encourage the most active users.",False

And I’d say we’ll see another listing by the end of the summer. It’s important to note that listing our token is not a priority for us now. We’re focused on building our product and strategic partnerships with financial institutions across the globe. This is another good news for all CRPT holders.

Some others have long lead in periods due to listing backlogs. It is our intention to be listed on a wide range of exchanges as this is a very important part of our operating model since users of our platform need to own our token. But it must be a step by step controlled process. After the 1st listing others will soon follow so that we can naturally expand our platform user base. Our purpose for exchanges, is to be listed on as many as possible, in order to make the token more available. Our product depends on token availability. No single exchange makes or breaks a token. As for the current value, only the buyers and sellers control that and we also have no control over HitBTC fees. They choose to charge their traders what they choose to charge them. Simply put, the use of the application requires the tokens, so listing on several exchanges is a must.

This is done to encourage spending 😃   Crypterium loyalty program is based on cashback (tokenback) facility and operates according to the common rule applicable for all user categories: the more crypto-to-fiat payments you are making within a month, the greater your loyalty reward shall be next month. Individual reward is also depends on user category. However, user personal activity is a key driver of reward size. Token holding itself generates no benefits, if no transactions are performed by the token holder (this user shall not be rewarded under Crypterium loyalty program).  Currently, the loyalty program assumes 4 categories on the basis of CRPT balance in Crypterium app*: 1) Bronze – no tokens available, 2) Silver – tokens under 8000, 3) Gold – tokens under 25000, 4) Platinum – 25000 tokens and greater. *Minimal balance of CRPT tokens on the Crypterium account within a full calendar month.

A specific part (based on Crypterium’s margin generated by a specific merchant) of every crypto-to-fiat payment made via Crypterium in the currency of payment shall be allocated to the general loyalty fund. Then Crypterium shall openly acquire CRPT tokens available in the secondary market for the funds generated during the month. These are our marketing expenses to promote and improve user payment activity. Subsequently, MLF shall be split into 4 parts based on 4 user groups (Bronze – 5%, Silver – 10%, Gold – 35%, Platinum – 50%). Finally, tokens shall be transfered to a Crypterium’s user account as a proportion to his/her user group fund. This proportion shall be measured as follows: proportion of all crypto-to-fiat payments made by a specific user within a specific month from the amount of crypto-to-fiat payment generated by the entire user group for a particular month.  Crypterium loyalty program applies to crypto-to-fiat payments to merchants and does not cover all transactions preformed in the Crypterium service.

It’s hard to tell that a frequency or severity of hacker attacks depends on this. The security is strong and fullfill the most modern security requirements. Our application belongs to the category of crypto banks. We do not know examples when current banking solutions are fully laid out to public. That’s a not safe.

The opposite is the case: if everyone can see and review your code, you can get feedback to make it more safe. Otherwise bugs might be only found by black hat hackers.  Another big example of an open source financial system that works perfectly is the Bitcoin network. Traditional closed sourced banking is a dinosaur and I thought with the start of Bitcoin this was extinct.  Another famous open source example for banking is Paypal, see there github repository: https://github.com/paypal While they might not have released their core server code (but I didn't examine all 155 repositories they have), they have lots of source code available for third parties to integrate Paypal.

The fact you already have a license convinced me in the long term investment potential of the project. But the team answered in twitter that it is a normal practice when price of the token is lower than during ICO. What was the point then to participate in the ICO, when buyers have the opportunity to buy tokens cheaper, from the investor point of view it is more profitable. That`s why i think short term price factor is also very important, as a tribute for investors, or you think in another way?  Official Crypterium Twitter:  ""During the first 3 months after the end of the token sale, all ICO tokens become cheaper. This is normal. Rare exceptions just break the rule. On average, after 6 months the price returns to the price on ICO. And then growths.""",False

We are following our white paper and roadmap. There are many negotiations going on behind the scenes, many interviews taking place and we are about to launch our advertisement campaign. Crypterium has already obtained 2 major licenses in fintech and crypto-currencies. It can be checked out in the register https://mtr.mkm.ee/juriidiline_isik/220559 . We also launched the process of obtaining another 2 licenses - Operating as financial institution and E-Money. The latter, by the way, is issued not by Estonia, but by the European Union. And it will be displayed in a different registry.  On the high withdrawal fee of CRPT from HitBTC. We cannot influence it. These conditions are determined by HitBTC and correspond to their general policy, other currencies also have high fees for withdrawal (especially the new ones). But it should be noted that this fee does not depend on the amount of withdrawal, and the cost of exchange transactions for HitBTC is one of the lowest on the market. This makes it attractive for traders with large turnover. For someone to purchase a small number of tokens, it would be more profitable to wait for the token to appear on other exchanges, which will be announced soon.  We are also very pleased to team up with World Capacity Builders to bring the unbanked community excellent and affordable financial services, while at the same time, solving the problem of liquidity for those in possession of cryptocurrency the world over. This partnership aligns perfectly with not only our company vision, but also our values,” said Co-founder and Financial Director, Austin Kimm.  https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180328005728/en/Crypterium-Announces-Payments-Partnership-World-Capacity-Builders  On iOS app invitations:  For security reasons, Crypterium’s functionality will be made available to its users in stages (at this time, we are not completely sure that our service’s most important functions are error-free). To control this process, a limited number of special invitations have been provided to a certain part of our audience. We are planning to enable full access to Crypterium’s full range of options soon (reinstalling the app will not be necessary). We apologize for the inconvenience. The procedure of launching the app this way was implemented in the interest of our community. However, it is easier to simply wait for the service’s full range of options to open for everyone.  Sometimes it is easier to copy/paste the same answer, when the same question has been asked and answered multiple times. It provides the ability to answer more question within the time available.  Our purpose for exchanges, is to be listed on as many as possible, in order to make the token more available. Our product depends on token availability. No single exchange makes or breaks a token. As for the current value, only the buyers and sellers control that. Simply put, the use of the application requires the tokens, so listing on several exchanges is a must. Reducing the number of tokens in conditions of stable or growing demand of them, will increase their cost. People whom read the white paper understand that this was no quick flip token and it was never intended to be.  I hope this answers your most recent questions.",False

Therefore, we must be sure that we can withdraw the crypto assets from the client's account, even if the client is offline and can not sign the transaction with his key. This is possible only if we keep the keys. We store funds according to the best practices, because most of the funds will be safely stored on cold wallets on our side.

More often than not, ICO tokens become cheaper by the time the ICO closes and the tokens are already listed on exchanges. But there are only a handful of exceptional ICOs that ended up with a sold out performance and this itself is a reason for Crypterium not to be simply compared to those that ended up not as successful.  2. If those that were not as successful as Crypterium were able to get listed in major exchanges, why can't Crypterium do that? The earlier the better because those who were not able to get CRPT during the ICO will still be early birds in buying this token on the exchanges.  3.

Our front end application is virtually ready, and we know what it will look like in principle, but everything is somewhat dependent upon our partners that are integrated within the App. For example, we will be integrated with partner payment card issuers. Depending on the issuer (and maybe even country), there may be different branding solutions. So there is really no point in trying to finalize the design now (in any event the final design will almost certainly go through several upgrades as we take feedback from our early adopters). We are working on the IOS App now and expect to release it in the next few weeks, but it is not our #1 priority, our priority is the release of the full version which will enable people to spend and use their crypto in the everyday world. Crytperium light, although a very capable wallet, still keeps the Crypto in the Crypto world. It's an interim step that will soon be overtaken by the full Crypterium App. HitBTC is still scheduled for early this month and more exchanges will be announced soon. We can not set dates for exchanges. Crytperium's token CRPT is an integral part of the platform as customer's must pay for each transaction with a small part of our CRPT. Therefore customers must be able to buy the CRPT freely on Exchanges of their choice (Crytperium will help factilitate this process) and CRPT must be on those exchanges, but the order and speed of roll-out is not so important. As soon as Crytperium is released, we will issue a notice to everybody who registered during our ICO. We are also now working on releasing www.crypterium.com (don't click on link now as it will take you to Crytperium.io our ICO site) where those people that did not register during the ICO will be able to register for the first platform releases. Current CMC price listings are based solely on P2P exchanges, which account for 1% of the volume and therefore do not reflect reliable values of CRPT. Price predictions are impossible to predict and will not be accurate until we are on official exchanges. Since the success of Crypterium relies heavily on the success of our application, our application is our main priority, at this point. There are numerous negotiations and internal workings going on within Crypterium and time is of the essence. We are perfectly in line with our white paper and our roadmap and we are working diligently to ensure that it continues to do so.",False

On decentralized there are not many users, low volumes, so even small transactions lead to significant changes in the rate. Also, decentralized exchanges often have technical problems, for example, Etherdelta simply bugging for more than a week.  3) Crypterium product has not been launched yet in a full-fledged relation with CRPT tokens. There are no crypto-fiat transactions, so there are no commissions in tokens with subsequent burning of them.

This is normal. Rare exceptions just break the rule. On average, after 3 months the price returns to the price on ICO. And then growths.  2) Officially, CRPT tokens have not been listed on any exchange. The first is planned in early March. On decentralized there are not many users, low volumes, so even small transactions lead to significant changes in the rate. Also, decentralized exchanges often have technical problems, for example, Etherdelta simply bugging for more than a week.  3) Crypterium product has not been launched yet in a full-fledged relation with CRPT tokens. There are no crypto-fiat transactions, so there are no commissions in tokens with subsequent burning of them.

The reason you were probably banned from TG chat, was do to violation of chat rules stated here:  💡Please refrain from using foul or unpleasant language and be kind to your fellow token holders. Do not spread FUD. Do not post inappropriate content or personal links of interest or personal gain. Audio replies are not permitted, as it is too difficult for the administrators to monitor these in a timely manner. Avoid discussion of illegal activities. Do NOT harass support. They are provided as a courtesy to Crypterium customers. Violation of chat conditions could lead to restrictions and banning. We strive for a friendly and positive chat experience!  So, chances are, it was more than likely the delivery of your questions and not your questions, themselves.  Also, we are in perfect alignment with our white paper, as well as our roadmap.  Many of the Crypterium management team are highly experienced digital payments professionals coming from some of the most innovative Fintech sectors in Europe and having spent the better part of 10 years developing digital payment and banking solutions. Before the team has attracted more than $50M of investment into fintech projects they have been responsible for creating and developing, including PayQR (Russia’s leading independent contact-less payment platform), Workle (a digital sales platform that has over 1.5m independent users selling everything from credit cards to security alarms) and Bonus Club (a digital loyalty program that is integrated inside leading publishers’ web sites).   The final App design is still a couple of weeks away. Our front end application is virtually ready, and we know what it will look like in principle, but everything is somewhat dependent upon our partners that are integrated within the App. For example, we will be integrated with partner payment card issuers. Depending on the issuer (and maybe even country), there may be different branding solutions.

Malware is defined by its malicious intent, acting against the requirements of the computer user — and so does not include software that causes unintentional harm due to some deficiency. Malware is sometimes used broadly against government or corporate websites to gather guarded information, or to disrupt their operation in general. However, malware can be used against individuals to gain information such as personal identification numbers or details, bank or credit card numbers, and passwords.  Also you could be phished. Phishing is the attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and money), often for malicious reasons, by disguising as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication  In that case it is better to change your passwords and scan your devices with anti-malware software.  2fa authenticator is also very good way to protect your accounts from being hacked.

That basically means you get paid for buying stuff! Crypterium has the most easy and high return potential as i can see of now. 0.5% burn and even high loyalty for using it.

These twits think their jobs are done because they launched a ico. That twit clearly thinks he dosn't need more cashflow to really gain it some traction.  He speaks english whenever you see him however, he does it poorly, very poorly. He should not be the face of a bank, he should not be on stage and i dare say he should not be in charge moving forward! He is trying to float a bank, he is out of his league right now and still his board has not hired a ceo with grit to launch a company with such a big dream.  The proof is right in front of you all.  Show me a bank that when it was first founded it took its major stake holders to a crappy bar in Singapore and gave away 500 of their shares and then proceeded to poorly articulate all of the information they could already find out themselves weeks before this silly event!  The art of good marketing is not rocket science. This bank and its team of twits need to show the world what they should be buying into. Not telling them in broken english what they already know! This twit ignores the fact that it actually matters at this point to people with real money. He fails to articulate any kind of vision.  As i said, don't hold your breath. The proof is all there in front of you. Some, most of you probably just don't want to see it.

Regarding Bancor, I'll answer you a little bit later. We should check this information.  2. There were additional payments, received after the hardcap (which were sent before hardcap). Raised funds were converted to BTC on the escrow side in several days after the purchases of CRPT. It may result in loses in the raised amount. For example, tokens purchased at high XRP rate resulted in lower amount of BTC included to the counter. So, it's not accurate to take CRPT price of 0.0001 BTC applied to the raised amount in BTC to estimate the amount of sold tokens. There were bonuses (including White List program, when token buyers were able to receive up to 50% bonuses) and referral tokens (5+1%). The referral program was actively used by participants.  3. Our IR Director and Co-founder Austin Kimm is the advisor at Storiqa.  4.

Zero common sense either...why would you claim the 25th when the whole community knows it didn't happen ~ liars can not be trusted with money  2. I see no comment on Bancor which means you are probably contacting them about a future partnership but why you claim them as a current partner when they are not is still unanswered.  3.

Here is the announcement regarding the bounty program changes: https://medium.com/@crypterium_io/crypteriums-bounty-program-final-results-58fbb5750e2c  Crypterium was a project that caught my eye because I felt their product was something I could actually use (ironically I learned about it from one of the signature campaign participants). However, reducing bounty allocations after a final announcement has been made, only to benefit 14 new unregistered participants is completely unprofessional. Sure, your whitepaper's bounty structure (item 6.4) claimed that: ""The exact distribution of CRPT tokens for the marketing campaign is managed by the ICO organisers and adjusted regularly ..."" and I can understand you making ""adjustments"" early in the campaign, maybe even half way after seeing how things are going (always notifying participants to see if they wish to continue under the new terms), but you can't change the terms after making formal announcements such as:  1. On January 10th, 2018 you release an announcement regarding the bounty program that states: ""The stakes and reward sizes for each Bounty Program participant will be individually calculated by the end of January, based on said participant’s activity. Attention! By January 20, please make sure you’ve provided the correct Ethereum wallet address ... "" (https://medium.com/@crypterium_io/crypteriums-news-bounty-program-7735eecd8f07) 2. On February 5th, 2018 Bounty Manager posts the final spreadsheets on the bounty thread announcing that:""The final spreadsheets with the official amount of tokens you'll receive are here: ... "" (post #1118: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2318931.msg29623298#msg29623298)  Crypterium Team: You should honor these announcements. If you felt the need to add new participants (after calculations had been completed and final stakes awarded) because you thought their ""activity proved to be very beneficial to our project"" or to increase the Video & Blog Bounty because ""It proved to be great at boosting brand awareness and building up trust towards our product"" that is awesome but pay it from the company's dime! You could have easily taken that extra amount from the ""15%: Tokens allocated for marketing and loyalty purposes"" as a portion of those also belong to marketing (same category as bounty). From a company perspective, it is not OK to lower someone's ""salary"" to increase someone else's (a bounty is a form of paid work and even your whitepaper refers to bounty campaign participants as ""marketing campaign team""). But if you were planning on reducing someone's salary, you should have done it from your pockets ... oh, wait ... but why should the founders & team only be splitting 8'698,579.899 tokens instead of 8'998,530.93 (your allocated 9%)? It probably wouldn't seem fair to you, like it doesn't feel fair to bounty campaign participants.  If you can't keep your word on something as simple as a bounty campaign, what guarantee do investors have that you will fulfill what was offered on the whitepaper / roadmap? Right now I don't feel like this is a team I can trust, and will more likely dump my CRPTs first chance I get, as well as post my thoughts in Social Media so that more users are aware of what is going on unless this issue gets fixed.  Crypterium team, it doesn't take very long to destroy one's reputation, and it would be sad if Crypterium became one of those failed ICOs because of issues and poor decision making post ICO (especially because I do think you have a good product).",False

In my head, and what I gather from movies  and the internet, is that they do pre-flight checks. Some involve checking the fuel propellant for any leaks…But I am getting ahead of myself.  As the display picture suggests, the space shuttle has to be transported to the platform. A procedure that can take days as the tank-like carrier of the shuttle, rolls down the preset path or road. This is a procedure similar to the road map of an ICO.  Then there is the numerous fuel checks; communication checks; weather checks; readings from the numerous sensors; health checks of the astronauts; etc…etc. It is a d**n long process.

Quote from: traderspit on January 28, 2018, 06:20:52 PM correct me if I am wrong. on https://crypterium.io/ is showed, that for $51m was sold for tokens during the ICO for a price of 0.0001 BTC (or ~$1.6 per CRPT based on the price of ~$16000/BTC). First of all, why are $51m in the room, when the hardcap was $47m (what is additional 10% from no where)? Okay, lets forget this ~$4m more, it's only one of the misty things. This are additional ~2.5m CRPT. who owns it ?  There was sold to investors $51/$1.6= around ~32m CRPT. If they say.. okay the BTC price dropped to ~$11k, the price per CRPT now is ~$1.1 (0.0001 BTC), they adjusted the amount to $51m/$1.1 to around 46m CRPT (but the ICO investors got only ~32m CRPT based on the price during the ICO). where are this (46m - 32m) additional ~14m CRPT, who owns it ?  Next.. these 46m adjusted CRPT must be equal to 70% of all existing tokens. If we add these 30% of CRPT for owners/bounty/reserverd etc, we have now adjusted total of 60m existing CRPT and not ~99m, this are additional 39m CRPT, who owns it ? You see, there are many numbers in the room which I can't explain. What I see is, that there are additional ~50m CRPT which I didn't expect  In general.. ~32m CRPT was sold to investors and now we see a total supply of ~99m. That mean, 70% catched the owners and 30% investors (and it should be in other way). Sorry in case if I'm wrong and spreading not correct understandings around, but someone have to clarify this.  my motivation is (I sold everything instantly when I read about 99m tokens), that I re-buy CRPT in case of being a serious story on the level of 25 cents, when it reaches the price, given by the amount of  CRPT.",False

So if the 70% distributed to the community is right, but they got only $47 million, some people might have got a lot for a very good discount, maybe because they bought a lot. 99 million tokens left is still not bad, if we assume something like 5x when it hits the exchanges, and even more when they release their app.",False

I don't trust them any more since they doubled the amount of tokens and filled their bags with shortly created assets (instead of burning them) coming from no where. In example from the ""real world"".. you can't bring a stock IPO to the stock market and after weeks double the stock amount without asking the existing shareholders. This action changes the value and scam the existing shareholders. There is no communication and PR to explain us what and why this happens.

I do not understand the people who are upset by the token count for several reasons...  1. The technical hard-cap was 300,000,000 tokens and there were less than 1/3 of that number issued. 2. This information was clearly stated by Crypterium... NO ONE should have been confused by this if they bothered to read the website or Whitepaper. 3. It was clearly posted that the team would take 30% of the total number of coins issued for themselves so I don't understand why people including, CoinmarketCap, ever thought there would be 44,029,586 tokens(the incomplete number that was posted on the Etherscan page for so long) so even had that number been accurate the token count would have been .70x=44,029,586  x= 44,029,586/.70 = 62,899,408.57 tokens total...point being it was never going to be under 50 million and people should have known this 4. With CRPT being burned during every transaction made on the mobile banking platform they will release in the coming months the token count isn't really an issue they should be concerned with... the real concern people should have is what partnerships they are pursuing and how they will attract users to their platform who make transaction that use CRPT as fuel 5. This was not the ICO to invest in if you were looking for quick gains and never was... the price decline is expected because some people were always going to sell some tokens and ""ride the free ones"" or sell the bounty tokens they got free... This investment is about the app and nothing else... It is really simple here if the app attracts hundreds of thousands/millions of users then CRPT will shoot up in price if they don't attract users of fail to make partnerships then CRPT is worthless and will drop sub penny... I expect the price will stay in the $1.75-3.00 range until there is news released about partnerships or their app, because until then there is no catalyst to move the price upwards...Just disgruntled day traders selling who aren't getting the 500%+ gains they hoped for",False

Calling them a scam just because you haven't received your tokens is childish of you. Since your first post you've continued to have a poor attitude towards this project. They are hard at work perfecting the product they displayed in there white paper which is more important. They're are only on limited exchanges like Etherdelta and IDEX with low trading volumes. Which is the reason for the high fluctuation in price. many enthusiasts like yourself are looking for a quick exit that's fine. Therefore in future please provide at least one piece of evidence before continue to FUD a project which has already passed many investors expectations.    ""Tokens withdrawal can take many days. Ethereum blockchain is overloaded, so the process is unstable and goes slow. But for now more than 5000 token holders already received their tokens to ETH addresses. We do control all transactions and we will resend them automatically if needed until we receive confirmation that your tokens was transferred successfully. Please don't send requests about withdrawal at support@crypterium.io. We can't accelerate this process - we run into the possibilities of the blockchain. Please wait as long as needed. All the token holders will eventually get their tokens. Thank you! Your patience is highly appreciated!",False

Crypterium (CRPT) is a digital currency banking platform that finished its wildly successful ICO earlier this month. People who participated in the token sale, which was launched on the Ethereum (ETH) network and ended on January 6th, have already started receiving their Crypterium coin dispersals. That means that they are just starting to hit smaller exchanges – like EtherDelta and Idex.  This blockchain-based venture is setting out to be the global go-to cryptobank. It is working on a worldwide payments ecosystem, where there are no physical cards. Users will pay using digital currencies like they do with fiat currency nowadays. But with Crypterium, it can all be controlled with an e-wallet. There will be loyalty programs, cashback rewards, a cryptocurrency software AppStore – and even blockchain-based loans.

Alipay has to be the holy grail here as it gives access to over 500,000,000 users and growing everyday.  It also provides deep penetration into several Asian markets where crypto is the most popular and provides great marketing opportunities to their massive user base and possibly customers for their banking app.  2. Partnership with a licensed bank so they can issue the virtual Amex, MC... In my eyes this has to be #2 because it opens up worldwide website spending online through virtual payments accepted damn near everywhere I only put it as two because Alipay has the massive user base which adds value to that partnership whereas whatever bank they partner with to issue these cards will not have 500,000,000+ accounts to send advertising emails to  3. AndroidPay, Paypal, other payment providers, .... the more partnerships the merrier ... growing the merchants that can accept their payment platform has to be of utmost importance as it is the best way to grow their user base and create more transactions that are fueled by CRPT driving up the token price  This needs to be done before the app is released obviously or people won't use their app.... I expect these announcements to start coming by March-April time frame .... Although it would be great to have a partnership announcement coincide with the listing on ""actual exchanges"" like binance etc not just P2P ones to help the interest in the token and protect the price and avoid dumping for the quick 2-3 bagger people can probably get  The banking license looks to be further down the road in the 2019-2020 time frame as they need to develop merchant solutions allowing them to expand their merchant acceptance base and have allocated alot of time and resources for this and rightfully so in my opinion.... that's why a partnership with a bank allowing for the virtual Amex, MC is so important in my view",False

Today, on January 20, 2018, we activate all CRPT tokens as per the legal terms specified in our public offer.  What does that imply for our token holders? First and foremost, CRPT tokens can now be used to perform any actions specified by the smart contract: for instance, to be transferred to other ETH addresses. All current limitations will be lifted, and CRPT tokens will fully become their respective holders’ digital property. This will also lead to CRPT tokens being listed on token markets.  This is a new milestone for our project! Our smart contract is programmed to detect token activation, meaning that the tokens cannot be deactivated at any point in the future. The activation is a one-time, irreversible procedure.  Despite the activation, we will continue with token emission. The emission, however, cannot go on further than January 25; this is a technical limitation specified by our smart contract.  https://medium.com/@crypterium_io/crypterium-news-token-activation-and-new-details-on-token-withdrawal-5e5cd49676e1",False

People have missing deposits from December and are waiting 10+ days for tokens to hit their wallets.  I don't see the token withdraw issue as being quite as severe as the missing deposits... mainly because as a bank if people don't believe their deposit will be credited for whatever reason(Even stupidity like sending to wrong address) they just won't deposit and then there won't be transactions and no need for CRPT as fuel...  I am missing tokens for 9 days now so... I feel like they are just moving very slowly and eventually they will hit my wallet.

If you look at other transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, all successful transactions are using like $3 or more transaction fee.  They shouldn't be so stingy. Lowest amount to buy was $75 anyway. I would happily buy $5 for fee and get this subtracted from my coins, which was a lot more, if this would improve speed.  Another note: I was wrong earlier with the trading. If you look at the contract source code:  https://etherscan.io/address/0x80a7e048f37a50500351c204cb407766fa3bae7f#code  you can see that there is a flag ""transferAllowed"". Currently this is false (see ""Read Smart Contract"") and can be changed only by the owner of the contract. This flag is used as a condition for the ""transfer"" function. So they control when we can start transferring (and thus trading) our coins. The only way to trade it would be to sell your whole Ethereum private key, but this might be a bad idea, because then the seller could still transfer it, if he is faster after ""transferAllowed"" is set to true",False

Looks like the Litecoin blockexplorer https://live.blockcypher.com accepts Bitcoin addresses, but the Bitcoin blockexplorer doesn't accept Litecoin addresses. Maybe you are lucky and they can import their private key of their Bitcoin address in a Litecoin wallet to send you the funds back or claim the funds, if the format if compatible. But you won't get an answer here for it, write to support@crypterium.io , so far I got always an answer for my questions, even if it needs a a day or two, which is understandable because of the high interest.  Meanwhile I got an answer why my withdrawal transaction disappeared: ""You cant see the transaction because hasn't been included in a block yet"". I guess because of the high number of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain sometimes they get lost, and then they send it again after some time. Will post again when I got the CRPT.",False

Before this coin went live and started trading on various exchanges, its value is assigned by developers (0.0001 BTC), and is aligned to Bitcoin. Hence, while people can buy it for USD, LTC, ETH, and BTC, amount collected would reflect conversion from amount of BTC collected. Most main coins have had a bad week with BTC valued at $13,341 (as of the moment of me writing this post) down from high of $19,205. Therefore, total collected during ICO you see is gradually decreasing as well. If, hypothetically, Bitcoin rebounded to over $19K within next few minutes, amount raised on ICO website would jump from almost $32M to $48M within few minutes.",False

The website states that tokens are burned forever during every transaction, which will create constant demand.

If it will really offer us the posibility to have in one place all of our crytocurrencies, and use them to pay for stuff like you would use a normal creditcard, i believe not only that this will be good for crypterium, and its value - which will apreciate dramatically, but will also raise the value of all other cryptos alltogether, as People finally have a means of using them in the day to day life, like you would normal Money.  This will be a huge step forwad in the world of the cryptos, as People realize, yes, you can use your ""insert coin Name here"" to get a coffe at starbucks, without having to go through exchanges, convert it to main currency (bit coin at this time) then bitcoin in fiat, then Transfer fiat on account to be used. Currently this proces takes probably a day or so, even more if you have to wait for fiat to arrive in your account.  Whereas with crypterium, you could do it as if you had cash in your pocket.  Thus i believe this coin has the potential to go into the thousands of Dollars - even tens of thousands, as value, if more and more People learn about it and adopt it, once everything is put in place.  Another positive Thing is, i believe i read somewhere that it is going to be listed relatively fast at Binance. What, never heard of Binance ?  Binance is moving fast to become the biggest and most succesfull Exchange platform on the planet. They also have their own coin, which has a lot of uses, for instance you can pay with it the Transfer fees, and the Transfer fees are halved.  They also have a marvelous application for android, and all trading can be done on the go. I was amazed by how smooth and nicely done their Interface is. After learning of binance i moved all my trading on this platforms. Their Servers Support up to 1.4 mil Transactions per second, and it never lags, compared to other exchanges i wont Name. Even investing into their Coin is worth it, ist on the 42nd place on coinmarket cap.  This will only push the Value of Crypterium even harder up, as more and more People can aquire Crypterium, thus expanding ist user base. Not to mention the fact that with every Transaction, 0.5% is burned away. Now this coin right here, is the reason, i believe, Bitcoin will someday fall, as Bitcoin is like an old Dinosaur, old, slow, and with no practical use.  Whereas stuff that have a usage behind them, will Triumph in the end. ANd i believe the best alternative for Bitcoin going Forward in the future will be IOTA with ist Zero Transaction fees, no blockchain but tangle protocol, which is Quantum Computer hacking proof, and where the Transactions get faster the more Transactions there are. Iota is still in beta stage, and still cheap right now.  Thus beeing said, i believe in this Team, and in their idea, basically you can use crypterium, when ist done, as you own personal bank, and dump normal banksters alltogether. Oh, there will be a Revolution People, mark my words. And if you contribute, you will get to tell your children and grandchildren, you see, my dear, i was in the whole middle of it.  Thus beeing said, if you want to use Binance and dont have an account, do use my refferal link to sign up. https://www.binance.com/?ref=11961571",False

We don't need to have a bank license from day one (for the transactional part). We will have several licensed bank partners.  2.1 Crypterium at the moment of cryptofiat transaction requests user's crypto balance and acknowledges that there is enough crypto. Then we instantly transfer our fiat to merchant in the required sum and withdraw user's crypto at the current best rate (for the user) + commission of 0,5%. We will use our special technology CrypteriumSX (Smart eXchange) to find the best rate for you. More information about CrypteriumSX you can find in our White Paper (https://crypterium.io/wp). Commission of 0.5% is taken in the CRPT tokens equivalent at their average market price and then the amount of tokens goes subsequently to be burned. User can preselect such an option as which cryptocurrency to use, perhaps in different percentages depending on their current trading value.  2.2 We will issue virtual bank cards with third party bank-partners.  2.3 We don't need it, at the beginning it's possible because our partner banks already have all required permissions. This is the popular case to launch a payment solution.  2.4 Please specify what do you mean?  2.5 It will be possible to add the virtual card to ApplePay, as it will support it",False

They have raised 1997 BTC as the price of CRPT is determined in BTC not USD and at the current valuation of 8900 USD/BTC the fiat equivalent raised is atm 17.8M $. But if/ when the price fluctuates it will change - hopefully to upside. One year ago the raised USD equivalent would have been 2M $ in the same ammount of BTC. Capish? In 10 Years the value could be 850M $ if BTC would go to 500k $ per USD.  The problem in pricing something in BTC/ETH or any other crypto is that the companys expenses are in fiat money (USD/EUR etc.). So the problem is that the volatility of the crypto to where the project token ICO fundraising is pegged has major influence in the outcome of the project.  It seems that the support isn't any more answering questions here but if they are it would be great if they could clarify how/when they will plan to exchange the risen crypto to USD/EUR to safeguard the projects funding.,False

At the current price of BTC they could sell only 60M:ish CRPT coins/tokens before they hit the 47M USD cap and probably lot less as BTC is most probably going north also in the coming weeks. Not the 210M as presented in the materials (70% of 300M max allocation of CRPT coins) as it would be worth over 150M+ USD!!  I was asking that are the BTC covnverted to fiat instantly at some exchange or are they held until end of the ICO and then converted or some other plans? FUD would be that they're hoarding BTC for speculative means and thats the most riskiest scenario as the price is very volatile. So lets say they get the hard cap 47M worth of BTC at current BTC/USD price. The ICO ends and all is fine and unsold tokens are ""burned"" but the BTC's gathered from the ICO are still in HODL and no hedges are made. Then the price of BTC goes -50%, -30% etc. or it goes +50% What happens to the project funding and possible USD loss or profit from the BTC? Their funding won't be sufficent to the planned budget any more if they haven't sold/hedged their BTC to USD and it drops. Or will they get free money to the company stake holders if/when the BTC rockets and they get extra USD? Or is the surpluss allocated to the community somehow (buy back scheme etc.)?  Normally companies have risk management and would be interesting if that in the funding of this magnitude of project would be just ""forgotten""...  So some conspiracy theory could be that this ICO is this a nice swap of CRPT coin to BTC to the company stockholders and other innercircle that will keep the BTC and speculate with the price going to the MOON? There is no worries if that happens if the price fluctuation is hedged away so in the worst case scenario the pipeline funding and budget won't be affected.",False

So let's make a simple math:  300M coins from where 70% is allocated to community so 210M coins for 0.0001 BTC each. Lets assume that there isn't any premiums offered. Hard cap is 47M USD. 210M CRPT/47M USD * 10000 would assume BTC price of 2238 USD per BTC. If premiums are calculated the price would be slightly higher (with average premiun of 10% allocated it would be around 2500 USD/BTC. So now the BTCUSD is roughly 8000 and to reach the hard cap it would mean that under 1/3 of the 210M CRPT could be allocated to meet the hard cap. What if BTC will rise to the MOON and be 10k+ in one month? Will you calculate the monetary value of the moneys recieved by the transaction time value or will you hoard the BTC and look the value at the end of ICO? Are you excahnging the BTC right away to fiat or do you keep them invested in BTC?,False

Thanks for interesting questions!  If the Token is only available for pre-release as part of the ICO, are you not limiting the customer base? - CRPT will be available for purchase for the whole period of ICO and after it hits exchanges. We will operate globally and do not have any limitations for participants whatsoever.  If the Token is a ""FlyBuys"" loyalty program and not a security or currency, then why will it be listed as a currency on exchanges? How can it be all of these things at once? - CRPT is a utility token serving as fuel for transactions in Crypterium system, similar to GAS in Ethereum blockchain, just as simple as this, and it will be traded on exchanges as a unit of service which is a transaction in case of Crypterium.  If the Token is necessary for a customer, and the Token is part of the ICO, is this not just adding FIAT layers to a Decentralised market? - CRPT as fuel is required for every single transaction, it's like we are selling coupons for future transactions now. Sorry, didn't get what you mean by ""adding FIAT layers to a Decentralised market"".  For example: I cannot conduct a transaction in BTC without the Token, this forces me to purchase Tokens, adding cost. Although Cryptariums forecast fees are a fraction of what we now go through exchanging FIAT currencies to get them into Exchanges, (which are using exorbitant fees currently available as well as non exact market pricing in order to transfer hard currency into crypto currency) and you wish to force the customer to take a ""loan"" then add a Credit Card, then a shop purchase fee ... It just seems to me that although these are micro fees, there seems to be fees all along a transaction for a customer - or am I over thinking this? - The process basically looks like this: a user has his crypto funds in Crypterium wallet and wants to spend them, he goes to a shop and buys a Snickers chocolate bar, he pays via NFC with his mobile phone where he has virtual card emulated, when he confirms the transaction the shop receives the pay in fiat which is credited by Crypterium at an average exchange rate (see for Crypterium Smart Exchange algorithm) VS crypto being spent, after the payment is done with the shop we withdraw necessary amount in crypto form user's wallet. Crypterium profit is payed by the shop, it's included in acquirer bank and card issuing bank commissions, user only pays 0,5% as the price for the fuel which is burnt after purchase to allow transaction to be performed.",False

Also, in order to bring cryptobanking to the same level with traditional you need crypto community to expand to a much wider audience.

We are not planning to work with traditional banking partners for too long and going to apply for our own banking license in 2019. But even after that our cryptobank will provide services in both crypto and fiat ecosystems which we believe to be one of our strongest strategic advantages. Our mobile bank with standard everyday services will be launched in Q1 2018.  Additional launch services will include: − Multi-currency transactions (write-off multiple currencies simultaneously) − Photo-payments – simply take a photo of the invoice and send to Crypterium and we’ll do the rest (this may incur additional charges) − QR payments for Crypterium infrastructure users  Following services is planning to be included: − Traditional banking services (following the acquisition of a banking licence) that will enable classical banking services to co-exist with cryptocurrency services − Peer to peer crypto and fiat currency transfer − Interest earning crypto deposits − Banking statements − Salary accounts  As for the second aspect of your concern cards not even physical, but virtual are no more than a payment tool, transportation channel if you like. There is no point in climbing a mountain when you have a tunnel, right?

I have just read your White Paper and have a few questions that I hope the forum can assist with. Please don't take me for a ""hater"" I just want to clarify a few points as I have probably ""over thought"" your documentation:  If the Token is only available for pre-release as part of the ICO, are you not limiting the customer base?  If the Token is a ""FlyBuys"" loyalty program and not a security or currency, then why will it be listed as a currency on exchanges? How can it be all of these things at once?  If the Token is necessary for a customer, and the Token is part of the ICO, is this not just adding FIAT layers to a Decentralised market?  For example: I cannot conduct a transaction in BTC without the Token, this forces me to purchase Tokens, adding cost. Although Cryptariums forecast fees are a fraction of what we now go through exchanging FIAT currencies to get them into Exchanges, (which are using exorbitant fees currently available as well as non exact market pricing in order to transfer hard currency into crypto currency) and you wish to force the customer to take a ""loan"" then add a Credit Card, then a shop purchase fee ... It just seems to me that although these are micro fees, there seems to be fees all along a transaction for a customer - or am I over thinking this?  Anyway, thanks everyone for your feedback in my attempt to expand my knowledge of your future company",False

From the viewpoint of a new Crypterium user :  1) No matter how much BTC/ETH/<other supported> coins I've, I need to buy Crypterium credit token for performing transaction in Crypterium system. 2) Even though the transaction cost is 0.5% of the total transaction coin amount, if the Crypterium token value is very fluctuating, I either end up paying a very high or low transaction fee (comparing with the value of original coin used for transaction).  From the view point of an investor who bought token for (long term/short term)profit:  1) If I don't do any transaction in Crypterium system, the only way I will get profit is when the Crypterium token price goes up. 2) For Crypterium company to be successful, it doesn't need Crypterium token to go up in value. These are two orthogonal things. 3) With this ICO, Crypterium is looking to create user base along with getting money to bootstrap the company.  Does these observations make any sense? I'm seeing this ICO more of an invitation for early adapters to the system (with some perks) than an investment.  Also the white paper lacks technical depth (may be that's an okay thing, I'm new here) compared to other white paper such as Stratis and missing many ""how to"" on various technical capabilities the system offering.

You can use our payment app right after installation, without need to wait your plastic card for 2 weeks. 2.

We are sure that we will cope with this task, because we have extensive experience in creating payment solutions. 3. We are focused not only on working with the existing crypto community, which now consists of just a few million people, but also with an audience that is still only interested in crypto-world and is afraid to buy crypto-currencies. We created the system, which will motivate dozens of millions of new users to connect with crypto-payments.  As for ""a link to follow the investment process"", what exactly do you mean?",False

Please could I just have some clarification. When we purchase these tokens. Do they appear in a Crypterium Crypto Wallet or do they just appear in our account and we then have to transfer them to our own wallet?  My second question is; once they (tokens) are received can we convert/exchange them into Ethereum via an exchange/wallet or the Crypterium application OR would it be best to keep hold of the tokens until price goes up? Very new to this so I probably sound a little stupid but how would the token price actually go up? Basically what I’m asking also is why consider an option to purchase the tokens rather than just buy ethereum directly from an exchange? Thank you for your help.  Aaron,False

They decide so many things, how you keep your money, how money is created and what and how you use your money. Crypterium takes away a lot of that control by putting it in the hands of the user. At the same time, it makes it easier for the normal user to use and store and exchange crypto.

About the legal side of burning tokens. Actually, the mechanics is as follows. We as a Crypterium company doesn't burn tokens, it's fully decentralized process. When users make transactions they need 'gas' for the transaction to be processed in Crypterium, so these 0.5% of charge they pay - goes for buying CRPT tokens on the market (in fact by users) with their subsequent burning. This is automatically managed on a decentralised smart contract basis and we are not involved in the process.  Please let me know if it's clear. And thanks for your interesting question again!",False

Basically to fit in one of the listed loyalty groups and start receiving cashback a user has to continuously own a certain amount of tokens for 1 month. In other words owning tokens in bigger or lesser amount will lead you to one of the loyalty groups.  Each loyalty group is assigned particular percentage of monthly cashback fund (MCF) going to that particular loyalty group. Here we see how 100% of MCF is divided between all loyalty groups.  Next thing you should know is that all transaction values made by all users belonging to a certain loyalty group are totaled up every month for that loyalty group alone. This allows us to see the share of every user in total value of transactions. Based on that share the user will be rewarded exactly same share of the total MCF for his loyalty group.  In other words amount of tokens owned by a user stands as a basis for his inclusion in one of the loyalty groups, each loyalty group gets a dedicated share of MCF, and the share user has in all monthly transactions within a loyalty group equals his personal share in MCF portion for his loyalty group.",False

You say that customer won't pay a penny, but now you say that a small fee of 0,5% is charged to perform a buy back. Pls clarify.  Next.  Quote from: Mike | Crypterium on October 11, 2017, 12:20:28 AM Quote from: Firered on October 11, 2017, 12:13:38 AM I've read that you are going to give special bonuses to token holders, but didn't quite get how are you going to recieve an income rather than 0.5% which goes on buybacking your tokens(right?)  From the merchants that accept the payments. Today all merchants are charged for acquiring services, whether this is Visa, MasterCard, American Express etc., measured as a percentage of the payment they receive. Some of these fees can be as high as 5% to 6%. Working with our partner acquiring bank, Crypterium will also earn fees (currently 0.49% but this could change as volume increases), from which 0.15% (approximately 30% of the 0.49%) will be used to thank our CRPT token-holders and the most active users through the acquisition distribution of CRPT tokens via a monthly cashback fund (MCF).  You say 30% from 0,49% that is 0,15%. but where is 0,5%?",False

Our answer to the first question should be verified by the team, I've forwarded it. Will answer soon.  Let me clarify on the second and third questions. There are two fees as follows: - First is acquiring part of 0.49% which all merchants are charged. It could be changed as volume increases. - Second is transaction charge of 0.5% which is payed by customers. We liken this process to that of the combustion engine that needs gasoline to run. To keep all parts of our transaction engine running in perfect harmony, Crypterium needs fuel. We fuel each transaction by burning a small amount of CRPT (0.5%) every time a payment is made, which in turn distributes its energy (monetary value) to all parts of the business, including our Token-holders. This is automatically managed on a decentralised smart contract basis.  Please note that this 0.5% is applied to the best currency rate on the market. The rate is ensured by CrypteriumSX (Smart eXchange) technology and is based on the most efficient bid-offer matching across natural peer-to-peer flow as well as third party crypto-exchanges. For the details please refer to our wp section 3.1.1 CrypteriumSX (Smart eXchange).",False

Crypto asset and currencies are contained in digital smart contract wallets. Using currently available smart contract wallet technology, there is no need for customers to move money out of their wallets and into Crypterium, Crypterium will simply debit the appropriate amount from the wallets in the predefined manner as identified by the payment protocols, and displays the remaining balances to the customer within the Crypterium mobile banking App.  In this way, the customer will be able to see all their Crypto assets in one place, whilst at the same time being able to spend them in practically any order or mix of their desire, even if the assets are in different wallets, in the secure knowledge that Crypterium has no access to such assets unless the smart contract triggering payment takes place.

Crypterium at the moment of cryptofiat transaction requests user's crypto balance and acknowledges that there is enough crypto. Then we instantly transfer our fiat to merchant in the required sum and withdraw user's crypto at the current best rate (for the user) + commission of 0,5%. We will use our special technology CrypteriumSX (Smart eXchange) to find the best rate for you. More information about CrypteriumSX you can find in our White Paper (see section 3.1.1 https://crypterium.io/wp). Commission of 0.5% goes to buying CRPT tokens from the market and subsequently burning them.  User can preselect such an option as which cryptocurrency to use, perhaps in different percentages depending on their current trading value.  So, Crypterium does all the communication and payment in fiat without the user having to do anything other than bring up their smartphone to the NFC terminal and press go. Only the exact amount of tokens in the order and ratio prescribed are exchanged to meet the payment needs.",False

Working with QR codes, the company moved to commercial operations in 2015, and quickly became a leader in the Appstore rankings for Google Play, was named as one of the top 100 Russian start-ups one of the top 50 start-ups with international potential, was awarded the top prizes for its antivirus solutions at the Emerging Challenges Competition and best innovation of the year (2016) at the safety leaders awards in the Financial services category. Further prestigious awards and recognition continued into 2017 including Russia’s Ministry of Communications selecting PayQR to showcase at the world Mobile Congress in China. Today, users of the platform include many European banks and technology leaders such as Alipay (for Russia).",False
