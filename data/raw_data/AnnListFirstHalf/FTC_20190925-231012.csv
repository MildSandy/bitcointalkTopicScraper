The ERC20 standard are fully described here.  A token on Ethereum is basically a balance in an Ethereum contract. A contract could be programmed to issue tokens when it receives its own proof of work: double sha256 is readily available, since the Ethereum Virtual Machine has a precompiled contract for sha256.  You are also could check this example of PoW token.  The tokens are ERC20 and ERC223 compatible and can be traded openly on all compatible exchanges, different algorithms require differing amounts of effort to produce tokens of the same difficulty, the current implementations are: SHA3 (Ethereum) SHA256 Elliptic Curve (secp256k1)",False

I believe that we can provide our users with some innovations, which would lead us to success. As example we are developing great platform for ICO in Ethereum Network, this platform is a part of FutureCoin. We are also developing solutions for e-commerce projects which will allow easily integrate new payment method into any web-store in a few clicks and start to receive payments in FutureCoins. The third product which is in a process - is an advertising network, where FutureCoin is an only payment method.  We are also providing a fair smart-contracts with a 100% refund in case if we don't collect the amount of money necessary for further development.  If you are saying this is pyramid - you are a bit wrong. This is called Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) - is a controversial marketing strategy for the sale of products or services where the revenue of the MLM company is derived from a non-salaried workforce (also called participants, and variously known as ""salespeople"", ""distributors"", ""consultants"", ""promoters"", ""independent business owners"", etc.) selling the company's products/services, while the earnings of the participants is derived from a pyramid-shaped commission system.  Classical pyramid do not have actual product - we have. But nowadays market is huge and very competitive, so we should stay on the way somehow...  I will prepare a full presentation of products we will introduce for our users and it will be publicly accessible and also will publish theme here.",False
