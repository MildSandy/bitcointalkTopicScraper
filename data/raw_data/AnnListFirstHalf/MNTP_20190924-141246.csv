In addition, in the nearest time, it will be possible to buy and sell GOLD for Fiat (at the moment only for ETH). We offer all traders to earn on arbitrage between our fixed price and the price of GOLD on Yobit, Bancor and Idex. Our KYC system (Know Your Customer) is multi-stage and kind of complicated, but since our wallet - is like a border between fiat and crypto worlds - otherwise, it can not work.

""GOLD"" - has the same ounce as physical gold price, ""MNTP"" is a utility token and its price depends not on gold price, but rather on the ""GOLD"" coin turnover.  3. We use our own blockchain with a unique proof-of-stake protocol of consensus.  4. We are developing a gold-specialized ATM-like machine - ""Custody bot"" which is a one of a kind device for evaluating, storing, buying and selling physical gold.  5.

Yes, sure. In order to always have sufficient funds to repurchase all of GOLD’s crypto assets at the current price of gold, GoldMint successfully opened an account with the well-known broker WedBush. This broker gives GoldMint the opportunity to buy and sell supply futures (and physical gold at London’s OTC market) on both the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the London Mercantile Exchange (LMA). As a subject of the OTC market, the company chose SGPMX (Singapore), which is well suited for our customers from Southeast Asia. In addition to this, the company, like any other participant, admitted to trade professionally in physical gold and has an account with Brinks.  And you always can check information on this page: https://www.goldmint.io/transparency  Best regards, Team GoldMint",False

You can find roadmap onour main page: https://www.goldmint.io   Quote from: jmjhayem on May 12, 2018, 06:08:06 AM Great Project. I just checked the website and its really a great project supported by the community and backed up by superb development team  Thank you for support!  Quote from: blockchi on May 12, 2018, 02:08:21 AM But this is just a name or indeed a tool for coin payments  Not only name, our project has many usecases for GOLD, for example:  -is equally stable as physical gold and has much lower volatility compared to any other currency; -brings traditional investors to the market of crypto as it gives them a transparent and reliable tool with a long history behind; -can be used as a payment instrument for businesses and individuals all over the world;  Quote from: minhdat3979 on May 11, 2018, 02:37:19 AM GOLD TOKEN WON’T BE LISTED ON ANY EXCHANGE, CORRECT? AND LET’S SAY IF I WANT TO BUY IT, GIVEN THAT IT REQUIRES THE ‘KYC’, HOW AND WHERE WILL YOU SELL YOUR TOKEN?   GOLD is listed on bancor.network , Simex , Idex at the moment. And also you will beable to buy on our official website through the personal account. Weplan to upgade it on the May 16th.   Quote from: awaish1234 on May 11, 2018, 02:01:49 AM What is the price of one token? How can I invest?   You can check the price of MNTP here: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/goldmint/   And buy it here:  You can find us on Bancor https://www.bancor.network/discover  Also Idex: https://idex.market/eth/mntp   Here you can find rates for BTC on Yobit https://yobit.net/en/trade/MNTP/BTC   Soon there will be more exchanges available. Thank you.   Quote from: ogzgenc on May 11, 2018, 01:10:10 AM  Another addition to those cryptos backed by precious metals primarily by gold. How this project differs from the other token or coins backed by gold like  goldblocks, Xaurum and some others?   Unlike other gold-backed cryptocurrency, GoldMint provides a different business model and technical supply.  1. We use physical gold, that we buy and sell on exchanges, to secure our crypto assets. It gives more liquidity to our coin.  2. We have 2 different coins - ""GOLD"" and ""MNTP"". ""GOLD"" - has the same ounce as physical gold price, ""MNTP"" is a utility token and its price depends not on gold price, but rather on the ""GOLD"" coin turnover.  3. We use our own blockchain with a unique proof-of-stake protocol of consensus.  4. We are developing a gold-specialized ATM-like machine - ""Custody bot"" which is a one of a kind device for evaluating, storing, buying and selling physical gold.  5. We plan on to develop investment marketplace for gold mining, pawnshops, gold trading companies. People will invest our GOLD coin into different businesses with different interests.   Quote from: BojkuSkender on May 11, 2018, 09:23:37 AM Hi is there any coin burn or staking? Thanks  Tokens won't be burnt.  Quote from: Bernadin91 on May 11, 2018, 01:02:39 PM hoang I Love MoneyToken: I am starting to know your platform, but some aspects are already attracting my attention. for example, using its own chain of blocks and altcoin, called MNT, for GOLD.O transactions that your storage unit is programmed to automatically identify and store gold jewelry, small ingots (up to 100 grams) and coins, without intervention paper. That already says a lot about your project   We really serious plans. So just follow and be with us.

At present, you can buy and sell the crypto asset on the bancor.network and Simex exchanges for one of the crypto-currencies represented on it. We have a ready-made smart contract, available on GitHub, that regulates the turnover of GOLD. Also, we have completed the development of a personal cabinet for holders of the GOLD asset.  Because of the prohibitive policy of banks and payment systems, we made the decision to list GOLD on the bancor.network and simex exchange without waiting for the fiat gateway. On the exchange, you can buy and sell GOLD for any of the 50 crypto-currencies that are part of the bancor.network. We, in turn, will carry out market-making, supporting the GOLD course in accordance with the course for CME. Unfortunately, it is still difficult to ensure a 100% correspondence, considering the delays in the purchase and sale of GoldMint assets. However, in general, our users will receive a stable, gold-secured crypto asset and will finally be able to use our second utility—the MNTP token—for one of our goals: to obtain preferential commission terms for transactions with GOLD.   In order to always have sufficient funds to repurchase all of GOLD's crypto assets at the current price of gold, GoldMint successfully opened an account with the well-known broker WedBush (account SWT3458) on March 5 after undergoing multiple tests. This broker provides us with the opportunity to buy and sell supply futures (and physical gold at London’s OTC market) on both the CME and the LME exchange.   We also agreed to partnership with the Singapore precious metals exchange (sgpmx.com). This partnership will allow our customers to exchange GOLD tokens for physical gold and vice versa, provided they also have an account on SGPMX. The gold can be delivered directly to the customer's home after the payment of transportation fees.   Stay tuned and see the latest updates in our blog and on the website.

And the ICO finished since 6 months ago? It is the slower price increase in an ICO i am participating...  Quote from: Genovese on February 25, 2018, 11:45:36 PM This is an interesting point that should be explained: if the Goldmint token is really backed by gold, how on earth can its value tank 3 or 4 times lower than ICO price? Gold did not lose 3 or 4 times its value. Would someone please explain that?  We are going to develop a graphene based custom tailored blockchain serving two tokens at least: GOLD and MNT(MNTP). MNTP tokens were 6$ each on ICO and now available for sale on exchanges. MNTP tokens are not gold-backed but holders will get rewards in GOLD tokens by verifying transactions according to holders token stake held. GOLD tokens are backed by a gold ounce each with an equal price. GOLD tokens will get issued in 2Q 2018 first on ETH. Then transferred to our own blockchain launched in 2Q 2018 as well.

Quote from: mylabs01 on February 11, 2018, 11:33:31 PM i think they will update it soon. i also checked it right now, so this means that MNTP is listed on three exchange already. yobit, ED, and bancor. but are they planing to list it on a bigger one? how about topia, kucoin, livecoin will do also.  With the release of MVP we are going to launch our huge marketing campaign including listings on bigger exchanges. An option of selling GOLD tokens on exchanges will be available without proceeding KYC.  Quote from: Johnny00 on February 23, 2018, 06:10:50 PM What are the 6m tokens going to be used for? thats a huge float and probably a reason why this coin dropped.  These unsold 6M MNTP tokens will be sold to more investors for a price higher than on our ICO.

After verification, smart contracts can be used in the web interface, and almost everything will be ready to launch our platform.  By the way, smart contracts were written on one of the latest updates of #Solidity 0.4.19 (who does not know - this is the programming language of smart contracts). For example, this allowed us to divide business logic and data in the architecture of smart contracts. In short, if we suddenly find an error in a smart contract, we can quickly fix it and update the contract without losing any user data. In previous versions of the compiler, this was much more complicated.  At the same time, we continue our work on our own blockchain.

Therefore, the post is not the last  In May 2017 we announced the creation of GoldMint - a blockchain-based platform wich operates gold-backed cryptoassets GOLD. In less than a week we held Pre ICO - without an advertising campaign and with a virtually zero marketing budget. For 36 hours we managed to sell 300 thousand MNTP tokens worth $600 thousand. The project was invested by Igor Ryabenkiy, Managing Partner of AltaIR, Alex Butmanov, Managing Partner of DTI, Evgeny Ezhov, General Partner of Omega Investment Solutions, and others. When we saw that such serious investors believe in our project, we did not have any doubts of success.  We set the ICO date on September 20. And we had just over three months to prepare it: we had to launch a website, plan and conduct an international marketing company, write smart contracts, provide legal support, and so on and so forth. There was not much time, but we managed. And we managed despite the fact that right in the middle of the road we had to seriously review the strategy (but not the essence) of the project. At the end of July, the US Securities Commission (SEC) issued a press release stating that “security” tokens are equated with securities, and therefore should be regulated as well as shares. We had to figure out how to make MNTP security tokens not security - it required some modification of the concept, as well as additional costs, including for programmers. We had to close the ICO for the citizens of the US and Canada, until the position of the regulator of these countries regarding the ICO becomes more certain. We wanted to follow the laws of all countries in which our company somehow plans to work. And we adhere to this principle up to now.  Shortly before the launch of our ICO, the Chinese government banned its citizens this investment tool. As a result, the way to investors of the biggest crypto markets - the USA and China - was closed for us. Despite this, GoldMint managed to attract investments about $ 7 million (at the exchange rate at the end of the ICO on November 11). This is more than enough to fulfill all obligations to investors in 2018. We work in accordance with the road map announced before the ICO and confirm all the terms.  The main emphasis in the first month of the new year we will do on the promotion of the GOLD token. Including for this we hired a new marketing director - earlier this position in the company was vacant. We have been looking for the right specialist for a very long time, and we are very happy that we are entering the new year with a new employee on this important post . We will present him in the new year.  GOLD tokens will be launched in the first quarter of 2018. To do this, we are preparing to launch a new site from which users can buy or sell GOLD tokens. In January, the alpha- and then the beta version of the site will be ready. We have already written the smart contracts necessary to launch GoldMint on the Ethereum network. And in the second quarter of 2018 we will launch the platform on our own blockchain. We integrated with the online user verification (Shufti Pro) to comply with the law: verification is necessary for transactions with turnover of more than 1000 euros per month. At the same time, we are working on our utility-tokens MNTP. They are already traded on the exchanges Ether Delta and Yobit.net, negotiations are being held with other major exchanges. We are sure that with the launch of #GOLD, the price of #MNTP tokens will only grow.  This is only a small part of what we managed to do in the seven months that have passed since the launch of GoldMint. We know that we still have a long way to go to realize our ideas and dreams. And we are sure that we will manage to do this - thanks to our hard work and your support.  We wish everyone a happy New Year!:) _______________________________________________________________",False

Everyone will be able to check how much gold GoldMint has and how many GOLD cryptoassets the company issued. - There would be decentralized storage of physical gold. This will be achieved by agreements with major banks and pawnbrokers all over the world. - The company fully complies with all legal and regulatory laws of the operating countries.

I thought that MNTP/BNT was to be up and running by the end of this year. I tried to find info on this but cannot find any info anywhere.  Also more than half of the MNTP tokens sold value were only 0.1 MNTP. Looks like all of these tokens were computer generated and were only seconds between each purchase. So did GOLDMINT make all of these 0.1 MNTP purchases and what is the purpose of buying 0.1 MNTP. Is it somehow to be used for manipulating price of MNTP ?   ,False

This was one of the most successful ICO.  Later, in October 2017, #GoldMint became one of the first project that announced Bancor Protocol Integration (here is more info about this in our blog https://blog.goldmint.io/goldmint-press-release-16-10-2017-…).  And yesterday Bancor has launched a live product that allows anyone to buy and sell tokens in the Bancor Network directly from the web, at prices automatically calculated by the open source Bancor Protocol formula, wrote Forbes (https://goo.gl/hZmtsg).  “The Foundation is now introducing a handful of significant new features, helping end-users to adopt the product more widely and new partners that are continuously announced to streamline integration into the network. The newly deployed functionality, announced partners, and expanded 2018 'bounty program' show the solid progress and positive momentum Bancor has achieved in six short months since its ICO”.  First, we want to congratulate our partners with such a great achievement that the company managed to achieve in only six months after ICO. Impressive result, which inspires and our team too.  We also want to say that our partnership continues, and we are confident that its results will benefit both GoldMint and Bancor, as well as our present and future investors and buyers of our #MNTP and #GOLD tokens.  We will inform you more about our partnership later. Stay tuned. _______________________________________________________________",False

That volume will be reached with more exchanges coming. We plan to get listed on more exchanges during the two months after ICO. MNTP tokens listing on blockfolio will happen soon, too.

The price of one GOLD equals one ounce of physical gold on the LBMA. Applicants who want to trade GOLD for fiat need to undergo GoldMint's KYC procedure. If accepted, the applicant’s GOLD cryptoasset is transferred from his, or her, GoldMint wallet to a special GoldMint account and is converted to fiat. GoldMint sends this fiat to the applicant. So, the price with commissions you receive for buying GOLD is LBMA + 5%, selling - LBMA + 2%. Therefore the way fiat => GOLD => fiat will be 3%.  Quote from: CryptoPromotions on October 19, 2017, 10:05:05 AM what can i do with gold assets?  You can use GOLD assets for the following: Exchange fiat to cryptocurrency - Right now the fiat-cryptocurrency exchange market exceeds $400 million. Experts predict that this will reach billions once banks regulate the cryptocurrency industry. Hedge volatility risks - Traders and other cryptocurrency users can hedge their gold commodity with GOLD on any cryptocurrency trading exchange, without leaving that particular platform. Traders can also diversify their trading portfolio with GOLD assets. Payroll unit- Given its low volatility, you may prefer GOLD to BTC and altcoins for paying employees. Because of its low commissions, high speed, and affordability (no extra charges for transborder payments), you can also use GOLD instead of fiat for regular deals. ICO currency - ICOs can ask for GOLD donations instead of regular cryptocurrency funds to hedge the high volatility risks that tend to accompany cryptocurrency. Buy and transport physical gold - You can convert your physical gold into GOLD in any bank that uses the GoldMint blockchain platform. This not only protects cross-country gold transportation but also simplifies the process.  Quote from: qberty on October 19, 2017, 10:18:19 AM how is gold emitted?  The amount of GOLD that is emitted depends on the amount of physical gold and ETF backing that GoldMint has in its reserves. The amount of GOLD in circulation can never exceed GoldMAn's reserves of physical gold.  With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

The amount payable to the investor is the following: SUM = (1 + (X / 12) * T) * Q where the number X (i.e., x%) is set by GoldMint based on market conditions. T= the amount of months the gold was loaned. Q= the interest tagged to the loan. Example: As of August 2017, the parameters would be X = 10%, Y = 28% per annum, and T = 1 year. This means that GoldMint receives 28% per year, an annual 10% of which goes to the investor.  Quote from: DeeSome on October 18, 2017, 04:19:40 AM what are some of the gold applications?

Details of the miner rotation, miners’ rewards and incentives as well as details related to Custody Bot operations (e.g., assessment, weight, when allocated and withdrawn). Also stored on Graphene are all details related to GoldMInt’s GOLD transactions.  Quote from: BazkieBumpercar on October 17, 2017, 08:07:02 AM Tell us more about hedging risks?  Commercial producers and gold workers, like miners, jewelers, or the government, tended to use gold options, futures and ETF as hedging tools.  Today, a significant amount of investors like to use gold to hedge against inflation or to diversify their investments. In fact, gold became the one common investment  of all metals and has a legendary history as commodity and coin. Like other commodities, gold depends on micro and macro economical and political events, so its value fluctuates along with these. GoldMint not only helps you cushion the risk of this volatility but also gives you the option of taking a short position in physical gold bullion, coins or mining stocks.  Here are some reasons why investors choose GoldMint:  You can hedge your investment in gold using the GOLD token. Doing so protects your gold from bearish conditions. Investors can chose to convert just a portion of their assets or all of it with this GOLD cryptoasset Investors may want to invest in a minimal amount of GOLD to assess whether or not they profit GOLD is based on real physical gold and therefore possesses far more face-value credibility than other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have. The gold market/ gld returns look promising. GoldMint helps investors hedge their risks and promises more for their investments.

If the borrower defaults, his GOLD cryptoassets are transferred to GoldMint.  Quote from: dermo on October 17, 2017, 10:47:15 AM Who is your target audience?  Crypto traders – These participants can use GOLD for hedging cryptocurrency volatility, as described in the white paper. GOLD can also be used to convert cryptocurrency into fiat. Standard investors – These investors may want to buy GOLD as cryptocurrency or as a type of security. E-commerce and self-employed individuals – GOLD can be used to pay for goods and services. Its low volatility asset and predictability make it an invaluable form of currency. Banks – GOLD cryptoassets gives banks new opportunities. There’s free liquidity and extra earning potential from trading gold into fiat and the reverse. Cryptocurrency has become a massive industry. Banks can profit from earning standard commissions, commissions on gold storage, and from using the GoldMint cash management system. At the same time, banks that invest in GOLD reinforce GOLD’s reputation, which increases their profit. Banks also earn commission from participating in the GoldMint partner program. Today the cryptocurrency overall circulation has achieved more than $700 billion a year and the commissions for deposit and withdrawal are more than 5%.  In case the bank sets lower commissions for GOLD buy/sell for a client, most transactions (cryprocurrency deposit and withdrawal) will switch from underground exchanges to the banks. At the same time the integration with GOLD only is necessary, while all the other cryptocurrencies can be purchased on a cryptoexchange directly. Banks also have revenues from cash management and commission charging for gold storing owned by GoldMint company. Still one more source of income for banks is the revenue from the partner program which includes adding GOLD digital asset to the product line of the bank’s department of Wealth Management.

Consensus algorithm :  We use PoS as our primary mining system. In  case  a user who holds many MNT  doesn’t have  enough  computational power, he can rent  computational power from other miners.  Miner rotation  The  amount  of  stakes  depends  on the  amount  of MNT  a miner holds.  So,  if  a miner owns 50% MNT, he will be chosen to process every second block.

Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin), where the algorithm rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining), in PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen in a deterministic (pseudo-random) way, and the chance that an account is chosen depends on its wealth (i.e. the stake). In PoS cryptocurrencies the blocks are usually said to be forged (in the blacksmith sense of this word), or minted, rather than mined. Also, usually all the coins are created in the beginning and the total number of coins never changes afterwards (although there are some other versions of PoS where new coins can be created). Therefore, in the basic version of PoS there are no block rewards (e.g. as in bitcoin); so, the forgers take only the transaction fees.

Quote from: DeeSome on October 16, 2017, 12:43:27 PM How Custody Bot analyse the value of gold?  Gold inspection includes:       ●    Visual  identification  of the product by  an  operator –  coin,  ingot, jewelry, raw gold or gold granules       ●    Evaluation via spectrography using the spectrograph installed within the box         ●    Evaluation and weighing of gold via hydrostatic weighing     Custody  Bot  uses  the  technologies  of  spectral  analysis  and  hydrostatic  weighing  to  inspect the value  of the  gold.  In the  absence  of  a  single  standard,  a  specialist  also manually inspects the jewelry before Custody Bot conducts spectral analysis.  Spectral analysis: the process: Custody  Bot  uses  fluorescence  spectroscopy,  a  type  of  electromagnetic  spectroscopy  that analyzes  fluorescence  from  a  sample.  This technique  involves using  a beam  of  light, usually ultraviolet light, that excites the electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to  emit  light.  An  analyzer  crystal  disperses  radiation  onto  the  gold  via  a  detector.  A computer-controlled  precision   goniometer  moves  the  analyzer  crystal  and  detector  and controls the position, intensity and lengths of secondary radiation waves. Concentration of the analysis is calculated by comparison with known standard samples.   Hydrostatic weighing: the process:  Hydrostatic  weighing  determines  the  density  of  the  gold  and  is  done by weighting the  item first  in  air  then  liquid  and  calculating  the  combined  private  density  (ρ2). Estimation  of density is made by contrasting the density of gold to densities of other metals.   The  initial weighting  lets  define the valuable’s weight (m1) and the second one lets detemine the volume: V=(m1-m2)/ρ2.  Quote from: dcl595 on October 16, 2017, 12:48:14 PM what is custody bot?  Custody Bot is GoldMint's unique device. It is programmed for temporary holding, inspection, long-term storing and conveying of gold jewelry, coins or gold.  With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

Most times, when a person buys GOLD for fiat, the price for GOLD will be LBMA + 5%. When they want to sell their GOLD, the price will be LBMA +3%. The commission for managing gold is 0.2-0.8% per annum, depending on gold volatility and investor traffic. After analyzing the correlation between the value of gold and the stock price of the three largest ETFs - the GLD (announced expense ratio 0.4% ), the IAU ( 0.25% ) and SGOL ( 0.39% ) - we estimate that the real backlog of ETF shares in physical gold is about 0.7% (prices are taken from COMEX on the LME ).  Quote from: qberty on October 16, 2017, 06:41:47 AM do gold commissions depend on the country/citizenship?

You can use GOLD assets for the following: Exchange fiat to cryptocurrency - Right now the fiat-cryptocurrency exchange market exceeds $400 million. Experts predict that this will reach billions once banks regulate the cryptocurrency industry. Hedge volatility risks - Traders and other cryptocurrency users can hedge their gold commodity with GOLD on any cryptocurrency trading exchange, without leaving that particular platform. Traders can also diversify their trading portfolio with GOLD assets. Payroll unit- Given its low volatility, you may prefer GOLD to BTC and altcoins for paying employees. Because of its low commissions, high speed, and affordability (no extra charges for transborder payments), you can also use GOLD instead of fiat for regular deals. ICO currency - ICOs can ask for GOLD donations instead of regular cryptocurrency funds to hedge the high volatility risks that tend to accompany cryptocurrency. Buy and transport physical gold - You can convert your physical gold into GOLD in any bank that uses the GoldMint blockchain platform. This not only protects cross-country gold transportation but also simplifies the process.  Quote from: code on October 16, 2017, 06:12:52 AM how is gold emitted?  The amount of GOLD that is emitted depends on the amount of physical gold and ETF backing that GoldMint has in its reserves.

Gold- because it is a clear metal for general public. Plus, we have a company that buys 450 kg of gold per month from pawnshops all over Russia. These are unclaimed deposits. Therefore, we have our own source of gold - we don't depend on banks.   Today, more than 1% of all gold is kept in pawnshops. In 53% of the cases, gold is bought as a mean of investment. Many people buy coins or small bars of gold. For them Custody Bot is an excellent solution. Coins are the easiest to examine.

ETF (Exchange Traded Funds) - An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a marketable security that tracks an index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets like an index fund. Unlike mutual funds, an ETF trades like a common stock on a stock exchange.  The three most popular ETFs are “Spiders” (ticker (NYSEARCA:SPY)), “Diamonds” (ticker (NYSEARCA:DIA)) and “Qs” or """"Qubes"""" (ticker (NASDAQ:QQQ)).  Top ETFs for gold can be found on ETFDB . The commission for the management of a portfolio of gold is 0.2-0.8% per annum, depending on the volatility of gold and the inflow / outflow of investors. After analyzing the correlation between the value of gold and the stock price of the three largest ETFs - the GLD (announced expense ratio 0.4% ), the IAU ( 0.25% ) and SGOL ( 0.39% ) - we estimate that the real backlog of ETF shares in physical gold is about 0.7% (prices are taken from COMEX on the LME ).

Differences   between   Goldmint   and   other  gold   cryptocurrency   blockchains  include  the  following:              Goldmint uses its own blockchain and altcoin, called MNT, for GOLD transactions.             Goldmint  uses Proof-of-Stake where miners  are  doled blocks/ transactions  according   to the  amount  of MNT they have. Proof  of  stake  (PoS)  is  faster,  simpler and                 cheaper  than proof of work (PoW).           Physical gold and ETFs are stored in a programmed decentralized storage unit.          Custody Bot    -   Goldmint’s   innovative  storage unit  is programmed to automatically  identify  and  store  gold  jewelry,  small  ingots  (up  to  100  grams)  and  coins without human intervention.

Crypto traders – These participants can use GOLD for hedging cryptocurrency volatility, as described in the white paper. GOLD can also be used to convert cryptocurrency into fiat. Standard investors – These investors may want to buy GOLD as cryptocurrency or as a type of security. E-commerce and self-employed individuals – GOLD can be used to pay for goods and services. Its low volatility asset and predictability make it an invaluable form of currency. Banks – GOLD cryptoassets gives banks new opportunities. There’s free liquidity and extra earning potential from trading gold into fiat and the reverse. Cryptocurrency has become a massive industry. Banks can profit from earning standard commissions, commissions on gold storage, and from using the GoldMint cash management system. At the same time, banks that invest in GOLD reinforce GOLD’s reputation, which increases their profit. Banks also earn commission from participating in the GoldMint partner program. Today the cryptocurrency overall circulation has achieved more than $700 billion a year and the commissions for deposit and withdrawal are more than 5%.  In case the bank sets lower commissions for GOLD buy/sell for a client, most transactions (cryprocurrency deposit and withdrawal) will switch from underground exchanges to the banks. At the same time the integration with GOLD only is necessary, while all the other cryptocurrencies can be purchased on a cryptoexchange directly. Banks also have revenues from cash management and commission charging for gold storing owned by GoldMint company. Still one more source of income for banks is the revenue from the partner program which includes adding GOLD digital asset to the product line of the bank’s department of Wealth Management.

Like other commodities, gold depends on micro and macro economical and political events, so its value fluctuates along with these. GoldMint not only helps you cushion the risk of this volatility but also gives you the option of taking a short position in physical gold bullion, coins or mining stocks.  Here are some reasons why investors choose GoldMint:  You can hedge your investment in gold using the GOLD token. Doing so protects your gold from bearish conditions. Investors can chose to convert just a portion of their assets or all of it with this GOLD cryptoasset Investors may want to invest in a minimal amount of GOLD to assess whether or not they profit GOLD is based on real physical gold and therefore possesses far more face-value credibility than other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have. The gold market/ gld returns look promising. GoldMint helps investors hedge their risks and promises more for their investments.

A  manipulator  forces the product onto scales where it is weighed  twice, once in air then  in liquid.    3. Once  inspection  is  complete,  the  manipulator  returns  the  product  to  one  of  the compartments inside the Custody Bot.  4. The  spectral  data  and  weighting  data  are  fed  into  a  computer  installed  inside  the  box. This measurement  data is encoded on the blockchain, made public to anyone who  wants to see the information. 5. You get a loan in GOLD currency.  Quote from: ianp on October 14, 2017, 07:14:01 AM Can i recieve cryptocurrency or fiat loan from Goldmint?  You may be able to receive a cryptocurrency or fiat loan from GoldMint PTE LTD, using GOLD as collateral. All applicants will need to undergo the KYC procedure. All members who have GOLD receive GoldMint Partner banks credit cards, aligned with VISA and MasterCard systems. To that end, GoldMint plans to create a special bank card  called “ Bogatstvo ” for prominent pawnshops like “ Blago ” and ” Fianit “. Process: GoldMint loan applicants transfer their GOLD as collateral to a certain GoldMint infrastructure element. The rate of the loan is established at the time of giving and remains fixed through the loan period.Applicants needs to consent to GoldMint loan terms to receive the loan. Applicant is given various options for repaying loan amount and for mode of repayment. If the borrower defaults, his GOLD cryptoassets are transferred to GoldMint. Credit card limits are set according to the value of the user’s GOLD.These cards can be used for payment in shops, restaurants and cafes. Interest is accrued to unpaid credit debt. If this remains unpaid, GOLD reverts to GoldMint.  With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

To start mining, you just  needs  to  download  a program  from the  GoldMint repository, launch it on your device, fine-tune it and start mining.

Miner rotation  The  amount  of  stakes  depends  on the  amount  of MNT  a miner holds.  So,  if  a miner owns 50% MNT, he will be chosen to process every second block.

Quote from: BazkieBumpercar on October 14, 2017, 01:48:56 AM Describe PoS and why you chose it? Thank you  Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin), where the algorithm rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining), in PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen in a deterministic (pseudo-random) way, and the chance that an account is chosen depends on its wealth (i.e. the stake). In PoS cryptocurrencies the blocks are usually said to be forged (in the blacksmith sense of this word), or minted, rather than mined. Also, usually all the coins are created in the beginning and the total number of coins never changes afterwards (although there are some other versions of PoS where new coins can be created). Therefore, in the basic version of PoS there are no block rewards (e.g. as in bitcoin); so, the forgers take only the transaction fees  With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

Gold inspection includes:       ●    Visual  identification  of the product by  an  operator –  coin,  ingot, jewelry, raw gold or gold granules       ●    Evaluation via spectrography using the spectrograph installed within the box         ●    Evaluation and weighing of gold via hydrostatic weighing     Custody  Bot  uses  the  technologies  of  spectral  analysis  and  hydrostatic  weighing  to  inspect the value  of the  gold.  In the  absence  of  a  single  standard,  a  specialist  also manually inspects the jewelry before Custody Bot conducts spectral analysis.  Spectral analysis: the process: Custody  Bot  uses  fluorescence  spectroscopy,  a  type  of  electromagnetic  spectroscopy  that analyzes  fluorescence  from  a  sample.  This technique  involves using  a beam  of  light, usually ultraviolet light, that excites the electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to  emit  light.  An  analyzer  crystal  disperses  radiation  onto  the  gold  via  a  detector.  A computer-controlled  precision   goniometer  moves  the  analyzer  crystal  and  detector  and controls the position, intensity and lengths of secondary radiation waves. Concentration of the analysis is calculated by comparison with known standard samples.   Hydrostatic weighing: the process:  Hydrostatic  weighing  determines  the  density  of  the  gold  and  is  done by weighting the  item first  in  air  then  liquid  and  calculating  the  combined  private  density  (ρ2). Estimation  of density is made by contrasting the density of gold to densities of other metals.   The  initial weighting  lets  define the valuable’s weight (m1) and the second one lets detemine the volume: V=(m1-m2)/ρ2.  Quote from: thisisnotmyltcusername on October 13, 2017, 10:37:32 AM what is custody bot?  Custody Bot is GoldMint's unique device.

Hedge volatility risks - Traders and other cryptocurrency users can hedge their gold commodity with GOLD on any cryptocurrency trading exchange, without leaving that particular platform. Traders can also diversify their trading portfolio with GOLD assets. Payroll unit- Given its low volatility, you may prefer GOLD to BTC and altcoins for paying employees. Because of its low commissions, high speed, and affordability (no extra charges for transborder payments), you can also use GOLD instead of fiat for regular deals. ICO currency - ICOs can ask for GOLD donations instead of regular cryptocurrency funds to hedge the high volatility risks that tend to accompany cryptocurrency.

ETF (Exchange Traded Funds) - An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a marketable security that tracks an index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets like an index fund. Unlike mutual funds, an ETF trades like a common stock on a stock exchange.  The three most popular ETFs are “Spiders” (ticker (NYSEARCA:SPY)), “Diamonds” (ticker (NYSEARCA:DIA)) and “Qs” or """"Qubes"""" (ticker (NASDAQ:QQQ)).  Top ETFs for gold can be found on ETFDB . The commission for the management of a portfolio of gold is 0.2-0.8% per annum, depending on the volatility of gold and the inflow / outflow of investors. After analyzing the correlation between the value of gold and the stock price of the three largest ETFs - the GLD (announced expense ratio 0.4% ), the IAU ( 0.25% ) and SGOL ( 0.39% ) - we estimate that the real backlog of ETF shares in physical gold is about 0.7% (prices are taken from COMEX on the LME ).

The characteristics of the GOLD cryptoasset include the following:          100% transparency  of  information  about  all  Gold  owned by GoldMint, disclosing the company’s  gold  reserves  and  its  ability  to  buy  back  GOLD  at  its  current  trading price.          GoldMint  uses the  decentralized blockchain  for  smart  contracts  and  for harboring  its  cryptoassets          GoldMint  uses  ETF  for  liquidity  and  elasticity.  ETF helps you trade  gold  far  faster than physical gold does         A  secured  loan may  contain gold, like jewelry or coins. GoldMint helps you store this collateral in its unique Custody Bot.         The ability to receive passive income as market price of GOLD rises.

A fast user registration system and identification.  Quote from: nenelsparadise on October 12, 2017, 08:21:48 AM Why tokens are Gold-backed? Why not using any other precious metals or other asset?  Gold- because it is a clear metal for general public. Plus, we have a company that buys 450 kg of gold per month from pawnshops all over Russia. These are unclaimed deposits. Therefore, we have our own source of gold - we don't depend on banks.   Today, more than 1% of all gold is kept in pawnshops. In 53% of the cases, gold is bought as a mean of investment. Many people buy coins or small bars of gold. For them Custody Bot is an excellent solution. Coins are the easiest to examine. Initially, we set a task for our engineers to examine the quality of jewellery. They have succeeded and this is way more difficult than examining coins.  Quote from: CryptoPromotions on October 12, 2017, 08:39:14 AM What will happen if audit shows that GoldMint have less physical gold, than GOLD tokens emitted?  If  the  audit  results  show  that,  the  value  of physical gold  is  less than the number  of the GOLD tokens emitted, the  excess  amount  of  GOLD  will  be  written  off  automatically from  the  company  wallet via the  smart contract.

Crypto traders – These participants can use GOLD for hedging cryptocurrency volatility, as described in the white paper. GOLD can also be used to convert cryptocurrency into fiat. Standard investors – These investors may want to buy GOLD as cryptocurrency or as a type of security. E-commerce and self-employed individuals – GOLD can be used to pay for goods and services. Its low volatility asset and predictability make it an invaluable form of currency. Banks – GOLD cryptoassets gives banks new opportunities. There’s free liquidity and extra earning potential from trading gold into fiat and the reverse. Cryptocurrency has become a massive industry. Banks can profit from earning standard commissions, commissions on gold storage, and from using the GoldMint cash management system. At the same time, banks that invest in GOLD reinforce GOLD’s reputation, which increases their profit. Banks also earn commission from participating in the GoldMint partner program. Today the cryptocurrency overall circulation has achieved more than $700 billion a year and the commissions for deposit and withdrawal are more than 5%.  In case the bank sets lower commissions for GOLD buy/sell for a client, most transactions (cryprocurrency deposit and withdrawal) will switch from underground exchanges to the banks. At the same time the integration with GOLD only is necessary, while all the other cryptocurrencies can be purchased on a cryptoexchange directly. Banks also have revenues from cash management and commission charging for gold storing owned by GoldMint company. Still one more source of income for banks is the revenue from the partner program which includes adding GOLD digital asset to the product line of the bank’s department of Wealth Management.

Quote from: granathus on October 11, 2017, 10:11:13 AM Describe PoS and why you chose it? Thank you.  Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin), where the algorithm rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining), in PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen in a deterministic (pseudo-random) way, and the chance that an account is chosen depends on its wealth (i.e. the stake). In PoS cryptocurrencies the blocks are usually said to be forged (in the blacksmith sense of this word), or minted, rather than mined. Also, usually all the coins are created in the beginning and the total number of coins never changes afterwards (although there are some other versions of PoS where new coins can be created). Therefore, in the basic version of PoS there are no block rewards (e.g. as in bitcoin); so, the forgers take only the transaction fees  Quote from: DeeSome on October 11, 2017, 10:17:18 AM how are the rewards for mining determined?

Commercial producers and gold workers, like miners, jewelers, or the government, tended to use gold options, futures and ETF as hedging tools.  Today, a significant amount of investors like to use gold to hedge against inflation or to diversify their investments. In fact, gold became the one common investment  of all metals and has a legendary history as commodity and coin. Like other commodities, gold depends on micro and macro economical and political events, so its value fluctuates along with these. GoldMint not only helps you cushion the risk of this volatility but also gives you the option of taking a short position in physical gold bullion, coins or mining stocks.  Here are some reasons why investors choose GoldMint:  You can hedge your investment in gold using the GOLD token. Doing so protects your gold from bearish conditions. Investors can chose to convert just a portion of their assets or all of it with this GOLD cryptoasset Investors may want to invest in a minimal amount of GOLD to assess whether or not they profit GOLD is based on real physical gold and therefore possesses far more face-value credibility than other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have.

Quote from: BazkieBumpercar on October 11, 2017, 06:18:40 AM How Custody Bot analyse the value of gold?  Gold inspection includes:       ●    Visual  identification  of the product by  an  operator –  coin,  ingot, jewelry, raw gold or gold granules       ●    Evaluation via spectrography using the spectrograph installed within the box         ●    Evaluation and weighing of gold via hydrostatic weighing     Custody  Bot  uses  the  technologies  of  spectral  analysis  and  hydrostatic  weighing  to  inspect the value  of the  gold.  In the  absence  of  a  single  standard,  a  specialist  also manually inspects the jewelry before Custody Bot conducts spectral analysis.  Spectral analysis: the process: Custody  Bot  uses  fluorescence  spectroscopy,  a  type  of  electromagnetic  spectroscopy  that analyzes  fluorescence  from  a  sample.  This technique  involves using  a beam  of  light, usually ultraviolet light, that excites the electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to  emit  light.  An  analyzer  crystal  disperses  radiation  onto  the  gold  via  a  detector.  A computer-controlled  precision   goniometer  moves  the  analyzer  crystal  and  detector  and controls the position, intensity and lengths of secondary radiation waves. Concentration of the analysis is calculated by comparison with known standard samples.   Hydrostatic weighing: the process:  Hydrostatic  weighing  determines  the  density  of  the  gold  and  is  done by weighting the  item first  in  air  then  liquid  and  calculating  the  combined  private  density  (ρ2). Estimation  of density is made by contrasting the density of gold to densities of other metals.   The  initial weighting  lets  define the valuable’s weight (m1) and the second one lets detemine the volume: V=(m1-m2)/ρ2.  With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

ETF (Exchange Traded Funds) - An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a marketable security that tracks an index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets like an index fund. Unlike mutual funds, an ETF trades like a common stock on a stock exchange.  The three most popular ETFs are “Spiders” (ticker (NYSEARCA:SPY)), “Diamonds” (ticker (NYSEARCA:DIA)) and “Qs” or """"Qubes"""" (ticker (NASDAQ:QQQ)).  Top ETFs for gold can be found on ETFDB . The commission for the management of a portfolio of gold is 0.2-0.8% per annum, depending on the volatility of gold and the inflow / outflow of investors. After analyzing the correlation between the value of gold and the stock price of the three largest ETFs - the GLD (announced expense ratio 0.4% ), the IAU ( 0.25% ) and SGOL ( 0.39% ) - we estimate that the real backlog of ETF shares in physical gold is about 0.7% (prices are taken from COMEX on the LME ).

Hedge volatility risks - Traders and other cryptocurrency users can hedge their gold commodity with GOLD on any cryptocurrency trading exchange, without leaving that particular platform. Traders can also diversify their trading portfolio with GOLD assets. Payroll unit- Given its low volatility, you may prefer GOLD to BTC and altcoins for paying employees. Because of its low commissions, high speed, and affordability (no extra charges for transborder payments), you can also use GOLD instead of fiat for regular deals. ICO currency - ICOs can ask for GOLD donations instead of regular cryptocurrency funds to hedge the high volatility risks that tend to accompany cryptocurrency.

Gold- because it is a clear metal for general public. Plus, we have a company that buys 450 kg of gold per month from pawnshops all over Russia. These are unclaimed deposits. Therefore, we have our own source of gold - we don't depend on banks.   Today, more than 1% of all gold is kept in pawnshops. In 53% of the cases, gold is bought as a mean of investment. Many people buy coins or small bars of gold. For them Custody Bot is an excellent solution. Coins are the easiest to examine.

If the borrower defaults, his GOLD cryptoassets are transferred to GoldMint.  Quote from: atariguy on October 09, 2017, 10:53:35 AM Who is your target audience?  Crypto traders – These participants can use GOLD for hedging cryptocurrency volatility, as described in the white paper. GOLD can also be used to convert cryptocurrency into fiat. Standard investors – These investors may want to buy GOLD as cryptocurrency or as a type of security. E-commerce and self-employed individuals – GOLD can be used to pay for goods and services. Its low volatility asset and predictability make it an invaluable form of currency. Banks – GOLD cryptoassets gives banks new opportunities. There’s free liquidity and extra earning potential from trading gold into fiat and the reverse. Cryptocurrency has become a massive industry. Banks can profit from earning standard commissions, commissions on gold storage, and from using the GoldMint cash management system. At the same time, banks that invest in GOLD reinforce GOLD’s reputation, which increases their profit. Banks also earn commission from participating in the GoldMint partner program. Today the cryptocurrency overall circulation has achieved more than $700 billion a year and the commissions for deposit and withdrawal are more than 5%.  In case the bank sets lower commissions for GOLD buy/sell for a client, most transactions (cryprocurrency deposit and withdrawal) will switch from underground exchanges to the banks. At the same time the integration with GOLD only is necessary, while all the other cryptocurrencies can be purchased on a cryptoexchange directly. Banks also have revenues from cash management and commission charging for gold storing owned by GoldMint company. Still one more source of income for banks is the revenue from the partner program which includes adding GOLD digital asset to the product line of the bank’s department of Wealth Management.

Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin), where the algorithm rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining), in PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen in a deterministic (pseudo-random) way, and the chance that an account is chosen depends on its wealth (i.e. the stake). In PoS cryptocurrencies the blocks are usually said to be forged (in the blacksmith sense of this word), or minted, rather than mined. Also, usually all the coins are created in the beginning and the total number of coins never changes afterwards (although there are some other versions of PoS where new coins can be created). Therefore, in the basic version of PoS there are no block rewards (e.g. as in bitcoin); so, the forgers take only the transaction fees.

Details of the miner rotation, miners’ rewards and incentives as well as details related to Custody Bot operations (e.g., assessment, weight, when allocated and withdrawn). Also stored on Graphene are all details related to GoldMInt’s GOLD transactions.  Quote from: dcl595 on October 08, 2017, 03:36:09 AM Tell us more about hedging risks?  Commercial producers and gold workers, like miners, jewelers, or the government, tended to use gold options, futures and ETF as hedging tools.  Today, a significant amount of investors like to use gold to hedge against inflation or to diversify their investments. In fact, gold became the one common investment  of all metals and has a legendary history as commodity and coin. Like other commodities, gold depends on micro and macro economical and political events, so its value fluctuates along with these. GoldMint not only helps you cushion the risk of this volatility but also gives you the option of taking a short position in physical gold bullion, coins or mining stocks.  Here are some reasons why investors choose GoldMint:  You can hedge your investment in gold using the GOLD token. Doing so protects your gold from bearish conditions. Investors can chose to convert just a portion of their assets or all of it with this GOLD cryptoasset Investors may want to invest in a minimal amount of GOLD to assess whether or not they profit GOLD is based on real physical gold and therefore possesses far more face-value credibility than other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have. The gold market/ gld returns look promising. GoldMint helps investors hedge their risks and promises more for their investments.

MNTP is initially released via ICO, after which MNTP tokens will migrate to the GoldMint blockchain, using a 1/1 fork. Then they will receive an MNT ticker.  Quote from: ianp on October 06, 2017, 05:42:50 AM in what way will mntp tokens migrate from ethereum to graphene?  MNTP will first be found on Ethereum and produced via its ERC20 interface.

Today there are more than 60,000 tonnes of gold from the earth extracted, half of which finds its way into the pockets and accounts of “ordinary” people. Our idea is no short of revolutionary: we plan to convert this gold into blockchain-encrypted tokens to help owners protect their valuables, to help investors move their gold can more rapidly and easily from one part of the world to another, and to help companies and individuals hedge their gold against market volatility.  We plan to move in three stages:  To gain access to 1% of global gold circulation (over 300 tonnes) by launching Custody Bot automated storage facilities in pawnshops around the world. To gain access to another 5% of gold circulation by introducing Custody Bot to shopping centers. To gradually gain access to a final 10% of gold reserves, worth more than $100 billion, and to develop a special version of Custody Bot for popular installation.  With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

The Airalab Core platform links Custody Bot to the blockchain.  We are consulting with them because they have a huge expirience about connecting various bots to blockchain  Quote from: actudoran on October 07, 2017, 05:43:36 AM How Custody Bot analyse the value of gold?  Gold inspection includes:       ●    Visual  identification  of the product by  an  operator –  coin,  ingot, jewelry, raw gold or gold granules       ●    Evaluation via spectrography using the spectrograph installed within the box         ●    Evaluation and weighing of gold via hydrostatic weighing     Custody  Bot  uses  the  technologies  of  spectral  analysis  and  hydrostatic  weighing  to  inspect the value  of the  gold.  In the  absence  of  a  single  standard,  a  specialist  also manually inspects the jewelry before Custody Bot conducts spectral analysis.  Spectral analysis: the process: Custody  Bot  uses  fluorescence  spectroscopy,  a  type  of  electromagnetic  spectroscopy  that analyzes  fluorescence  from  a  sample.  This technique  involves using  a beam  of  light, usually ultraviolet light, that excites the electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to  emit  light.  An  analyzer  crystal  disperses  radiation  onto  the  gold  via  a  detector.  A computer-controlled  precision   goniometer  moves  the  analyzer  crystal  and  detector  and controls the position, intensity and lengths of secondary radiation waves. Concentration of the analysis is calculated by comparison with known standard samples.   Hydrostatic weighing: the process:  Hydrostatic  weighing  determines  the  density  of  the  gold  and  is  done by weighting the  item first  in  air  then  liquid  and  calculating  the  combined  private  density  (ρ2). Estimation  of density is made by contrasting the density of gold to densities of other metals.   The  initial weighting  lets  define the valuable’s weight (m1) and the second one lets detemine the volume: V=(m1-m2)/ρ2.  Quote from: spiceminer15 on October 07, 2017, 05:46:57 AM what is custody bot?  Custody Bot is GoldMint's unique device.

You can use GOLD assets for the following: Exchange fiat to cryptocurrency - Right now the fiat-cryptocurrency exchange market exceeds $400 million. Experts predict that this will reach billions once banks regulate the cryptocurrency industry. Hedge volatility risks - Traders and other cryptocurrency users can hedge their gold commodity with GOLD on any cryptocurrency trading exchange, without leaving that particular platform. Traders can also diversify their trading portfolio with GOLD assets. Payroll unit- Given its low volatility, you may prefer GOLD to BTC and altcoins for paying employees. Because of its low commissions, high speed, and affordability (no extra charges for transborder payments), you can also use GOLD instead of fiat for regular deals. ICO currency - ICOs can ask for GOLD donations instead of regular cryptocurrency funds to hedge the high volatility risks that tend to accompany cryptocurrency. Buy and transport physical gold - You can convert your physical gold into GOLD in any bank that uses the GoldMint blockchain platform. This not only protects cross-country gold transportation but also simplifies the process.  Quote from: dermo on October 05, 2017, 05:25:40 AM how is gold emitted?  The amount of GOLD that is emitted depends on the amount of physical gold and ETF backing that GoldMint has in its reserves. The amount of GOLD in circulation can never exceed GoldMAn's reserves of physical gold.  Quote from: BazkieBumpercar on October 05, 2017, 05:29:35 AM which is the maximum amount of gold emitted?  The amount of GOLD emitted depends on (a) the validation of deal/ details stored in the blockchain and (b) on the authenticity and value of gold inspected by Custody Bot.

Proof  of  stake  (PoS)  is  faster,  simpler and                 cheaper  than proof of work (PoW).           Physical gold and ETFs are stored in a programmed decentralized storage unit.          Custody Bot    -   Goldmint’s   innovative  storage unit  is programmed to automatically  identify  and  store  gold  jewelry,  small  ingots  (up  to  100  grams)  and  coins without human intervention.

Gold- because it is a clear metal for general public. Plus, we have a company that buys 450 kg of gold per month from pawnshops all over Russia. These are unclaimed deposits. Therefore, we have our own source of gold - we don't depend on banks.   Today, more than 1% of all gold is kept in pawnshops. In 53% of the cases, gold is bought as a mean of investment. Many people buy coins or small bars of gold. For them Custody Bot is an excellent solution. Coins are the easiest to examine. Initially, we set a task for our engineers to examine the quality of jewellery. They have succeeded and this is way more difficult than examining coins.  With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

Crypto traders – These participants can use GOLD for hedging cryptocurrency volatility, as described in the white paper. GOLD can also be used to convert cryptocurrency into fiat. Standard investors – These investors may want to buy GOLD as cryptocurrency or as a type of security. E-commerce and self-employed individuals – GOLD can be used to pay for goods and services. Its low volatility asset and predictability make it an invaluable form of currency. Banks – GOLD cryptoassets gives banks new opportunities. There’s free liquidity and extra earning potential from trading gold into fiat and the reverse. Cryptocurrency has become a massive industry. Banks can profit from earning standard commissions, commissions on gold storage, and from using the GoldMint cash management system. At the same time, banks that invest in GOLD reinforce GOLD’s reputation, which increases their profit. Banks also earn commission from participating in the GoldMint partner program. Today the cryptocurrency overall circulation has achieved more than $700 billion a year and the commissions for deposit and withdrawal are more than 5%.  In case the bank sets lower commissions for GOLD buy/sell for a client, most transactions (cryprocurrency deposit and withdrawal) will switch from underground exchanges to the banks. At the same time the integration with GOLD only is necessary, while all the other cryptocurrencies can be purchased on a cryptoexchange directly. Banks also have revenues from cash management and commission charging for gold storing owned by GoldMint company. Still one more source of income for banks is the revenue from the partner program which includes adding GOLD digital asset to the product line of the bank’s department of Wealth Management.

Commercial producers and gold workers, like miners, jewelers, or the government, tended to use gold options, futures and ETF as hedging tools.  Today, a significant amount of investors like to use gold to hedge against inflation or to diversify their investments. In fact, gold became the one common investment  of all metals and has a legendary history as commodity and coin. Like other commodities, gold depends on micro and macro economical and political events, so its value fluctuates along with these. GoldMint not only helps you cushion the risk of this volatility but also gives you the option of taking a short position in physical gold bullion, coins or mining stocks.  Here are some reasons why investors choose GoldMint:  You can hedge your investment in gold using the GOLD token. Doing so protects your gold from bearish conditions. Investors can chose to convert just a portion of their assets or all of it with this GOLD cryptoasset Investors may want to invest in a minimal amount of GOLD to assess whether or not they profit GOLD is based on real physical gold and therefore possesses far more face-value credibility than other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have. The gold market/ gld returns look promising. GoldMint helps investors hedge their risks and promises more for their investments.

Quote from: BazkieBumpercar on October 02, 2017, 11:51:35 AM Describe PoS and why you chose it? Thank you  Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin), where the algorithm rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining), in PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen in a deterministic (pseudo-random) way, and the chance that an account is chosen depends on its wealth (i.e. the stake). In PoS cryptocurrencies the blocks are usually said to be forged (in the blacksmith sense of this word), or minted, rather than mined. Also, usually all the coins are created in the beginning and the total number of coins never changes afterwards (although there are some other versions of PoS where new coins can be created). Therefore, in the basic version of PoS there are no block rewards (e.g. as in bitcoin); so, the forgers take only the transaction fees.  With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

In the  absence  of  a  single  standard,  a  specialist  also manually inspects the jewelry before Custody Bot conducts spectral analysis.  Spectral analysis: the process: Custody  Bot  uses  fluorescence  spectroscopy,  a  type  of  electromagnetic  spectroscopy  that analyzes  fluorescence  from  a  sample.  This technique  involves using  a beam  of  light, usually ultraviolet light, that excites the electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to  emit  light.  An  analyzer  crystal  disperses  radiation  onto  the  gold  via  a  detector.  A computer-controlled  precision   goniometer  moves  the  analyzer  crystal  and  detector  and controls the position, intensity and lengths of secondary radiation waves. Concentration of the analysis is calculated by comparison with known standard samples.   Hydrostatic weighing: the process:  Hydrostatic  weighing  determines  the  density  of  the  gold  and  is  done by weighting the  item first  in  air  then  liquid  and  calculating  the  combined  private  density  (ρ2). Estimation  of density is made by contrasting the density of gold to densities of other metals.

Quote from: CryptoPromotions on October 01, 2017, 06:51:17 AM what is an etf and how can it back gold?  An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a marketable security that tracks an index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets like an index fund. Unlike mutual funds, an ETF trades like a common stock on a stock exchange. ETFs offer low-cost diversification, trading and arbitrage options. New ETFs range from several dozen to hundreds in any particular year. They can be used to back GOLD, since there is a high demand for ETFs in the gold market.

The price of one GOLD equals one ounce of physical gold on the LBMA. Applicants who want to trade GOLD for fiat need to undergo GoldMint's KYC procedure. If accepted, the applicant’s GOLD cryptoasset is transferred from his, or her, GoldMint wallet to a special GoldMint account and is converted to fiat. GoldMint sends this fiat to the applicant.

You can use GOLD assets for the following: Exchange fiat to cryptocurrency - Right now the fiat-cryptocurrency exchange market exceeds $400 million. Experts predict that this will reach billions once banks regulate the cryptocurrency industry. Hedge volatility risks - Traders and other cryptocurrency users can hedge their gold commodity with GOLD on any cryptocurrency trading exchange, without leaving that particular platform. Traders can also diversify their trading portfolio with GOLD assets. Payroll unit- Given its low volatility, you may prefer GOLD to BTC and altcoins for paying employees. Because of its low commissions, high speed, and affordability (no extra charges for transborder payments), you can also use GOLD instead of fiat for regular deals. ICO currency - ICOs can ask for GOLD donations instead of regular cryptocurrency funds to hedge the high volatility risks that tend to accompany cryptocurrency. Buy and transport physical gold - You can convert your physical gold into GOLD in any bank that uses the GoldMint blockchain platform.

Plus, we have a company that buys 450 kg of gold per month from pawnshops all over Russia. These are unclaimed deposits. Therefore, we have our own source of gold - we don't depend on banks.   Today, more than 1% of all gold is kept in pawnshops. In 53% of the cases, gold is bought as a mean of investment. Many people buy coins or small bars of gold. For them Custody Bot is an excellent solution. Coins are the easiest to examine. Initially, we set a task for our engineers to examine the quality of jewellery.

Quote from: dermo on September 30, 2017, 01:11:01 PM Describe PoS and why you chose it? Thank you   Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin), where the algorithm rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining), in PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen in a deterministic (pseudo-random) way, and the chance that an account is chosen depends on its wealth (i.e. the stake). In PoS cryptocurrencies the blocks are usually said to be forged (in the blacksmith sense of this word), or minted, rather than mined. Also, usually all the coins are created in the beginning and the total number of coins never changes afterwards (although there are some other versions of PoS where new coins can be created). Therefore, in the basic version of PoS there are no block rewards (e.g. as in bitcoin); so, the forgers take only the transaction fees   With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

Goldmint  uses Proof-of-Stake where miners  are  doled blocks/ transactions  according   to the  amount  of MNT they have.

Commercial producers and gold workers, like miners, jewelers, or the government, tended to use gold options, futures and ETF as hedging tools.  Today, a significant amount of investors like to use gold to hedge against inflation or to diversify their investments. In fact, gold became the one common investment  of all metals and has a legendary history as commodity and coin. Like other commodities, gold depends on micro and macro economical and political events, so its value fluctuates along with these. GoldMint not only helps you cushion the risk of this volatility but also gives you the option of taking a short position in physical gold bullion, coins or mining stocks.  Here are some reasons why investors choose GoldMint:  You can hedge your investment in gold using the GOLD token. Doing so protects your gold from bearish conditions. Investors can chose to convert just a portion of their assets or all of it with this GOLD cryptoasset Investors may want to invest in a minimal amount of GOLD to assess whether or not they profit GOLD is based on real physical gold and therefore possesses far more face-value credibility than other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have. The gold market/ gld returns look promising. GoldMint helps investors hedge their risks and promises more for their investments.   Quote from: Kracko on September 30, 2017, 08:49:41 AM Is MNTP a security token?   No, MNTP tokens are used for ICO only. As soon as GoldMint blockchain is launched, MNTP can be exchanged for MNT used as stake in our consensus algorithm. MNT holders do not receive any passive income. We have a report on MNT/MNTP status from an US lawyer company. This provides us with an opportunity to trade MNT/MNTP on the US market 12 months after ICO.

Differences   between   Goldmint   and   other  gold   cryptocurrency   blockchains  include  the  following:              Goldmint uses its own blockchain and altcoin, called MNT, for GOLD transactions.             Goldmint  uses Proof-of-Stake where miners  are  doled blocks/ transactions  according   to the  amount  of MNT they have. Proof  of  stake  (PoS)  is  faster,  simpler and                 cheaper  than proof of work (PoW).           Physical gold and ETFs are stored in a programmed decentralized storage unit.

The rate of the loan is established at the time of giving and remains fixed through the loan period.Applicants needs to consent to GoldMint loan terms to receive the loan. Applicant is given various options for repaying loan amount and for mode of repayment. If the borrower defaults, his GOLD cryptoassets are transferred to GoldMint.

Quote from: Abitcoinfuture on September 30, 2017, 05:45:03 AM how is my income calculated? (provide an example here as well)  The amount payable to the investor is the following: SUM = (1 + (X / 12) * T) * Q where the number X (i.e., x%) is set by GoldMint based on market conditions. T= the amount of months the gold was loaned. Q= the interest tagged to the loan. Example: As of August 2017, the parameters would be X = 10%, Y = 28% per annum, and T = 1 year. This means that GoldMint receives 28% per year, an annual 10% of which goes to the investor.  Quote from: TomKoinify on September 30, 2017, 05:51:09 AM what are some of the gold applications?

The price of one GOLD equals one ounce of physical gold on the LBMA. Applicants who want to trade GOLD for fiat need to undergo GoldMint's KYC procedure. If accepted, the applicant’s GOLD cryptoasset is transferred from his, or her, GoldMint wallet to a special GoldMint account and is converted to fiat. GoldMint sends this fiat to the applicant. So, the price with commissions you receive for buying GOLD is LBMA + 5%, selling - LBMA + 2%. Therefore the way fiat => GOLD => fiat will be 3%.

Commercial producers and gold workers, like miners, jewelers, or the government, tended to use gold options, futures and ETF as hedging tools.  Today, a significant amount of investors like to use gold to hedge against inflation or to diversify their investments. In fact, gold became the one common investment  of all metals and has a legendary history as commodity and coin. Like other commodities, gold depends on micro and macro economical and political events, so its value fluctuates along with these. GoldMint not only helps you cushion the risk of this volatility but also gives you the option of taking a short position in physical gold bullion, coins or mining stocks.  Here are some reasons why investors choose GoldMint:  You can hedge your investment in gold using the GOLD token. Doing so protects your gold from bearish conditions. Investors can chose to convert just a portion of their assets or all of it with this GOLD cryptoasset Investors may want to invest in a minimal amount of GOLD to assess whether or not they profit GOLD is based on real physical gold and therefore possesses far more face-value credibility than other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have. The gold market/ gld returns look promising. GoldMint helps investors hedge their risks and promises more for their investments.   Quote from: Kracko on September 29, 2017, 04:24:13 PM Is MNTP a security token?   No, MNTP tokens are used for ICO only. As soon as GoldMint blockchain is launched, MNTP can be exchanged for MNT used as stake in our consensus algorithm. MNT holders do not receive any passive income. We have a report on MNT/MNTP status from an US lawyer company. This provides us with an opportunity to trade MNT/MNTP on the US market 12 months after ICO.

Crypto traders – These participants can use GOLD for hedging cryptocurrency volatility, as described in the white paper. GOLD can also be used to convert cryptocurrency into fiat. Standard investors – These investors may want to buy GOLD as cryptocurrency or as a type of security. E-commerce and self-employed individuals – GOLD can be used to pay for goods and services. Its low volatility asset and predictability make it an invaluable form of currency. Banks – GOLD cryptoassets gives banks new opportunities. There’s free liquidity and extra earning potential from trading gold into fiat and the reverse. Cryptocurrency has become a massive industry. Banks can profit from earning standard commissions, commissions on gold storage, and from using the GoldMint cash management system. At the same time, banks that invest in GOLD reinforce GOLD’s reputation, which increases their profit. Banks also earn commission from participating in the GoldMint partner program. Today the cryptocurrency overall circulation has achieved more than $700 billion a year and the commissions for deposit and withdrawal are more than 5%.  In case the bank sets lower commissions for GOLD buy/sell for a client, most transactions (cryprocurrency deposit and withdrawal) will switch from underground exchanges to the banks. At the same time the integration with GOLD only is necessary, while all the other cryptocurrencies can be purchased on a cryptoexchange directly. Banks also have revenues from cash management and commission charging for gold storing owned by GoldMint company. Still one more source of income for banks is the revenue from the partner program which includes adding GOLD digital asset to the product line of the bank’s department of Wealth Management.

Custody Bot can replace pawnshops as it is more transparent and almost totally automated.   Quote from: getwork on September 29, 2017, 02:14:36 PM Will there be any auditing of goldmint assets?   After you’ve done the KYC process, you enter your gold commodities in the Custody Bot, which inspects the items and determines how much fiat or crypto currency you get. You can, also, receive a credit card through a partner bank. The limit of that card will correspond to the value of your stored gold.   Quote from: goodluck0319 on September 29, 2017, 02:25:51 PM What are the commissions for transactions in gold?   Most times, when a person buys GOLD for fiat, the price for GOLD will be LBMA + 5%. When they want to sell their GOLD, the price will be LBMA +3%. The commission for managing gold is 0.2-0.8% per annum, depending on gold volatility and investor traffic. After analyzing the correlation between the value of gold and the stock price of the three largest ETFs - the GLD (announced expense ratio 0.4% ), the IAU ( 0.25% ) and SGOL ( 0.39% ) - we estimate that the real backlog of ETF shares in physical gold is about 0.7% (prices are taken from COMEX on the LME ).

Quote from: Itcher on September 29, 2017, 08:13:01 AM Describe PoS and why you chose it? Thank you  Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin), where the algorithm rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining), in PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen in a deterministic (pseudo-random) way, and the chance that an account is chosen depends on its wealth (i.e. the stake). In PoS cryptocurrencies the blocks are usually said to be forged (in the blacksmith sense of this word), or minted, rather than mined. Also, usually all the coins are created in the beginning and the total number of coins never changes afterwards (although there are some other versions of PoS where new coins can be created). Therefore, in the basic version of PoS there are no block rewards (e.g. as in bitcoin); so, the forgers take only the transaction fees  Quote from: florianuhlemann on September 29, 2017, 08:18:05 AM how are the rewards for mining determined?

That's right. A more valuable block will be more valuable to mine.  2) Commissions are payed instantly after the block is verified. All blocks will be distributed to the stakeholders according of value block, too. But that occur with more transactions verified.  3) You don't need your ID verified for getting GOLD tokens commissions.  4) At first our blockchain will use standard cryptography methods as most of the blockchains nowadays. As soon as powerful quantum computers will appear being available to hack these blockchains we will start implementing quantum proof.

Commercial producers and gold workers, like miners, jewelers, or the government, tended to use gold options, futures and ETF as hedging tools.  Today, a significant amount of investors like to use gold to hedge against inflation or to diversify their investments. In fact, gold became the one common investment  of all metals and has a legendary history as commodity and coin. Like other commodities, gold depends on micro and macro economical and political events, so its value fluctuates along with these. GoldMint not only helps you cushion the risk of this volatility but also gives you the option of taking a short position in physical gold bullion, coins or mining stocks.  Here are some reasons why investors choose GoldMint:  You can hedge your investment in gold using the GOLD token. Doing so protects your gold from bearish conditions. Investors can chose to convert just a portion of their assets or all of it with this GOLD cryptoasset Investors may want to invest in a minimal amount of GOLD to assess whether or not they profit GOLD is based on real physical gold and therefore possesses far more face-value credibility than other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have.

Quote from: TomKoinify on September 29, 2017, 07:43:12 AM How will be distributed tokens during ICO event?  Release  of  MNT  tokens  are  done  by  Ethereum-based  smart  contracts,  specially  used  for distribution of tokens.    80% of 10 000 000 MNT are released during ICO launch.  GoldMint  team  receives  two  million  MNT  tokens,  and  no  more  than  500  000  per  quarter distributed via a special wallet.  Some consultants receive MNT tokens two months after ICO launch.  Smart contracts can automatically trade ETH into MNT.  The number  of tokens to be transmitted to a particular user depends on the sum at the time of its receipt by GoldMint.  Quote from: mika1977 on September 29, 2017, 07:49:13 AM Why don't you use ETH blockchain?  GoldMint’s blockchain, using the Graphene platform will be launched.       Advantages of such a choice compared to using an Ethereum private fork are as follows:           1. Safer  -  GoldMint  blockchain  uses  its  own  coins  rather  than  turing-complete  smart contracts.          2. More  productive  -  GoldMint  uses  PoS,  is  optimized  for  GOLD transactions  as there are no other ICOs on the same platform.            3. Cheaper - no charge for ether commissions.          4.

Today there are more than 60,000 tonnes of gold from the earth extracted, half of which finds its way into the pockets and accounts of “ordinary” people. Our idea is no short of revolutionary: we plan to convert this gold into blockchain-encrypted tokens to help owners protect their valuables, to help investors move their gold can more rapidly and easily from one part of the world to another, and to help companies and individuals hedge their gold against market volatility.  We plan to move in three stages:  To gain access to 1% of global gold circulation (over 300 tonnes) by launching Custody Bot automated storage facilities in pawnshops around the world. To gain access to another 5% of gold circulation by introducing Custody Bot to shopping centers. To gradually gain access to a final 10% of gold reserves, worth more than $100 billion, and to develop a special version of Custody Bot for popular installation.  Quote from: Abitcoinfuture on September 29, 2017, 03:11:07 AM How Custody Bot will be linked to a blockchain?  The Airalab Core platform links Custody Bot to the blockchain.  We are consulting with them because they have a huge expirience about connecting various bots to blockchain  Quote from: TomKoinify on September 29, 2017, 03:17:56 AM How Custody Bot analyse the value of gold?  Gold inspection includes:       ●    Visual  identification  of the product by  an  operator –  coin,  ingot, jewelry, raw gold or gold granules       ●    Evaluation via spectrography using the spectrograph installed within the box         ●    Evaluation and weighing of gold via hydrostatic weighing     Custody  Bot  uses  the  technologies  of  spectral  analysis  and  hydrostatic  weighing  to  inspect the value  of the  gold.  In the  absence  of  a  single  standard,  a  specialist  also manually inspects the jewelry before Custody Bot conducts spectral analysis.  Spectral analysis: the process: Custody  Bot  uses  fluorescence  spectroscopy,  a  type  of  electromagnetic  spectroscopy  that analyzes  fluorescence  from  a  sample.  This technique  involves using  a beam  of  light, usually ultraviolet light, that excites the electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to  emit  light.  An  analyzer  crystal  disperses  radiation  onto  the  gold  via  a  detector.  A computer-controlled  precision   goniometer  moves  the  analyzer  crystal  and  detector  and controls the position, intensity and lengths of secondary radiation waves. Concentration of the analysis is calculated by comparison with known standard samples.   Hydrostatic weighing: the process:  Hydrostatic  weighing  determines  the  density  of  the  gold  and  is  done by weighting the  item first  in  air  then  liquid  and  calculating  the  combined  private  density  (ρ2). Estimation  of density is made by contrasting the density of gold to densities of other metals.   The  initial weighting  lets  define the valuable’s weight (m1) and the second one lets detemine the volume: V=(m1-m2)/ρ2.  With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

The reward for mining a block would obviously be directly related to a % the total value of the GOLD block mined ?    So a more valuable block would be more profitable to mine ?    2) Just a thought here. Would it be at all possible to combine/pool all miners  MNT/MNTP tokens together and each miner can then share EQUITABLY in the GOLD mining profits for all blocks mined based on the % of MNT/MNTP tokens they own. Each miner could then receive a % payout on a daily basis or however often you pay out commissions.      3) Currently you do not require purchasers of MNT/MNTP tokens to produce any form of ID. Once operational and you start paying miners commission in GOLD will you then require each miner to provide you KYC/ID personal details ?    4) Will your new graphene blockchain be quantum proof ?    5) Could GOLDMINT possibly set up there own in house exchange for people to trade tokens and GOLD. This would avoid price manipulation on crypto exchanges. For example Vaultoro has their own exchange on their web site.  Cheers )     ,False

In  case  at  the  moment  of  block  validation  the  miner  doesn’t  have  enough  computational  power  to  validate  the  block  or  in  case  he  cannot  do  this  for  some  other  reasons  he  can be deleted  from the White List  of reliable miners  and will  lose the right to  accomplish  a block.  In  this  case  the  right  to  validate  blocks  goes  over  to  another  user  who has been  chosen by GoldMint algorythm.  To  become  a  validator  all  you  need  is  to  download  GoldMint  Wallet  app  from the  official website and launch it using your GoldMint account.  In case  a user who holds many MNT  doesn’t have  enough  computational power, he can rent computational power from other miners.  Quote from: makemebeat on September 29, 2017, 01:19:12 AM Can MNT holders participate in GoldMint company management?  Is GoldMint a DAO?  The internal MNT token does not give rights to participate in company management of GoldMint and is not a share.  MNT tokens holders recieve a right to vote on GoldMint platform proportionally to the number of tokens they hold.  This means that in case some changes are to take place within GoldMint platform, MNT tokens holder vote on whether to accept it or not.  With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

The price of one GOLD equals one ounce of physical gold on the LBMA. Applicants who want to trade GOLD for fiat need to undergo GoldMint's KYC procedure. If accepted, the applicant’s GOLD cryptoasset is transferred from his, or her, GoldMint wallet to a special GoldMint account and is converted to fiat. GoldMint sends this fiat to the applicant. So, the price with commissions you receive for buying GOLD is LBMA + 5%, selling - LBMA + 2%. Therefore the way fiat => GOLD => fiat will be 3%.  Quote from: Itcher on September 28, 2017, 01:13:10 PM what can i do with gold assets?  You can use GOLD assets for the following: Exchange fiat to cryptocurrency - Right now the fiat-cryptocurrency exchange market exceeds $400 million. Experts predict that this will reach billions once banks regulate the cryptocurrency industry. Hedge volatility risks - Traders and other cryptocurrency users can hedge their gold commodity with GOLD on any cryptocurrency trading exchange, without leaving that particular platform. Traders can also diversify their trading portfolio with GOLD assets. Payroll unit- Given its low volatility, you may prefer GOLD to BTC and altcoins for paying employees. Because of its low commissions, high speed, and affordability (no extra charges for transborder payments), you can also use GOLD instead of fiat for regular deals. ICO currency - ICOs can ask for GOLD donations instead of regular cryptocurrency funds to hedge the high volatility risks that tend to accompany cryptocurrency. Buy and transport physical gold - You can convert your physical gold into GOLD in any bank that uses the GoldMint blockchain platform. This not only protects cross-country gold transportation but also simplifies the process.  Quote from: florianuhlemann on September 28, 2017, 01:18:21 PM how is gold emitted?  The amount of GOLD that is emitted depends on the amount of physical gold and ETF backing that GoldMint has in its reserves.

An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a marketable security that tracks an index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets like an index fund. Unlike mutual funds, an ETF trades like a common stock on a stock exchange. ETFs offer low-cost diversification, trading and arbitrage options. New ETFs range from several dozen to hundreds in any particular year. They can be used to back GOLD, since there is a high demand for ETFs in the gold market. Top ETFs for gold can be found on ETFDB.  Quote from: makemebeat on September 28, 2017, 12:21:07 PM where does goldmint store its physical gold and which etfs back gold cryptoassets?

Gold- because it is a clear metal for general public. Plus, we have a company that buys 450 kg of gold per month from pawnshops all over Russia. These are unclaimed deposits. Therefore, we have our own source of gold - we don't depend on banks. Today, more than 1% of all gold is kept in pawnshops. In 53% of the cases, gold is bought as a mean of investment. Many people buy coins or small bars of gold. For them Custody Bot is an excellent solution. Coins are the easiest to examine. Initially, we set a task for our engineers to examine the quality of jewellery. They have succeeded and this is way more difficult than examining coins.  Quote from: Abitcoinfuture on September 28, 2017, 08:12:17 AM What will happen if audit shows that GoldMint have less physical gold, than GOLD tokens emitted?  If  the  audit  results  show  that,  the  value  of physical gold  is  less than the number  of the GOLD tokens emitted, the  excess  amount  of  GOLD  will  be  written  off  automatically from  the  company  wallet via the  smart contract.  Quote from: TomKoinify on September 28, 2017, 08:15:05 AM How will amount of physical gold will be controlled?  All ratings are confirmed by bank statements which are encoded in blockchain by uploading relevant forms in IPFS to  the blockchain, thereby recording ownership of the gold to GoldMint. These documents let the system check that GoldMint company owns X amount of gold. This X is checked by an auditor from GoldMint. This number is verified each month by an objective TOP5 audit company. Inspection confirms that the total number of GOLD cryptoassets in all wallets (Y) is less than the total number of X ounces of gold on the balance sheet.  With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

If the borrower defaults, his GOLD cryptoassets are transferred to GoldMint.  Quote from: TomKoinify on September 28, 2017, 03:50:38 AM Who is your target audience?  Crypto traders – These participants can use GOLD for hedging cryptocurrency volatility, as described in the white paper. GOLD can also be used to convert cryptocurrency into fiat. Standard investors – These investors may want to buy GOLD as cryptocurrency or as a type of security. E-commerce and self-employed individuals – GOLD can be used to pay for goods and services. Its low volatility asset and predictability make it an invaluable form of currency. Banks – GOLD cryptoassets gives banks new opportunities. There’s free liquidity and extra earning potential from trading gold into fiat and the reverse. Cryptocurrency has become a massive industry. Banks can profit from earning standard commissions, commissions on gold storage, and from using the GoldMint cash management system. At the same time, banks that invest in GOLD reinforce GOLD’s reputation, which increases their profit. Banks also earn commission from participating in the GoldMint partner program. Today the cryptocurrency overall circulation has achieved more than $700 billion a year and the commissions for deposit and withdrawal are more than 5%. In case the bank sets lower commissions for GOLD buy/sell for a client, most transactions (cryprocurrency deposit and withdrawal) will switch from underground exchanges to the banks. At the same time the integration with GOLD only is necessary, while all the other cryptocurrencies can be purchased on a cryptoexchange directly. Banks also have revenues from cash management and commission charging for gold storing owned by GoldMint company. Still one more source of income for banks is the revenue from the partner program which includes adding GOLD digital asset to the product line of the bank’s department of Wealth Management.  Quote from: Kracko on September 28, 2017, 03:56:26 AM Where can I find your advisors?  Goldmint is fortunate to have experienced financial market experts.

Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin), where the algorithm rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining), in PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen in a deterministic (pseudo-random) way, and the chance that an account is chosen depends on its wealth (i.e. the stake). In PoS cryptocurrencies the blocks are usually said to be forged (in the blacksmith sense of this word), or minted, rather than mined. Also, usually all the coins are created in the beginning and the total number of coins never changes afterwards (although there are some other versions of PoS where new coins can be created). Therefore, in the basic version of PoS there are no block rewards (e.g. as in bitcoin); so, the forgers take only the transaction fees.

The Airalab Core platform links Custody Bot to the blockchain. We are consulting with them because they have a huge expirience about connecting various bots to blockchain  Quote from: Abitcoinfuture on September 27, 2017, 08:53:23 AM How Custody Bot analyse the value of gold?  Gold inspection includes:       ●    Visual  identification  of the product by  an  operator –  coin,  ingot, jewelry, raw gold or gold granules       ●    Evaluation via spectrography using the spectrograph installed within the box         ●    Evaluation and weighing of gold via hydrostatic weighing     Custody  Bot  uses  the  technologies  of  spectral  analysis  and  hydrostatic  weighing  to  inspect the value  of the  gold.  In the  absence  of  a  single  standard,  a  specialist  also manually inspects the jewelry before Custody Bot conducts spectral analysis.  Spectral analysis: the process: Custody  Bot  uses  fluorescence  spectroscopy,  a  type  of  electromagnetic  spectroscopy  that analyzes  fluorescence  from  a  sample.  This technique  involves using  a beam  of  light, usually ultraviolet light, that excites the electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to  emit  light.  An  analyzer  crystal  disperses  radiation  onto  the  gold  via  a  detector.  A computer-controlled  precision   goniometer  moves  the  analyzer  crystal  and  detector  and controls the position, intensity and lengths of secondary radiation waves. Concentration of the analysis is calculated by comparison with known standard samples.   Hydrostatic weighing: the process:  Hydrostatic  weighing  determines  the  density  of  the  gold  and  is  done by weighting the  item first  in  air  then  liquid  and  calculating  the  combined  private  density  (ρ2). Estimation  of density is made by contrasting the density of gold to densities of other metals.   The  initial weighting  lets  define the valuable’s weight (m1) and the second one lets detemine the volume: V=(m1-m2)/ρ2.  Quote from: TomKoinify on September 27, 2017, 09:00:24 AM what is custody bot?  Custody Bot is GoldMint's unique device. It is programmed for temporary holding, inspection, long-term storing and conveying of gold jewelry, coins or gold.  With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

We plan to move in three stages:  To gain access to 1% of global gold circulation (over 300 tonnes) by launching Custody Bot automated storage facilities in pawnshops around the world. To gain access to another 5% of gold circulation by introducing Custody Bot to shopping centers. To gradually gain access to a final 10% of gold reserves, worth more than $100 billion, and to develop a special version of Custody Bot for popular installation.   With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a marketable security that tracks an index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets like an index fund. Unlike mutual funds, an ETF trades like a common stock on a stock exchange. ETFs offer low-cost diversification, trading and arbitrage options. New ETFs range from several dozen to hundreds in any particular year. They can be used to back GOLD, since there is a high demand for ETFs in the gold market. Top ETFs for gold can be found on ETFDB.  Quote from: chaolang on September 26, 2017, 11:48:05 PM where does goldmint store its physical gold and which etfs back gold cryptoassets?

Gold- because it is a clear metal for general public. Plus, we have a company that buys 450 kg of gold per month from pawnshops all over Russia. These are unclaimed deposits. Therefore, we have our own source of gold - we don't depend on banks.   Today, more than 1% of all gold is kept in pawnshops. In 53% of the cases, gold is bought as a mean of investment. Many people buy coins or small bars of gold. For them Custody Bot is an excellent solution. Coins are the easiest to examine. Initially, we set a task for our engineers to examine the quality of jewellery. They have succeeded and this is way more difficult than examining coins.

These documents let the system check that GoldMint company owns X amount of gold. This X is checked by an auditor from GoldMint. This number is verified each month by an objective TOP5 audit company. Inspection confirms that the total number of GOLD cryptoassets in all wallets (Y) is less than the total number of X ounces of gold on the balance sheet.  With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

Commercial producers and gold workers, like miners, jewelers, or the government, tended to use gold options, futures and ETF as hedging tools.  Today, a significant amount of investors like to use gold to hedge against inflation or to diversify their investments. In fact, gold became the one common investment  of all metals and has a legendary history as commodity and coin. Like other commodities, gold depends on micro and macro economical and political events, so its value fluctuates along with these. GoldMint not only helps you cushion the risk of this volatility but also gives you the option of taking a short position in physical gold bullion, coins or mining stocks.  Here are some reasons why investors choose GoldMint:  You can hedge your investment in gold using the GOLD token. Doing so protects your gold from bearish conditions. Investors can chose to convert just a portion of their assets or all of it with this GOLD cryptoasset Investors may want to invest in a minimal amount of GOLD to assess whether or not they profit GOLD is based on real physical gold and therefore possesses far more face-value credibility than other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have. The gold market/ gld returns look promising. GoldMint helps investors hedge their risks and promises more for their investments.

Crypto traders – These participants can use GOLD for hedging cryptocurrency volatility, as described in the white paper. GOLD can also be used to convert cryptocurrency into fiat. Standard investors – These investors may want to buy GOLD as cryptocurrency or as a type of security. E-commerce and self-employed individuals – GOLD can be used to pay for goods and services. Its low volatility asset and predictability make it an invaluable form of currency. Banks – GOLD cryptoassets gives banks new opportunities. There’s free liquidity and extra earning potential from trading gold into fiat and the reverse. Cryptocurrency has become a massive industry. Banks can profit from earning standard commissions, commissions on gold storage, and from using the GoldMint cash management system. At the same time, banks that invest in GOLD reinforce GOLD’s reputation, which increases their profit. Banks also earn commission from participating in the GoldMint partner program. Today the cryptocurrency overall circulation has achieved more than $700 billion a year and the commissions for deposit and withdrawal are more than 5%.  In case the bank sets lower commissions for GOLD buy/sell for a client, most transactions (cryprocurrency deposit and withdrawal) will switch from underground exchanges to the banks. At the same time the integration with GOLD only is necessary, while all the other cryptocurrencies can be purchased on a cryptoexchange directly. Banks also have revenues from cash management and commission charging for gold storing owned by GoldMint company. Still one more source of income for banks is the revenue from the partner program which includes adding GOLD digital asset to the product line of the bank’s department of Wealth Management.

You can use GOLD assets for the following: Exchange fiat to cryptocurrency - Right now the fiat-cryptocurrency exchange market exceeds $400 million. Experts predict that this will reach billions once banks regulate the cryptocurrency industry. Hedge volatility risks - Traders and other cryptocurrency users can hedge their gold commodity with GOLD on any cryptocurrency trading exchange, without leaving that particular platform. Traders can also diversify their trading portfolio with GOLD assets. Payroll unit- Given its low volatility, you may prefer GOLD to BTC and altcoins for paying employees. Because of its low commissions, high speed, and affordability (no extra charges for transborder payments), you can also use GOLD instead of fiat for regular deals. ICO currency - ICOs can ask for GOLD donations instead of regular cryptocurrency funds to hedge the high volatility risks that tend to accompany cryptocurrency. Buy and transport physical gold - You can convert your physical gold into GOLD in any bank that uses the GoldMint blockchain platform. This not only protects cross-country gold transportation but also simplifies the process.   With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

Quote from: getwork on September 26, 2017, 02:04:59 AM Describe PoS and why you chose it? Thank you  Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin), where the algorithm rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining), in PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen in a deterministic (pseudo-random) way, and the chance that an account is chosen depends on its wealth (i.e. the stake). In PoS cryptocurrencies the blocks are usually said to be forged (in the blacksmith sense of this word), or minted, rather than mined. Also, usually all the coins are created in the beginning and the total number of coins never changes afterwards (although there are some other versions of PoS where new coins can be created). Therefore, in the basic version of PoS there are no block rewards (e.g. as in bitcoin); so, the forgers take only the transaction fees  With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

Crypto traders – These participants can use GOLD for hedging cryptocurrency volatility, as described in the white paper. GOLD can also be used to convert cryptocurrency into fiat. Standard investors – These investors may want to buy GOLD as cryptocurrency or as a type of security. E-commerce and self-employed individuals – GOLD can be used to pay for goods and services. Its low volatility asset and predictability make it an invaluable form of currency. Banks – GOLD cryptoassets gives banks new opportunities. There’s free liquidity and extra earning potential from trading gold into fiat and the reverse. Cryptocurrency has become a massive industry. Banks can profit from earning standard commissions, commissions on gold storage, and from using the GoldMint cash management system. At the same time, banks that invest in GOLD reinforce GOLD’s reputation, which increases their profit. Banks also earn commission from participating in the GoldMint partner program. Today the cryptocurrency overall circulation has achieved more than $700 billion a year and the commissions for deposit and withdrawal are more than 5%.  In case the bank sets lower commissions for GOLD buy/sell for a client, most transactions (cryprocurrency deposit and withdrawal) will switch from underground exchanges to the banks. At the same time the integration with GOLD only is necessary, while all the other cryptocurrencies can be purchased on a cryptoexchange directly. Banks also have revenues from cash management and commission charging for gold storing owned by GoldMint company. Still one more source of income for banks is the revenue from the partner program which includes adding GOLD digital asset to the product line of the bank’s department of Wealth Management.

This would put the worth of said blockchain into what seems to be a lump sum of gold. But assets are diluted due to the POS you have implemented?  Using a centralized source of wealth like gold only increases the risk of the entire project as gold is frequently stolen, sometimes even by governments. I just feel like I see more and more of these pop up and people do not realize the essential value of crypto is not a receipt for what should be in someone's vault. It should be a reward for securing the world's most important resource which is data. Sorry if I am getting preachy. I just do not understand the appeal of stuff like this. Gold is something you buy and hold in your hand. Crypto is something that is decentralized and nobody can ever take it away from you.  Sell me on your crypto, not on gold please. Everything you have been saying is just what the current system is doing and is a huge trust system mess of debt with what used to be enough gold to make every dollar worth some of it. Systems like this deteriorate over time as humans pull crap. How will you deter the negative side of holding gold through a blockchain solution (I suppose is my main question)? I have already read through everything, and it seems like there is no guarantee that someone wouldn't doublespend the gold which would leave your system with whatever debt was left over by the transaction right? Or if someone stole the gold, what would happen to the asset?  Also, you misspelled traders as ""traiders"" in your PR graphics and it bugs the crap out of me.",False

Quote from: Kracko on September 25, 2017, 01:48:16 PM What do you want to gain with your project?  Today there are more than 60,000 tonnes of gold from the earth extracted, half of which finds its way into the pockets and accounts of “ordinary” people. Our idea is no short of revolutionary: we plan to convert this gold into blockchain-encrypted tokens to help owners protect their valuables, to help investors move their gold can more rapidly and easily from one part of the world to another, and to help companies and individuals hedge their gold against market volatility.  We plan to move in three stages:  To gain access to 1% of global gold circulation (over 300 tonnes) by launching Custody Bot automated storage facilities in pawnshops around the world. To gain access to another 5% of gold circulation by introducing Custody Bot to shopping centers. To gradually gain access to a final 10% of gold reserves, worth more than $100 billion, and to develop a special version of Custody Bot for popular installation.  Quote from: mika1977 on September 25, 2017, 01:53:56 PM How Custody Bot will be linked to a blockchain?  The Airalab Core platform links Custody Bot to the blockchain.

Gold inspection includes:       ●    Visual  identification  of the product by  an  operator –  coin,  ingot, jewelry, raw gold or gold granules       ●    Evaluation via spectrography using the spectrograph installed within the box         ●    Evaluation and weighing of gold via hydrostatic weighing     Custody  Bot  uses  the  technologies  of  spectral  analysis  and  hydrostatic  weighing  to  inspect the value  of the  gold.  In the  absence  of  a  single  standard,  a  specialist  also manually inspects the jewelry before Custody Bot conducts spectral analysis.  Spectral analysis: the process: Custody  Bot  uses  fluorescence  spectroscopy,  a  type  of  electromagnetic  spectroscopy  that analyzes  fluorescence  from  a  sample.  This technique  involves using  a beam  of  light, usually ultraviolet light, that excites the electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to  emit  light.  An  analyzer  crystal  disperses  radiation  onto  the  gold  via  a  detector.  A computer-controlled  precision   goniometer  moves  the  analyzer  crystal  and  detector  and controls the position, intensity and lengths of secondary radiation waves. Concentration of the analysis is calculated by comparison with known standard samples.   Hydrostatic weighing: the process:  Hydrostatic  weighing  determines  the  density  of  the  gold  and  is  done by weighting the  item first  in  air  then  liquid  and  calculating  the  combined  private  density  (ρ2). Estimation  of density is made by contrasting the density of gold to densities of other metals.   The  initial weighting  lets  define the valuable’s weight (m1) and the second one lets detemine the volume: V=(m1-m2)/ρ2.  Quote from: florianuhlemann on September 25, 2017, 02:21:25 PM what is custody bot?  Custody Bot is GoldMint's unique device.

Quote from: kenel on September 25, 2017, 05:23:38 AM Describe PoS and why you chose it? Thank you   Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin), where the algorithm rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining), in PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen in a deterministic (pseudo-random) way, and the chance that an account is chosen depends on its wealth (i.e. the stake). In PoS cryptocurrencies the blocks are usually said to be forged (in the blacksmith sense of this word), or minted, rather than mined. Also, usually all the coins are created in the beginning and the total number of coins never changes afterwards (although there are some other versions of PoS where new coins can be created). Therefore, in the basic version of PoS there are no block rewards (e.g. as in bitcoin); so, the forgers take only the transaction fees   With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

Proof  of  stake  (PoS)  is  faster,  simpler and cheaper  than proof of work (PoW).           Physical gold and ETFs are stored in a programmed decentralized storage unit.          Custody Bot    -   Goldmint’s   innovative  storage unit  is programmed to automatically  identify  and  store  gold  jewelry,  small  ingots  (up  to  100  grams)  and  coins without human intervention.

People who want to trade GOLD for fiat or cryptocurrency need to undergo GoldMint's KYC procedure. You can also get GOLD when you transfer your physical gold to Custody Bot or to GoldMint’s partner banks.  Quote from: getwork on September 25, 2017, 06:18:17 AM some people may wonder if they can exchange the gold token with the real gold bars. how are you going to explain this?  The price of one GOLD equals one ounce of physical gold on the LBMA. Applicants who want to trade GOLD for fiat need to undergo GoldMint's KYC procedure. If accepted, the applicant’s GOLD cryptoasset is transferred from his, or her, GoldMint wallet to a special GoldMint account and is converted to fiat. GoldMint sends this fiat to the applicant. So, the price with commissions you receive for buying GOLD is LBMA + 5%, selling - LBMA + 2%. Therefore the way fiat => GOLD => fiat will be 3%.  Quote from: goodluck0319 on September 25, 2017, 06:24:05 AM what can i do with gold assets?  You can use GOLD assets for the following: Exchange fiat to cryptocurrency - Right now the fiat-cryptocurrency exchange market exceeds $400 million. Experts predict that this will reach billions once banks regulate the cryptocurrency industry. Hedge volatility risks - Traders and other cryptocurrency users can hedge their gold commodity with GOLD on any cryptocurrency trading exchange, without leaving that particular platform. Traders can also diversify their trading portfolio with GOLD assets. Payroll unit- Given its low volatility, you may prefer GOLD to BTC and altcoins for paying employees. Because of its low commissions, high speed, and affordability (no extra charges for transborder payments), you can also use GOLD instead of fiat for regular deals. ICO currency - ICOs can ask for GOLD donations instead of regular cryptocurrency funds to hedge the high volatility risks that tend to accompany cryptocurrency. Buy and transport physical gold - You can convert your physical gold into GOLD in any bank that uses the GoldMint blockchain platform. This not only protects cross-country gold transportation but also simplifies the process.  With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

ETF (Exchange Traded Funds) - An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a marketable security that tracks an index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets like an index fund. Unlike mutual funds, an ETF trades like a common stock on a stock exchange.  The three most popular ETFs are “Spiders” (ticker (NYSEARCA:SPY)), “Diamonds” (ticker (NYSEARCA:DIA)) and “Qs” or """"Qubes"""" (ticker (NASDAQ:QQQ)).  Top ETFs for gold can be found on ETFDB . The commission for the management of a portfolio of gold is 0.2-0.8% per annum, depending on the volatility of gold and the inflow / outflow of investors. After analyzing the correlation between the value of gold and the stock price of the three largest ETFs - the GLD (announced expense ratio 0.4% ), the IAU ( 0.25% ) and SGOL ( 0.39% ) - we estimate that the real backlog of ETF shares in physical gold is about 0.7% (prices are taken from COMEX on the LME ).

Gold- because it is a clear metal for general public. Plus, we have a company that buys 450 kg of gold per month from pawnshops all over Russia. These are unclaimed deposits. Therefore, we have our own source of gold - we don't depend on banks.   Today, more than 1% of all gold is kept in pawnshops. In 53% of the cases, gold is bought as a mean of investment. Many people buy coins or small bars of gold. For them Custody Bot is an excellent solution. Coins are the easiest to examine. Initially, we set a task for our engineers to examine the quality of jewellery. They have succeeded and this is way more difficult than examining coins.  Quote from: Abitcoinfuture on September 25, 2017, 01:08:12 AM What will happen if audit shows that GoldMint have less physical gold, than GOLD tokens emitted?  If  the  audit  results  show  that,  the  value  of physical gold  is  less than the number  of the GOLD tokens emitted, the  excess  amount  of  GOLD  will  be  written  off  automatically from  the  company  wallet via the  smart contract.

Crypto traders – These participants can use GOLD for hedging cryptocurrency volatility, as described in the white paper. GOLD can also be used to convert cryptocurrency into fiat. Standard investors – These investors may want to buy GOLD as cryptocurrency or as a type of security. E-commerce and self-employed individuals – GOLD can be used to pay for goods and services. Its low volatility asset and predictability make it an invaluable form of currency. Banks – GOLD cryptoassets gives banks new opportunities. There’s free liquidity and extra earning potential from trading gold into fiat and the reverse. Cryptocurrency has become a massive industry. Banks can profit from earning standard commissions, commissions on gold storage, and from using the GoldMint cash management system. At the same time, banks that invest in GOLD reinforce GOLD’s reputation, which increases their profit. Banks also earn commission from participating in the GoldMint partner program. Today the cryptocurrency overall circulation has achieved more than $700 billion a year and the commissions for deposit and withdrawal are more than 5%.  In case the bank sets lower commissions for GOLD buy/sell for a client, most transactions (cryprocurrency deposit and withdrawal) will switch from underground exchanges to the banks. At the same time the integration with GOLD only is necessary, while all the other cryptocurrencies can be purchased on a cryptoexchange directly. Banks also have revenues from cash management and commission charging for gold storing owned by GoldMint company. Still one more source of income for banks is the revenue from the partner program which includes adding GOLD digital asset to the product line of the bank’s department of Wealth Management.

Quote from: chaolang on September 24, 2017, 12:29:08 AM Describe PoS and why you chose it? Thank you  Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin), where the algorithm rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining), in PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen in a deterministic (pseudo-random) way, and the chance that an account is chosen depends on its wealth (i.e. the stake). In PoS cryptocurrencies the blocks are usually said to be forged (in the blacksmith sense of this word), or minted, rather than mined. Also, usually all the coins are created in the beginning and the total number of coins never changes afterwards (although there are some other versions of PoS where new coins can be created). Therefore, in the basic version of PoS there are no block rewards (e.g. as in bitcoin); so, the forgers take only the transaction fees  Quote from: makemebeat on September 24, 2017, 12:35:47 AM how are the rewards for mining determined?

Commercial producers and gold workers, like miners, jewelers, or the government, tended to use gold options, futures and ETF as hedging tools.  Today, a significant amount of investors like to use gold to hedge against inflation or to diversify their investments. In fact, gold became the one common investment  of all metals and has a legendary history as commodity and coin. Like other commodities, gold depends on micro and macro economical and political events, so its value fluctuates along with these. GoldMint not only helps you cushion the risk of this volatility but also gives you the option of taking a short position in physical gold bullion, coins or mining stocks.  Here are some reasons why investors choose GoldMint:  You can hedge your investment in gold using the GOLD token. Doing so protects your gold from bearish conditions. Investors can chose to convert just a portion of their assets or all of it with this GOLD cryptoasset Investors may want to invest in a minimal amount of GOLD to assess whether or not they profit GOLD is based on real physical gold and therefore possesses far more face-value credibility than other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have.

Commercial producers and gold workers, like miners, jewelers, or the government, tended to use gold options, futures and ETF as hedging tools.  Today, a significant amount of investors like to use gold to hedge against inflation or to diversify their investments. In fact, gold became the one common investment  of all metals and has a legendary history as commodity and coin. Like other commodities, gold depends on micro and macro economical and political events, so its value fluctuates along with these. GoldMint not only helps you cushion the risk of this volatility but also gives you the option of taking a short position in physical gold bullion, coins or mining stocks.  Here are some reasons why investors choose GoldMint:  You can hedge your investment in gold using the GOLD token. Doing so protects your gold from bearish conditions. Investors can chose to convert just a portion of their assets or all of it with this GOLD cryptoasset Investors may want to invest in a minimal amount of GOLD to assess whether or not they profit GOLD is based on real physical gold and therefore possesses far more face-value credibility than other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have. The gold market/ gld returns look promising. GoldMint helps investors hedge their risks and promises more for their investments.   Quote from: Kracko on September 23, 2017, 03:34:53 PM Is MNTP a security token?   No, MNTP tokens are used for ICO only. As soon as GoldMint blockchain is launched, MNTP can be exchanged for MNT used as stake in our consensus algorithm. MNT holders do not receive any passive income. We have a report on MNT/MNTP status from an US lawyer company. This provides us with an opportunity to trade MNT/MNTP on the US market 12 months after ICO.

You may be able to receive a cryptocurrency or fiat loan from GoldMint PTE LTD, using GOLD as collateral. All applicants will need to undergo the KYC procedure.  All members who have GOLD receive GoldMint Partner banks credit cards, aligned with VISA and MasterCard systems. To that end, GoldMint plans to create a special bank card  called “ Bogatstvo ” for prominent pawnshops like “ Blago ” and ” Fianit “.  Process:  GoldMint loan applicants transfer their GOLD as collateral to a certain GoldMint infrastructure element. The rate of the loan is established at the time of giving and remains fixed through the loan period.Applicants needs to consent to GoldMint loan terms to receive the loan. Applicant is given various options for repaying loan amount and for mode of repayment. If the borrower defaults, his GOLD cryptoassets are transferred to GoldMint. Credit card limits are set according to the value of the user’s GOLD.These cards can be used for payment in shops, restaurants and cafes. Interest is accrued to unpaid credit debt. If this remains unpaid, GOLD reverts to GoldMint.   Quote from: florianuhlemann on September 23, 2017, 04:24:29 PM Why don't you use ETH blockchain?   GoldMint’s blockchain, using the Graphene platform will be launched.       Advantages of such a choice compared to using an Ethereum private fork are as follows:           1. Safer  -  GoldMint  blockchain  uses  its  own  coins  rather  than  turing-complete  smart contracts.          2. More  productive  -  GoldMint  uses  PoS,  is  optimized  for  GOLD transactions  as there are no other ICOs on the same platform.            3. Cheaper - no charge for ether commissions.          4.

Traders can also diversify their trading portfolio with GOLD assets. Payroll unit- Given its low volatility, you may prefer GOLD to BTC and altcoins for paying employees. Because of its low commissions, high speed, and affordability (no extra charges for transborder payments), you can also use GOLD instead of fiat for regular deals. ICO currency - ICOs can ask for GOLD donations instead of regular cryptocurrency funds to hedge the high volatility risks that tend to accompany cryptocurrency.

Thank you   Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin), where the algorithm rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining), in PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen in a deterministic (pseudo-random) way, and the chance that an account is chosen depends on its wealth (i.e. the stake). In PoS cryptocurrencies the blocks are usually said to be forged (in the blacksmith sense of this word), or minted, rather than mined. Also, usually all the coins are created in the beginning and the total number of coins never changes afterwards (although there are some other versions of PoS where new coins can be created). Therefore, in the basic version of PoS there are no block rewards (e.g. as in bitcoin); so, the forgers take only the transaction fees   With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

To gain access to another 5% of gold circulation by introducing Custody Bot to shopping centers. To gradually gain access to a final 10% of gold reserves, worth more than $100 billion, and to develop a special version of Custody Bot for popular installation.  Quote from: code on September 23, 2017, 05:51:02 AM How Custody Bot will be linked to a blockchain?  The Airalab Core platform links Custody Bot to the blockchain.  We are consulting with them because they have a huge expirience about connecting various bots to blockchain Quote from: actudoran on September 23, 2017, 05:57:06 AM How Custody Bot analyse the value of gold?  Gold inspection includes:       ●    Visual  identification  of the product by  an  operator –  coin,  ingot, jewelry, raw gold or gold granules       ●    Evaluation via spectrography using the spectrograph installed within the box         ●    Evaluation and weighing of gold via hydrostatic weighing     Custody  Bot  uses  the  technologies  of  spectral  analysis  and  hydrostatic  weighing  to  inspect the value  of the  gold.  In the  absence  of  a  single  standard,  a  specialist  also manually inspects the jewelry before Custody Bot conducts spectral analysis.  Spectral analysis: the process: Custody  Bot  uses  fluorescence  spectroscopy,  a  type  of  electromagnetic  spectroscopy  that analyzes  fluorescence  from  a  sample.  This technique  involves using  a beam  of  light, usually ultraviolet light, that excites the electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to  emit  light.  An  analyzer  crystal  disperses  radiation  onto  the  gold  via  a  detector.  A computer-controlled  precision   goniometer  moves  the  analyzer  crystal  and  detector  and controls the position, intensity and lengths of secondary radiation waves. Concentration of the analysis is calculated by comparison with known standard samples.   Hydrostatic weighing: the process:  Hydrostatic  weighing  determines  the  density  of  the  gold  and  is  done by weighting the  item first  in  air  then  liquid  and  calculating  the  combined  private  density  (ρ2). Estimation  of density is made by contrasting the density of gold to densities of other metals.   The  initial weighting  lets  define the valuable’s weight (m1) and the second one lets detemine the volume: V=(m1-m2)/ρ2.  With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

The three most popular ETFs are “Spiders” (ticker (NYSEARCA:SPY)), “Diamonds” (ticker (NYSEARCA:DIA)) and “Qs” or ""Qubes"" (ticker (NASDAQ:QQQ)).  Top ETFs for gold can be found on ETFDB . The commission for the management of a portfolio of gold is 0.2-0.8% per annum, depending on the volatility of gold and the inflow / outflow of investors. After analyzing the correlation between the value of gold and the stock price of the three largest ETFs - the GLD (announced expense ratio 0.4% ), the IAU ( 0.25% ) and SGOL ( 0.39% ) - we estimate that the real backlog of ETF shares in physical gold is about 0.7% (prices are taken from COMEX on the LME ).

MNT holders do not receive any passive income. We have a report on MNT/MNTP status from an US lawyer company.

MNTP tokens are not gold-backed but they bring profits to the holder by verifying transaction blocks according to tokens stake held. GOLD tokens are backed by a gold ounce each with an equal price. These will get issued in 2018 only after our blockchain launch.  Quote from: InfiniteQuant on September 20, 2017, 06:09:30 AM Why limit to Gold, and not include also Platinium or any other precious metal. Personally I would love to Hedge my trade with Platinium rather than Gold.  Gold is the most distributed precious metal in the world.

Technology only furthers the desire to make our lives easier, and vending machines play an important role in catering to that.  _______________________________________________________________  Quick History of Vending Machines _______________________________________________________________  Vending machines have existed since the Roman Empire. The first such instance was a holy water dispenser, allowing users to insert a coin and receive the sacred liquid. Modern vending machines, though, came about in the late 1880s, in England. Vending machines, of course, are popular because of their extreme convenience, and ability for you to complete transactions without human interaction.  _______________________________________________________________  Different Types of Vending Machines _______________________________________________________________  When you say the word “vending machine”, a little box offering food or drinks often comes to mind. But, there are tons of other types of vending machines out there, varying from weird, to “I-wish-I’d-thought-of-that” type of brilliant.  Many zoos and museums have something called a “Mold-a-Rama”. This type of vending machine works by having the user select the type of figurine they’d like, often in the shape of animals or artifacts. From there, the machine makes the selected blow-molded plastic figurine. Once completed, it spits out the model, still hot from the press.  Japan is well-known for their quirky, atypical trends. Animals and animal costumes are no exception, in their love of going out-of-the box. So, it should come as no surprise that Tokyo offers vending machines for dog wigs and hats. Open 24-hours a day, they’re available to fix any pet apparel emergency.  The 90s brought about widespread changes, with regard to medical marijuana, which caused a huge spike in the cannabis innovation industry. It’s not shocking that a vending machine and MMJ were fused. First available in California, Colorado, and Canada, these machines were placed inside of regulated dispensaries, making the lives of card holders and budtenders alike much easier.  While these off-the-wall ideas are innovative, it begs the question, to what extent can vending machines truly improve our lives? Answer: significantly — and in more ways than you could ever imagine.  _______________________________________________________________  Gold Vending Machines _______________________________________________________________  Now, a gold vending machine isn’t an entirely new concept in and of itself. In fact, Westfield Mall located in west London, has been home to a gold vending machine (aptly named Gold to Go) for a number of years. Unassuming, yet it holds a booming presence because of the psychological draw — purchasing gold from a vending machine is novel, yet an increasingly smart investment.  Because gold does fluctuate, Gold to Go updates prices every 10 minutes, to ensure users are purchasing at an accurate market price. You can purchase in one g, 2.5 g, five g, and quarter-ounce sizes…all the way up to a 250 g bar. While exceedingly awesome in concept, there’s so much more that can be done with a gold vending machine, than solely dispensing gold.  _______________________________________________________________  A Game Changer _______________________________________________________________  That’s where Custody Bot steps in. GoldMint is a blockchain-based company involved with tokenized cryptoassets — specifically gold. Their proprietary vending machine, Custody Bot, allows people to appraise, store, receive, and deliver gold, without having to interact with human beings.  Custody bot prototype is attached to the public blockchain, Ethereum, and works as a mediator. Moving forward, it will be associated with GoldMint’s custom blockchain, based on Graphene technology. Essentially, when someone initiates an action in the vending machine, a smart contract forms between the buyer and the owner of the machine (known as a creditor). Custody Bot audits and verifies the collateral, and spits out a unique identifier code for each item stored, recording the action accordingly on the blockchain.  Once someone places jewelry in the machine, it’s stored in a safe cell. From there, it conducts a spectrometer analysis of the gold, then hydrostatically weighs the gold. In other words, it’s weighed once in air and once in liquid. It then transfers data to secure computer in the machine, where it either approves or disapproves of the gold. If approved, the value is determined, and it spits out the aforementioned unique identifier code. If disapproved, it’s returned to the owner. While this concept is great for individuals, it is pawn shops who are extremely excited about gold vending machines.  _______________________________________________________________  The State of Pawning Affairs _______________________________________________________________  Currently, the pawn industry is riddled with issues. As previously mentioned, wiring payments across borders is costly. Unclaimed pledges are a common issue, as well. Also known as pawns, these are items that have been handed over as collateral for a loan, only to be forgotten. And, because pawn shops exist worldwide, there’s truly no set standard for industry regulations.  Russia, Spain, and the UK house large pawn shop networks. Russia’s industry boasts around $1 Billion in its current asset portfolio. Spain rings in around $3 Billion. The UK, though, takes the cake at £6 Billion pounds. To say the pawn industry is gigantic would be an understatement.  Custody Bot solves many of the issues that plague pawn shops. It allows for gold to be recorded on the blockchain. With this information, pawn shops know exactly how much is in their portfolio, and to whom it belongs. Moreover, lending becomes much cheaper, thanks to the removal of expensive wire transfer fees. And, because pawn shops across the world can lend, trade, and sell with Custody Bot, a set of regulations and standards is easy to implement, given the extreme transparency and connectivity.  _______________________________________________________________  Wrap Up _______________________________________________________________  While vending machines have been around for millennia, they’re still a useful tool when paired with today’s advanced technology. Because gold is considered a stable investment, it’s often used as collateral for a loan, especially by pawn shops. Many issues plague the pawn industry, but Custody Bot and other gold vending machines are a revolutionary take on the old technology, by abolishing international borders, and bringing in a new era of pawning. The future of pawn shops has arrived.",False

Quote from: granathus on September 22, 2017, 11:06:20 AM how can gold help me hedging risks on the cryptocurrency market?  The price of GOLD is set according to the price of gold at LBMA market. GOLD has gentler volatility than cryptocurrency, so the risks of receiving less for buyback are less than had you used, say, bitcoin to make your transaction.

You can use GOLD assets for the following: Exchange fiat to cryptocurrency - Right now the fiat-cryptocurrency exchange market exceeds $400 million. Experts predict that this will reach billions once banks regulate the cryptocurrency industry. Hedge volatility risks - Traders and other cryptocurrency users can hedge their gold commodity with GOLD on any cryptocurrency trading exchange, without leaving that particular platform. Traders can also diversify their trading portfolio with GOLD assets. Payroll unit- Given its low volatility, you may prefer GOLD to BTC and altcoins for paying employees. Because of its low commissions, high speed, and affordability (no extra charges for transborder payments), you can also use GOLD instead of fiat for regular deals. ICO currency - ICOs can ask for GOLD donations instead of regular cryptocurrency funds to hedge the high volatility risks that tend to accompany cryptocurrency. Buy and transport physical gold - You can convert your physical gold into GOLD in any bank that uses the GoldMint blockchain platform.

ETF (Exchange Traded Funds) - An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a marketable security that tracks an index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets like an index fund. Unlike mutual funds, an ETF trades like a common stock on a stock exchange.  The three most popular ETFs are “Spiders” (ticker (NYSEARCA:SPY)), “Diamonds” (ticker (NYSEARCA:DIA)) and “Qs” or """"Qubes"""" (ticker (NASDAQ:QQQ)).  Top ETFs for gold can be found on ETFDB . The commission for the management of a portfolio of gold is 0.2-0.8% per annum, depending on the volatility of gold and the inflow / outflow of investors. After analyzing the correlation between the value of gold and the stock price of the three largest ETFs - the GLD (announced expense ratio 0.4% ), the IAU ( 0.25% ) and SGOL ( 0.39% ) - we estimate that the real backlog of ETF shares in physical gold is about 0.7% (prices are taken from COMEX on the LME ).

Gold- because it is a clear metal for general public. Plus, we have a company that buys 450 kg of gold per month from pawnshops all over Russia. These are unclaimed deposits. Therefore, we have our own source of gold - we don't depend on banks.   Today, more than 1% of all gold is kept in pawnshops. In 53% of the cases, gold is bought as a mean of investment. Many people buy coins or small bars of gold. For them Custody Bot is an excellent solution. Coins are the easiest to examine. Initially, we set a task for our engineers to examine the quality of jewellery. They have succeeded and this is way more difficult than examining coins.

These documents let the system check that GoldMint company owns X amount of gold. This X is checked by an auditor from GoldMint. This number is verified each month by an objective TOP5 audit company. Inspection confirms that the total number of GOLD cryptoassets in all wallets (Y) is less than the total number of X ounces of gold on the balance sheet.  With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

If the borrower defaults, his GOLD cryptoassets are transferred to GoldMint.  Quote from: granathus on September 21, 2017, 07:50:24 AM Who is your target audience?  Crypto traders – These participants can use GOLD for hedging cryptocurrency volatility, as described in the white paper. GOLD can also be used to convert cryptocurrency into fiat. Standard investors – These investors may want to buy GOLD as cryptocurrency or as a type of security. E-commerce and self-employed individuals – GOLD can be used to pay for goods and services. Its low volatility asset and predictability make it an invaluable form of currency. Banks – GOLD cryptoassets gives banks new opportunities. There’s free liquidity and extra earning potential from trading gold into fiat and the reverse. Cryptocurrency has become a massive industry. Banks can profit from earning standard commissions, commissions on gold storage, and from using the GoldMint cash management system. At the same time, banks that invest in GOLD reinforce GOLD’s reputation, which increases their profit. Banks also earn commission from participating in the GoldMint partner program. Today the cryptocurrency overall circulation has achieved more than $700 billion a year and the commissions for deposit and withdrawal are more than 5%.  In case the bank sets lower commissions for GOLD buy/sell for a client, most transactions (cryprocurrency deposit and withdrawal) will switch from underground exchanges to the banks. At the same time the integration with GOLD only is necessary, while all the other cryptocurrencies can be purchased on a cryptoexchange directly. Banks also have revenues from cash management and commission charging for gold storing owned by GoldMint company. Still one more source of income for banks is the revenue from the partner program which includes adding GOLD digital asset to the product line of the bank’s department of Wealth Management.

Today, a significant amount of investors like to use gold to hedge against inflation or to diversify their investments. In fact, gold became the one common investment  of all metals and has a legendary history as commodity and coin.

GoldMint not only helps you cushion the risk of this volatility but also gives you the option of taking a short position in physical gold bullion, coins or mining stocks.  Here are some reasons why investors choose GoldMint:  You can hedge your investment in gold using the GOLD token. Doing so protects your gold from bearish conditions. Investors can chose to convert just a portion of their assets or all of it with this GOLD cryptoasset Investors may want to invest in a minimal amount of GOLD to assess whether or not they profit GOLD is based on real physical gold and therefore possesses far more face-value credibility than other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have.

You can, also, receive a credit card through a partner bank. The limit of that card will correspond to the value of your stored gold.

Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin), where the algorithm rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining), in PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen in a deterministic (pseudo-random) way, and the chance that an account is chosen depends on its wealth (i.e. the stake). In PoS cryptocurrencies the blocks are usually said to be forged (in the blacksmith sense of this word), or minted, rather than mined. Also, usually all the coins are created in the beginning and the total number of coins never changes afterwards (although there are some other versions of PoS where new coins can be created). Therefore, in the basic version of PoS there are no block rewards (e.g. as in bitcoin); so, the forgers take only the transaction fees  Quote from: qberty on September 20, 2017, 08:39:20 AM how are the rewards for mining determined?

Quote from: actudoran on September 20, 2017, 08:09:05 AM Why don't you use ETH blockchain?  GoldMint’s blockchain, using the Graphene platform will be launched.       Advantages of such a choice compared to using an Ethereum private fork are as follows:           1. Safer  -  GoldMint  blockchain  uses  its  own  coins  rather  than  turing-complete  smart contracts.          2. More  productive  -  GoldMint  uses  PoS,  is  optimized  for  GOLD transactions  as there are no other ICOs on the same platform.            3. Cheaper - no charge for ether commissions.          4. The Graphene blockchain supports PoS.  Quote from: spiceminer15 on September 20, 2017, 08:16:01 AM What about GOLD/MNT mining?  To start mining, you just  needs  to  download  a program  from the  GoldMint repository, launch it on your device, fine-tune it and start mining.  Consensus algorithm :  We use PoS as our primary mining system. In  case  a user who holds many MNT  doesn’t have  enough  computational power, he can rent  computational power from other miners.  Miner rotation  The  amount  of  stakes  depends  on the  amount  of MNT  a miner holds.  So,  if  a miner owns 50% MNT, he will be chosen to process every second block.

Quote from: ianp on September 20, 2017, 05:04:58 AM Some people may wonder if they can exchange the gold token with the real gold bars. How are you going to explain this?   The price of one GOLD equals one ounce of physical gold on the LBMA. Applicants who want to trade GOLD for fiat need to undergo GoldMint's KYC procedure. If accepted, the applicant’s GOLD cryptoasset is transferred from his, or her, GoldMint wallet to a special GoldMint account and is converted to fiat. GoldMint sends this fiat to the applicant. So, the price with commissions you receive for buying GOLD is LBMA + 5%, selling - LBMA + 2%. Therefore the way fiat => GOLD => fiat will be 3%.

The Airalab Core platform links Custody Bot to the blockchain.  We are consulting with them because they have a huge expirience about connecting various bots to blockchain  Quote from: code on September 20, 2017, 06:16:05 AM How Custody Bot analyse the value of gold?  Gold inspection includes:       ●    Visual  identification  of the product by  an  operator –  coin,  ingot, jewelry, raw gold or gold granules       ●    Evaluation via spectrography using the spectrograph installed within the box         ●    Evaluation and weighing of gold via hydrostatic weighing     Custody  Bot  uses  the  technologies  of  spectral  analysis  and  hydrostatic  weighing  to  inspect the value  of the  gold.  In the  absence  of  a  single  standard,  a  specialist  also manually inspects the jewelry before Custody Bot conducts spectral analysis.  Spectral analysis: the process: Custody  Bot  uses  fluorescence  spectroscopy,  a  type  of  electromagnetic  spectroscopy  that analyzes  fluorescence  from  a  sample.  This technique  involves using  a beam  of  light, usually ultraviolet light, that excites the electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to  emit  light.  An  analyzer  crystal  disperses  radiation  onto  the  gold  via  a  detector.  A computer-controlled  precision   goniometer  moves  the  analyzer  crystal  and  detector  and controls the position, intensity and lengths of secondary radiation waves. Concentration of the analysis is calculated by comparison with known standard samples.   Hydrostatic weighing: the process:  Hydrostatic  weighing  determines  the  density  of  the  gold  and  is  done by weighting the  item first  in  air  then  liquid  and  calculating  the  combined  private  density  (ρ2). Estimation  of density is made by contrasting the density of gold to densities of other metals.   The  initial weighting  lets  define the valuable’s weight (m1) and the second one lets detemine the volume: V=(m1-m2)/ρ2.  Quote from: actudoran on September 20, 2017, 06:21:22 AM what is custody bot?  Custody Bot is GoldMint's unique device.

Commercial producers and gold workers, like miners, jewelers, or the government, tended to use gold options, futures and ETF as hedging tools.  Today, a significant amount of investors like to use gold to hedge against inflation or to diversify their investments. In fact, gold became the one common investment  of all metals and has a legendary history as commodity and coin. Like other commodities, gold depends on micro and macro economical and political events, so its value fluctuates along with these. GoldMint not only helps you cushion the risk of this volatility but also gives you the option of taking a short position in physical gold bullion, coins or mining stocks.  Here are some reasons why investors choose GoldMint:  You can hedge your investment in gold using the GOLD token. Doing so protects your gold from bearish conditions. Investors can chose to convert just a portion of their assets or all of it with this GOLD cryptoasset Investors may want to invest in a minimal amount of GOLD to assess whether or not they profit GOLD is based on real physical gold and therefore possesses far more face-value credibility than other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have.

Gold has a magical quality that other metals and substances do not, as it provides a sense of purity and infinity. It is also easy to shape in various forms. These characteristics explain why gold continues to remain valuable and be used in various currencies — both traditional fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies.  In this article, we will briefly discuss what digital gold is, why gold is more stable and more secure than conventional and crypto currencies, and the advantages of digital gold in comparison with other currencies.  _______________________________________________________________  Gold and Digital Gold _______________________________________________________________  After the era of bartering goods, around 550 BC, gold coins were introduced as a currency by the King of Croesus of Lydia. However, some scholars posited that ancient Egyptian already used gold currency 3,500 years ago. Since King Croesus’ official use of gold coins, various types of coins were also used in several countries before the introduction of paper money in 600 BC by China.  In 1066, the British currency system introduced “the original pound,” which was a pound of silver. In 1248, they issued the gold florin, which was the first major gold currency. The era of using gold as monetary standard has officially started.  Fast forward five centuries later, in 1792, the United States started a silver-gold monetary system, which established that the value of one US dollar was equal to 24.75 grains of pure gold. At that time, notes can be redeemed into gold or silver. However, redeemability ended in 1933 for gold and 1968 for silver.  By the 19th Century, many major currencies were fixed to gold at a set price per ounce, under the so-called Gold Standard. The USA introduced its gold standard in 1900. President Richard Nixon, however, released this standard in 1978. Since then, the US dollar has no backing but debt, which is called “fiat money.”  Digital gold currency is a digital currency backed by mass units of gold that resembles the U.S. paper gold certificate used from 1873 to 1933, which was exchangeable with gold. Today, digital gold currencies are issued by companies, such as GoldMint, which is also a platform where users can pay each other in gold units that are as valuable as gold bullion. Digital gold currencies are considered independent currencies.  _______________________________________________________________  Why Gold Is More Stable _______________________________________________________________  The market value of gold remains more stable than other metals. When other currencies are weak, gold value usually increases. One of the most told use-case stories is that people during the times of war or natural disasters often return to using gold pieces to pay for life necessities. In other words, when other currencies have no more value due to political, social, and economic uncertainties, gold remains valuable and is the most respected item for bartering.  Physically, gold does not corrode nor shift in shape despite changes in temperature, location, and time. Even after thousands of years, gold remains pure and free from external elements, which allows immediate processing, if needed. It is also non-toxic and portable — can be shaped in various forms. As a currency, these traits provide a sense of security that the value will be preserved as well.  _______________________________________________________________  Advantages of Digital Gold _______________________________________________________________  Due to being backed by gold bullion, digital gold currencies provide the same sense of stability and security like gold bars and gold certificates. Users keep digitalized information on their gold units, which are backed by real gold. Such record is a proof of ownership of the gold units.  Thus, digital gold currencies also give protection against inflation and are timeless and convenient to store. The record of ownership will be kept in an online account, which users can use for various purposes, including currency exchanges and obtaining loans.  Compared with traditional (fiat) currencies, gold and digital gold provide a hedge against inflation. Also, when currencies are weak, gold value usually increases. Since digital gold can be redeemed, owners can use real gold units whenever needed.  Compared with other crypto currencies, like Bitcoin, digital gold currencies are more stable and secure. Digital gold currencies are backed by real gold bullion, while most other crypto currencies are not. However, in the case of Tether, which is backed by dollar, it is prone to inflation and the ups and downs of a fiat currency. Crypto currencies rely on trust that they have value, while digital gold currencies’ value is closely affected by the value of gold bullion.  _______________________________________________________________  Other advantages of digital gold currencies include: _______________________________________________________________  1. Universality It is a borderless global currency system independent of exchange rates and political situations.  2. Asset protection Digital gold currencies hold 100 percent of ownership in gold units, which can be redeemed with digital certificates. Most fiat currencies, however, aren’t backed at all. The US dollars, for instance, are “legal tender” in payments of debts.  3. Investment Digital gold currencies can be kept as investments. They can be used for various investment purposes among parties as well.  4. Exchangeability Digital gold currencies can be exchanged through digital currency exchangers to be bought and sold. However, if necessary, owners can redeem the gold units and use them for transactions.  5. Non-reversibility Digital gold currency transactions are final and can’t be reversed like in credit and debit card transactions. It allows transactions to occur without being able to be reversed in most circumstances. These characteristics allow digital gold currency platforms run without spending a large budget for dispute resolutions.  6. Immediacy Due to the blockchain technology that supports digital currencies, like the GoldMint, transactions and exchanges can occur immediately with smart contracts. Smart contracts are computer software that provides instant execution of agreement terms upon met conditions.  In conclusion, digital gold currencies are the modern digital format of gold bullion. Thus, they have the same advantages as the real gold, while also enjoy the convenience and immediacy of digital currencies.",False

Quote from: granathus on September 19, 2017, 07:26:20 PM What are the commissions for transactions in gold?   Most times, when a person buys GOLD for fiat, the price for GOLD will be LBMA + 5%. When they want to sell their GOLD, the price will be LBMA +3%. The commission for managing gold is 0.2-0.8% per annum, depending on gold volatility and investor traffic. After analyzing the correlation between the value of gold and the stock price of the three largest ETFs - the GLD (announced expense ratio 0.4% ), the IAU ( 0.25% ) and SGOL ( 0.39% ) - we estimate that the real backlog of ETF shares in physical gold is about 0.7% (prices are taken from COMEX on the LME ).

You can use GOLD assets for the following: Exchange fiat to cryptocurrency - Right now the fiat-cryptocurrency exchange market exceeds $400 million. Experts predict that this will reach billions once banks regulate the cryptocurrency industry. Hedge volatility risks - Traders and other cryptocurrency users can hedge their gold commodity with GOLD on any cryptocurrency trading exchange, without leaving that particular platform. Traders can also diversify their trading portfolio with GOLD assets. Payroll unit- Given its low volatility, you may prefer GOLD to BTC and altcoins for paying employees. Because of its low commissions, high speed, and affordability (no extra charges for transborder payments), you can also use GOLD instead of fiat for regular deals. ICO currency - ICOs can ask for GOLD donations instead of regular cryptocurrency funds to hedge the high volatility risks that tend to accompany cryptocurrency. Buy and transport physical gold - You can convert your physical gold into GOLD in any bank that uses the GoldMint blockchain platform. This not only protects cross-country gold transportation but also simplifies the process.   Quote from: nenelsparadise on September 19, 2017, 03:09:11 PM How is gold emitted?

The sale kicks off on September 20th at 9:00 UTC.  During its ICO GoldMint will offer their MNTP (MNT pre-launch tokens) for sale at the price of $7 in ETH equivalent, the price will be adjusted manually all the time max once in one hour dependent on the Ethereum rate (Coinmaketcap) due to its high volatility. There may be some delays in the adjustment process in case the Ethereum network is overloaded. MNTP will be emitted on the Ethereum blockchain and later migrate to GoldMint’s own blockchain (in Q2 2018), where it will be used to verify transactions and confirm blocks. Miners will get 75% of commissions for transactions with GOLD, the physical gold-backed digital asset. _______________________________________________________________  Goldmint.io is the ONLY address of GoldMint _______________________________________________________________  Under no circumstances will GoldMint ever use any other website or a mirror during the crowdsale.

The price of one GOLD equals one ounce of physical gold on the LBMA. Applicants who want to trade GOLD for fiat need to undergo GoldMint's KYC procedure. If accepted, the applicant’s GOLD cryptoasset is transferred from his, or her, GoldMint wallet to a special GoldMint account and is converted to fiat. GoldMint sends this fiat to the applicant. So, the price with commissions you receive for buying GOLD is LBMA + 5%, selling - LBMA + 2%. Therefore the way fiat => GOLD => fiat will be 3%.

You can use GOLD assets for the following: Exchange fiat to cryptocurrency - Right now the fiat-cryptocurrency exchange market exceeds $400 million.

Hedge volatility risks - Traders and other cryptocurrency users can hedge their gold commodity with GOLD on any cryptocurrency trading exchange, without leaving that particular platform. Traders can also diversify their trading portfolio with GOLD assets. Payroll unit- Given its low volatility, you may prefer GOLD to BTC and altcoins for paying employees. Because of its low commissions, high speed, and affordability (no extra charges for transborder payments), you can also use GOLD instead of fiat for regular deals. ICO currency - ICOs can ask for GOLD donations instead of regular cryptocurrency funds to hedge the high volatility risks that tend to accompany cryptocurrency.

The volatility of the very first crypto coins in the market manifest the necessity to hedge the risks with a stable currency. Be it gold, dollars, mac laptops or pieces of arts, no matter what commodity or asset they are backed with, their value should stay in sync with the commodity’s price in the real market and that stays a prime challenge to achieve. The concept is not complicated but the latest efforts to bring the idea to life have not been widely adopted yet.  Cryptocurrencies have captured the imagination of many and thus, the idea of assets (other than money) backed digital currency is gaining more acceptance. While Gold continues to storm the global investment market, bringing it closer to cryptocurrencies will assure a trustworthy physical backing. Digix, one of the most well-known stable currency projects, has recently posted an overview of the existing and upcoming solutions in the industry of tokenized gold.  Having a complicated audit system, Digix ensures the transparency and the backing of their DGX tokens but the gold token has not been released yet and the capitalization of the company grows mostly due to the speculative price growth of DAO token. The emergence of DAO platform and a tokenized gold asset is a tremendous initiative as it ensures development of all the companies prevalent in the market. So, the new attempts to create digital gold asset were done but none of these have succeeded yet and encouraged the cryptogold which can be exchanged easily in the market.  GoldMint project is led by a team of Russian developers who have extensive experience in managing physical gold. LOT-ZOLOTO, a company founded by GoldMint’s CEO Dmitry Pluschevsky, has exceeded the trading volume of $10 million in March, 2017. The perfect understanding of the market provided the GoldMint’s team with an opportunity to develop a platform which is more than just digital gold asset blockchain. GOLD, digitized gold, and Custody Bot, a vending gold storage machine, are the two independent products of GoldMint that heralds a mark in the evolution of ‘smart contracts’.  _______________________________________________________________  GOLD backing: storage and audit _______________________________________________________________  GOLD is backed by physical gold of 999 quality or ETF bought on the stock exchange NYSE Arca. ETFs are used as a backing instrument as they are a more portable and convenient instrument for storing gold value compared to physical gold. Still, the Company proposes to partly back the value of its GOLD by physical gold: All physical gold owned by GoldMint exists in the following forms:  1. Manufacturer-certified bullions 2. Gold coins 3. Gold jewelry 4. 999 quality granules, stamped by manufacturer  As stated in the White Paper, “Physical gold is locked-up in storage and rated according to its value:  1. Moody’s — A2 and above. 2. Standard & Poor’s — A and above. 3. Fitch — A and above”.  All the transactions on deposing and withdrawing gold are confirmed by bank statements which are encoded by uploading relevant forms in GoldMint blockchain. These documents allow the system to check that GoldMint company owns the particular amount of gold.  The gold storage is regularly audited by an auditor from GoldMint and by any one of the TOP 100 audit company monthly.  For more information of Gold backing and storage, read GoldMint’s White Paper section 4.1.1. Gold Emission.  _______________________________________________________________  GOLD purchase and redemption _______________________________________________________________      As you can see in the infographics above, the process of GoldMint purchase and redemption is quite simple and infuses KYC procedure. As soon as GOLD is sold, the digital assets are burnt to persistently maintain the ratio of 1:1 between physical gold/ETF and GOLD asset . The commission for FIAT — GOLD — FIAT transactions is 2% of gold market price for the whole circle.  Staying intact to transparency and accuracy, GoldMint unlatches the potential of world’s most valued asset through an effective trading platform. As the interest of the investor grows towards tokenized Gold, GoldMint’s Blockchain lets you utilize the commodity in different ways and up scales its exchangeability.

Differences   between   Goldmint   and   other  gold   cryptocurrency   blockchains  include  the  following:             Goldmint uses its own blockchain and altcoin, called MNT, for GOLD transactions.            Goldmint  uses Proof-of-Stake where miners  are  doled blocks/ transactions  according   to the  amount  of MNT they have. Proof  of  stake  (PoS)  is  faster,  simpler and                 cheaper  than proof of work (PoW).            Physical gold and ETFs are stored in a programmed decentralized storage unit.          Custody Bot    -   Goldmint’s   innovative  storage unit  is programmed to automatically  identify  and  store  gold  jewelry,  small  ingots  (up  to  100  grams)  and  coins without human intervention.

Experts predict that this will reach billions once banks regulate the cryptocurrency industry. Hedge volatility risks - Traders and other cryptocurrency users can hedge their gold commodity with GOLD on any cryptocurrency trading exchange, without leaving that particular platform. Traders can also diversify their trading portfolio with GOLD assets. Payroll unit- Given its low volatility, you may prefer GOLD to BTC and altcoins for paying employees. Because of its low commissions, high speed, and affordability (no extra charges for transborder payments), you can also use GOLD instead of fiat for regular deals. ICO currency - ICOs can ask for GOLD donations instead of regular cryptocurrency funds to hedge the high volatility risks that tend to accompany cryptocurrency. Buy and transport physical gold - You can convert your physical gold into GOLD in any bank that uses the GoldMint blockchain platform.

Crypto traders – These participants can use GOLD for hedging cryptocurrency volatility, as described in the white paper. GOLD can also be used to convert cryptocurrency into fiat. Standard investors – These investors may want to buy GOLD as cryptocurrency or as a type of security. E-commerce and self-employed individuals – GOLD can be used to pay for goods and services. Its low volatility asset and predictability make it an invaluable form of currency. Banks – GOLD cryptoassets gives banks new opportunities. There’s free liquidity and extra earning potential from trading gold into fiat and the reverse. Cryptocurrency has become a massive industry. Banks can profit from earning standard commissions, commissions on gold storage, and from using the GoldMint cash management system. At the same time, banks that invest in GOLD reinforce GOLD’s reputation, which increases their profit. Banks also earn commission from participating in the GoldMint partner program. Today the cryptocurrency overall circulation has achieved more than $700 billion a year and the commissions for deposit and withdrawal are more than 5%.  In case the bank sets lower commissions for GOLD buy/sell for a client, most transactions (cryprocurrency deposit and withdrawal) will switch from underground exchanges to the banks. At the same time the integration with GOLD only is necessary, while all the other cryptocurrencies can be purchased on a cryptoexchange directly. Banks also have revenues from cash management and commission charging for gold storing owned by GoldMint company. Still one more source of income for banks is the revenue from the partner program which includes adding GOLD digital asset to the product line of the bank’s department of Wealth Management.

The price of one GOLD equals one ounce of physical gold on the LBMA. Applicants who want to trade GOLD for fiat need to undergo GoldMint's KYC procedure. If accepted, the applicant’s GOLD cryptoasset is transferred from his, or her, GoldMint wallet to a special GoldMint account and is converted to fiat. GoldMint sends this fiat to the applicant. So, the price with commissions you receive for buying GOLD is LBMA + 5%, selling - LBMA + 2%. Therefore the way fiat => GOLD => fiat will be 3%.

Quote from: CryptoPromotions on September 17, 2017, 03:52:36 PM Describe PoS and why you chose it? Thank you   Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin), where the algorithm rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining), in PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen in a deterministic (pseudo-random) way, and the chance that an account is chosen depends on its wealth (i.e. the stake). In PoS cryptocurrencies the blocks are usually said to be forged (in the blacksmith sense of this word), or minted, rather than mined. Also, usually all the coins are created in the beginning and the total number of coins never changes afterwards (although there are some other versions of PoS where new coins can be created). Therefore, in the basic version of PoS there are no block rewards (e.g. as in bitcoin); so, the forgers take only the transaction fees.    With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

The Graphene blockchain supports PoS.  Quote from: getwork on September 17, 2017, 07:25:23 AM What about GOLD/MNT mining?  ""To start mining, you just  needs  to  download  a program  from the  GoldMint repository, launch it on your device, fine-tune it and start mining.  Consensus algorithm :  We use PoS as our primary mining system. In  case  a user who holds many MNT  doesn’t have  enough  computational power, he can rent  computational power from other miners.  Miner rotation  The  amount  of  stakes  depends  on the  amount  of MNT  a miner holds.  So,  if  a miner owns 50% MNT, he will be chosen to process every second block.   Miner rewards  A miner receives  a  GOLD commission from each processed block. When the block is processed, no tokens are emitted.  Quote from: mika1977 on September 17, 2017, 07:37:11 AM Describe PoS and why you chose it? Thank you  Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin), where the algorithm rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining), in PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen in a deterministic (pseudo-random) way, and the chance that an account is chosen depends on its wealth (i.e. the stake). In PoS cryptocurrencies the blocks are usually said to be forged (in the blacksmith sense of this word), or minted, rather than mined. Also, usually all the coins are created in the beginning and the total number of coins never changes afterwards (although there are some other versions of PoS where new coins can be created). Therefore, in the basic version of PoS there are no block rewards (e.g. as in bitcoin); so, the forgers take only the transaction fees  With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

Standard investors – These investors may want to buy GOLD as cryptocurrency or as a type of security. E-commerce and self-employed individuals – GOLD can be used to pay for goods and services. Its low volatility asset and predictability make it an invaluable form of currency. Banks – GOLD cryptoassets gives banks new opportunities. There’s free liquidity and extra earning potential from trading gold into fiat and the reverse. Cryptocurrency has become a massive industry. Banks can profit from earning standard commissions, commissions on gold storage, and from using the GoldMint cash management system. At the same time, banks that invest in GOLD reinforce GOLD’s reputation, which increases their profit. Banks also earn commission from participating in the GoldMint partner program. Today the cryptocurrency overall circulation has achieved more than $700 billion a year and the commissions for deposit and withdrawal are more than 5%.  In case the bank sets lower commissions for GOLD buy/sell for a client, most transactions (cryprocurrency deposit and withdrawal) will switch from underground exchanges to the banks. At the same time the integration with GOLD only is necessary, while all the other cryptocurrencies can be purchased on a cryptoexchange directly. Banks also have revenues from cash management and commission charging for gold storing owned by GoldMint company.

Commercial producers and gold workers, like miners, jewelers, or the government, tended to use gold options, futures and ETF as hedging tools.  Today, a significant amount of investors like to use gold to hedge against inflation or to diversify their investments. In fact, gold became the one common investment  of all metals and has a legendary history as commodity and coin. Like other commodities, gold depends on micro and macro economical and political events, so its value fluctuates along with these. GoldMint not only helps you cushion the risk of this volatility but also gives you the option of taking a short position in physical gold bullion, coins or mining stocks.  Here are some reasons why investors choose GoldMint:  You can hedge your investment in gold using the GOLD token. Doing so protects your gold from bearish conditions. Investors can chose to convert just a portion of their assets or all of it with this GOLD cryptoasset Investors may want to invest in a minimal amount of GOLD to assess whether or not they profit GOLD is based on real physical gold and therefore possesses far more face-value credibility than other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have. The gold market/ gld returns look promising. GoldMint helps investors hedge their risks and promises more for their investments.

No. None of others gold-backed projects are founded by businessmen who have a real physical gold business with a tangible turnover. Our founders have a living gold processing company ""LOT ZOLOTO"" having 400kg physical gold turnover monthly and $50M turnover for the past 6 months.

Their concept isn't full for my opinion : )  Quote from: nmrcngrb on September 15, 2017, 09:19:29 AM    As far as I have researched, it has 2 main differences. 1st GoldMint holds phisical gold and/or ETF as backing in contrast to Xaurum which holds only Phisical gold. 2nd GoldMint has fix backing, so it's like holding phisical gold or ETF, Xaurum has growing gold base. This means that in the first moment ammount of backing is on GoldMint side since it is 100% backed by gold and Xaurum is not, but eventualy you will have more backing in Xaurum since it has growing gold base. Both coins have some additional features which makes them unique. They are both good on the field where they are playing although GoldMint still have time to prove it since it is on the begining of the road. I believe it will. As far as I understand GoldMint is more on the field of hedging and security, but Xaurum with growing gold base brings more potential growth.  Please devs correct me if I'm wrong.   These are the benefits of GOLD tokens:  1. STABLE PRICE. - for cryptotraders it can help hedging risks after a busy day trading. - for ICOs to hedge your risks when buying new tokens. As you know each ICO has their ETH exchange rate on the first day and rate is kept till the last day frozen. ALL ICOs usually continue for 1 month. And during this month ETH and BTC can suffer really big fluctuations of price.  2. CHEAP ENTRY. The process to buy any of the cryptocurrencies today having fiat is accompanied with high transactions fees such as 5-8% or even more! Agree? Same with selling your BTC or ETH for fiat. Is anybody happy with the 10-16% spread of FIAT-GOLD-FIAT circle? We can provide same with less than 5%! HOW? We are going to deliver this service to banks. We already have banks agreed as they have plenty of GOLD and want to issue GOLD tokens backed by their physical GOLD. Isn't it nice?  3. FIAT LOANING. We are going to deliver p2p fiat loaning to our GOLD token buyers. How? As a collateral you can deposit your GOLD tokens to GOLDMINT and get a loan on a credit card issued by our bank partners. Why we decided so? There 60000 tones of GOLD excavated today. 30000 of them are on people hands, necks or kept in drawers. Nobody today can refinance physical gold better then pawnshops. Tired of 100-150% pawnshops interest anually?  4. CUSTODY BOT. Here come our future tech - own designed robotic custody bots which can evaluate physical gold, issue GOLD tokens to those who will deposit their physical gold jewellery. Realtime. Hassle free.

Commercial producers and gold workers, like miners, jewelers, or the government, tended to use gold options, futures and ETF as hedging tools.  Today, a significant amount of investors like to use gold to hedge against inflation or to diversify their investments. In fact, gold became the one common investment  of all metals and has a legendary history as commodity and coin. Like other commodities, gold depends on micro and macro economical and political events, so its value fluctuates along with these. GoldMint not only helps you cushion the risk of this volatility but also gives you the option of taking a short position in physical gold bullion, coins or mining stocks.  Here are some reasons why investors choose GoldMint:  You can hedge your investment in gold using the GOLD token. Doing so protects your gold from bearish conditions. Investors can chose to convert just a portion of their assets or all of it with this GOLD cryptoasset Investors may want to invest in a minimal amount of GOLD to assess whether or not they profit GOLD is based on real physical gold and therefore possesses far more face-value credibility than other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have. The gold market/ gld returns look promising. GoldMint helps investors hedge their risks and promises more for their investments.   Quote from: atariguy on September 16, 2017, 03:42:12 AM Is MNTP a security token?   No, MNTP tokens are used for ICO only.

You can use GOLD assets for the following: Exchange fiat to cryptocurrency - Right now the fiat-cryptocurrency exchange market exceeds $400 million. Experts predict that this will reach billions once banks regulate the cryptocurrency industry. Hedge volatility risks - Traders and other cryptocurrency users can hedge their gold commodity with GOLD on any cryptocurrency trading exchange, without leaving that particular platform. Traders can also diversify their trading portfolio with GOLD assets. Payroll unit- Given its low volatility, you may prefer GOLD to BTC and altcoins for paying employees. Because of its low commissions, high speed, and affordability (no extra charges for transborder payments), you can also use GOLD instead of fiat for regular deals. ICO currency - ICOs can ask for GOLD donations instead of regular cryptocurrency funds to hedge the high volatility risks that tend to accompany cryptocurrency. Buy and transport physical gold - You can convert your physical gold into GOLD in any bank that uses the GoldMint blockchain platform. This not only protects cross-country gold transportation but also simplifies the process.    Quote from: hometester on September 15, 2017, 03:40:35 PM How is gold emitted?

Quote from: mika1977 on September 15, 2017, 02:11:06 PM Describe PoS and why you chose it? Thank you  Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin), where the algorithm rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining), in PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen in a deterministic (pseudo-random) way, and the chance that an account is chosen depends on its wealth (i.e. the stake). In PoS cryptocurrencies the blocks are usually said to be forged (in the blacksmith sense of this word), or minted, rather than mined. Also, usually all the coins are created in the beginning and the total number of coins never changes afterwards (although there are some other versions of PoS where new coins can be created). Therefore, in the basic version of PoS there are no block rewards (e.g. as in bitcoin); so, the forgers take only the transaction fees  With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

Our idea is no short of revolutionary: we plan to convert this gold into blockchain-encrypted tokens to help owners protect their valuables, to help investors move their gold can more rapidly and easily from one part of the world to another, and to help companies and individuals hedge their gold against market volatility.  We plan to move in three stages:  To gain access to 1% of global gold circulation (over 300 tonnes) by launching Custody Bot automated storage facilities in pawnshops around the world. To gain access to another 5% of gold circulation by introducing Custody Bot to shopping centers. To gradually gain access to a final 10% of gold reserves, worth more than $100 billion, and to develop a special version of Custody Bot for popular installation.  Quote from: Kracko on September 15, 2017, 11:25:06 AM How Custody Bot will be linked to a blockchain?  The Airalab Core platform links Custody Bot to the blockchain.  We are consulting with them because they have a huge expirience about connecting various bots to blockchain  With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

Gold inspection includes:       ●    Visual  identification  of the product by  an  operator –  coin,  ingot, jewelry, raw gold or gold granules       ●    Evaluation via spectrography using the spectrograph installed within the box         ●    Evaluation and weighing of gold via hydrostatic weighing     Custody  Bot  uses  the  technologies  of  spectral  analysis  and  hydrostatic  weighing  to  inspect the value  of the  gold.  In the  absence  of  a  single  standard,  a  specialist  also manually inspects the jewelry before Custody Bot conducts spectral analysis.  Spectral analysis: the process: Custody  Bot  uses  fluorescence  spectroscopy,  a  type  of  electromagnetic  spectroscopy  that analyzes  fluorescence  from  a  sample.  This technique  involves using  a beam  of  light, usually ultraviolet light, that excites the electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to  emit  light.  An  analyzer  crystal  disperses  radiation  onto  the  gold  via  a  detector.  A computer-controlled  precision   goniometer  moves  the  analyzer  crystal  and  detector  and controls the position, intensity and lengths of secondary radiation waves. Concentration of the analysis is calculated by comparison with known standard samples.   Hydrostatic weighing: the process:  Hydrostatic  weighing  determines  the  density  of  the  gold  and  is  done by weighting the  item first  in  air  then  liquid  and  calculating  the  combined  private  density  (ρ2). Estimation  of density is made by contrasting the density of gold to densities of other metals.   The  initial weighting  lets  define the valuable’s weight (m1) and the second one lets detemine the volume: V=(m1-m2)/ρ2.

This means that in the first moment ammount of backing is on GoldMint side since it is 100% backed by gold and Xaurum is not, but eventualy you will have more backing in Xaurum since it has growing gold base. Both coins have some additional features which makes them unique. They are both good on the field where they are playing although GoldMint still have time to prove it since it is on the begining of the road. I believe it will.

When they want to sell their GOLD, the price will be LBMA +3%. The commission for managing gold is 0.2-0.8% per annum, depending on gold volatility and investor traffic. After analyzing the correlation between the value of gold and the stock price of the three largest ETFs - the GLD (announced expense ratio 0.4% ), the IAU ( 0.25% ) and SGOL ( 0.39% ) - we estimate that the real backlog of ETF shares in physical gold is about 0.7% (prices are taken from COMEX on the LME ).

Traders can also diversify their trading portfolio with GOLD assets. Payroll unit- Given its low volatility, you may prefer GOLD to BTC and altcoins for paying employees. Because of its low commissions, high speed, and affordability (no extra charges for transborder payments), you can also use GOLD instead of fiat for regular deals. ICO currency - ICOs can ask for GOLD donations instead of regular cryptocurrency funds to hedge the high volatility risks that tend to accompany cryptocurrency.

Precious metals, especially gold, have long been considered a “safe investment” because prices are generally stable. But, the way in which people store gold is completely out-of-date, given how far technology has come. This is 2017. Every single asset in your possession should be easy-to-access, and stored in a super secure manner.  _______________________________________________________________  GoldMint — digital gold solution _______________________________________________________________  GoldMint is a blockchain-based platform, focused on gold-backed cryptoassets, aptly named “GOLD”. In the days of old, purchasing gold was a tedious, clumsy, and a downright insecure process: buying it from a dealer, then storing it in a safety deposit box. Goldmint recognized this atrocious, slow system, and created the ultimate solution: placing the precious metal on a blockchain.  In order to garner market share, they created an vending safety deposit box called “Custody Bot”. Essentially it stores and identifies gold, and gold-based items like coins and ingots up to 100 grams, without human intervention. By strategically planning tiered launches of Custody Bot in pawn shops, shopping centers, and then general high-traffic areas, GoldMint will obtain a larger market share and will be a convenient instrument to use for the general population.  Whether someone purchases gold through GoldMint, or through a dealer, it’s a very straightforward process to register it on the platform. Each GOLD is valued at the market price of an ounce of gold. For security, the platform uses Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) or physical gold of 999 quality. The platform itself is 100% transparent, and allows anyone to protect their gold assets, and easily move gold around the world.  _______________________________________________________________  Eurasia Mining — platinum and gold mining _______________________________________________________________  Eurasia Mining is an international mineral exploration company, mostly focused in Russia. They target platinum group metals (PGM) — and gold. It mines millions of ounces of the latter metal every year. Currently, they’re in the throes of three large mining projects, with one focusing strongly on potential of near-term gold production levels.  Founded in 1996, Eurasia Mining has a hand in a slew of important mining projects. These include PGM mining in Northeastern Russia’s Kola Peninsula, which expects full-production by 2020. Additionally, they ran a trial mining period in West Kytlim — which boasted more than a million pounds profit in 2016 alone. Thanks to such phenomenal success, the company was granted a Discovery Certificate, allowing them to apply for and obtain an official mining license for the West Kytlim project. Expanding their efforts takes a team effort — more than just that of the mining company itself.  _______________________________________________________________  Consequences of the cooperation _______________________________________________________________  GoldMint and Eurasia Mining are two companies focused on gold, and seemingly disparate in their goals. After closer examination, however, it’s clear they are after the same thing: bringing gold into the digital world. Because the two companies are in the same game of precious metals, they’ve formed a unique partnership to advance their businesses and expand their ventures. Eurasia Mining’s current ventures are whirring away, and they’re looking to further develop additional projects with the help of GoldMint.  As it stands, the two precious metal-based companies seek to collaborate on future endeavors, with GoldMint financing a portion, or all of a given project. From there, GoldMint will manage part, or all of the mining process. Moreover, this partnership has the potential to affect current deals.  By fusing two businesses at opposite ends of the gold obtention spectrum, they’re bridging the gap in the most productive, secure manner possible. The effects of this joint venture will be felt worldwide, thanks to increased gold production, and availability of the Custody Bot machines in high-traffic areas, where gold is prevalent. Currently, safety deposit boxes are front-of-mind when it comes to securely storing precious metals. So, the two companies are working together to break this societal-wide thought process. GoldMint’s targeted plan to to expand their Custody Bot machines will bring their blockchain-based technologies top-of-mind when securing gold. Physical safety deposit boxes will become obsolete, and GoldMint provides the digital answer for both banks and individuals.  This partnership allows a gold mine to truly market itself in such a way that people will almost immediately be able to secure their precious metals on a blockchain. Once it’s on there, the ability to move it back into fiat currency, secure a loan with gold as collateral, lend it through peer-to-peer transactions, and others actions will become infinitely easier to complete.  GoldMint’s blockchain-based platform, focuses on a specific cryptoasset: GOLD. Eurasia Mining is a large precious metals mining company, concentrated in Russia. Together, the two will skyrocket gold back into the digital mainstream. Security, efficiency, stability with precious metals — a common goal for all.",False

ETF (Exchange Traded Funds) - An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a marketable security that tracks an index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets like an index fund. Unlike mutual funds, an ETF trades like a common stock on a stock exchange.  The three most popular ETFs are “Spiders” (ticker (NYSEARCA:SPY)), “Diamonds” (ticker (NYSEARCA:DIA)) and “Qs” or ""Qubes"" (ticker (NASDAQ:QQQ)).  Top ETFs for gold can be found on ETFDB . The commission for the management of a portfolio of gold is 0.2-0.8% per annum, depending on the volatility of gold and the inflow / outflow of investors. After analyzing the correlation between the value of gold and the stock price of the three largest ETFs - the GLD (announced expense ratio 0.4% ), the IAU ( 0.25% ) and SGOL ( 0.39% ) - we estimate that the real backlog of ETF shares in physical gold is about 0.7% (prices are taken from COMEX on the LME ). Commissions and broker commissions are taken into account in calculating our commissions for GOLD.   Quote from: CryptoPromotions on September 14, 2017, 03:03:02 PM What are MNTP tokens?

Quote from: TomKoinify on September 14, 2017, 12:21:15 PM Some People May Wonder If They Can Exchange The Gold Token With The Real Gold Bars. How Are You Going To Explain This?  The price of one GOLD equals one ounce of physical gold on the LBMA. Applicants who want to trade GOLD for fiat need to undergo GoldMint's KYC procedure. If accepted, the applicant’s GOLD cryptoasset is transferred from his, or her, GoldMint wallet to a special GoldMint account and is converted to fiat. GoldMint sends this fiat to the applicant. So, the price with commissions you receive for buying GOLD is LBMA + 5%, selling - LBMA + 2%. Therefore the way fiat => GOLD => fiat will be 3%.

You can use GOLD assets for the following: Exchange fiat to cryptocurrency - Right now the fiat-cryptocurrency exchange market exceeds $400 million. Experts predict that this will reach billions once banks regulate the cryptocurrency industry. Hedge volatility risks - Traders and other cryptocurrency users can hedge their gold commodity with GOLD on any cryptocurrency trading exchange, without leaving that particular platform. Traders can also diversify their trading portfolio with GOLD assets. Payroll unit- Given its low volatility, you may prefer GOLD to BTC and altcoins for paying employees. Because of its low commissions, high speed, and affordability (no extra charges for transborder payments), you can also use GOLD instead of fiat for regular deals. ICO currency - ICOs can ask for GOLD donations instead of regular cryptocurrency funds to hedge the high volatility risks that tend to accompany cryptocurrency. Buy and transport physical gold - You can convert your physical gold into GOLD in any bank that uses the GoldMint blockchain platform.

Gold- because it is a clear metal for general public. Plus, we have a company that buys 450 kg of gold per month from pawnshops all over Russia. These are unclaimed deposits. Therefore, we have our own source of gold - we don't depend on banks.   Today, more than 1% of all gold is kept in pawnshops. In 53% of the cases, gold is bought as a mean of investment. Many people buy coins or small bars of gold. For them Custody Bot is an excellent solution. Coins are the easiest to examine. Initially, we set a task for our engineers to examine the quality of jewellery. They have succeeded and this is way more difficult than examining coins.

ETF (Exchange Traded Funds) - An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a marketable security that tracks an index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets like an index fund. Unlike mutual funds, an ETF trades like a common stock on a stock exchange.  The three most popular ETFs are “Spiders” (ticker (NYSEARCA:SPY)), “Diamonds” (ticker (NYSEARCA:DIA)) and “Qs” or """"Qubes"""" (ticker (NASDAQ:QQQ)).  Top ETFs for gold can be found on ETFDB . The commission for the management of a portfolio of gold is 0.2-0.8% per annum, depending on the volatility of gold and the inflow / outflow of investors. After analyzing the correlation between the value of gold and the stock price of the three largest ETFs - the GLD (announced expense ratio 0.4% ), the IAU ( 0.25% ) and SGOL ( 0.39% ) - we estimate that the real backlog of ETF shares in physical gold is about 0.7% (prices are taken from COMEX on the LME ).

Traders can also diversify their trading portfolio with GOLD assets. Payroll unit- Given its low volatility, you may prefer GOLD to BTC and altcoins for paying employees. Because of its low commissions, high speed, and affordability (no extra charges for transborder payments), you can also use GOLD instead of fiat for regular deals. ICO currency - ICOs can ask for GOLD donations instead of regular cryptocurrency funds to hedge the high volatility risks that tend to accompany cryptocurrency. Buy and transport physical gold - You can convert your physical gold into GOLD in any bank that uses the GoldMint blockchain platform. This not only protects cross-country gold transportation but also simplifies the process.   With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

GoldMint’s blockchain, using the Graphene platform will be launched.       Advantages of such a choice compared to using an Ethereum private fork are as follows:           1. Safer  -  GoldMint  blockchain  uses  its  own  coins  rather  than  turing-complete  smart contracts.          2. More  productive  -  GoldMint  uses  PoS,  is  optimized  for  GOLD transactions  as there are no other ICOs on the same platform.            3. Cheaper - no charge for ether commissions.          4. The Graphene blockchain supports PoS.   Quote from: qberty on September 14, 2017, 05:42:03 AM What is the use of API implementation?   The Application Programming Interface (API) regulates the GOLD, distributing these tokens to the following entities: E-commerce that can use GOLD for transactions. Local banks and Monetary Financial Institutions (MFIs) that can use GOLD as collateral. The API also regulates the GOLD that is used as escrow for bank accounts and as financial guarantees.

Differences   between   Goldmint   and   other  gold   cryptocurrency   blockchains  include  the  following:              Goldmint uses its own blockchain and altcoin, called MNT, for GOLD transactions.             Goldmint  uses Proof-of-Stake where miners  are  doled blocks/ transactions  according   to the  amount  of MNT they have.

We plan to move in three stages:  To gain access to 1% of global gold circulation (over 300 tonnes) by launching Custody Bot automated storage facilities in pawnshops around the world. To gain access to another 5% of gold circulation by introducing Custody Bot to shopping centers.

In case the bank sets lower commissions for GOLD buy/sell for a client, most transactions (cryprocurrency deposit and withdrawal) will switch from underground exchanges to the banks. At the same time the integration with GOLD only is necessary, while all the other cryptocurrencies can be purchased on a cryptoexchange directly.

The price of one GOLD equals one ounce of physical gold on the LBMA. Applicants who want to trade GOLD for fiat need to undergo GoldMint's KYC procedure. If accepted, the applicant’s GOLD cryptoasset is transferred from his, or her, GoldMint wallet to a special GoldMint account and is converted to fiat. GoldMint sends this fiat to the applicant. So, the price with commissions you receive for buying GOLD is LBMA + 5%, selling - LBMA + 2%. Therefore the way fiat => GOLD => fiat will be 3%.

Quote from: kenel on September 12, 2017, 02:40:27 PM Describe PoS and why you chose it? Thank you   Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin), where the algorithm rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining), in PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen in a deterministic (pseudo-random) way, and the chance that an account is chosen depends on its wealth (i.e. the stake). In PoS cryptocurrencies the blocks are usually said to be forged (in the blacksmith sense of this word), or minted, rather than mined. Also, usually all the coins are created in the beginning and the total number of coins never changes afterwards (although there are some other versions of PoS where new coins can be created).

Commercial producers and gold workers, like miners, jewelers, or the government, tended to use gold options, futures and ETF as hedging tools.  Today, a significant amount of investors like to use gold to hedge against inflation or to diversify their investments. In fact, gold became the one common investment  of all metals and has a legendary history as commodity and coin. Like other commodities, gold depends on micro and macro economical and political events, so its value fluctuates along with these. GoldMint not only helps you cushion the risk of this volatility but also gives you the option of taking a short position in physical gold bullion, coins or mining stocks.  Here are some reasons why investors choose GoldMint:  You can hedge your investment in gold using the GOLD token. Doing so protects your gold from bearish conditions. Investors can chose to convert just a portion of their assets or all of it with this GOLD cryptoasset Investors may want to invest in a minimal amount of GOLD to assess whether or not they profit GOLD is based on real physical gold and therefore possesses far more face-value credibility than other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have. The gold market/ gld returns look promising. GoldMint helps investors hedge their risks and promises more for their investments.   Quote from: Kracko on September 12, 2017, 08:39:18 AM Is MNTP a security token?   No, MNTP tokens are used for ICO only. As soon as GoldMint blockchain is launched, MNTP can be exchanged for MNT used as stake in our consensus algorithm. MNT holders do not receive any passive income. We have a report on MNT/MNTP status from an US lawyer company. This provides us with an opportunity to trade MNT/MNTP on the US market 12 months after ICO.

You may be able to receive a cryptocurrency or fiat loan from GoldMint PTE LTD, using GOLD as collateral. All applicants will need to undergo the KYC procedure.  All members who have GOLD receive GoldMint Partner banks credit cards, aligned with VISA and MasterCard systems. To that end, GoldMint plans to create a special bank card  called “ Bogatstvo ” for prominent pawnshops like “ Blago ” and ” Fianit “.  Process:  GoldMint loan applicants transfer their GOLD as collateral to a certain GoldMint infrastructure element. The rate of the loan is established at the time of giving and remains fixed through the loan period.Applicants needs to consent to GoldMint loan terms to receive the loan. Applicant is given various options for repaying loan amount and for mode of repayment. If the borrower defaults, his GOLD cryptoassets are transferred to GoldMint. Credit card limits are set according to the value of the user’s GOLD.These cards can be used for payment in shops, restaurants and cafes. Interest is accrued to unpaid credit debt. If this remains unpaid, GOLD reverts to GoldMint.   Quote from: florianuhlemann on September 12, 2017, 09:38:30 AM Why don't you use ETH blockchain?

In the past, stakeholders used gold to diversify risks, especially those through the use of futures indentures. Its practical scarcity, compactness and great demand in the industry made it a highly preferred product. However, due to its paucity, investing in gold was not always practical.  As technology reached new heights, people found a new way to transact gold i.e., converting it into a digital asset that can be operated globally — this is the very thing GoldMint project deals with. This digital gold asset — GOLD — is always backed by physical gold or exchange-traded funds (ETF) and its price equals one ounce of gold at any moment.  _______________________________________________________________  Gold & Graphene _______________________________________________________________  The daily circulation of the gold market is nearly $27 billion. The migration from traditional market to crypto will make gold trading faster and more transparent. With digital gold customers could now access, pass on and transfer gold effortlessly. To make the transactions still faster and cheaper, GoldMint deploys its own blockchain built on Graphene technology and scheduled for its launch in 2Q 2018.  There are many rationales behind the usage of Graphene technology by the company. It’s an open-source, offering a wide variety of tools required to bring the project to life. Furthermore, it sticks to the modern security standards and has a lot of global financial blockchain systems got on its base. As soon as GoldMint blockchain is launched, it will be used to operate GOLD digital assets — cryptogold. This can be used for speedy and secure transfers, as an investment tool and as an instrument for hedging risks.  Still, GoldMint is not only about GOLD, it also has MNT token used as stake in GoldMint blockchain PoS (Proof-of-Stake), and it guarantees the miners rewards for verifying transactions with GOLD.  _______________________________________________________________  Verifying transactions and getting 75% of commissions _______________________________________________________________  MNT refers to the GoldMint tokens. The more MNT a person owns, the more number of blocks he can validate and add to the chain. Miners may get about 75% of commission once the transactions are validated. The other 25% are allocated for charity and for GoldMint company development. Still, MNT tokens will enter the scene once GoldMint blockchain is set up — but the purchase of the future stakes will take place during ICO.  MNTP tokens stand for MNT Pre-Launch tokens and will be emitted on Ethereum blockchain in a limited supply. 10 000 000 MNTP are to be emitted and 7 000 000 tokens will be sold during the crowdsale which will happen on September, 20.  In Q2 2018 MNTP tokens will be transferred as MNT for verifying transactions in GOLD. Once the user has more MNT tokens, they can get verify more transactions and get a larger bonus.  Physical gold is an age-old method of wealth preservation and GoldMint’s novel solution gives 100% gold-backed token. The launch of the GoldMint project will interrupt the gold market and bring a stable solution to the cryptocurrency market. The market is in the middle of a paradigm shift uphill on the road to a greater adoption and GoldMint’s progressive notion will endure to attract money into this new ecosystem.",False

Gold- because it is a clear metal for general public. Plus, we have a company that buys 450 kg of gold per month from pawnshops all over Russia. These are unclaimed deposits. Therefore, we have our own source of gold - we don't depend on banks.   Today, more than 1% of all gold is kept in pawnshops. In 53% of the cases, gold is bought as a mean of investment. Many people buy coins or small bars of gold. For them Custody Bot is an excellent solution. Coins are the easiest to examine. Initially, we set a task for our engineers to examine the quality of jewellery. They have succeeded and this is way more difficult than examining coins.  With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

This means that GoldMint receives 28% per year, an annual 10% of which goes to the investor.   With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a marketable security that tracks an index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets like an index fund. Unlike mutual funds, an ETF trades like a common stock on a stock exchange. ETFs offer low-cost diversification, trading and arbitrage options. New ETFs range from several dozen to hundreds in any particular year. They can be used to back GOLD, since there is a high demand for ETFs in the gold market. Top ETFs for gold can be found on ETFDB.

The price of one GOLD equals one ounce of physical gold on the LBMA. Applicants who want to trade GOLD for fiat need to undergo GoldMint's KYC procedure. If accepted, the applicant’s GOLD cryptoasset is transferred from his, or her, GoldMint wallet to a special GoldMint account and is converted to fiat. GoldMint sends this fiat to the applicant. So, the price with commissions you receive for buying GOLD is LBMA + 5%, selling - LBMA + 2%. Therefore the way fiat => GOLD => fiat will be 3%.

Crypto traders – These participants can use GOLD for hedging cryptocurrency volatility, as described in the white paper. GOLD can also be used to convert cryptocurrency into fiat. Standard investors – These investors may want to buy GOLD as cryptocurrency or as a type of security. E-commerce and self-employed individuals – GOLD can be used to pay for goods and services. Its low volatility asset and predictability make it an invaluable form of currency. Banks – GOLD cryptoassets gives banks new opportunities. There’s free liquidity and extra earning potential from trading gold into fiat and the reverse. Cryptocurrency has become a massive industry. Banks can profit from earning standard commissions, commissions on gold storage, and from using the GoldMint cash management system. At the same time, banks that invest in GOLD reinforce GOLD’s reputation, which increases their profit. Banks also earn commission from participating in the GoldMint partner program. Today the cryptocurrency overall circulation has achieved more than $700 billion a year and the commissions for deposit and withdrawal are more than 5%.  In case the bank sets lower commissions for GOLD buy/sell for a client, most transactions (cryprocurrency deposit and withdrawal) will switch from underground exchanges to the banks. At the same time the integration with GOLD only is necessary, while all the other cryptocurrencies can be purchased on a cryptoexchange directly. Banks also have revenues from cash management and commission charging for gold storing owned by GoldMint company. Still one more source of income for banks is the revenue from the partner program which includes adding GOLD digital asset to the product line of the bank’s department of Wealth Management.

It has inspired wars, provided wealth, shaped the course of human history. The rich used it for jewelry, dishware, and ornamentals. Way back in ancient times, these rich people used it to replace missing teeth.  The earliest traces of gold were tracked to 40,000 BC in ancient caves, although it was the ancient Egyptians who were the first to promote gold — using it to develop everything from jewelry to the capstones of the Great Pyramids to King Tut’s funeral mask. They also charted maps to mines. in 564 BC, *Lydia, followed by ancient Greece and Rome launched gold and its alloys as currency. The Romans introduced hydraulic mining. In the 14th century, King Ferdinand of Spain robbed the Inca and Aztec of more than 150,000 kilograms of gold for his own reserves.  Two centuries later, the British launched the first bank. People deposited their money with goldsmiths for safety. The goldsmiths issued a note promising to pay the bearer a certain sum on demand. In time, people exchanged these notes instead of coins, because it was easier and safer. Goldsmiths lent the money deposited with them in return for a high rate of interest.  Britain, too, was the first country to create a gold standard, namely a fixed currency value for gold based on its weight. In due time, other countries followed, with the United States pegging its dollar to gold in 1792. Gold and silver became America’s legal currency, with gold growing 15 times more popular than silver, until the Civil War.  Gold rushes further popularized gold. In 1695 and 1719, gold was discovered in Brazil. In the 1900s, gold was found in different parts of America, including San Francisco, Colorado, and South Dakota. The fever spread to Australia, North Africa and Canada. In each case, new habitations sprung up where none (or few) existed; California’s Gold Rush led to it becoming a state two years later.  Unfortunately, the two World Wars hampered gold production, shut mines and impoverished countries. Since America emerged, in 1944, as the richest country, the allied leaders established the U.S. dollar as the global currency, and created the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in what became known as the Bretton Woods System. The USD dollar was pegged at $35 per ounce of gold. In 1973, an impoverished United States under President Nixon unhooked the value of dollar from gold. Without price controls, the cost of gold shot up in the free market.  Today, gold remains an important investment, with gold prices hovering around $1,200 and $1,400 an ounce since 2011. Gold is used in coins, jewelry, medals, and other tokens. It is also used in electronic devices including computers, cell phones, and televisions, as well as in aerospace mechanical and medicine.     _______________________________________________________________  Here’s Why People Love Gold… _______________________________________________________________  Even though the gold standard has disappeared, the value of gold grows with the years. This is for several reasons. First, most investors recognize that fiat (or the plain old U.S. dollar) has long lost its value and, being backed by nothing, is merely a flip of paper. Gold has inconceivably more value. Second, gold hedges inflation, since gold prices rise when the cost of living decreases. For the same reason, gold protects you against deflation, or starvation, since while the rest of the country suffers from minimal wages, the price of gold soars. Other currencies may lose their value, but gold survives and prospers. Then there’s the fact that certain gold-consuming countries, where gold is a part of their cultures, are emerging market economies. The Indian wedding season in October, for instance, tends to see the highest global demand for gold, while in China, where its locals traditionally hoard gold bars and coins, demand for gold is steady. Gold is great for portfolio diversification, since the mineral either thrives or soars while another stock or financial instrument does the reverse. So, for instance, the 1970s was great for gold but terrible for stocks, while the 1980s and 1990s were great for stocks, but awful for gold. Successful investors diversify their portfolios, preferably include one or more investments with reciprocal negative correlations, to hedge for all conditions. Finally, gold production has declined since 2000s. In fact, the annual gold-mining output fell from 2,573 metric tons in 2000 to 2,444 metric tons in 2007. It takes five to ten years to dig a mine. When there’s less gold, the price for your piece of gold escalates. For each of these reasons, gold investment is one heck of a deal.     _______________________________________________________________  Exchange Traded Funds _______________________________________________________________  An ETF, or an exchange-traded fund, is a pool of securities that trades on a stock exchange. Unlike mutual funds, that are actively managed, ETFs are passively managed, meaning they track a stock or bond index, and that helps to keep their costs low.  These types of investments have been around since 1993, but they started being used significantly about a decade later, when investors discovered that ETFs offer low-cost diversification, trading and arbitrage options, although they have their disadvantages, too. If you are considering an ETF for your portfolio, here are the main pros and cons:  Advantages:  • ETF prices are updated throughout the day, while mutual funds are priced once a day after the markets close. This means, ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the day and can be bought on margin, sold short, or traded using stop orders and limit orders.  • Accountability. Most mutual funds publish details of their stocks or companies (known as “constituents”) on an infrequent basis and are not known for their transparency. ETFs, on the other hand, publish the list of assets in the fund on a daily basis.  • An ETF’s annual expenses and trading costs are usually lower than non-index mutual funds. • ETFs are a “tax friendly” investment, in that capital gains taxes are generally lower for ETFs than for traditional mutual funds • ETFs usually allow you to diversify your portfolio into other sectors of the market, like gold. Disadvantages: • ETFs may not be cost effective if you are buying them through small, regular contributions because of the commissions associated with purchasing ETFs. ETFs are typically sold through a brokerage, and in most cases investors must pay commissions to buy shares. Many mutual funds are commission-free.  • From a timing perspective, selling an ETF when you want to or need to may be difficult if the ETF is an unpopular security which makes it risky, or if the market is experiencing high volatility.  • Some ETFs are more expensive and riskier than mutual funds. A recent Morningstar study comparing the average expense ratios of index-based ETFs and comparable mutual funds found that ETFs were only cheaper than their mutual fund counterparts in a few categories.  While many of the first ETFs simply tracked the major indexes, investors can now choose from a mind-boggling array of products. (To date, there are more than 1,600 U.S.-listed ETFs, according to MorningStar). Advisors recommend investors to look under the hood, as they should do with any type of investment product.    _______________________________________________________________  Bullion on the Blockchain? _______________________________________________________________  Why not? The possibilities are endless. The blockchain gives gold investors fungibility, verified reserves, speed and unlimited storage, making gold investments and trading more transparent. The whole process becomes more efficient, faster, and far cheaper to store and to trade.  There are various blockchain technologies that, backed by real gold, have recently sprung up digitizing gold.  Of these, Digix may be the best-known. According to its website description:  “Digix tokenizes gold on Ethereum. We leverage the Distributed Ledger for its immutability, transparency and auditability, by applying it to precious physical assets. Digix has created a range of technologies including The Proof of Asset Protocol (POA) and Digix Gold Tokens (DGX) on Ethereum.”  Digix uses Ethereum and IPFS to record the amount of its gold reserves and ownership on its distributed ledger. It has its own auditors and helps gold investors purchase certified bullion from London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) refineries.  The thing is that Digix has two tokens: Digix Gold and Digix DAO. Digix DAO is popular largely because of intensive marketing, while Digix Gold is barely used. Second, our own company, GoldMint LLC. realizes that to help gold investors it needs to do far more. For that reason, GoldMint goes beyond tokenizing gold and also helps you with P2P lending and different investment scenarios. GoldMint, subsequently, has a better chance of attracting laypeople to its platform than do competitors, like Digix.  _______________________________________________________________  The advantages of GOLD tokens _______________________________________________________________  In early 2017, GoldMint PTE LTD developed the idea of a blockchain-based gold platform, with a token called GOLD. GOLD is an Exchange Traded Commodity (“ETC”) that can be created and redeemed on demand (by market makers). It trades on the ASX just like an equity, is settled and held in ordinary brokerage accounts, and its pricing and tracking operates similarly to an ETF. No new securities can be issued until the bullion is delivered to the custodian’s vault. Its value is fixed to the current price of gold set on the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA).  Here are GoldMint’s other advantages:  * Transparency — All transactions and audit figures are stored on the blockchain.  * Speed — GoldMint has its own blockchain, called Graphene, so GOLD transactions are faster than transactions done on Bitcoin or Ethereum. Of course, since GOLD is a cryptocurrency, it is far faster than any inter-bank transfer.  * Security — The blockchain protocol is secure.  * Universality — Since gold has global value, people all over the world will come to appreciate GOLD.  * Stability — GOLD is a stable token. Its worth correlates with the price of one ounce of gold at the LBMA exchange.  * Credibility — Gold is a well-known asset accepted for payment in most countries.     _______________________________________________________________  Conclusion _______________________________________________________________  GoldMint’s GOLD cryptoasset is designed to offer investors a simple, cost-efficient and secure way to store, trade and invest gold by providing a return equivalent to the movements in the gold spot price, with competitive GoldMint commission for borrowers, to boot. In short, GoldMint’s blockchain gives you a more liquid and verifiable market for physical gold, makes gold more useful as collateral, and even enhances it as a means of exchange. The more useful the commodity, the greater its value.  Gold has influenced mankind from time immemorial. Digitizing it into GOLD gives you endless possibilities.",False

That will happen because of these 3 important GOLD pros against bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies:  - low volatility due to gold-tied price and 100% guaranteed tokens buyback. - lower transactions fees (0,3%) operating with GOLD tokens. - 50000 transactions per second against Bitcoin's 2 per second.  4) design our unique custody bots for a realtime cryptocurrencies and fiat loaning for physical gold holders in all over the world pawnshops.  5) make an instrument for classic investors GOLD holders bringing 6-10% annually by depositing their GOLD tokens to GOLDMINT trust management.  6) bring a new tool for cryptotraders to hedge their risks in cryptotrading  7) save energy from usual PoW mining wasting by using PoS algorithm on our blockchain.

After 5 years, we plan that Custody Bot will be installed in each shopping mall and getting loans to card will go on bail. It will be a new economy - the economy of trust. In the future, we plan to equip the Custody Bot with a section that will sell gold. This way, if you have cash you receive gold. No cash -you can sale or lay gold .   At first, Custody Bot will only be installed in pawnshops. Regular people won’t use it. Later, when the quality of its work will increase, we are planning to install Custody Bot in malls. It’s as safe as installing a ATM machine. Everything will be insured.  With regards, team GOLDMINT",False

The Nothing-at-Stake issue is the event of a fork (the “fork” can be a malicious attempt to rewrite the history and do a double spend) the optimal strategy for any validator is to validate every chain, so that the validator gets their reward no matter which fork wins. This means that consensus algorithm doesn’t work as intended.  The attacker may be able to send a transaction to an exchange for some digital commodity (usually another cryptocurrency), receive the commodity and then start a fork of the blockchain from one block behind the transaction and send the money to themselves instead.  Even with 1% of the total stake the attacker’s fork would win because everyone else is mining on both.  There is no single PoS algorithm that can suit everyone. Because of that GoldMint has chosen the path of building its own highly specialized blockchain instead of building an all-purpose solution. Currently our engineers are designing the blockchain while keeping Nothing-at-stake problem in mind.  There are different approaches to handle the matter. Ethereum Casper uses so called “slashing conditions”: in case the validator is cheating and the conditions are met, he loses his deposit. Graphene doesn’t use deposits, but the cheating witness (validator) can be excluded from the list of active witnesses.  Please also notice that “statistical simulations have shown that simultaneous forging on several chains is possible, even profitable. But Proof-of-Stake advocates believe most described attack scenarios are impossible or so unpredictable that they are only theoretical” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake).",False

The price of a share in an ETF will fluctuate throughout the trading day based on market conditions.  GOLD is a crypto-asset which functions as an ETF, and is backed by the physical commodity gold. The price of GOLD issued by Goldmint corresponds to the current price of gold as set on the LBMA (http://www.lbma.org.uk) exchange (at the time of sale).  _______________________________________________________________  Why is GOLD more beneficial for assets holding? _______________________________________________________________  Physical gold is a challenging and expensive asset to move. It is difficult to secure and cumbersome to transport. Trading gold for other assets requires an assay/appraisal process that is time consuming. GOLD has none of the restrictions of physical gold, yet has the same underlying value. GOLD does not have the same trading risk as gold. It serves as a type of futures contract in that there is a legal agreement to buy or sell gold at a predetermined price at a specific future time.  _______________________________________________________________  Transparency _______________________________________________________________  As a crypto-asset, Goldmint discloses the company’s gold reserves and ability to buy back GOLD at its current trading price. Goldmint also transmits information about the number of ounces of physical gold or ETF’s owned by the company. These statements are received from the depository (either electronic or printed) and transmitted to the decentralized blockchain ledger allowing the information to be open and transparent to all members.  _______________________________________________________________  Speed _______________________________________________________________  Because GOLD is not encumbered by the barriers of physical gold, members can trade gold quickly and easily. The blockchain makes the process faster, allowing easier trading across borders and shielding investments from loss. GOLD crypto-assets can be converted into fiat money utilizing Goldmint. This eliminates the problem of trading physical gold because the underlying asset (gold) has been evaluated and appraised. The physical gold does not have to be transferred. GOLD cyptoassets are traded in place of the commodity of physical gold. This is intrinsically faster than trading gold or an ETF on a traditional exchange.  _______________________________________________________________  How can ETF back GOLD digital assets? _______________________________________________________________  Goldmint would issue to a potential investor GOLD in exchange for gold backed ETF’s. The underlying asset is gold which backs the ETF, making GOLD the liability of Goldmint. This aids the investor in that the investor receives a rate of return on their GOLD crypto-currency. Additionally, the investor is protected from price fluctuations in gold.  _______________________________________________________________  The bottom line _______________________________________________________________  GOLD provides an asset which is easily and quickly traded with a degree of transparency that cannot be equaled by ETF’s or physical gold. It provides the investor an ROI independent of the performance of gold.",False

Times are changing fast, and there seems to be a near goldrush on some types of cryptocurrencies. ICOs are taking place all the time, almost daily, with, and the value of Bitcoin and Ether rocketing up. As we all know though, these currencies often also experience massive volatility in terms of their values too. The challenge moving forwards is to have a globally traded currency that is both secure, and yet also tied to something of real, intrinsic value. Numerous studies, by Pwc and others have demonstrated that gold remains a highly valuable resource and preferred choice for the storage of wealth.  ______________________________________________________________________________  An interesting new initiative by GoldMint ______________________________________________________________________________  GoldMint is an interesting new innovation, that brings together the historical security of the physical asset of gold, with the digital security and speed of transactions that new blockchain technologies can offer. Gold has been used to store wealth for millennia by humans. With the recent technological developments in cryptoassets, there are now exciting possibilities for gold and modern technology to provide innovative global trading business solutions. GOLD, a cryptoasset created by GoldMint, may just provide the perfect combination of new and old financial systems.  ______________________________________________________________________________  Faster, more secure international trading opportunities ______________________________________________________________________________  GOLD offers many exciting trade opportunities. At the recent WCO [World Customs Organisation] annual conference in Tbilisi, June 2017 there many examples of how blockchain based innovation can help to speed up global trade across international borders. ‘Single window’ is a term which raised a lot of excitement, this is the ability for all of the customers and border control details to be dealt with through one interface. It also offers the potential to have all the paperwork done and approved before the goods even reach the border checkpoint. This would then mean only the actual good themselves have to be inspected as everything else will have already been completed. New technologies such as GOLD, GoldMint’s cryptoasset offer exciting possibilities that will enable people and businesses to safely move things of value between different countries. This would help avoid the traditional risks and delays that occur when it comes to crossing international borders.  ______________________________________________________________________________  The benefits of gold, combined with the digital security of a cryptoasset ______________________________________________________________________________  Traditionally gold has always been a great way to store wealth, but it was also very cumbersome and unwieldy when you then wanted to extract some of the value from your wealth. As well as risky when transporting, you also needed to store it securely. With GOLD, the gold backed crypto asset, we may be reaching the point where it’s value is still secure but it can also be used more quickly for investments and trading. Historically banks and currency traders have charged high fees for those wanting to move their money beyond national borders. With the emergence of secure blockchain platforms it is now possible to greatly reduce these costs. It is now much much easier for people and companies to do business from both inside and outside of the European Union to Russia, the US, China, and the rest of the world. Cryptoasset based trading with digitally tradeable, but gold backed investments offers the ability to perform faster, more convenient, efficient and cheaper transactions.  ______________________________________________________________________________  The GoldMint team’s banking and entrepreneurial experience ______________________________________________________________________________   With any new venture the next question to ask is always, who are behind the initiative, and what experience and pedigree do they have. Fortunately for this venture the chances of success look promising due to the deep level of knowledge and entrepreneurial knowhow they have assembled. GoldMint was established in 2016 by the founders of the LOT-ZOLOTO company. This company buys unwanted gold securities from pawnshops, processes them and then supplies them to jewelers. In the first six months of 2017, turnover of LOT-ZOLOTO amounted to 50.2 million USD. The company is a marketplace leader and has an extensive background in gold trading. The GoldMint team, led by Dmitry Pluschevsky, CEO of GoldMint and Konstantin Romanov, co-founder, have a strong background in innovation and developing previous successful projects over the last two decades. Pluschevsky has a good range of entrepreneurial experience across marketing, app development, venture fund investment, and then as a startup mentor at the innovative Skolkovo institution. His experience is complemented well by Konstantin Romanov’s twenty five years experience in the Russian banking sector, including Rosbank among others. For this project they have already put together a strong team of developers and business experts, supported by an even more impressive group of advisors with a healthy range of diverse and useful business experience. It looks like it could be a good combination to help make GoldMint a success too.  ______________________________________________________________________________  Exciting possibilities for future trading opportunities ______________________________________________________________________________  We are at an exciting time with the recent developments in cryptocurrencies, backed by blockchain technologies to ensure secure, fast and effective means to perform business transactions globally in near to real time. We are at the threshold of a new period of opportunities and business developments in micro payments, financial trading and many other business use-cases that are still being identified. The GOLD option developed by GoldMint holds exciting possibilities for future transactions too, and may even replace other forms of investing and holding value, such as ETFs and other current options.",False

As the latest addition to the bandwagon, ICO makers, traders and investors are hugely anticipating upon cryptocurrencies that promise a splurging return and dominate all other forms of currencies in the world.  ______________________________________________________________________________  Dominate all other forms, really? ______________________________________________________________________________  The total cryptocurrency circulation has surpassed 700 USD with the BTC and ETH stamping impressive growth to their inherent value, compelling the enthusiastic investors to pool in more. However, high volatility makes the game way riskier! Blame it to the bad press, the unpredictable perceived store value or the unclear taxation policy; cryptocurrencies will continue to stay more vulnerable towards an overnight crash.  Post a few major achievements, cryptocurrencies fell way short of the respectable acceptance extend. Although plastic money reach has been promised, most websites don’t accept Bitcoins (being the most popular) and the ones that do, need an interim payment gateway which is clearly nowhere close to a smooth process.  As of July’17, cryptocurrencies crashed massively by 23%. Such intense volatility is discouraging enough to look beyond.  As an effective alternative, stable coins are steadily gaining support towards it syncing aptly with the digital currency trends.  ______________________________________________________________________________  Digital Gold will too acquire mass adoption — Wait for it! ______________________________________________________________________________  As the undisputed champ of investment, gold has a rich history of valuable evolution that the current swathe of cryptocurrencies may not experience ever. Stable coins backed by physical gold and ETF are therefore a universal and a convenient instrument for hedging the volatility risks. This alone can encourage the common investor believe more in the ICOs.  Gold has been the least volatile metal showing a steady increase in value when the fiat currency is dropping. In times of social uncertainty out political or economic crisis such as a war or a natural disaster, gold stays intact to its intrinsic value and is the ultimate dependable resource to channel transactions.  Governments across the world are amassing their gold storage assets. China reported a whopping 600 tons between 2009 and 2015. Experts have estimated that the value may go up to 10,000 tons in coming years. The legends hold it true for other economies like India, Russia and US.  Utilizing the most out of the digital swathe, the cost of transferring 1 Kilogram of Gold is equivalent to 1 gram.  ______________________________________________________________________________  Winning over the traditional investor ______________________________________________________________________________  GOLD driven digital currency is confidently foreseen to tap colossal progress and cover a larger market share. The much-needed conglomerate of the metal’s inherent value in real time and the portability of cryptocurrencies will have a staunch impact. Thus, the traditional investor community that was not so impressed by computing controlling their wealth can rely upon physical gold backing the game.  ______________________________________________________________________________  The actual asset backing ______________________________________________________________________________  Unlike the cryptocurrencies, digital GOLD is evaluated by actual gold bullion. Offering the same scale of investment security like certificates and other GOLD in physical forms, investors get utmost ownership with asset information digitally stored against GOLD units. This digital information is widely accessible in form of an account and supports across online transactions.  On the other hand, cryptocurrencies grow by the faith of an enthusiastic investor that the value will raise. There’s no actual asset in real-time backing it and risks are guaranteed!  ICOs have attested a promising return and continue to engage more investors. Minus a few gaps where they are still trying to catch up with the skeptical take on volatility, GOLD could help eliminate the cloud and sync perfectly with the ICOs. Unlatching the benefits of a less volatile asset could actualize mass adoption, sooner than expected!",False

GoldMint works on two types of tokens, GOLD and MNT. The GOLD cryptoasset is an investment instrument which is 100% backed by physical gold and/ or ETF. One GOLD token is the same as one ounce of gold on LBMA stock exchange. MNT — on the other hand — is GoldMint’s cryptocurrency, used to confirm your GOLD cryptoasset transactions. If you’re a GoldMint miner, your amount of MNTs also tell you how many assignments, or transaction blocks, you can accept.  _______________________________________________________________  How to trade GOLD for fiat or for cryptocurrency and get a P2P loan? _______________________________________________________________  You can buy GOLD for fiat or cryptocurrency on GoldMint’s cryptoexchange where you created your wallet. You need to have a public key to gain access to the wallet.  If you want to trade GOLD for fiat or crypto currency, you have one of two options. First, you can seek a GoldMint-guaranteed buyback or, second, you can request a loan. For either option, the process is as follows:  1. You’re directed to a special app that helps you transfer your GOLD as collateral to a certain GoldMint account.  2. GoldMint uses the current price of gold set on the LBMA Gold Price to fix the rate of your loan.  3. GoldMint requires you to undergo its KYC process. You will also need to consent to GoldMint loan terms to receive the loan. At the same time, you’re given various options for repaying the loan amount as well as for how you choose to repay it.  4. If you default on repayment, your GOLD cryptoassets are transferred to GoldMint.  _______________________________________________________________  How to trade GOLD for gold? _______________________________________________________________  GoldMint also helps you convert gold into GOLD tokens and reconvert these GOLD tokens into gold to facilitate border crossings. Carrying gold from one country to another can be a hassle and often results in expense and aggravation. By converting your gold into GOLD, you not only avoid this hassle, but also retrieve 100% of the value of your gold at journey’s end.  With this process, too, you’ll need to go through GoldMint’s KYC procedure.  In both cases, the amount of GOLD you receive, depends on the following:   * The confirmation of the transaction.   * The authenticity and value of your gold after it has been weighed, evaluated and registered by a Custody Bot inspection.  Custody Bot is GoldMint’s decentralized storage unit, which is programmed to computationally identify and store gold jewelry, small ingots (up to 100 grams) and coins. In this way, it acts as a Dapp (i.e. decentralized application that is programmed to run flawlessly, rapidly and effectively without needing anyone to control it). This Custody Bott inspects the value of incoming gold using three cutting-edge technologies: spectral analysis, usual and hydrostatic weighing .  _______________________________________________________________  In Short _______________________________________________________________   * People who want to trade GOLD for fiat or cryptocurrency need to undergo GoldMint’s KYC procedure.   * Resale of GOLD occurs on stock exchanges or as direct transaction between parties.   * GOLD and MNT cryptoassets and cryptocurrencies can be stored long-term in a special and secure storage bot.   * GOLD emission depends on how much GOLD is needed but never exceeds the total cost of gold in GoldMint’s reserves.",False

My name is Anton. I worked as a C++ programmer for about 10 years, then moved to the cryptoworld. I have designed and implemented several DApps.  Now I am a part of the GoldMint team as the Lead Blockchain Developer and I am proud of that. I enjoy working together with other developers from our team. It’s an awesome experience and I am sure we will deliver a great product that will solve real world problems for our customers.  You can read more about the GoldMint project in our whitepaper here.  _______________________________________________________________  What is blockchain? _______________________________________________________________  Blockchain is a technology which supports a decentralized distributed ledger DB whose main purpose is to protect its users against the situation that is commonly referred to as “double-spend.” An example would be when an individual spends a cryptocurrency on an item (a Ferrari) and immediately spends the same coins on another item.  Because blockchain is decentralized (almost like BitTorrent). This means that different users can will have different versions of reality. For example, 90% of the users will indicate you have purchased the car, but the remaining 10% will claim you have not. Because of the of the distributed nature of the block chain, these two groups will have different histories of the transactions. How does blockchain solve this problem and prevent cheating? This is accomplished through the use of a Consensus Algorithm. Consensus will eventually determine which version is correct and therefore, which history fork to choose. The above is a simplified description of consensus.  Bitcoin uses Proof-of-Work (PoW) Consensus Algorithm. The user who consumes more electricity is the one that wins. If you want to revert some transaction and do a double spend you should buy a very powerful miner and burn a lot of electricity. Then you can “go back in time” and change the blockchain.  It seems that in real life it is very energy consuming to go back in time too. Time is ticking and the history is made and there is no easy means to go back. Just like in blockchain.  There is an alternative to PoW algorithm that is called Proof-of-Stake (PoS). The “miner” in PoS is usually called a validator. In it’s simplest form, PoS is where your stake of cryptocurrency matters, but not your mining power. So even if you can easily rebuild the whole blockchain from scratch in a second it is just not economically feasible to do this even if you own large stake of cryptocurrency.  _______________________________________________________________  How should the GoldMint blockchain work? _______________________________________________________________  We wish to build a custom-tailored PoS blockchain that works only with 2 tokens — GOLD token and MNT token. When someone transfers GOLD token his transaction is added to the current block. The GoldMint validator automatically gets a fraction of his transaction as a reward for validating this block.  The Block validator will use MNT token as a stake to validate blocks. The more MNT tokens the validator has, the more GOLD fees he collects.  Very simplified picture of this process:    Basic GoldMint blockchain properties:  1. Openness Anybody should be able to become a validator. Just download GoldMint software from the official repository and start it.  2. PoS Consensus Algorithm GoldMint should use PoS as it is more natural for GoldMint infrastructure than PoW. Block validator should use MNT token as a stake to validate blocks.  3. The validator should receive GOLD token as rewards The rewards should be paid as soon as possible (at time of block validation).  4. Tokens No MNT or GOLD token emission occurs during block validation. Addition of other tokens on top of our blockchain is possible only by forking the code.  5. Smart contracts There will be no custom-minted token or smart contract capabilities in the first version.  Please note that this is our current vision of what we are building and it will (of course) evolve!  We don't publish our full-size article saving forum space and making it more convenient for our readers. Here is the link.",False

In the Goldmint platform, a robotic storage unit Custody Bot is used to automatically store, assess, and deliver physical gold in its various forms, including jewelry, granules, and coins. In this short article, we shall explain what Custody Bot is, how it works, its configurations, and key features.  _______________________________________________________________  What Custody Bot is _______________________________________________________________  Custody Bot is a robotic storage unit, which looks like a coffee vending machine with deposit boxes inside. It is primarily used to verify gold assets in banks, financial institutions, and individual homes. At Goldmint, it is used to store, assess, evaluate, and delivery the physical gold.  Its role in ensuring the authenticity and value of the physical gold is very important to give a peace of mind to GOLD crypto assets’ owners. Only with verified gold the clients can use their GOLD assets for trading, investment, or as credit collateral.  _______________________________________________________________  Configurations and Key Features _______________________________________________________________  Custody Bot is a large cabinet made of a fireproof material with the following dimensions: 1.5 meters height, 0.65 meters depth, and 0.8 meters width. On the front part is an output tray, which is similar to the tray for inserting CDs in the CD-ROM player. The size of the tray is 15 centimeters x 20 centimeters. Next to the tray is a small touch screen and a numeric keypad, which is used to type in codes.  It comes with automatic gold retrieving mechanism. It also has a spectrometer and scales to analyze and weigh physical gold. Just like bank safety boxes, up to 40 individual boxes stacked together. Linux is the computer operating system used to automate the Custody Bot. Moreover, the platform is linked to public blockchain.  _______________________________________________________________  How It Works _______________________________________________________________  Manual inspection by a gold specialist is usually conducted before evaluation by the Custody Bot. Next, the physical gold is placed on the tray of the Bot, where the analysis is performed. After the evaluation is completed, the product is placed in one of the deposit boxes and the information is transmitted along with a smart contract containing its identification and analysis results.  During the evaluation process, the physical gold is measured with the hydrostatic scales. Next, the X-Ray fluorescence spectrometer is used to induce the atoms of the item being analyzed. The second fluorescence radiation is dispensed with an analyzer crystal, which will be detected by a detector.  Both the analyzer crystal and the detector are moved by goniometer, which is computer-controlled. The goniometer is an instrument that measures angles between the faces of crystals. Each position of the goniometer corresponds to a certain length of secondary radiation waves, thus when an angle is shifted, it receives different spectral lines that are reflected by the crystal.  The spectral lines resulted indicate the quantitative content of a substance, which is, in this case, is the physical gold. In the confirmation stage, the concentration is calculated by comparison with standard samples. The standard samples do not need to be present physically.  Custody Bot is therefore a unique brand new technology which helps to automate many processes within Goldmint platform and simplifies operations with GOLD on the whole.",False

Here are the scenarios:  _______________________________________________________________  1. Transferring GOLD _______________________________________________________________  People who transfer gold from one region to another can hedge their risks by investing in the GOLD cryptoasset. The GOLD price aligns with LBMA physical gold price fluctuations that has gentler volatility in contrast to crypto currencies, like BTC or ETH, with their high volatility (or, for that matter, fiat currencies with their high cross-border exchange rate). This makes GOLD payments and transfers a more secure, cheaper and faster way to transfer gold from one region to another.  Further, gold is well-known and valued all over the world so you don’t have to teach clients about this new “currency” and its exchange rate.  Example:  Mehul just entered into a contract to sell 10,000 troy ounces of gold, to be delivered in three months’ time. The sale price is agreed by both parties to be based on the market price of gold on the day of selling. The buyer commonly pay with bitcoin. Bitcoin, however, is famed for its surges in volatility, with unpredictable dips and highs that can be deep. Mehul can now ask his buyer to swap bitcoin with GOLD. GOLD hews closer to the gentler LBMA physical gold price and hedges Mehul’s risks.  _______________________________________________________________  2. ICOs & their investors _______________________________________________________________  ICOs often have to adjust their caps to meet constant crypto currency volatility. ICOs can lock in their cap at an attractive rate by asking their investors to provide funds in GOLD. These investors use GOLD to lock in their commodities at an attractive LBMA or spot price so that neither ICO nor investors lose out if gold price dips.  Example:  Goldmint plans to launch early fall. On the first day of the launch, one BTC is worth, say, 2,742 USD. On the last day, BTC value has dropped to, say, 2,642 USD. On the first day, Joe invests in Goldmint for the value of 1 BTC. Unfortunately, when Goldmint starts, Joe’s investment value would have dropped by 100 USD. Joe could use GOLD to convert gold coins (or some other gold commodity) into this GOLD cryptoasset and use its token to offset future loss.  _______________________________________________________________  3. Crypto traders can hedge volatility risks without leaving exchanges _______________________________________________________________  GOLD token will be available for purchase on most exchanges. This means that traders, after a busy day of trading, can gain peace of mind by simply converting their commodities to GOLD within the same day and the same exchange, without visiting another platform or paying extra commissions for money withdrawal.  Example:  Maria is a jeweler who needs 100 ounces of gold to make four hundred gold rings. The process takes her two weeks, and in that time period she may not want to take the price risk. So she sells one gold contract (100 ounces) at the same time as she buys the physical gold for production. This trade has been done on Bitfinex, which is a full-featured spot trading platform for the major cryptocurrencies. Right away, Maria wants to transfer her physical gold into GOLD to hedge her risks. She will be able to find that GOLD crypto-token on Bitfinex, too.  _______________________________________________________________  In short _______________________________________________________________  Gold producers can hedge against falling gold price by investing in GOLD cryptoassets. The cryptocurrency locks in their gold in a present selling price for an ongoing production of gold that is only ready for sale sometime in the future. This option can be extended to also help ICOs and crypto traders hedge their risks.",False

Now that the digital gold has arrived, keeping gold has never been this convenient. Goldmint is a platform for digital gold investors, where GOLD crypto-assets (GOLD tokens) can be used for lending and pawning transactions. Thus, this platform provides a safe storage space for these purposes.  _______________________________________________________________  Trust Management _______________________________________________________________  When an investor owns GOLD crypto-assets, which are backed by physical gold, and stores them at Goldmint, an account is created. It is like a bank account, but stores GOLD tokens instead of physical gold, crypto-currency, or fiat currency. The user can delegate Goldmint company the right to manage GOLD at the account. Hence it is called “trust management.”  With the similar functionality of a bank account, the Goldmint trust account also pays out interest or “investment income” to investors. The interest rate or “investment income rate” (X% annually) is based on market conditions.  Here is how it works: Goldmint serves as a lender and charges interest (Y% annually) to borrowers. At the end of the year, the investor receives profit based on this calculation: Y% — X% = profit.  _______________________________________________________________  Lending _______________________________________________________________  In the event of obtaining a credit with fiat or crypto-currency, GOLD tokens will be used as collateral. An agreement of the loan amount and its costs will be agreed before the transfer of the fund. The borrower, who owns GOLD tokens, must agree with the terms of the loan.  The fund can be withdrawn and used via a bank account or a specially emitted VISA/Mastercard card. Interest will accrue when the credit is used and hasn’t been paid back after the grace period. It works like a regular credit card, but it is a secured credit by digital gold.  The loan can be repaid in several ways regarding the amount and the method of repayment. In the case of untimely loan repayment, the GOLD tokens will be transferred to Goldmint and become Goldmint’s property.  _______________________________________________________________  Pawning _______________________________________________________________  The GOLD tokens received from the investor are converted into a currency and W% pf the amount (50 <W <96, for example, 80) will be transferred to a pawnshop to be issued after T months under Y% per annum (Y >X >0). After the conversion took place, no more than 4% [(100-W)%] will be used to purchase Q amount of CALL options that will expire in T months and [(X/12)*T*Q] mini gold futures on the stock exchange. Therefore, Goldmint provides a hedge against the increased prices of physical gold and guarantees 100% return of investments through T months with a specific interest rate. This gives Goldmint with 1.1 ounce position of gold.  Two possible scenarios from the pawning functionality of Goldmint:  1. The pawnshop provides a full return in Y%. Goldmint exchanges fiat currency into GOLD tokens and pay of the loan to the investor with X% interest.  2. In the case that the pawnshop does not pay the loan back, Goldmint will take over the ownership of the content of Custody Bot.  In the event that Goldmint takes over the ownership of the content of Custody Bot, the physical gold will be transformed into ingots for storage. Next, Goldmint would issue an equal amount of GOLD tokens to be returned to the trust with agreed upon interest and within the timeframe via the linked smart contract.  Custody Bot is an automatic robotic storage unit used to automatically store, assess, and deliver the physical gold, which is like to replace conventional pawning mechanism. It provides extra security as it would automatically evaluate the authenticity and value of the physical gold with hydrostatic scales, X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, analyzer crystal, and goniometer.  In various pawning scenarios, Custody Bot provides a peace of mind to investors. Goldmint uses Custody Bot with these features in mind.",False
