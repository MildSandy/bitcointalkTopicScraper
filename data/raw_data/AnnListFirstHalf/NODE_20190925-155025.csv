Thanks to Node technology, you could easily increase the duration of the trip on the electric car, which would allow you to comfortably cover long distances and not thinking about the battery charge.  The scooter is capable of speeding up to 25 kilometers per hour, independently prompting the road and sharing with the owner various useful information. In addition, the scooter can report on the situation on the road and predict the weather - this is the display located on the steering wheel. Also, on the display of the electric key, you can duplicate the smartphone screen and easily track calls, incoming messages and other information via Bluetooth, this will allow you to stay in touch and keep abreast of all events.

The fact that the power is distributed proportionally and reduced if you charge simultaneously many devices could be a limitation for Eon. Eon consumes about 1W from the network in standby mode. The maximum power it can transmit is150W. When any electrical devices equipped with Node receivers are placed in the area of action, the power consumption from the network begins to increase. The closer the device is to Eon the higher the transmission ratio, at the most approximate distance it is about 95% and linearly decreases with increasing distance.  For example: If we bring to Eon a discharged phone with maximum power consumption (equal to) 5W (standard USB 5V / 1A) then Eon starts charging it, and once the phone is charged its adapter (inside the phone) breaks the circuit, the phone stops charging and Eon enters standby mode.  The same with several devices, but you will)need to combine them, sum up the power in case the devices are at the same distance, and if on different there will be some average value depending on each (power-to-distance ratio).  (All this Pts will be difficult to perceive, so you need to simplify the course, but do so that there is no ambiguous interpretation, like what we transmit more than we consume. And it's important not to confuse the power consumption of Eon, Eon transmission power and the power consumption of the charged devices.)  The power consumption of Eon will always be less than the transmitted power by 5-10%. The power transmitted by Eon depends on the total power consumption of the charged devices and the distance to them. However, the transmitted power is distributed evenly among the devices depending on the amount of power consumed, for example, if we place a device that consumes 150W in the area of action with another device that consumes 10W, then the power is distributed so (without taking into account the distance) 140W for the first and 10W for the second. If we add a third device with power consumption equaal to100W in that area, the energy will be redistributed as a percentage of each device at the rate of 150W at all: the first 58% - 87W, the second 4% - 6W, the third 38% - 57W.  If you put 10 devices each consuming 15W, they will all be charged by the equal amount - 15W (150W in total) and Eo will consume 157.5W from the outlet  However, we are constantly working on the improvement of our current devices and a better development of new ones, so we try to reduce all possible limitations to make our devices as efficient and convenient as possible.",False

First of all we are a technological start-up, and the Node technology can be used in a wide range of business segments, including automotive, drones, healthcare, etc. Our devices (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTPgNitnQII) are just  an example of how technology can be implemented in consumer electronics segment and proof efficiency.  We are also conducting a research on other industries, to produce the future devices that can be suitable and efficient in the following sectors:                                                                               1. Automotive The solution from Node allows faster and more convenient charging of electric vehicles. It is enough to place the receiving device under asphalt, for example, parking and on the inside surface of the body; the vehicle will be ready for charging. The body itself can act as a receiver. This method is safe, a ordable and environmentally friendly, and also as simple and fast as refueling a gasoline car on a regular gas station.  2. Drones Drones and quadcopters can be continuously recharged from wireless charging stations on the route. No need to connect the drone now to the connector or have a special bar for charging. There is an opportunity to create a distributed delivery network with the help of drones, for example, by placing the charging stations on houses.  3. Healthcare Starting with the maintenance of electronics for care and monitoring of health, ending with the supply of implanted devices, sensors and measuring devices. Implanted microsensors that run on batteries do not require a connection and can be easily recharged by simply placing them to the charging transmitter through the body.  That types of solutions are under development and would be presented later in 2018 For more detailed information regarding the use of our technology, please check our website (nodepower.eu) or read our WhitePaper",False

And power is achieved by joining of different frequencies waves directly in the receiver.  This type of wave constitutes only 20% of the energy transmitted in the form of electromagnetic radiation, the rest of the energy is formed due to the interference of waves in space and in the receiver.  Due to the fact that there is no strong electromagnetic interaction with the surrounding space, a large transmission distance and passage through the materials are achieved, since there is no interaction, then there are no losses due to absorption and there is no influence on matter (humanbeings in particular)  We will definitely receive the appropriate certificates during licensing and certification process according to our roadmap.

Yes, you are correct!  In terms of the differences, the key difference is in the imposition of several electromagnetic waves in the form of impulses of different duration and frequency to each other. By creating the conditions under which the atoms of matter pass into an excited state can transfer energy through absolutely any media. The higher the density of the medium, the higher the energy transfer coeffcient. The transformation of energy occurs by creating conditions under which free (excited) electrons matter (semiconductor, metal) acquire an additional impulse and begin to move under the action of an electric field. Therefore, the actual benefit from imposing this method is reducing energy loss, increasing range of power transmission and expanding horizons regarding the question what can be charged (material).  Overall, the following competitive advantages of the Node technology can be highlighted:  - Variety of energy solutions from milliwatts to megawatts - Ability to transmit energy to long distances - Ability to transfer energy through any material and environment - Three times less weight and compactness - Possibility of charging devices production for any shape, including flexible ones - Ability to charge devices without a fixed position - Attractive price of products makes them affordable - Absolute protection against dust and moisture - Energy transfer while the receiver is moving",False

Thank you very much for your opinion!  Basically, Node was created with the goal of developing and implementing commercial use of a new technology of wireless energy transmission, which was developed and tested several years ago by a team of physicists from Russia.  Prior to this, from October 2012 until May 2016, a number of studies were conducted in the field of semiconductor materials, ceramic materials and their interaction with electromagnetic high-frequency impulse fields by team members. Gradually, various experimental proofs of the phenomenon of energy transmission through the magnetic moments of the atoms of matter were obtained, and the conditions were defined under which such a transmission takes place. At the same time, a decision to commercialize this technology was made.  From May 2016 until March 2017, the project team created possible technological solutions for commercial use, schemes were developed, and components were selected. A month later, a successful final testing of several prototypes of devices from 1W to 150W was carried out. In the period from May until July 2017, a design concept was developed, materials and technologies were selected for the production line of consumer products. In May 2017, the legal registration of the company was carried out, a settlement account was opened, the domain name and hosting were purchased, and an active search for funding sources was initiated.",False

Yes, our scope does not end on just making charging devices. The process of creating products using technologies originating Node, has passed the stage from experimental studies to the creation and successful final testing of prototype devices. Right now, we offer the market 2 products: Alpha (Wireless charging Pad) and Eon (Wireless Charging Pod). We are also planning to introduce Wireless power station, which will have more power and a longer distance of energy transmission.  However, solutions for the industry is the our strategic goal. They can be implemented in different areas: production, construction, agriculture, energy, security and many others. Now, the company conducts research in the following areas:  1. Automotive The solution from Node allows for faster and more convenient charging of electric vehicles. It’s enough to place the receiving device under asphalt, for example, parking and on the inside surface of the body; the vehicle will be ready for charging. The body itself can act as a receiver. This method is safe, affordable and environmentally friendly, and also as simple and fast as refueling a gasoline car on a regular gas station.  2. Drones wireless charging Wireless charging and power technology provide multiple advantages over traditional connectors and docking systems, not only for unmanned systems, but also for industrial robotics. Moving on the surface, or passing areas where there is a signal, the robot can be charged from our wireless device.  Drones and quadcopters can be continuously recharged from wireless charging stations on the route. No need to connect the drone now to the connector or have a special bar for charging. There is an opportunity to create a distributed delivery network with the help of drones, for example, by placing the charging stations on houses.  3. Healthcare Node is actively engaged in the research and development of new sensors for non-invasive determinations of the chemical composition of liquids and media. By using new methods of signal transmission through various media and collecting information on the change of these signals at different resonant frequencies, it’s possible to determine with sufficient accuracy the presence and quantity of chemical elements and compounds in a certain volume of the medium space.  Using special algorithms, it’s possible to determine deviations of environmental parameters from standard values and transmit this information. This allows for obtaining reliable and accurate data on the state of the environment in real time, remotely and with low power consumption. This is a demanded product, which is extremely necessary in the medical industry, for example: to create devices that determine the chemical composition of blood, and also designed to control blood sugar levels, etc. Therefore, Node's technological solutions are widely used in medicine.  There are no limits of what we can do with Nodes technology. Starting with the maintenance of electronics for care and monitoring of health, ending with the supply of implanted devices, sensors and measuring devices. Implanted microsensors that run on batteries do not require a connection and can be easily recharged by simply placing them to the charging transmitter through the body.  These types of solutions are under development and would be presented later in 2018.",False

Thank you very much for your comment!  Eon consumes about 1W from the network in standby mode. The maximum power it can transmit is150W. When any electrical devices equipped with Node receivers are placed in the area of action, the power consumption from the network begins to increase. The closer the device is to Eon the higher the transmission ratio, at the most approximate distance it is about 95% and linearly decreases with increasing distance.  For example: If we bring to Eon a discharged phone with maximum power consumption (equal to) 5W (standard USB 5V / 1A) then Eon starts charging it, and once the phone is charged its adapter (inside the phone) breaks the circuit, the phone stops charging and Eon enters standby mode.  The same with several devices, but you will)need to combine them, sum up the power in case the devices are at the same distance, and if on different there will be some average value depending on each (power-to-distance ratio).  (All this Pts will be difficult to perceive, so you need to simplify the course, but do so that there is no ambiguous interpretation, like what we transmit more than we consume. And it's important not to confuse the power consumption of Eon, Eon transmission power and the power consumption of the charged devices.)  The power consumption of Eon will always be less than the transmitted power by 5-10%. The power transmitted by Eon depends on the total power consumption of the charged devices and the distance to them. However, the transmitted power is distributed evenly among the devices depending on the amount of power consumed, for example, if we place a device that consumes 150W in the area of action with another device that consumes 10W, then the power is distributed so (without taking into account the distance) 140W for the first and 10W for the second. If we add a third device with power consumption equaal to100W in that area, the energy will be redistributed as a percentage of each device at the rate of 150W at all: the first 58% - 87W, the second 4% - 6W, the third 38% - 57W.  If you put 10 devices each consuming 15W, they will all be charged by the equal amount - 15W (150W in total) and Eo will consume 157.5W from the outlet",False

Eon consumes about 1W from the network in standby mode. The maximum power it can transmit is150W. When any electrical devices equipped with Node receivers are placed in the area of action, the power consumption from the network begins to increase. The closer the device is to Eon the higher the transmission ratio, at the most approximate distance it is about 95% and linearly decreases with increasing distance.  For example: If we bring to Eon a discharged phone with maximum power consumption (equal to) 5W (standard USB 5V / 1A) then Eon starts charging it, and once the phone is charged its adapter (inside the phone) breaks the circuit, the phone stops charging and Eon enters standby mode.  The same with several devices, but you will)need to combine them, sum up the power in case the devices are at the same distance, and if on different there will be some average value depending on each (power-to-distance ratio).  (All this Pts will be difficult to perceive, so you need to simplify the course, but do so that there is no ambiguous interpretation, like what we transmit more than we consume. And it's important not to confuse the power consumption of Eon, Eon transmission power and the power consumption of the charged devices.)  The power consumption of Eon will always be less than the transmitted power by 5-10%. The power transmitted by Eon depends on the total power consumption of the charged devices and the distance to them. However, the transmitted power is distributed evenly among the devices depending on the amount of power consumed, for example, if we place a device that consumes 150W in the area of action with another device that consumes 10W, then the power is distributed so (without taking into account the distance) 140W for the first and 10W for the second. If we add a third device with power consumption equaal to100W in that area, the energy will be redistributed as a percentage of each device at the rate of 150W at all: the first 58% - 87W, the second 4% - 6W, the third 38% - 57W.  If you put 10 devices each consuming 15W, they will all be charged by the equal amount - 15W (150W in total) and Eon will consume 157.5W from the outlet",False

Thank you for your question!  Our scope does not end on just making charging devices. The process of creating products using technologies originating Node, has passed the stage from experimental studies to the creation and successful final testing of prototype devices. Right now, we offer the market 2 products: Alpha (Wireless charging Pad) and Eon (Wireless Charging Pod).  However, solutions for the industry is the our strategic goal. They can be implemented in different areas: production, construction, agriculture, energy, security and many others. Now, the company conducts research in the following areas:  1. Automotive The solution from Node allows for faster and more convenient charging of electric vehicles. It’s enough to place the receiving device under asphalt, for example, parking and on the inside surface of the body; the vehicle will be ready for charging. The body itself can act as a receiver. This method is safe, affordable and environmentally friendly, and also as simple and fast as refueling a gasoline car on a regular gas station.  2. Drones wireless charging Wireless charging and power technology provide multiple advantages over traditional connectors and docking systems, not only for unmanned systems, but also for industrial robotics. Moving on the surface, or passing areas where there is a signal, the robot can be charged from our wireless device.  Drones and quadcopters can be continuously recharged from wireless charging stations on the route. No need to connect the drone now to the connector or have a special bar for charging. There is an opportunity to create a distributed delivery network with the help of drones, for example, by placing the charging stations on houses.  3. Healthcare Node is actively engaged in the research and development of new sensors for non-invasive determinations of the chemical composition of liquids and media. By using new methods of signal transmission through various media and collecting information on the change of these signals at different resonant frequencies, it’s possible to determine with sufficient accuracy the presence and quantity of chemical elements and compounds in a certain volume of the medium space.  Using special algorithms, it’s possible to determine deviations of environmental parameters from standard values and transmit this information. This allows for obtaining reliable and accurate data on the state of the environment in real time, remotely and with low power consumption. This is a demanded product, which is extremely necessary in the medical industry, for example: to create devices that determine the chemical composition of blood, and also designed to control blood sugar levels, etc. Therefore, Node's technological solutions are widely used in medicine.  There are no limits of what we can do with Nodes technology. Starting with the maintenance of electronics for care and monitoring of health, ending with the supply of implanted devices, sensors and measuring devices. Implanted microsensors that run on batteries do not require a connection and can be easily recharged by simply placing them to the charging transmitter through the body.  These types of solutions are under development and would be presented later in 2018.",False

Node is a revolutionary high-tech start-up, which disrupts a market niche of wireless transmission devices for both private and commercial use. In the consumer sector this technology is actively used to charge smartphones, tablets, wearable devices and other electronics. Node aims to develop a wide range of applications in consumer electronics, automotive, medical and many other industries. Our investors get an opportunity not only to increase their capital, but also to become the first owners of such devices.   Our Products     Road map       NODE Token  The NODE token gives you a unique opportunity to invest in a revolutionary technological product - wireless transmission devices for both private and commercial use. The current round of the funds raising is aimed at financing the Node devices production, marketing and sales.  The current stage of development is the best time to invest:  Smoothed risks related to the product's performance Opportunity that is usually only available to business angels and venture capitalists R&D phase, prototype production and testing are successfully completed All Tests of prototypes demonstrate full compliance with the declared characteristics Maximum potential for the increase in investment   Investment Opportunity     NODE Token demand forecast   The demand for NODE tokens will be formed by a combination of factors: the implementation of a buyback and the provision of a discount on products when purchased directly from Node. Depending on the ITO implementation scenario, with some assumptions, it is possible to calculate the estimated annual ""organic"" demand for NODE tokens.     That is, in the case of the third scenario, the estimated annual demand would be about 8 million US dollars without taking into account the increase in demand due to the release of new products to the market and the reduction in the number of free-to-use tokens.

Thank you so much for your interest! The NODE token gives you an opportunity to increase your profit as a result of the tokens redemption process, that will be executed annually by the Node company. Also, as a token holder, you will be able to purchase the Node products with tokens with a 25% discount in relation to the value in a fiat currency (US dollars). At any time, the you will have the opportunity to purchase the Node products and pay for the order with NODE tokens. You can find all the formulas to calculate your profit/price of products in our whitepaper: http://www.nodepower.io/whitepaper.pdf  We will also provide you with a case, so it will be vey simple for you to understand which benefits the NODE tokens can bring you:  If $1000 is spent on the Pre-ITO and 1500 NODE tokens are received, the following 2 scenarios are possible:  1. Exchange tokens for Node products with a 25% discount and purchase Alpha or Eon for $2000 at the market value. In this case, your beneft will be equal to 100%.  2. With a realistic ITO scenario, the volume of the NODE tokens sold will be $5mln. In March 2019, 15% of undistributed profit for 2018 ($0.84 mln) will be directed for the redemption of tokens. At a market value of $2 per each NODE, 420 000 NODE tokens will be redeemed. Accordingly, 1500 NODE tokens can be sold for $3000, therefore a 200% profit is received from the $1000 invested during Pre-ITO. Given the fact that the redeemed tokens are burned, there will be fewer tokens on the market every year, and the remaining NODE tokens in circulation are projected to grow by 40-60% annually. Accordingly, with each year of ownership, an ITO participant can receive a 50% increase in the price of each held token.  We recommend you to read the Whitepaper, as it provides you with all the details about the NODE tokens and all possible calculations.",False
