The platform allows all parties to interact with each other, trade and settle for cryptocurrencies, while the blockchain keeps a public record for everybody to see and explore. Leveraging the trust that is inherent to this untamperable public record, we can remove a lot of fees and middlemen that are required to complete high-value transactions using old-fashioned systems.
