NVB does not distribute dividends to shareholders; instead all revenues are distributed among participants of the ecosystem.  Also we would like to outline three reasons why NVB as project could be a huge success: 1. Right business model, targeting publishers and vloggers in the first place and enabling them to profit in more than one way without sharing a bulk of these profits with lead-generating platform. 2. Effective combination of half-automated techniques of channel tagging/filtering and programmatic approach in ad serving. 3.
