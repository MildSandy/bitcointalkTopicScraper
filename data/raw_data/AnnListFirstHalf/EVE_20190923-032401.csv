Other than the ones which are obvious scams, there are also inherent risks in the business. One of the biggest difference we have from our competitors are that we expect this to be a very long battle. We are looking to raise funds to roll out the basic tech quickly but also sustain ourselves over a longer period. Unlike other teams, we are NOT looking to hire 30 staff and 15 advisors from the first day. We want to run a quality small dev team (which is costly) and get brands on boarded consistently throughout the process.  The other element is cost - for it to be feasible for everyone to use, it has to be cheap. The mechanics of that is a little tricky and one of the challenges is trying to balance the cost to get manufacturers to adopt the tech. Of course, we also do want anyone who starts a small indie store to also be able to tag their items from day one if they want  We'd be happy to have a chat further if you are keen.

We'd like to start out by saying that we have previously experienced the same issue you are facing and realised that this is a common issue amongst brands. It is what spurred us to come up with the solution.  The key concept here would be this - if you produced only 100 limited-edition products, you would buy 100 tags from us, and for each product you will assign the tag. At each point of it changing hands, you can have the ownership change, and this movement of the product will be permanently stored in the blockchain. In there future, no one can claim to own one item unless they have the associated tag.  At launch we will be trialling with QR codes as it is easier to implement. Later on, we will partner with hardware manufacturers to produce specific RFID tags that can be read by the NFC reader on Apple or Android phones.  For the manufacturers, we will build apps that will plug in directly to the ecommerce sites and APIs that can be used to integrate into the current software that they use. One crucial adoption bit is that the technology is going to be largely invisible. We will provide the generic apps, Apple and Android mobile apps, and api access for free.  How do you currently mitigate against imitation products and could you tell us a bit more about your business?",False
