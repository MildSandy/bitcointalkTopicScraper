GMT - GoldMine Token,"Anyone ever seen that movie Gold? With Matthew Mcconaughey? The real gold was the investors in the gold mining project.  That in mind, the first red flag that is obvious is the ""First in the World"" (btw world doesn't need to be capitalized...) But this guy might be new to crypto so he doesn't remember that this crypto model was probably most commonly known through uro then some random gold pegs came later. So maybe that isn't a red flag, we will chalk it up to OP being new to the scene.  I really want to focus on the land.  There are many aspects that go into surveying a plot. There are also many securities that need to be in place to assure that the assay was not tampered with during any part of the process. I see none of that coming out of a russian run zambian gold mine registered in china. Especially from a company that can't SEO their company site higher than a blog about how their company ripped some people off in zambia. But the article also demonstrated that the land that is said to be owned is under dispute assuming that I am researching the correct company from Aleksandr Ogloblin or Glebov.  https://www.dailynation.news/kasempa-community-cheated-out-of-mine-deal/  Now the testing side of it is done by a company called SGS who is legit but they do not ensure that what they are testing is not tampered with during transport from whatever site to their labs. So imo there are no assurances here for any actual assets. At least with some of the other gold pegs they attempted to keep reserves. This just seems like an ico version of the movie ""Gold"" that just got put on Netflix, which is a great movie but sad to see so many people get ripped off. So don't get ripped off people!  Also, what would ever be the incentive for the dev to buy back gmt after the whole cycle? There is no motivation for them to do that.",True

GMT - GoldMine Token,"Hi, erok  1st, regarding article, this post is just proving that we are working and gold is mining. There's some pressure from some locals who want to have a piece of pie, but no matter what they want the mining will be still going on. Authorities and the goverment is at our side, supporting the project and right now thanks to ICO they got even more interested in our business. By the way we are helping local and supporting the community - not the ""local leaders"" . They'd (those ""leaders"") better find a job.  2nd, we're uploaded lots of paperwork and licences to make everything clear for everyone and we're totaly open. If you don't trust it - ok, dunno what to do more. Though, the article says that ""Sources in Kasempa confirm that workers there are carrying out mining and digging"". You're to contradicting yourself.  3rd - about our managing company registered in Hong Kong... no comments. Just take a look at other ICO's jurisdictions ans ask yourself why.  4th - about ""ripping some people off in Zambia"".  It would be nice to see some proofs. Please tell us.  5th - the assumptions about substitution of samples. This is hilarious. Really. You're blaming the company in  ripping off pour Zambian leaders and faking the gold (without any basis) and  at the same time prooving the real work and results by the article.  The ""Gold"" is a great movie, but it's just a movie....",True
