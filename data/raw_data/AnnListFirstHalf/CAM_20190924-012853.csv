It's easy. There are two different questions: 1. We need CAM tokens to pay it to CamOnRoad app users for streaming or uploading public videos. Others need these tokens to reach platform data and analytics. CAMs are some kind of internal currency of CamOnRoad platform. 2. CamOnRoad platform needs own decentralized registry to store data about each violation of traffic rules worldwide (GPS data, date and time of violation, car model, car plate number, type of violation, link to a video, etc.). Nobody can delete or modify the data.",False

Sometimes when I go somewhere I need to cross a 4-line crossroad with quite dangerous traffic and drivers mostly do not want to stop even on green light for pedestrians (drivers also have a green light and it intersects with green light for pedestrians for the first 30 seconds). Couple of times they almost hit me there. Unfortunately I'm not allowed to take a baseball bet and crash cars in such cases due to law restrictions. It would be nice to have such system where drivers will be punished for such behavior and other dangerous driving situations. This would make roads safer for both drivers and pedestrians.  As I can see you already have some code base and ready-to-use app. And I do undestand that it needs quite much investments to go worldwide and make project profitable and roads safer.  You have my ETH.  Also it would be nice to have some of the data recorded into a blockchain for cases when people with much power/money/connections and no brains make something bad on road and then just skip the punisment.,False
