I have always been interested in music + cryptocurrency combo. I'm actually listening to a radio platform that combines both.   I just saw the site and wow this looks seriously hot! I also love the concept of no more monthly fees but instead prepaying for a set amount of time. That's the way it should be! I reminds me of what they started doing with insurance where you only pay for the miles you estimate you'll be using and they just check annually where you submit a form showing your current mileage so that the estimation is correct. It saved so many people money this way. Auto subscriptions are a pain to cancel.  Could you imagine if VOXXO after they become big in music they end up deciding to take over the whole audiobook industry?  I despise subscription services because you can never cancel those damn things but paying for time blocks with crypto is just genius!  So many great ideas I just wonder how they're going to get mass adoption.  I also like that this takes out the middle men and lets the the musician collect revenue directly from the listener.,False
