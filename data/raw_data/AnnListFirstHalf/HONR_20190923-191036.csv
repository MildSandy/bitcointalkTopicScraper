I recognize that there are other projects for the same audience, what sets us apart is the value proposition.   Service providers may only enter by appointment. The indicated service provider receives 30% of the HONOR token subscription (HONR) where it can: Hire Insurance against accidents and incidents. Pawn the tokens in a smartcontract as guarantees of clauses as extended warranty. Hire other services on the Jubs platform Swap by fiat currency Our service providers also receive tokens from the rewards machine when the service provider generates a quality service and when performing actions that preserve the health of the ecosystem. Within our platform there is also a court of participants that awards arbitration awards. Our platform is already available in version 1.0 in Playstore and soon for IOS.  And the main one, every month Jubs buys $ 8 USD in HONOR per active service provider, follow the graphic on the site: honor.appjubs.com  We have a great potential to liquidate the investments and with the withdrawal of tokens from the market for usability in the platform the tendency with the scarcity the tokens value themselves.
