The New Milestone of the Internet,"Pre ICO has successfully finished!  Hello everyone! Pre ICO has successfully finished! We managed to achieve our goals! Not all of them, but it doesn’t really matter now. During this month we have gathered a lot of feedback on the project, conditions of ICO and much more.  Here is the most important news! Our team is growing! UI specialists and designers have joined us. It’s very important for us since our project is a real challenge in the interface. In details, we’re changing the Internet and it’s interface as a whole!  Also we’ve been in touch with a few investors who are willing to invest money at ICO, thus at the moment we’re working on terms and conditions for large-scale investments.  Increasing amount of followers People are interested in our project. During the month of Pre ICO we got thousands of followers who are interested in our project and are looking forward to the detailed information about it. Many of them suggested their ideas and shared their opinions with us.  What about the collection of ETH?  Public collection of money didn’t show an impressive result but there are a few investors with interest in our project. Some of them, in exchange for our tokens, have decided to join the project and support it. Thus we are happy to announce that we are getting ready to start our ICO!  To everyone who supported the project  Everyone who sent ETH to our address(0x00f18dBB7696132323754c3F69ac29c3261Abfc7) will get their ETH back + a bonus for their trust and interest in the project. Unfortunately we don’t know who sent the ETH and how interested they are in our project but we’ve decided that it’s the right way to return their ETH since we haven’t reach our goal at getting the soft cap. Your trust is very important to us. If you are planning to continue supporting us, you can resend ETH to a new address: 0x00F14ea9136f4F64aA0863Dd42cad065Fe23fae1  We have special conditions for our early adopters: 1000 ZenTokens per 1 ETH. You can get our tokens immediately. This address will be working until the ICO stage.  And also to subscribe to our newsletter: http://eepurl.com/cw5cHz  Unsolved problems There are a lot of different ICO and advertising of other projects, thus our project is not visible among all this information noise. So, if you’re reading this message, share it with your friends, tell them about the project, how serious it is and how it can change the Internet. It’s better than any advertising. Your participation influences the success of the project!  What’s next? As we have planned, we are getting ready to start ICO very soon. From this moment until the beginning of ICO we will continue our pre sale at the previous conditions: 1 ETH = 1000 ZenTokens. At the ICO the cost will be different: 1 ETH = 500 ZenTokens.  Good luck to everyone and let’s change the Internet!",False

The New Milestone of the Internet,"   It makes only a little sense to do Pre ICO with escrow.  And here is why: 1) We’re collecting 300,000 USD and the money will be immediately spent. Escrow agent will either harm the development by delaying transfers or just give all the money and in this case why use the agent? 2) It’s necessary to pay to the agent. If we were collecting 10,000,000 then there would be the opportunity to pay. But we’re’re collecting only 300,000 and the money will be used exclusively for the development of the first version of the application ICO preparation. Any other expenses will only thwart the project.  Escrow is obviously necessary for the ICO.  Is there anyone you could advise?",False

It’s like an iPhone which combined a phone, a camera and an mp3 player.

The New Milestone of the Internet,"   We suggest you to look at the Internet as millions of similar websites and online services. We offer you an application that combines user scenarios (there’re not so many of them as it seems) in one application.  Here is a simple example. Now one can find a lot of websites dedicated to blockchain and ICO, or those that offer similar services for ICO projects. But the services are really similar one to each other and teams have to spend time communicating with each of them and spend money that could be spent on development of projects. And it’s always like that: ‘Do you need a recipe?’ – ok, have a look at all those websites that Google offers you. Or those people in programming have to always register and check all those forums.  A milestone is a transition from a ‘web browser’ Internet to an orderly Internet. At first it’s gonna be a simple social network that we all got used to with functions of communities so that people could talk and store information getting tokens in exchange.  In order to attract an ordinary consumer, it’s necessary to give them something they use in daily life: games, entertaining, communication, opportunity to earn on their active and useful activities. It’s like if all the authors writing in Wikipedia were paid for their contribution to the world encyclopedia. And obviously it’s a complete protection of personal data as well. This topic is quite extensive for discussion and I would like you to take part in it. How do you see the application? What kind of value can it give to you? And how do you think it should develop?

The New Milestone of the Internet,"website | facebook | twitter | medium | telegram channel & group WHITEPAPER DRAFT | Email subscription  Official #openZen project bounty campaign thread!  Intro: I’m publishing the project in order to discuss it with the community, gather constructive(!) criticism. Our whitepaper is only a draft now, we have a lot of information to add there, so please tell us what you would like to see in it. Also we’re opening the Pre ICO in order to accelerate the launch of the first version of the application.  Hello everyone! My name is Ilya, I am the developer and founder of the project Zen. I am here to  talk about the project which will completely change your view on the Internet. That project can change the image of the whole Internet, methods of communication familiar to us and other behavior patterns... In a few words, this project can change our life, and change it for better!  Zen is  the result of my difficult and long-term research in spheres of information theory, sociology, mathematics, Information Ecology, Human Information Behavior, Human Information Interaction. So, working on this topics and investigating problems arising between people and information, I came to understanding the deep-seated problems of information and the Internet in particular. Trying to find a way of solving those problems I decided to start my own project Zen.  What is Zen? Zen is an application and a decentralised network. What does it mean? It means that all the information is stored not on a single server or data centre, but on people’s computers. Obviously it’s encrypted. Decentralisation provides complete protection of the user’s information. Zen is a desktop application which is an alternative to browser. Zen is a semi-closed decentralized social network, a search engine and a repository of information. Here information is created, updated and consumed directly by the users of the system. Information is distributed among the members of the network in accordance with a p2p model. Zen is a big new world, new universe with new rules, with your rules. Just imagine it and you will understand me. It is like you find a new continent where you can do everything.  Let me show you the interface so that you understand what’s going on.  Application interface for test  So now we’re familiar with the app, but how will it be useful for us?  What’s the idea: the application Zen is being developed in order to solve a number of systematic problems of the Internet, make people’s life easier. What kinds of problems does Zen solve? Which problems did become the reasons to create this project.  Problem overview In the process of life and activity in the online space we faced a number of problems which are not being solved now and cause more and more harm every year. Web is like an ocean of information. There is so much of it that it’s difficult to even imagine. But the majority of this information is just a waste rock. Only a small part of it is really valuable.  Information pollution and information overload The main point that I’m trying to emphasise is that web is a plant for the production of informational noise and garbage. It’s all this advertising, registration, enormous amount of low-quality information. Also it’s the constant e-mail spam, notifications from hundreds of internet services where you once left your data. Not to mention one-type internet services and millions of web sites. It’s all called informational noise, some people call it informational garbage. It reaches us as soon as we open the browser. I’m sure you have faced it.  And thus here I will use a metaphor. There accumulates a lot of information mosquitoes around each of us, they drink our blood, suck our time complicating our lives. Those mosquitoes are all the ads, notifications, invitations and endless search of the relevant information.  Money The Internet industry is a big vacuum cleaner to collect money. We use one service and we pay for it. Then we use another service and again we pay. I can agree that they improve the quality of our lives but why don’t we create a single universal service and pay it for a set of different functions. As an example imagine a swiss army knife.  That’s what we aim to do. But we are going even further. Since the system is decentralised and we don’t have significant expenditure on hardware support and stuf maintaining it. It means that our users don’t pay for it.  Crisis of trust in information and responsibility Fakes news are everywhere. What’s the reason of them spreading so fast? It’s the lack of responsibility of the authors. Zen, for example, monitores it. If someone gives fake news and it is confirmed, then the rating of the publisher lowers. Would you now try to catch a major mass media and lower its rating? Now it is possible.  Reputation is an asset of the 21st century. It’s a mechanism of increasing responsibility. It cannot be bought or sold. You can only earn it doing socially useful actions or spend it. This mechanism will be fully described later.  All the information about the problems that we’re solving is available here or in the whitepaper.   Mission Statement Our mission is to give the users of Internet the instrument to make life easier. This instrument will allow them to save their priceless time of life. Zen is a new milestone in the development of the Internet that will reduce the amount of informational noise and informational pollution. Our mission is to reduce the role of advertising as means of getting profit. In our opinion it is the main reason if informational pollution. In the pursuit of advertising the business does not act in the interests of ordinary people, more and more manipulating their weaknesses, desires and pains. Developing Zen we completely realise that Zen cannot belong to a limited number of people who will use it to increase only their own capital and material prosperity. Our mission is to create an ecosystem for honest, fair and responsible people. Our mission is to create an autonomous and smart society.   Core Objectives Create an application that will be an alternative to web browsers, that will combine all the main user scenarios in the Internet: communication, search and creation of information, entertainment. Reduce information overload, make life easier in the period of information age. Make the application decentralised, independent from material interests of a limited number of people. Reward users for socially useful actions. Any activity aiming to collect and organise knowledge should be rewarded as well as any socially useful actions. Reduce negative influence of unscrupulous people, organisations and information. Any negative and destructive action should have an effect on life of its initiator. Give people equal opportunities for personal development. All the people are equal and if someone has less resources than the other, it should not matter if the person wants to develop.  Why blockchain? - you can ask. Zen uses the technologies based on blockchain and its own cryptocurrency ZenToken as means of exchange, payments, voting, games, rewarding members of the application for useful activity…  What is ZenToken? ZenToken can be used in the application in order to pay for purchases, content, voting and other social interactions of subjects between each other and with the world. ZenToken acts as a unit of measure of the economic condition inside the platform Zen. ZenToken are required for Zen platform to operate and for access of users to the program.  Pre ICO The project is being developed by an independent team of software engineers. We’ve decided to launch Pre ICO for the project in order to accelerate its development, get feedbacks, comments and opinions, draw attention to the problems that are being solved. We are doing it in order to refine the conceptual ideas with the help of society because that’s you who will use the application.  So what do you think of it? What else could we improve?  We would also like to attract indifferent to this project professionals who understand these problems and their seriousness. We would like to see in our team strong mathematicians, lawyers and programmers in order to fully implement our ideas. So if you share our ideas and would like to become part of our team, please contact me (facebook, email: [b]ilya.druzhinin@protonmail.ch[/b]).  The minimum required amount (equivalent to $300,000) is necessary to strengthen our team, launch of the first version of the application, to run a large-scale ICO campaign and to attract participants of the project. Pre ICO also includes collection of funds for the preparation of marketing campaigns, advertising in social networks, registration of all the necessary documents.  Pre ICO will be held on the official website of the project Zen http://openzen.co, using smart contracts of the Ethereum platform.  Everyone who is interested in this project and agree to the terms of this campaign can support the project by taking part in our Pre ICO and get ZenToken.  Distribution of ZenToken Whole amount of released tokens: 270 000 000 ZenToken Pre ICO Fund: 20,000,000 ZenToken The minimum amount, that will let us move forward faster is 1500 ETH. Maximum: 5500 ETH. Time of the Pre ICO: from 31st July to 31st August 2017. It will last only one month.  Where will the money be used? Research and development, team: 40% Marketing: 30% Registration, office: 20% Technological infrastructure: 10%  Brief description of architecture Zen is basically an innovative approach to design and user scenarios. We aim to create the most convenient interface for working with the Internet and to optimize the user scenarios. Adaptive and highly adjustable interface where a user can choose what he wants to see and what he does not. Unlike other projects that are developing technologies, we first develop a unified interface that will allow the users to find and create information easier, to communicate better and to spend fun time online.  The basic functions of the Zen system will be implemented through the combination of several technologies, including Ethereum, IPFS, etc. We assume that the platform Zen will have a distributed decentralized architecture with the content in IPFS and a blockchain Ethereum as a computational mechanism.  IPFS IPFS - is an interplanetary file system (IPFS). Most of the content, including documents, articles, photos, videos, and various updates to the platform will be stored there. Zen users get another chance to earn income from their own content or storage space if part of the information will be stored on their computers.  Distributed social network The platform Zen is a distributed social network. Distributed Social Network (DSN) is a network established to protect the privacy of user’s information. User’s personal data is stored exclusively on the client machine of the user. Fully decentralized DSN differ in a complete absence of server. The client of such a network is installed on a user’s computer and acts as a client and a server simultaneously. Zen is a software that implements a distributed social network. Emphasis is put on extensive privacy settings.  Zen architecture is based on a p2p and f2f model. The information generated by the users is spread between them, i.e. a distributed data storage is implemented. All the data is accumulated in special network nodes. These are common users who act as the nodes.  Public content is stored in IPFS, nodes. Personal data is distributed according to the model of p2p.   Road Map The project has a status of a semi-closed system until the beta version of it. Access to it is given to the holders of ZenToken and the people with invitations.  Pre ICO from 31/07/2017 to 30/08/2017 Goals: accelerate the development of the first version of the application, collect feedbacks, opinions, to refine the concept and attract new people to our team.

Again, we’re not creating a ‘killer’ of browsers. We offer an alternative. Browsers with all those millions of web pages, notifications, advertisements, spam, fraud, bots, enormous amount of low-quality information, that is what we’re so used to, will remain. We only offer a different view on the Internet, we suggest you make your choice yourself. We’re making a more convenient format of interaction with information and the Internet. It’s going to be a long and hard way but we’re ready for it and we know what to do. So we’re waiting for the support of those people who share our views.  From this moment, weekly reports on the project development will be posted on this post and in social networks. I invite you to take part in discussing the project and problems. Please share this post with your friends so that they could also leave their opinion. Accompany your repost with the hashtag #openZen so that we could track the activity and take part in your discussion.  I invite you to take part in discussing the project and problems Stay in touch with me personally, I’ll be glad to talk to everyone interested in the project. Good luck to everyone and let’s together change the world for better!

The New Milestone of the Internet,So you plan on having a signature campaign or this only a pre-sale ico where you are not reserving any for the bounty hunters? I am currently in process of destroying myethereum wallet due to the major hacks going on with that now. So hopefully your token isn't ethereum-based and can be stored in it's own wallet. Because ethereum seems to be the wrong way to go with the ease of them being stolen from investors wallets. Just look at what happened to $30 million worth of ethereum being stolen due to the stupid security that ethereum has. So good timing on releasing an alternative way to do business.,False
