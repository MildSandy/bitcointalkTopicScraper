When the game starts, the earned bounty tokens will be awarded to the participants, and the unspent rest will be destroyed.  Of the bounty fund, 8% (2000 JACK) are allocated for ""Misc."" needs. We believe it is our responsibility to notify our investors about unexpected spends from the ""Misc."" section, and that's what we are doing with this message.  We were contacted by an investor who by their mistake used an exchange account to buy JACK tokens. This means JACK were sent back to the exchange's Ethereum account, and are effectively lost. In this case people can't control the tokens, since they don't control the exchange's account.  The Txn in question: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3eb2d7cc15f0c6b618d079e09777c17a8b78f85a87275c3bcd4795c80dd938a5  Notice for future investors: don't buy JACK tokens from exchanges' accounts, only send Ether to the ICO address from an account you directly control (e.g. through MyEtherWallet or MetaMask).  The total amount of tokens ""lost"" was 93 JACK.  We believe it is our duty to help them out. Due to the way EtherJack ICO works, we can't reverse their transaction or refund them from the Jackpot fund: we don't have access to it. We are able however to give them the tokens they expected to receive, from the Bounty fund.  Today we sent this investor the tokens to compensate for their lost tokens (although the loss is result of their action, not our mistake or bug). Txn: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9bbb193e794ac9897f2c78211b242b694850e54f9eaa3c1ec8fcfc4ce4633db0  We believe it is the right thing to do, since:  - It didn't happen due to our fault or system error or a bug in the game.  - Taking these tokens from the Bounty fund doesn't hurt the interest of other investors at all: these merely replace other tokens effectively removed from circulation (exchange taking control of the tokens on their account is unlikely and illegal).  - By resolving the issue this way we are being transparent and supportive to our investors at the same time.  We will continue issuing such notices in case other unexpected spendings have to happen.  We make no guarantee that future incidents like this will be addressed in a similar manner.

After the jackpot has 333 ETH or more, a 48-hour countdown timer will start. After the countdown runs down to 0, the game will start. Leave your email in the box on the website to be notified 12 hours before the game start and on game start. If you subscribe to website pushes (left top corner), you’ll get those notifications as well.   Q: What is the ICO stage? In the ICO stage the game is collecting the jackpot for which the players will compete, and gives the investors JACK tokens at low price in return. During the game phase it will be much more expensive to buy JACK tokens.   Q: How much can I earn if I invest now? It depends on what exactly you are going to do with tokens and when you plan to sell them.  Token price during the ICO: 0.004-0.006 When the game starts: 0.01 ETH After 1K bids: 0.07 ETH After 10K bids: 0.61 ETH  The White paper includes a table with ROI numbers depending on when you invest and when you sell. Additionally, before you decide to sell you can deposit the tokens with Croupier and get a cut from bids and token sales during the game (the amount of dividends depends on number of tokens deposited by all players in total).   Q: How is it guaranteed that the game is fair? Ethereum is more than a cryptocurrency, it’s a platform for Smart Contracts: pieces of program code deployed to the blockchain that can’t be changed and which can determine behavior of a system. EtherJack is implemented as two Smart Contracts (one for the game itself and one to describe the token). Anyone can inspect the source code of the contracts and ensure that the code matches the declared behavior. The developers have no access to the jackpot funds: those are locked in the smart contract, and what is going to happen to it is only determined by the contract (which anyone can read). The developers left no backdoors or ways to alter the contract for themselves. This also can be verified in the smart contract code.   Q: What can I do with the tokens?    1.   Bid JACK. After the game starts, anyone can bid with ETH to claim the jackpot. But one can also bid 1 JACK at any time, and it will work as a bid. When a bid will cost 0.1 ETH or 1 ETH, you don’t have to spend ETH, just bid JACKs, which you bought back when they were cheap.    2.   Deposit JACK in the Vault and get a cut from every bid made and token sold during the game phase.    3.   Resell. When the bid price and JACK price raises during the game (it grows by 0.006 ETH with every 100 bids placed) you can resell the JACK to new players willing to buy them. The game can do it for you automatically. Even when the game just starts, the JACK price will jump to 0.01 ETH per JACK (highest price during ICO is 0.006 ETH).   Q: How do I participate in the ICO? To buy JACK, send ETH to 0xe64d5f33e28387855d33980719f27f0d579392af, and the smart contract will send you back JACK tokens. Check the current price at EtherJack.io, you can also use the calculator at the bottom of the page. Also, if you are using Metamask, you can place the order right from the website.   Q: Is there a control panel for investors? Yes. To access it, at EtherJack.io, click “JACK Holders’ Dashboard” and enter your Ethereum address. You don’t need a login and password: all operations are triggered by transactions on the blockchain, so the system will know you is you by watching the blockchain transactions.  [/color]",False
