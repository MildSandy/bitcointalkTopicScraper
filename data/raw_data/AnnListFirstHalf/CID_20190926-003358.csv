Be it certificates for passing a certain examination or licenses for carrying out a particular business. These certificates and licenses signal the achievements and abilities which make them eligible for specific jobs.  Given the importance of these documents, the way we handle them currently is archaic. Most of the certificates are paper-based which need to be carried around in person. If you need to present it to any authority, you need to get it notarised which is a cumbersome process in itself. The need for notarization is to ensure that fake certificates are not produced, but the way public notary services are designed hardly ensure authenticity. And if you are required to share your certificates with somebody else over the Internet, it’s a nightmare.  The main problem with sharing of certificates is that people have huge incentives to fake certificates and signal achievements which they have not accomplished. Blockchain technology is an ideal solution for such situations where the system needs to be censorship resistant and reliable without the need for parties to trust each other. With ChainID, we envisage a world where sharing certificates which are reliably authentic is as easy as sharing a document.  But how does it work?  1. Every user who wants to get a ChainID needs to register in our website with at least a name. There can be other fields which can be added like phone number, email id, postal addresses etc. There is only one principle: all information will be verified, and things which are not verifiable cannot be added. For example, if you wish to add phone number, the system will send SMS code which you need to enter on the website.  2. Then the system generates a user card. The user card corresponding to the details given by the user is created and stored in the ETH blockchain. Below is a visual representation of the card.    3. The user gets a unique code or address which he can share with others who wish to access information about the user. The address could be just a email, the only requirement to an address is that it is unique in the system and user could easily remember it, so email will work just fine.  4. Then, let’s imagine that the user goes to a PADI diving course. He gives the address of his card to PADI, and when he successfully passes final exams, PADI will insert their certificate to the user card.  Here it is important to note that PADI can change only one field in the user card, namely PADI field. But of course they cannot change TOEFL field for example. Every certificate issuing organization has rights to modify their own fields only.  Updated! So today we discussed how user certificates gets into blockchain in the first place. Interested? Stay in touch, tomorrow we discuss how user can actually use them!",False
