And it's quite obvious, why they are not showing any tendency to talk about it. I think they were quite overwhelmed by the big demand (understandable, it is a nice project) during their pre-ITO, which was closed a long time before the announced deadline --> which is fine, when you were to slow, it's your problem, nothing to argue about. But then apparently they started to wonder why they are giving away their tokens so cheap, given the big interest which was already there during pre-ITO. So they increased the prices of the main token sale without attracting any attention to it. Apparently they were hoping that nobody will complain because nobody will realize it (and people who are already invested made via this already insanely gains, so of course, they will also not complain).  I just want to stress what this means whith an easy example:  - Person A invests 1000$ in the main tokensale (first stage, token price is 0.4$)  - Person A gets 2500 tokens  - Person B invested 1000$ during the pre-ITO  - Person B got 20.000 tokens  So persons who invested in the pre-ITO have have gotten a bonus of additional 700%!  700%, this is insane.

We needed to make the change to the price of the token as long term business decision.  Our lead investor (global blockchain) found us with out us having spent any $$ on marketing. We met them in person, showed them our prototype and shook on a deal. Global blockchain purchased our token along with 30% equity at an average of 8c USD/MVU. Global blockchain will provide the funds needed to compete for the attention in this space but will bring a lot more then just capital to the table. Not only will development be expedited but key connections, and partnerships will be announced in the coming weeks/months, that would not of been possible otherwise.  With GBC we feel more confident in being able to gain early traction, adding the needed liquidity on our platform, and exceeding the expectations we have set out.  Previously our raise was only for 7MM USD in the public sale, and after discussions with GBC, our advisors, and executives from traditional or ""legacy"" sports books 7 MM is just not enough to compete.  We want to be here in 3-5 years when the mainstream begins adopting crypto and blockchain tech and see meVu as a trusted, fun and established dapp. This is why we raised the starting price in the public sale to 40c with 60MM MVU available for a sale targeting a 24 Mil USD raise, which in our opinion is still a very modest.  This will allow us to become a self sustaining and established brand for the future.  Once again we do apologize for the change at such a late time, but we needed to adapt our plan for future success. We have been busy at work and I apologize for not being as active as we should be on this forum. Gearing up for our marketing campaign April 1st and have many things to get organized prior too. I check telegram 24/7 and you can join our group here https://t.me/joinchat/FKcKRUwJ1_T8zMK2Lueu3A Alternatively you can always email me kelvin@mevu.bet and I will be sure to answer ASAP. Thank you for your interest in meVu, and I hope you understand our decision and continue participating in our community.",False
