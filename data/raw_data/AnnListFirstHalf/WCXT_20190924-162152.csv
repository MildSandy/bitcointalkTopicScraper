Idk about you- I bought presale and they had a page with information about the token etc. I remember it saying something about ID verification for referrals and banned countries.  In any case I think it's the logical approach. Why would they give you tokens for referring people who aren't active or real?  It would be a waste of tokens IMO and pretty bad for all those who bought XT and are buying XT because it would just dilute the supply. XT sales are already really close to the 1 billion maximum cap if you take into account the presale.,False

But they do not require KYC to trade on their platform. Only to claim the tokens. If it is required to do KYC to claim a token, wouldn't it be just as important for actually trading, and dealing in what could presumably be considered securities?  If they had required it for all parties across the board, I would have been (still unhappy), but fine with it. But it isn't about compliance, because then traders would be required to do it as well.  Nope. This is about not paying out, because they don't want to pay out.  *************************** ***************************  And @hamnchess.

You may not believe that this ICO is a scam. That is your right to believe that, personally. Others do not have to share those beliefs.  You say if people referred ""spam and shit people"", you aren't allowed to complain. Now hold on a second. The referrals were not required to make a purchase. They were required to verify their email. That is the issue here. The change in the rules, not the quality of the people signing up.  Just because the exchange works, doesn't mean WCX has not deceived all of the people creating referrals. Just because the CEO is smart and intelligent doesn't make WCX honest, regarding the policy change. Just because purchasing XT works like a charm doesn't mean that WCX did not change the rules half way through the game. Just because KYC is easy doesn't mean that it was specified as required at the start of the ICO. Just because support answers quickly doesn't mean that WCX has acted honestly regarding referrals. Just because the telegram channel is ""transparent"" doesn't mean that the rules weren't changed after everyone put in all the work.  Here is these peoples' argument. (If I may be so bold as to speak for others). It isn't right, nor fair, to change a contract once one side is done with their obligation. None of the referrers got a say in the new policy. So they did all of the marketing work for WCX, and now that the rules have changed, are going to get only a fraction of what they were originally promised.  You come in here calling those who disagree with you ""idiots"", and ""beggars"". That is not polite discourse, and is doing neither you, nor WCX any help.  As to your secondary questions: They might be continuing to work because they are STILL seeking more money for their ICO. Their releasing a fully functional exchange has nothing to do with their integrity on the aspect of referrals. How could it be a scam? Plenty of fully functional exchanges ended up scamming. Does Mt Gox ring a bell?  Just because people do not share your view of a certain ICO does not make them stupid, beggars, or uninformed. I believe that the measure was put into place solely for the purpose of limiting the amount that WCX has to pay out. Which is not as per the original agreement.

Although you tout yourself as an open and honest platform, that is really not the vibe you are giving off.  Let's look at one of your early quotes:    Let's look at more. Your history is full of these:  There will be no limits on withdrawals or deposits. We won't be dealing with fiat or banks, just cryptocurrencies.   We will not require KYC for any cryptocurrency deposits or withdrawals. When we integrate fiat later in 2018, KYC will be required if you choose to deposit or withdraw fiat - this is required by the banks who hold the fiat, not us in particular.  What do you tell us about referrals?  Referrals are going through smoothly. Please make sure whoever you refer verifies their email for their referral to count. Also that they are:  - using a real email, and not using a disposable email service to register  - not double registering with the same IP   How does the referral system count referrals?  Referred users need to verify their email for them to count.   Referrals are counted to you after they verify their email.  Let's assume you are honest.  I would request that you follow through with your original commitments. Those were the rules that we all agreed to play by, when we helped bring users to your platform.  XT is a cryptocurrency token. As such, there should be no withdrawal limits, or KYC required. That is what you proposed, correct? And your requirements for a referral to ""count"" was that the user verifies email. Did you lie to us, or will that be the case, going forward?  The way I see it, you either are committing fraud, by changing the agreement midway, or you are going to rescind the KYC requirement.  Can you explain to me why you changed your earlier statements, and changed to the current setup? Can you show me where you said that referrals and referrers would both have to end up doing KYC? Can you tell me why you think changing the terms of an agreement after the fact is fair? Can you tell me why almost every other referral system in existence does not have this requirement? Can you demonstrate to me why referrals need to do KYC to ""filter spam"" when you said earlier that users only need to verify their email? Can you tell me why KYC is not required to buy and sell on your exchange, yet is in order to ""claim"" what they have already earned by your own rules?  I'm very unhappy with what I've seen here. I'm not a bot. Nor am I a troll. I'm just an unfortunate schmuck who took your words at face value. Did you lie to my face?",False

And the regulatory landscape in crypto evolves - a lot. Some of the things that were not required just a few months ago are required today. We cannot put the platform at risk of non-compliance or put our users at risk by not requiring KYC.  2) If the people you referred are real and active (actually useful for the project and not spam or disinterested), then they should have no trouble completing KYC. It's a very straightforward process. Tens of thousands of users already have. Email verification is unfortunately not enough.  There are actually three types of referrals we've seen: - spam: fake emails, self referrals, fraud - these cannot verify their ID and hence do not count - not interested: referrals that picked up the free tokens and do not contribute in any other way to the project, do not promote it, have forgotten about it or do not read our emails. These also do not complete KYC and do not count as meaningful referrals anyway. - interested: have purchased WCXT or XT, return to the site, follow us frequently, read our emails: these are high value referrals, and mostly all of them complete KYC.

You can get verified here: https://wcex.com/verify.  I have 400 referrals. And it means 2k $ worth of token which is worth doing kyc.  But most of 400 people has 5$ worth of tokens and it doesn't worth for a kyc. Make a 25$ minimum kind of decision or say that we a scammer company.  I can accept both.  Don't make a half-ass explanation. totally agree especially that there are doubts over the veracity of your project. Nobody's going to risk a KYC for $5 in these conditions.",False

ICOs are moved many times, they try to prolong the ICO's time to attract as much money as possible. Then they will go to UFOs and bye stupid investors. 2. Support of poor ICO, if this is a serious ICO, you will get support as soon as possible. Dev very little activity. They do not show interest with faulty transactions, not customer support. Support is written in 1 day. 3. The company's ICO support URL and hidden domain ID, hidden data of the domain registrar. 4. Provide ERC20, passive income, exchange views, ... deceive that this is a large and legitimate project. 5. View exchange jobs but can not register a trading account.

FAQ (update 26 oct 2017)  1) When will be the ICO? - ICO moved to 1 December 2017  2) When can I try the platform? - Exchange is already launched since 10 oct 2017  https://wcex.co/trade/ETHBTC  3) Why I can't create an account? - There is weekly limitations. They expect to allow everyone to sign up some time in November, likely after the Bitcoin hard forks. The exchange is its own system, so you have to create an account with the blue button in the top right corner. It very fast reached our sign up quota for the week with the higher than expected traffic. They are working on letting more people in as quickly, and safely, as possible.  4) When I can trade WCX tokens? - After the ICO  5) When ICO will be over?  - The maximum amount of time the ICO will last is likely 30 days, although this could change.  6) Why I can't buy tokens at pre-sale? - There is daily limitations too. If you receive a “Presale tokens sold out” message when trying to purchase, more tokens may be made available at 00:00 UTC the following day.  7) I have an issue -  Try to write to hello@wcex.co  8 ) What is in their plans? - They are working on incredible updates for both the UI and our backend trading system  Roadmap here https://trello.com/b/596LMpPZ/wcx-product-roadmap  9) What coins listed on the platform at the moment?-  ETH, BTC, LTC, XRP.   Current trades pairs: https://wcex.co/trade/ETHBTC https://wcex.co/trade/LTCBTC https://wcex.co/trade/XRPBTC They expect WCX tokens to be issued and begin trading on WCX shortly after the ICO completes. WCX will be fork-agnostic and offer traders the choice to trade BTC, BTC Segwit2x, and BTC Gold, if all these chains survive.   10) Can I withdraw tokens for referals? - NOT YET, bacause they will be AFTER the ICO https://help.wcex.co/hc/en-us/community/posts/115000757391-How-to-deposit-my-WCX-coins?page=1#community_comment_115000502331  11) Bounty is over? - NOT YET  12) What is the contract address of WCX?  - Contract address is not issued yet since they are in presales.

All unsold tokens will be burned  15) My ref.counter not working   - Check your ref.link - it should be with ico https://ico.wcex.co/",False

This has been clearly explained in their last post. Please take the time to read it. I see no harm in that.  Since there are many new people just landing here, some tips:  - Please read previous posts.  - If you are having trouble with email verification, try clicking the email confirmation link in Chrome on a desktop computer (not mobile) - this helped me.  - If you are having issues with referral count, try using ico.wcex.co in your link instead of wcex.co.  - If you don't have an account on the exchange, or are unable to create one, that is normal for this week, the spots have been filled.  - Read some of Molot86's posts since they have been very useful in summarizing the thread as it moves. It is moving fast but please again take the time to read the thread so you don't post BS or things that have already been addressed.    Okay, when it comes to ICO: they had problems, postponed date.  But that's not their only problem! The problem is: - not updating information about stock exchange launch date, and further sending emails that stock market started when it is not - lack of any support (I sent 8 emails for the last 10 days for no answer!), Twitter also does not reply to the word, what more delete the posts. - lack of cooperation and clear information eg here.  In my opinion, scam, nothing more - because they are so thieves, they describe a wonderful project, collect money and move dates.

Here are some updates.   → The WCX Exchange is live. The exchange is its own system, so you have to create an account with the blue button in the top right corner instead of using your ICO account.  We're working on letting people in as quickly, and safely, as possible with new sign up slots opening every week. We expect to allow everyone to sign up some time in November, likely after the Bitcoin Segwit2x hard fork.  We have incredible new features coming up, including a whole new trading dashboard, chat, and token trading support. Check out the full product roadmap here.   → WCX sign ups have crossed 800,000 people. Every month, WCX is visited by over 2 million people, with 75% of traffic coming from non-English speaking countries.   → Presale tokens are selling out quickly. To give all participants a chance to own WCXT, we’re making a fixed quantity of WCX tokens available every day on our ICO page. Those tokens are selling out within an hour or two, and sometimes in minutes.  If you receive a “Presale tokens sold out” message when trying to purchase, more tokens may be made available at 00:00 UTC the following day.   → The ICO start date was pushed back to December 1, 2017. With the upcoming Bitcoin hard forks (Gold and Segwit2x), it's prudent and safe for everyone involved to wait until the dust settles post hard fork to guarantee transaction delivery.  You'll still be able to purchase WCXT through our presale program. WCXT Presales will remain open, with a likely minor break in acceptance around the time of the hard forks.  We expect WCX tokens to be issued and begin trading on WCX shortly after the ICO completes. WCX will be fork-agnostic and offer traders the choice to trade BTC, BTC Segwit2x, and BTC Gold, if all these chains survive.",False

Chinese holds a lot of crypto currencies and they are the biggest investor in ICOs, as we can know from the fact that before then ban, almost every ICO on chinese platform got fully funded within days, some in hours or even in minutes. Those Chinese who  holds crypto assets need a platform to speculate, now that all big Chinese exchanges like YUNBI, OKCOIN, HUOBI, CHBTC are all closed, they are looking at overseas platforms. That said, I think any new exchange wil become big easily if they pay some attention to chinese community, Chinese not only hold a lot of bitcoin, but also a big portion of popular altcoins, like OMG, QTUM, etc.  So I strongly suggest WCEX team pay some attention to chinese community, I as a supporter am ready to help. Please add QTUM, OMG and NEO trading, those three tokens are among top ten most traded currencies in terms of USD value, and they are mostly held by Asian investors. Why I think those three tokens will boost trading volum for WCEX.CO is that they have strong community(OMG is working to become decentralised paypel in south east asia.

If you look at my history you will see that in my first post I worked out the math of how many tokens would be issued, before any official word was given. I also told everyone I had made contact with the escrow and confirmed his involvement. I commented ""I love the clear mission and the generous profit-sharing program."" In my second post I revealed that I had made an investment, and said, ""I too would like more details regarding the team and how they will execute their plan, but am willing to take the risk at this point in spite of sparse details."" In my third post I confirmed that the exchange was working, expressed my enthusiasm, and shared a link to their roadmap (which had not been shared).  {Regarding the WCX roadmap (https://trello.com/b/596LMpPZ/wcx-product-roadmap), it's nice to see a list of things they are working on. I could express a concern that only one person is listed for doing the work (John Reyes), but maybe he is a one-man wonder. I might mention a concern that the last logged activity is Sept 12, but if I did that you would have to come up with a new way to insult me and I don't want to tax your vocabulary.} In my 4th post I shared the email regarding refund of investment. In my 5th post I confirmed that I had received my refund. I also said, ""Although I would like more transparency regarding team members and the company overall, to this point they have done as they said they would do."" But I did start to express some concerns about the potential for success, saying ""there are a lot of unknown variables"" . . . In my 6th post I wrote to @wcxofficial, thanking them and wishing for their success, but also asking for either a multi-sig wallet or an escrow before reinvesting. However, it was not until my 7th post that I became one of your targets! My transformation into a ""useless troll"" was when I said, ""What I love about this project is the profit-sharing model--I think that is just brilliant! I also love that they want to become the world's leading exchange. I think with the right team they could reach this goal. But there is the Achilles's heel--we simply do not know the team! We don't know how many people are working on reaching their goals, what problems they are running into, or anything else."" So, yes, I'm very clearly trolling! I even raised it up a notch and became a ""bloody schmuck"" when I listed some potential competitors!! And for me to give responsible disclosure by listing which of these companies I did or did not have a stake in, I became a shill as well. You, on the other hand, have not disclosed your financial incentives that could affect your judgment. I can only assume you have a large stake in WCX; otherwise why spend so much energy knocking down anyone who presents a concern?  By the way, to my knowledge I do not have an alter-ego who publishes under the name of @benjismarket--but for me to deny any connection to him probably just makes me more suspicious. Besides, (s)he does seem to understand rational argumentation so there could in fact be a connection between us. Here is another intriguing possibility: Have you considered that @benjismarket and @wcxofficial could be one and the same?? They both are starting exchanges, they are both anonymous, they are both trying to address the problems with existing exchanges and promising better user experience, . . . if they are not the same person, then one should hire the other and work together rather than compete!

And I don't know who this ""everybody"" is that you're referring to. Only people I've seen call scam are on this topic. Everywhere else I look, Twitter, Steemit, etc., people are pretty pumped up about the project.  There are no signs of scam behavior - the only thing some people are iffy about is that the team IDs are not yet released, but WCX have addressed this many times and most recently on Twitter:  Security is our top priority for the exchange. Our directors are custodians of customer funds and it's important ... ... to disclose their identities to the public responsibly without putting client funds or their personal safety at risk.   Other reasons WCX is 100% legitimate:  1/ I'm pretty sure if they actually were trying to scam people they would have created a few fake LinkedIn profiles like all scam ICOs do. Aka there is absolutely no reason to ""raise suspicions"" by remaining anonymous if you're trying to scam people when it's so easy to just create a few fake or hyper pumped LinkedIn profiles.  2/ Already has fully functioning exchange. It stuns me that some people think the exchange is just the interface UI and it's something you can ""throw together"" in an afternoon. You do understand that an exchange is almost entirely backend: orderbook matching engine, balance management, real-time data sockets, deposit/withdraw flows, integration with asset blockchains, server infrastructure, testing, security, API, etc. and that the interface UI is just a small part of that?  WCX has a fully functioning exchange on their beta with all the above features - which happens to include a web UI, yes. You can't just ""throw"" all these things together in a couple hours. Which is also why I think this project is 1000% more legitimate than any other ICO that just pumps people with empty promises.  3/ WCX has delivered and communicated on the things they promised so far. The problem is this thread is moving so quickly that new people are just jumping in and don't get a chance to read the previous pages of wcxofficial's posts. Take some time and browse back through the topic.",False

It is interesting that it has taken this long for someone from WCX to say ""WCX stands for World Cryptocurrency Exchange."" (see https://help.wcex.co/hc/en-us/community/posts/115001620352-What-is-the-relationship-between-this-site-and-Whaleclub-co). I am quite confident Petar Zivkovski, COO of Whaleclub is involved and yet his name has never been disclosed. I am not going to reveal my reasons for this assertion, so I am sure this will be denied. But my question is, why hide? HamnChess is so adamant that the explanation given for not revealing names (security of clients' money) is valid. Money managers and financial advisors around the world are known entities--this does not endanger their clients' funds, so why would the WCX founder be any different? If he holds private keys--WHY? Why not simply have his clients move their funds to a safer situation so he can work full-time on WCX?  Another very strange move was when they did away with the escrow arrangement and instead promised that refunds will be available. Umm, great, I can give my money to an unknown entity and if I am not happy they will give it back to me. What could possibly go wrong with that?? What about an escrow situation are they trying to avoid? How could no escrow possibly be better for investors?  One last point: people talk about how great the exchange is. Well, trades can be made on it, true. I was able to make a deposit and trade amongst the 3 options. In trying to withdraw, however, I have only been able to withdraw BTC, not ETH or XRP. Withdrawals were approved after I gave email confirmation, but no withdrawal actually occurred. With such low volume I don't want to sell back to BTC if I can avoid it.  I would love for WCX to rocket to success, and I would be quick to join them, but so far I am not seeing how they are set to become the world's #1 exchange. Maybe if HamnChess swears a little more and belittles a little louder then I will feel much better about this venture--after all, what good could possibly come from a rational discussion when we have the option of slandering and swearing?",False

Should I mention that Cobinhood has a page about their team? Or that the Leverj team is led by someone who is well known? You say team identity does not matter, but in my experience having a great idea is relatively easy but executing that idea is incredibly difficult. It takes a team to succeed--a very good team. I am at the point where if I see a great team with a mediocre idea I will pick them over a mediocre team with a great idea--the great team will execute well and can always pivot to bigger ideas while the mediocre team will likely self-implode. I mentioned Mingo because they were putting the team members in front of the world to talk about their philosophy, their vision, etc. I wanted to point out that it is not difficult to be more open. WCX only said that the leader needed to remain anonymous, but that is no excuse for hiding the identity of the entire team. I don't see why you are OK with their behavior. If a stranger stops me on the street and wants to sell me a great looking watch for an incredible price, it is highly unlikely I will have faith in that watch because I have no reason to trust this person. You seem to be saying, ""Look at how shiny the watch is! The identity of this man does not matter--he has a shiny watch, and if we buy it now we will be rich!""  Full disclosure: I have invested small amounts in both Cobinhood and Mingo; nothing invested in Godzillion or Leverj or Kakao. I had invested much more with WCX because I was so enamored about the possibility of sharing in profits, but have chosen to not reinvest unless I see dramatic improvements to the exchange, much greater volume, and better communication from team members (I really don't care whether or not I know their names--I do care whether or not they are responsive and accountable).",False

All tickets were created by a single person in a short period of time before launching the demo, I'm developer myself and I know in agile environments, where these kind of ticketing board should be used by a  team it would be changing very rapidly.

Good luck with them.  At this point I don't think the WCX people give a damn about any other ICO if they already raised $25MM, they are crushing 99.99% of all open ICOs already, and WCX ICO has not even began.

All about what you believe - if you don't believe, don't invest, more money for us who have!  AND it's complete crazy to me how you try to compare WCX with other ICO who are complete shit spam, like some education mingo coin or messenger, based on openness or whatever. the team directors in WCX have identities covered BECAUSE IT IS AN EXCHANGE and security is too important to mess with shit like this. sure you can reveal your team when you are making some BS messenger app nobody is gonna use, because nobody gives a shit, you will rape your investors and take their BTC/ETH anyway, become rich even before the bloody product is made - like 99% of ICOs, which are bloody scams.  I fucking don't understand how people can hesitate on WCX when WCX actually HAVE A PRODUCT AND CUSTOMERS (=$$$) BEFORE THE ICO as listed (or will have), use your brain for 2 seconds people, what the fuck are you doing investing in shit ICOs like some mingo coin based on just promises?? They give you a few linkedin profiles, some may be fake, and tell you they'll have a trillion customers and what you give them your money?? Can you list an ICO from last year which actually succeeded and has a bloody product or app many people are using today?? AGAIN use your bloody brain!! Many of these ICOs don't have a business model, let alone a clear one!! WCX business model is fucking straight: exchange fees.

If they can just make a GOOD pure crypto exchange that's open internationally, then it's gold... none out there.  WCX fees are much lower than what already exists. Comparing WCX 0.1% net fee (both sides of the trades) to Poloniex 0.4% and Bittrex 0.5%, that's 4x and 5x lower respectively. And they're likely to attract good liquidity because makers are paid to place trades on the book. Which in turn attracts retail traders.  And the downside is pretty limited. No exchange I know has failed unless caused by external factor such as a hack. Which comes back to their point of ""security is their top priority"" which makes sense to focus on that since it's a big factor.  Basically the project is a slam dunk if they can pull it off.",False

We've had a spike in new account creation and support requests over the past week or so and have been dealing with those. As we scale our team we'll be more prepared to deal with those as well as remain active here.  Here are some updates:  → Presales minimum is now $100, down from $25,000, making WCXT available for purchase to more people. We've been making available for sale a fixed and limited amount of WCXT on a daily basis. This prevents all WCXT from being sold out in a day. If you get a ""Tokens Sold Out"" message, more WCXT may become available at 00:00 UTC the following day so you can try then.  We also added more bonus options for presale purchases, including for purchases under $10K. Bonuses are proportional to the amount of tokens bought, in percent terms.  We will not be using escrow services for the presale. Instead we're going one step further and offering full refunds on any WCXT purchase you make from now till the ICO ends October 12, 2017. Refunds are available for any WCXT you've purchased in the past, too. For refunds, email hello@wcex.co.  This refund policy achieves two things:  - WCXT supply is tight and demand is high. Refunds allow us to get WCXT into the hands of people who are committed to the project, while weeding out less committed purchasers. This results in increased engagement from WCX's participant base, which is vital to the future success of the exchange.  - Zero risk for early participants. You get a chance to see how things play out while ensuring you get your hands on WCXT before they sell out, if you want to. WCXT purchases are hence akin to (free) options that can be annulled at any time before the end of the ICO, or exercised post-ICO.   → WCX sign ups have exceeded 500,000 users. We were skeptical of this figure too, so we dug through our email list to check the viability of all these accounts. Worth noting that this number is the number of verified users, meaning users who signed up, resolved the CAPTCHA, and clicked the verification link we sent to their inbox. New sign ups are also limited to 1 per IP, so if an IP is already in our database, it's blocked from creating a new account.  Our audit revealed that there are indeed a number of likely spam registrations -- estimated at around ~18% of the total base, which comes down to ~92K likely spam registrations currently. An email was tagged as spam if it used a likely spam domain name extension (.tk, .biz, etc.), was likely duplicate of another email in our base, was registered through a known spam site as its referrer (such as pay-to-click or micro-task sites), or triggered a fraud or security warning with our application security partners at sqreen.io.  CloudFlare stats for the wcex.co domain:  Unique visitors past 30 days: 1,180,219 ~70% of traffic coming from non-English-speaking countries.     → WCX Beta trading volume is rocketing. We've paused new invitations to the Beta for now and will re-enable them in about 7 days. We're heads down working on substantial front-end updates as well as new, modern, and highly performant backend infrastructure that will allow WCX to scale to millions of users and thousands of cryptocurrency markets -- while still delivering a seamless experience to all customers.   → This was announced previously, and worth repeating here: the ICO start date was pushed back to October 31, 2017. This new date gives everyone a chance to use the exchange (planned to launch on Oct 10) and then decide whether or not to participate in the ICO.   → If you've contacted us and have not yet received an answer, please do not send the same message again. We promise, we've got you covered -- we're working through our support queue and will get to you ASAP.",False

I do appreciate the refund you provided, and I have held that money aside in case I decide to reinvest. I do wish you would go with an escrow service since a 3rd party is a nice safety feature. If not escrow, how about a multi-sig wallet? It's nice to trust people, but in crypto we strive for trustless systems, do we not? In a worst-case scenario where I decided I wanted a refund, I really am not in any position to get that refund if you refuse. You could take down your website, disappear, and I would have no recourse (I would not even know who to try to go after). If, instead, you had a multi-sig wallet I could deposit into and wait to sign until end of ICO then I would feel I had some protection.  To be clear, I really want this project to succeed--for purely selfish reasons! Not only would I like a better exchange than anything else out there (you are not there yet), but I would love to have a stable and growing monthly payout in a mix of cryptocurrencies. I love the option of being able to seek a refund all the way until the end of the ICO if you can make it ""set in stone"" in some manner. By the end of the ICO we should have some real numbers of transactions/day and get a sense of how much we may earn on returns each month. If I had some sort of safeguard in place (escrow or multi-sig wallet or ??) then I would reinvest right away. Without that I am quite hesitant, having lost money before to people who had given every reassurance that my money would be safe with them.",False

Seeing you don't have proof you invested into this, and still claim not to work for wcex, maybe you're the fake account makers? Nice job guys!  A tu quoque and two unsubstantiated claims.

Your posts have been solely that on this thread. Thank you.  Stop making newbie accounts to contend against the truth #wcexundercover  :-). My posts have been providing more information than the ""wcex"" people will give anyone. Not my fault wcex/your project is full of issues. Literally nothing good to talk about this project, yet ... So if you would provide anything that isn't negative, would be glad to point it out.  If by ""providing more information"" you mean regurgitating the complaints of several other posters (legitimate and otherwise), deflecting and in, in all but one case, failing to back your numerous claims, flinging poop while marketing your so-called competitor and offering almost entirely fallacious rebuttals as a response then sure, you've been providing ""information"".

""Do you have a refund address we can use to send you the: X.XXX BTC""  We.  We are sending the btc.   Not 'the escrow manager'.    Perhaps 'we' means we and the escrow manager.

BUT WHY WITH REAL MONEY?? They are asking people to try a buggy platform with real money. Greedy, they could have at least made it paper trading first.  The bugs are not my issue, bugs are expected. Apparently, no one here is a developer? Literally looks like the platform was made overnight, so most likely untested. I say this cause anyone could have found the holes that I did in just a few minutes. It's great they keep getting patched after I mention them, but makes me wonder why things were coded and set-up the way they were in the first place. They should fire their developers and hire someone better before letting people risk their $ on a beta.  Dev 2 dev, on a scale of 1-10, how easy is it to build a quick secure and encrypted beta sign-up system? One that emails unique sign up links to a list of 5000 users listed in your database as a beta tester. Then the links take users to a page that verifies the unique code is part of the beta and then displays a sign-up form asking for a password. I give it a 1 for easy.  How hard is it to build a secure crypto exchange? I give it a 15, as super difficult.  Maybe it makes sense now what the big issue is. WCEX is supposed to have dev's from Apple, and IBM. So everyone here will ignore the fact that they can't build a very very simple beta test set-up, but can somehow magically build a super secure exchange? Gotcha. Good luck on that.  Hopefully, they will hire someone with actual skills and fix their stuff. Hate to see people lose $ because wcex decided to use newbie developers.    Anyways, let's wait for the ""admin"" to say the beta is ""open"" officially to see if issues are fixed completely. Feel like I keep saying that. Let's wait to see...",False

For all those doubters, PM me, I will give you my fake email and password so you can log-in to the demo. Will even tell you how to sign up for yourself.  Suppose, even if it's true, then what? It's just a demo version, a raw beta test. If you hacked their admin for example or something like that - it would be a different conversation. The current ""vulnerability"" even if it is - does not give any efficiency, in addition to registering an account and touching - look at the test product? Hmm.  I understand that you are trying to smear a competitive product by advertising your project and your ICO through subscription and profile information.  Yes, a beta, but they are running an untested, probably very buggy ""real"" exchange. Real money! They can't even make a simple closed beta program. I just don't see how that is ok to people. Guess you don't have any $$ on the line or demo access.  Seriously though, PM me, will give you access so you can see I'm not making crap up.  But there was no announcement that the invites were sent or the work of the beta version is stable? Then what is the boiling point? Do you prufayte raw product, when all this is well understood and even the official representatives said that they finish it?  I do not understand what you are trying to prove? That your product is better and that people are coming to you or what?  People are asking to see their demo. Their demo is clearly open. I can show you how to access it. What happened to wanting transparency.  The moment you shilled your ""competitor"" product in this thread right after a smear campaign was the moment it became glaringly obvious that transparency is the last thing on your mind.",False

Vapid speculation is what you offered and exactly the type of speculation that this thread is filled with. There are legit complaints here and there from a few posters but they're outnumbered by the (usually) 1 - 3 ""SCAM!!!"" posts by once dormant Newbie accounts.  Quote All the numbers are just typical rough statistics. Think about it. Right now, numbers are showing over 800K visitors to their site. Without the Pareto principle, just think about. How many page views are repeat users? How many times have you visited wcex.co... ? 1,5, 20 times?  It's easy to say, there are 3 reasons to explain their 356k sign-ups.  Completely fake, random counter Real sign-ups, just multiple accounts per person, OR, people sign up and then do nothing All real, one account per visitor, no one goes and visits the site more than 3 times in the last two months.  Which one seems feasible ...  4. Mostly real.  The ""Duh?"" option.  Quote Evidence free because it's just statistics.  No, evidence-free because you either don't have any evidence or won't provide it. But it doesn't matter to you as muddying the waters is enough for your marketing ploy.  Quote Everything is hypothetical and evidence free because wcex team doesn't respond to inquiries. The ""Awesome Customer Support team"" statement is bs. Makes you wonder what else is.  Or your claims that you've contacted them/not received a response is. Perhaps they felt your inquiry didn't deserve a response, I can definitely see that happening. I haven't contacted them so who knows. Bittrex took > 3 days to answer my inquiry, same with Binance and LBC but this is hardly indicative of every person's experience.  Quote As for ""less fees = less services provided"".  Not sure how that doesn't make sense. Lesser fees mean lower income for the exchange. Lower income, fewer services they can provide because they will have to cut expenses.  Someone should call GDAX then.  Quote I mentioned my reasoning for not trusting wcex, you, didn't mention any reason TO trust wcex and I was being transparent so people know I am a little bias, instead of having someone go and point out  You flung poop, those aren't reasons. I couldn't care less about giving you a reason to trust them especially after your last two ad posts.  Quote It doesn't matter to me, our platform isn't in the same competitive space as we have a product, everyone will get to demo it, everyone gets our coins at the same price and everyone gets to control where their money is spent.  Riiight. Yours is legit, theirs isn't. Cool story.  Quote But hey, let's see what happens. 10.10 or tomorrow. Was suppose to see their demo tomorrow, right?  You didn't think about that before your marketing? Oh wait...",False

Ok, am working on putting together information right now. Also, real funny. I just signed up for 3 new accounts. It's call VPN. Even can use just a cell phone.  Economics, sure. Lower fees, but then you HAVE to get more volume. Volume isn't just magically going to appear, to get more volume, you HAVE to give a reason for more people. Ok, lower fees is a start but it won't help for long. GDAX has ZERO fees for limit orders, why don't they process billions per day? There is also a point at which revenue will cross below expenses because volume will top out. Im glad you think volume is an unlimited supply. It's more complex than lower fees = more volume.",False

From the calculator on their website, if you say you hold 250,000 coins and you set daily volume = $1B, then your monthly payout is $1,500. $1B/day in volume, with a fee of 0.1% yields fees of $1,000,000/day * 30 days/month = $30 million/month in profits 20% of $30m = $6 million/month to be shared with token holders $1,500/$6,000,000 = 0.00025. That proportion of money is based on my proportion of coins. Hence, 250,000 coins/.00025 = 1,000,000,000 coins total  So the calculator is running on an assumption of 1 billion coins, which would let them raise about $100,000,000 (not that much due to bonuses, coin retention, etc).  Although I too would like more information, I did receive confirmation from Fran Strajnar that he is indeed acting as escrow. His involvement adds a lot of legitimacy to what they are doing and was enough to keep me interested.

So that could cut the number of coins down to some number.  Unless they have a set number of coins and sell out.  Either they have a set number of coins and will 100% sure sell out, or they end up with less coins and the proposed monthly payouts are off, or they sell more than a billion coins, and again the math is off.  I'm no math whizz, but those proposed payouts pre volume level are just guesses unless they've planned a small number of coins that will for sure sell out.

My account is still working and its not banned but i wonder why are those people getting that message? I have only posted my ref link on a single forum once. So why is this happening to some of the people that i referred? Here is my ref link please review my account and fix it if it has any problems - https://wcex.co/?ref=caHsaug ( I dont wanna share my email publicly thats why i gave you my ref link. but if you want i can pm you y email)  This message is displayed when your link is used by people coming from sites considered as spam, such as link harvesters, or pay-to-click sites. This doesn't affect your account as a referrer, it simply disallows referred users from signing up.

This is the second scam I have stumbled upon in less than a week and I'm not even searching for them. When I heard of this ICO I was so pumped because this is exactly what I would love to buy into, and also something I understand, because I have used a lot of exchanges, and most of them have a lot to improve imo. So I did my due diligence, or so I thought. I was about to push the button and send a huge amount to the address I was given because I feared I would lose the spot. I'm glad I was able to step back from it and convince myself to sleep over it. The next day I realised that I hadn't done ANY due diligence, because there was nothing to check and judge. There's no tangible information whatsoever. I've spent more time researching it and at some point I couldn't pretend anymore that it was legit. At least, I don't think so. I'm not happy about it, because if their calculations were right, the amount I was about to invest would have given me enough passive income for a long time, if not for the rest of my life.

You can keep your WCXT.  2. This is still under discussion.  Quote from: Leonid SI on August 16, 2017, 10:33:52 PM Hi everybody. May somebody explain me what is the bonus for testers of ""WCX Beta Program""?  These will be revealed along with which people were selected a few days before the exchange Beta launches (Sep 1).  Quote from: gintrux on August 16, 2017, 10:51:38 PM 1. There is a way to purchase WCXT tokens anonymously. Will there be a way to transfer those tokens to my other anonymous ethereum wallet anonymously after ICO?  2. Will WCX allow exchanging fiat <-> crypto or is it only btc <-> altcoin?  3. Will rewards from referrals be diluted in future? I read some replies, seems like users got diluted even for already-invited users. It seems some time ago it was 200/referred user, but then after you made it 100 or 50, everyone got diluted to the new amount per referral  1. You can purchase WCXT with cryptocurrency. WCXT are transferable just like any other ERC20 token once they are issued.  2. WCX is digital currency only. Fiat integration is planned for 2018.  3. No dilution. Amount per referral is conserved.   Quote from: rainbow169 on August 16, 2017, 10:51:52 PM Why is there no white paper and details about the team? Privacy?

This has been explained a million times in the replies in this thread. If you don't want to invest in the pre-sale you can simply wait till the exchange launches before the ICO then decide.  As far as legitimacy, and as far as I've been dealing with the WCX team and pretty much everyone on this thread, they have delivered on all their promises so far. They are following their business timeline and the dates have been announced for beta, ICO, launch etc. so it's fair I think to let them do it.  I think the thinking behind the Presale is you take on a little more risk and get large bonuses. By the time the exchange launches all the information will be public and I *personally* believe buying WCXT will be a no-brainer.",False

I mean really i don't want to be an asshole but it is like you people put 0 brain power into thinking these things though.  Most ICOs have no problem revealing their team because the crypto they hold is theirs, if they lose it it is their own fault.

I see you are already identifying yourself with these people, feeling threatened whenever someone asks serious questions. Same goes for you, polka. I've read everything as you suggested, and they explain NOTHING.  So for everybody else who thinks about pre-ordering. There is no need to keep the team a secret just to secure the private keys. If you are doing serious business, you will find better ways to keep them secure than not saying ANYTHING about your team. It's a stupid argument and smells fishy. And to argue ""this is crypto"" and the keys could easily be stolen is just stupid. BECAUSE this is crypto, a single person doesn't matter at all for the funds. If they are serious about security, they will do multisig anyways.  The whitepaper is a joke, it has nothing to do with what most crypto projects consider a whitepaper. It's just marketing speak, more like a flyer, not even a small business plan. They won't tell you anything, not even the name of the company. There is NO ESCROW whatsoever, which means if they run with the money, it's gone. And you won't be able to complain to anyone other than some anonymous nicknames on this forum.  The bitcointalk forum used to be very sceptical, but it seems as soon as someone opens their digital purse, the greed takes over and people stop questioning the most basic things.

It's not about 1 person fool even if they are the entire team, if they get to 1 person they can get to the rest. Plus multisig has almost zero provable advantage over hot / cold structure, just ask bitfinex who got hacked for $200MM they were using multisig.  There is no reason to reveal team member identities. It only serves to put customer funds at risk. It doesn't even increase trust or security. Look at bitfinex their team is ""supposedly"" known identities, they got hacked like dogs for hundreds of $MM. It's just foolish from security perspective to reveal the private holder identity.

Here are a few updates from the past couple of days.  → WCX just launched its ICO Presale, where you can purchase WCXT with a 15% bonus using BTC, ETH, LTC, DASH, and USDT. The current minimum purchase is 250,000 WCXT and this minimum is reduced every week until the Presale tokens are sold out.  → The referral program is back! And better than ever. For every friend you refer, you get 50 WCXT + 5% of the WCXT they buy, and they get an extra 15% bonus when they buy WCXT. You can get your referral link by signing up on WCX.  → The new translation project for the ICO Presale site is up on POEditor. You can join our translator community here.  → WCX Slack just launched. Slack channel will be relaunched with the Beta on Sep 1.   ---     Please reach out to hello@wcex.co for assistance.  Quote from: SL HE on August 16, 2017, 12:05:26 PM Referral links is not working   Instead of https://_wcex.co/?ref=bla_bla_bla my browser converts this string to https://_wcex.co/?ref=bla_bla_bla?ref=bla_bla_bla in address bar, as it was when the referral program was turned off. Tell me please when refferral links they will be working? Thanks.  This should be fixed.  Quote from: gintrux on August 16, 2017, 12:51:38 PM 1. I read on your website If your WCX tokens are held outside of WCX itself, you'll be able to provide an ETH address on your account that we'll monitor when making payments to you. tell me more how can the tokens be transferred from one wallet to another, or e.g. from wcx wallet to my own custom wallet.  2. Is there a way to transfer WCXT tokens to another wallet without going through the exchange?  3. When someone signs up through my referral link, do they also get 50 WCXT?  4. Is there a way to get monthly payment in bitcoins only? E.g. some coins that you collect fees on might be going down, so by the time monthly payment time comes, they might lose most of the value. It would be great if there was a way to auto-exchange them to bitcoin at the time they are collected as a fee. Or when some fee balance of that coin gets reached.  1. WCXT are ERC20 tokens so they can be held in any Ethereum wallet.  2. At the end of the ICO, you can transfer the WCXT from your WCX account directly to another wallet without needing to use the exchange.  3. Yes as long as they verify their email.  4. This is an interesting idea that has not yet been implemented. Payments to you are made in the digital currencies WCX collects as fees. So for example if at the end of the month WCX fees are 40% in BTC, 30% in ETH, 15% in LTC, and 15% in XRP, you will be paid in those proportions as well.",False

However, most positions we're hiring for are distributed around the world, particularly customer support. WCX is a truly global exchange - our focus is international. This can already be seen by the translation effort: the site and whitepaper are available in 3 dozen languages, there are a dozen or so local threads on BTalk, and WCX will be available in 20 languages on launch. Most traffic to the WCX site is from non-English speaking countries.  Concerning job openings, we'll have more information on this by next week.

Quote from: gintrux on August 10, 2017, 09:54:18 PM Few more questions:  1. What exchanges will accept WCXT on 10.10.17, when everything launches? Any deals made already? 2. If referral system will be available only next week, how long will it be available? I mean until what date will it get turned off? ICO date?  1. WCXT will be traded on WCX after launch. We may list on other exchanges as well but no deal is currently sealed.  2. Likely till the end of the ICO. However this will depend on the amount of demand we see - we don't want to dilute WCXT since the dedicated marketing budget is 5% of all tokens.

We don't have a price target - this is not something we set. However a basic cash flow analysis should make WCX price projections fairly straightforward because the main utility of WCXT is a tracker of WCX's profit, e.g. the more volume is expected on WCX the higher the price of WCXT.  The coin cap will likely remain hidden. Burned tokens apply to everyone equally, not just the public tokens.

By the level of the office environment, you can already say a lot. On our forum I have already met serious concerns for security and if the developers are serious they are posting a video of the working environment, on which it is already possible to draw a conclusion about the seriousness of the developers, our claim is that they worked for Apple, Deutsche Bank and IBM and Wall Street veterans. So the office is obviously expensive and built according to a certain concept of work (I can explain in a personal message). This will make a preliminary conclusion about the seriousness of the developers.",False

You'll be able to trade these tokens on the exchange.   ---   Updates  → The whitepaper is now available in 21 languages!  → We've almost filled our 5,000 spots for the WCX Beta Program. If you'd like early access to WCX and still haven't signed up, you can do so here.  → Pre-ICO commitments have reached $5.5M. If you're planning to buy over 250,000 WCXT you can get a 15% discount by buying pre-ICO. Availability is limited. You can use this form to sign up. Pre-ICO payments are escrowed and funds are released upon product delivery.   ---   Also important to keep in mind since we're seeing some replies in this thread that seem incognizant of this:  The WCX exchange will be up and running before the ICO.  This means you'll be able to try WCX, full featured, and then choose whether or not to participate in the ICO. This eliminates product delivery risk.

How did that help all the people who had money on Mt Gox? All the owners were known and the exchange went under and bankrupt and people lost money.  How did that help Bitfinex when they got hacked for $200M? Again all the owners were known.  There's not much upside to revealing who holds the private keys, it's mostly all downside. This is understandable from security perspective (I work in bank IT security). I think it's very smart decision to keep it hidden if they decide to do so.  Sure let them reveal some team members but don't make public known to everyone who holds the private keys, that would be fucking stupid. Look at poloniex they are largest crypto exchange by volume and owners are not known!! And not one single security breach. It's a smart choice.  Second, as you trade on ANY exchange, don't keep funds there all the time, this is just common sense. It's not a wallet. you deposit, you trade, you withdraw. very low risk in this case and knowing private key holders makes very little difference.  Third, WCX is compliant according to whitepaper. That is easily verifiable when they launch and which countries they serve. That means due diligence, etc. has been made by many parties, perhaps even governments, vendors, etc. and owners were revealed to them. They are just not publicizing - again, smart decision I think.  Quote from: sud on August 05, 2017, 07:54:45 PM Where are they holding those priv keys? In their pockets? And someone will track and rob them? Lets be real please...  I just hope the devs will disclose the team before ICO starts like they promised.  Doesn't have to be in pocket, can be anywhere as long as location is known and that would make it a real risk. Also they will need access to cold storage from time to time to refill hot wallets I presume like every other exchange. So it's not gonna be in a mountain vault somewhere.

It would indeed be fucking stupid. Yes Poloniex owners and leadership etc are not known, in fact nobody at Poloniex is known. I'm not saying WCX has to not reveal anyone, they can reveal parts of their team with no access to customer funds as I said in previous post...  BUT that needs to be controlled as well because bad actors with knowledge of team/residences of team members can use those to get to private key holders, which again puts customer funds in danger.

Your math is wrong.   $250 million = 250millionx10 tokens (because $1=10 tokens).  2.  But let's go with it.  In general that math logic only works if the 8% and 5%  (really just the 8%)is based off the amount sold.  But It's not, it's (I'm 99% sure) based of the 'hidden cap', which could be 100 billion coins, or 10 billion, or 200 million, or...  Let's say the hidden cap is 10billion.  8% of that is 800 million.   Then if they sell 25 million tokens and burn the rest, that leaves 25mil in the hands of investors and 800 million in the hands of the team and advisors.

It makes total sense to withhold some names, especially names of people who have access to private keys. In BTC/crypto is like having access to cash, so you can be target for kidnapping, theft, etc. That means revealing these IDs puts the WCX client funds at risk and also the safety of their staff. Many now in crypto who have revealed their identity are living with bodyguards 24/7 (coinbase, bitstamp CEOs, etc.) A billion dollar traditional CEO doesn't have to worry about that, their cash, company cash, etc. is held in bank. That being said they said they will reveal some name people, hopefully some with no access to private keys.  And concerning WCXT value seems very simple to me, it will go up when more volume on exchange, and down with less, because its fully correlated it pays out by based on volume, 20% of fee which is directly correlated to amount of volume on exchange.

Whitepaper is expected to be released tomorrow. It'll contain more information about WCX, its competitive advantages, and why we're going after this market. It'll also have more details about the ICO and WCX token distribution.  WCX will have a fully functional product that you can use, before the ICO. So if you're planning on participating in the token sale, you'll know what you're getting into. This is in contrast to almost all ICOs who generally decide to raise money first and sell the promise of a product down the line.",False

The policy is not equivalent of holding a finite number of shares in a limited liability company. Nor does it mimic the bond bearer instrument. (am confused)  d.

Same page №42 ""No, you won't receive a notification. Unfortunately notifying spam accounts will result in them changing up their tactics, which leads to more spam, which is counter-effective."" In connection with the above, there was a question from Joking313 ""Ok, is there a way though that i can verify to make sure that i haven't been flagged for spam, because i have gotten a good amount of referrals and i just want to make sure i wasn't accidentally flagged or that someone didn't misuse my link."" Answer wcxofficial ""Yes! You can reach out to hello@wcex.co and they can check that for you.""  I became interested in this because at the moment I had 531 friends from whom I personally know about 420-460 (where I wrote a comment where I told in detail whom I invited), the rest is via social networks, etc. I wrote a letter hello@wcex.co. Answer - Hello, I don't have that information right now. It will be available at the end before the ICO. Best regards, Paul Kaplan Customer Support, WCX   So I want to know a few things: 1) On what basis will the team block accounts? (The technical side is described in detail), I am not satisfied with the statement that it is secret (describe in general terms, but in detail); 2) Why do different responses from company officials - wcxofficial (11% of unacknowledged letters for spam), hello@wcex.co (It is not possible to check for spam to the end); 3) It looks unfair for me - I have 531 friends, of which I can confirm about 460 (more precisely, they can do it themselves), if in the remaining 71 registered spam are found (just some kind of idiot spammed my link) then why will you block the account Immediately - i.e. Legally it is possible to confirm the overwhelming majority (that everything is honest), but what percentage of those registered can be generally spammed by a bad person whom I do not know and nobody knows (just a spammer on the network); 4) Why can not I check my account now? I because of the team's response about the impossibility of verification because of the uncertainty I will not invite anyone else (I wanted to pay through the official channels in social networks for advertising - there were about 1,000 friends left until the end). 5) Notifications are required before blocking - and if I want to challenge the lock, for example the situation as described above - though 460 people can send their photos and confirm their identity ... Now in my opinion it looks disgusting - the team does not notify about the blocking, does not say the verification technology (just that it is ""unique""), the official response from the team of 2 different - on verification, impossibility of verification before the end (WTF), justify why it is not possible, nothing Prevents the team before the ICO to say to large accounts (with a large number of invited), then they are blocked without explaining anything ... How much I love this project, but all together looks like a fraud. I'm waiting for detailed, well-informed explanations from the official team!",False

As long as your referrals aren't from pay-to-click sites, task workers, automation, etc. you're fine.  2) 11% of emails are unverified. That does not necessarily mean they are spam, we were just putting that figure out there. Some of those could be spam. Vice versa, some of the verified emails can be spam too. We won't notify spam accounts because that would cause them to change their spam tactics which would be counter-productive.  3) Spam is not the same as unverified. Unverified simply means the person did not yet click on the verification email link.  4) As a referrer, you're fine. If your link is shared through spam methods as described in the site footer, the people that are referred through those methods are tagged. Your account is not.

You'll need more.  A lot more.  The big complaint vs. exchanges is slow/crappy customer service.  I hope the whitepaper lays out how you're going to overhire so you'll be more than ready for awesome and fast customer service during growth.   5. This information will be released over time. Since this is a private key based business, it may be wise to keep some identities anonymous in the interest of security of customer funds and member personal safety.  I'll await the whitepaper.  Not naming names is a credibility killer.    6. The market is currently around $3B per day in trading volume. Forex for example is $5T per day. That's a 1000x opportunity for growth. We think we're just getting started.  Forex isn't comparable, I'm a little concerned you're using that as a basis for growth/volume predictions/expectations.  I'll wait for the whitepaper and hope it lays out how you're going to beat the other active exchanges and grow larger than the current #1 volume exchange.

As others have said, dimensioning a crypto currency platform to be capable of handling millions of transactions a second is a huge undertaking.  I have questions on this.  WCX will be trading BITCOIN, ETHERIUM and mostr other popular blockchain currencies.  Now, BITCOIN has some serious dimensioning problems in its own right.  The transaction history is never archived, so every BITCOIN gets bigger and bigger and slower and slower.  The press have reported backlogs in BITCOIN transactions amounting to more than 165,000 transactions with no confirmation, and it is growing, not getting less!  http://www.newsbtc.com/2017/05/12/bitcoin-network-backlog-grows-165000-unconfirmed-transactions/  My question are these:  when BITCOIN transactions are made on WCX, who will confirm the transaction and process the BITCOIN chain?  Will this be done by the WCX platform itself, or will the BITCOIN that are traded by WCX just join the ever growing global queue (and growing backlog) to be processed by a distributed server somewhere else?  And if WCX servers will be able to process the BITCOIN transactions directly, then is it possible that the WCX platform could also be used to process and reduce the global backlog?  And if so, how will WCX earn money by doing the work of other traders for them?  Thanks a lot, RobZorba",False

Meaning, the Nascaq doing $110B/day has ZERO relevence to WCEX's ability to do $1/day volume.  That Nasdaq does $100B/day in now way means that WCEX can grow to any particular amount.  I will look to the white paper and hope to see the plan/roadmap, and hope not to see ""WCEX will grow to $2B/day volume because tons of people trade in the stock market every day.""  That is not a valid justification for growth.

However, since 2013 (I think) US authorities (not SEC but something similar, sorry I can't remember exact governing body name) set certain rules that most crypto exchanges are obliging to, one of them is ID verification. If you study charges pressed against Mr. Vinnik this one comes first - running an unauthorised monetary exchange. I read an extensive article on the subject yesterday in my news feed and it was basically saying that if you provide ANY exchange services to US citizens you're obliged to comply with their rules, otherwise you might as well end up being arrested. Sure we can keep saying that digital currencies aren't money etc etc but it looks like this doesn't fly anymore in the eyes of US authorities (which are well known for trying to confiscate everything they can't control). So my question is - how are you guys planning to deal with the legal side of things from this point of view? Not revealing founders names (just an example) won't fly at ICO, going this way you'll end up in gray/black markets, not as an established 100% legal exchange.",False

That being said, WCX will comply will all laws and regulations of the jurisdictions that it serves, and in jurisdictions where those regulations are not entirely clear (digital currency regulation is still a work in progress in many part of the world), we'll proactively reach out for guidance. That may indeed mean refusing to serve or imposing trading limits for customers in certain jurisdictions.  In short, WCX is a fully ethical and compliant exchange. If you're planning on using WCX for money laundering, tax evasion, or any other sort of illegal activity, you're gonna have a bad time.  Also to keep in mind that if you're planning on using fiat later in 2018 when that integration is planned to go live, KYC will be required regardless of the jurisdiction you reside in.",False

Correct.  2. Crypto will be anonymous. Fiat integration which is happening in 2018 will require KYC from customers if they want to deposit or withdraw fiat from/to a bank.  The regulatory landscape for digital currencies is still evolving. WCX will comply with all regulations that have been set out clearly. And we'll proactively reach out to jurisdictions where regulation is not clear, for guidance.  In short, WCX is an honest, ethical trading platform. If you try to use us for money laundering, tax evasion, or any other potentially criminal activity, you're gonna have a bad time.  3. We're studying this since it's a recent development. WCX is global and has attracted demand from 177 countries based on the sign ups we've received so far at wcex.co.  4. Our value proposition is: Tiny Fees + Incredible Service. We have great customer support reps and we're actually hiring more - we have around 30 positions open across many different languages. If you're interested, skilled, and have customer support experience, please drop us a line hello@wcex.co.  5. This information will be released over time. Since this is a private key based business, it may be wise to keep some identities anonymous in the interest of security of customer funds and member personal safety.  6. The market is currently around $3B per day in trading volume. Forex for example is $5T per day. That's a 1000x opportunity for growth. We think we're just getting started.  7. WCX Tokens symbol will be WCT when it hits exchanges, so no confusion there.  8. There is a hard cap on WCX tokens. Details are TBD.",False

WCX will have an incredible, dedicated team that will scale over time based on customer demand.",False

Please keep in mind the rules to sign up and receive your tokens:  - you're using a real email, and not using a disposable email service to register  - you're not double registering with the same IP  - you're not signing up through a spam referrer, e.g. through advertising software, ad viewing sites, automation, automated clicks, scripting, etc.  These are spam prevention measures. There are likely more than a few spammers, duplicates, disposable emails, etc. who have signed up over the last few days to take advantage of the free tokens. We'll be working on identifying and disabling them over the next few days.

We're so excited about WCX and can't wait to bring it to you.   The best way to stay in the loop on our progress, timelines, ICO, launch, and more, is to:  > Register at https://wcex.co;  > Follow WCX on Twitter;  > Follow this thread.        Hey Glory90. Sorry to hear about the verification email. Please contact hello@wcex.co (using the email you used to sign up) for assistance.  Regarding withdrawals, there will be no time delays.

Quote from: DaCash on July 26, 2017, 11:47:44 AM Can you confirm that payouts will be in different currencies directly to WCX wallets for every participant, without any conversion thru ETH? I stayed away from other exchange ICO because of exactly that - payouts going via ETH. Also what is the payout scheme - daily, or smth like quarterly mimicking typical divident schemes? Thanks!  That's correct. Payouts will be made to your WCX wallet in all the types of digital currencies WCX supports. There is no conversion through ETH.  Payouts will be made on a weekly basis. More information about WCX tokens is available in our original post and on WCX.

Got to study the answers in order not to ask the same over and over again.       Quote from: wcxofficial on July 25, 2017, 02:50:43 AM Thanks again for your replies and questions. Please find our answers below.  (Here's a link to our previous answer wiki: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2026078.msg20340135#msg20340135)  I can't wait to read the whitepaper. When it will be available?  This will become available within the next couple of weeks. More information about the ICO fund distribution, team, etc. will also be made available.  What currencies can be used to purchase WCX tokens during the ICO?  BTC and ETH. If there's enough interest we can accommodate for other currencies as well.  Are there deposit or withdrawal limits?  No.  Will you have a chatbox?  Yes.  Is it a decentralized exchange?  No, not at first. Decentralization of user wallets is on our roadmap for 2018.  How will you compete with incumbent exchanges?  Considerably lower fees, awesome customer service, and radically better user experience.  What will happen after the ICO with unsold tokens?  Unsold tokens will be burned.  If you invite more than 250 people using the referral system at https://wcex.co, will they be counted?  Yes. There is no limit to how many people you can invite. 250 is the max shown on the progress bar, but your balance will keep increasing if you refer more.  Where will WCX tokens be traded?  They will be traded on WCX with bases BTC, ETH, and USDT.  Can we withdraw the WCX tokens from our account?  Not yet. WCX token is an ERC20 token so you'll be able to withdraw it to your Ethereum wallet.  How will the commissions be paid to WCX token holders if they're held in an Ethereum wallet?  Payments will be made to your WCX wallet. You'll be getting paid in all sorts of digital currencies, since WCX collects fees in many different digital currencies. If your WCX tokens are held outside of WCX itself, you'll be able to provide an ETH address on your account that we'll monitor when making payments to you.  Will you offer derivatives at launch time?  No. Margin trading is on the roadmap for 2018.  Please add BNT, OMG, MYST, TAAS, PLBT.  These have been added to the voting form here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdkFM1HKmTfhDeJ5Acn5hstJFi_Mcj8KIgMk7fpvOxJ2Ua5aA/viewform?usp=sf_link  Please let us know by replying in this thread if there are coins you'd like to trade that are not listed on the voting form.  Do WCX tokens give me voting rights concerning decisions made for the exchange?  Decisions on which coins and markets to add next will be made based on public interest and voting.  Will the ICO announcement such as date and so on be posted on this thread, or will it be on another thread on the ANN subforum?  We'll notify users on this thread, Twitter, and through email if you registered at https://wcex.co.  If a friend of mine invites another friend, will I benefit?  No. You'll get credited for the first level of friends you invite (not multi-level).     Quote from: wcxofficial on July 25, 2017, 11:44:34 PM Thanks again for your replies and questions. Please see our answers below.  Our previous answer wikis, where we answer frequently asked questions, are available here:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2026078.msg20340135#msg20340135 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2026078.msg20362180#msg20362180   How long will the referral program be active for?  It'll likely be active till the Beta launch in early September. The rewards will decrease over time. The sign up bonus promotion is likely to decrease from 100 WCX to 50 WCX in the next 24 hours, and the referrals will decrease from 200 WCX to 100 WCX per friend.  Added QTUM, WINGS, STORJ, MINEREUM, STEEM, ANT, BYTE, XZT, BCC to the Coin voting form.  You can find a list of coins we’re considering here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdkFM1HKmTfhDeJ5Acn5hstJFi_Mcj8KIgMk7fpvOxJ2Ua5aA/viewform. You can suggest other coins to add by replying in this thread.  How will the revenue sharing process work with WCX tokens?  Payments will be made to your WCX wallet. You'll be getting paid in all sorts of digital currencies, since WCX collects fees in many different digital currencies. If your WCX tokens are held outside of WCX itself, you'll be able to provide an ETH address on your account that we'll monitor when making payments to you.  How does the referral system count referrals?  Referred users need to verify their email for them to count.  I'm getting an “Account already in use.” error when trying to sign up at https://wcex.co.  This means your IP has already been used. It’s one registration per IP.  Is there a minimum of WCX needed to receive revenue share payments?  Yes, although this hasn't yet been determined. It'll be low - the measure is simply taken to avoid blockchain spam.  Plans to list on other exchanges outside of WCX?  Not at this time. Liquidity to buy or sell will be available on WCX for WCX tokens at launch time.  How to participate in the Beta launch?  We'll be looking for beta users. This will be communicated in this thread, on Twitter (@wcxofficial), and by email (the one you used to register at https://wcex.co).  Will you support BCC?  We'll support all coins with enough interest from the public, measured mainly through voting/polling.  Very nice to see everything answered. A good job!",False

Please see our answers below.  Our previous answer wikis, where we answer frequently asked questions, are available here:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2026078.msg20340135#msg20340135 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2026078.msg20362180#msg20362180   How long will the referral program be active for?  It'll likely be active till the Beta launch in early September. The rewards will decrease over time. The sign up bonus promotion is likely to decrease from 100 WCX to 50 WCX in the next 24 hours, and the referrals will decrease from 200 WCX to 100 WCX per friend.  Added QTUM, WINGS, STORJ, MINEREUM, STEEM, ANT, BYTE, XZT, BCC to the Coin voting form.  You can find a list of coins we’re considering here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdkFM1HKmTfhDeJ5Acn5hstJFi_Mcj8KIgMk7fpvOxJ2Ua5aA/viewform. You can suggest other coins to add by replying in this thread.  How will the revenue sharing process work with WCX tokens?  Payments will be made to your WCX wallet. You'll be getting paid in all sorts of digital currencies, since WCX collects fees in many different digital currencies. If your WCX tokens are held outside of WCX itself, you'll be able to provide an ETH address on your account that we'll monitor when making payments to you.  How does the referral system count referrals?  Referred users need to verify their email for them to count.  I'm getting an “Account already in use.” error when trying to sign up at https://wcex.co.  This means your IP has already been used. It’s one registration per IP.  Is there a minimum of WCX needed to receive revenue share payments?  Yes, although this hasn't yet been determined. It'll be low - the measure is simply taken to avoid blockchain spam.  Plans to list on other exchanges outside of WCX?  Not at this time. Liquidity to buy or sell will be available on WCX for WCX tokens at launch time.  How to participate in the Beta launch?  We'll be looking for beta users. This will be communicated in this thread, on Twitter (@wcxofficial), and by email (the one you used to register at https://wcex.co).  Will you support BCC?  We'll support all coins with enough interest from the public, measured mainly through voting/polling.",False

Please find our answers below.  (Here's a link to our previous answer wiki: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2026078.msg20340135#msg20340135)  I can't wait to read the whitepaper. When it will be available?  This will become available within the next couple of weeks. More information about the ICO fund distribution, team, etc. will also be made available.  What currencies can be used to purchase WCX tokens during the ICO?  BTC and ETH. If there's enough interest we can accommodate for other currencies as well.  Are there deposit or withdrawal limits?  No.  Will you have a chatbox?  Yes.  Is it a decentralized exchange?  No, not at first. Decentralization of user wallets is on our roadmap for 2018.  How will you compete with incumbent exchanges?  Considerably lower fees, awesome customer service, and radically better user experience.  What will happen after the ICO with unsold tokens?  Unsold tokens will be burned.  If you invite more than 250 people using the referral system at https://wcex.co, will they be counted?  Yes. There is no limit to how many people you can invite. 250 is the max shown on the progress bar, but your balance will keep increasing if you refer more.  Where will WCX tokens be traded?  They will be traded on WCX with bases BTC, ETH, and USDT.  Can we withdraw the WCX tokens from our account?  Not yet. WCX token is an ERC20 token so you'll be able to withdraw it to your Ethereum wallet.  How will the commissions be paid to WCX token holders if they're held in an Ethereum wallet?  Payments will be made to your WCX wallet. You'll be getting paid in all sorts of digital currencies, since WCX collects fees in many different digital currencies. If your WCX tokens are held outside of WCX itself, you'll be able to provide an ETH address on your account that we'll monitor when making payments to you.  Will you offer derivatives at launch time?  No. Margin trading is on the roadmap for 2018.  Please add BNT, OMG, MYST, TAAS, PLBT.  These have been added to the voting form here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdkFM1HKmTfhDeJ5Acn5hstJFi_Mcj8KIgMk7fpvOxJ2Ua5aA/viewform?usp=sf_link  Please let us know by replying in this thread if there are coins you'd like to trade that are not listed on the voting form.  Do WCX tokens give me voting rights concerning decisions made for the exchange?  Decisions on which coins and markets to add next will be made based on public interest and voting.  Will the ICO announcement such as date and so on be posted on this thread, or will it be on another thread on the ANN subforum?  We'll notify users on this thread, Twitter, and through email if you registered at https://wcex.co.  If a friend of mine invites another friend, will I benefit?  No. You'll get credited for the first level of friends you invite (not multi-level).",False

We try to address most of the questions that came up below.  Recap of dates and timelines (planned)  - Beta Launch on September 1, 2017 - ICO Start on September 9, 2017 - Launch on October 10, 2017  Questions about ICO, details, team  We'll release more details in the coming days and weeks about this. Regarding the cap, it will be capped. No tokens will be generated beyond the ones sold at the ICO. Any unsold tokens will be burned. The tokens that remain will pay out 20% of the exchange fee revenue regardless of how many there are, so we won't cut back on that either.  How will payouts work?  If you hold WCX tokens, you'll be paid on a weekly basis directly to your WCX wallet. Payment will be made in all types of digital currencies since WCX collects fees in all kinds of cryptocurrencies.  Will you have chat on-site?  Yes.  Where will you legally operate?  Hong Kong and Luxembourg. No US based operations.  Bounties, campaigns, promotions?  More coming up, likely including a BT sig campaign.   Do you have Slack or Reddit?  Not at this time. Likely in a later phase.  You claim to have no KYC, how will you establish fiat payments?  We will not require KYC for any cryptocurrency deposits or withdrawals. When we integrate fiat later in 2018, KYC will be required if you choose to deposit or withdraw fiat - this is required by the banks who hold the fiat, not us in particular.  Exchanges where WCX will be tradable?  WCX tokens will be tradable on WCX itself at launch time. You'll find liquidity to either buy or sell.  When are the promo payouts made?  The payouts for the BT promotion, Twitter, Coin voting, etc. are made at the end of the week. For the current promo, that is Sunday, July 30.  How will you keep people in the loop?  The best way is to sign up at https://wcex.co and also to follow this thread. We will be sending you emails from time to time with important updates.  Is it decentralized?  No. At least not at first - wallet decentralization is on our roadmap. Unfortunately efficient order book exchange decentralization is not consumer ready, but we will be first to hop on board when it is.  Will you be providing trading tools, charting, indicators?  Yes. WCX will have charts and tools to accommodate beginner as well as professional traders.  Can you add LTC?  LTC will be available at launch.

See here: Quote As a holder of WCX tokens, you're entitled to a portion of WCX's fee profit. Since WCX collects fees in all sorts of digital currencies, holding WCX tokens is the equivalent of holding a diversified digital currency portfolio that keeps growing. 20% of all fee revenue generated by WCX is automatically paid out to WCX token holders on a weekly basis, in amounts equivalent to each holder's share of the total amount of tokens.

The German Bitcoin.de exchange, for instance, directly cooperates with Fidor bank (German online bank) to allow direct instant trading of BTC/EUR with other ""express trading"" users on the Bitcoin.de platform.  It would be nice to see something along the lines of that, i.e. allowing users to deposit funds right from their bank account as quickly as possible. Needless to say -- cooperating with banks, however, is not unproblematic. Of course, not every exchange should necessarily support FIAT or be affiliated with banks.

Quote from: Bambulee on July 21, 2017, 05:34:26 PM there is a lil bug on https://wcex.co./ It ask me for a password for Sign In, but i never have gave a passwort, i put my e-mail for 2 days and Verify my email address thats all. Also there is no option to reset passwort.  When you enter your email at https://wcex.co, you're prompted to create a password. This allows you to create an account to track your WCX tokens. When you refer someone, tokens are credited to your account when they sign up and verify their email.

Great job WCX!  Will be watching when you do finally launch after the summer is over and classes start again.  Thanks. Our north star is total focus on customer satisfaction. Part of that means offering the highest quality service at the lowest fees. Another part of that means finding a way to allow early customers to participate in our future success. Issuing WCX tokens to the public achieves this since owners of WCX tokens earn a portion of the revenue the exchange generates.  One note about WCX tokens is that they'll be tradable on WCX from the start, so that also provides liquidity for early customers who want to sell or new customers who want to buy in.

We're excited to announce WCX, a new crypto exchange.  Trading derivatives: https://wcex.com Exchange: https://exchange.wcex.com/  I'm Tomas the CTO. Arno who is responsible for community management is also here.  Story We started a presale token sale last July and it grew well beyond our expectations. We had an exchange system prepared capable of supporting about 30K traders, but that turned out to be insufficient given the strong demand (currently over 1.6 million signups).  So we went back to the drawing board and built a scalable digital currency exchange, and that led to the first version of our spot exchange.  About WCX WCX is a digital asset exchange. We have three products: spot exchange, futures exchange, and decentralized exchange.  1) Spot exchange allows you to trade between high market cap currencies like bitcoin, ether, and the USD. 2) Futures exchange (leveraged trading) will launch in Q4 this year. 3) Decentralized exchange will launch in Q1 2019. It's where you can trade digital assets and utility and security tokens directly from your own wallet.  We want to become a place where you can trade and invest in thousands of markets using digital currency.  Our roadmap is laid out on our token sale page here.  Team We are a small team based in France and moving to Switzerland in the next few months (to the crypto valley). Our team is currently 2 founders, 2 engineers, and support and design contractors some of which will convert to full time roles.  We're very technical and product focused (the 2 founders are software engineers from Apple).  Interview with our CEO: listen here.   Please feel free to ask your questions! I'm happy to respond.  I noticed that there are already a few support questions being posted here. You'll have the best luck reaching out to our support team directly. Here's the link: https://wcex.com/support.

We're able to provide much lower fees because most of the exchanges out there are overcharging tremendously. The net fee for Bittrex for example is 0.5% per trade. WCX will be under 0.1% and market makers are paid, instead of charged, when they trade.  Current exchanges seem to be run inefficiently and unprofessionally, or mismanaged, which is why we see this as an opportunity to offer a professional, at-cost, client-focused exchange. The fees are too high, or the customer support sucks, or deposits/withdrawals take forever, or the trading engine lags, among other things.  We will have pre-ICO bounties as well as bonuses for early buyers of WCX tokens.",False

I am fully for what you have to offer in giving your potential customers some relief in the form of high transactions fees they are paying using other exchanges.  They all feel as if they are being taken advantage of by these other exchanges. So I do hope you and your exchange do wish to alleviate us all from these higher than normal transactions fees to want to move our own funds around a site or out of a site when you want to.  Thanks.,False

WCX will aim to have the lowest costs and fees of any exchange in the world. This is our driving force. We believe the very low fees as well as our laser focus on customer satisfaction, will drive a large amount of volume and liquidity which will benefit the business. Current cryptocurrency exchanges are tremendously overcharging while also mismanaging their business or running it inefficiently.  2. Base markets to start with are BTC, ETH, and USDT. You can vote for which coins and market pairs you want to see included here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdkFM1HKmTfhDeJ5Acn5hstJFi_Mcj8KIgMk7fpvOxJ2Ua5aA/viewform - you can also let us know if there are particular coins you'd like to trade by replying in this thread.  3. The taker will pay a small fee (e.g. -0.15%) and the maker will get paid, not charged, a fee (e.g. +0.05%). Currently Poloniex nets around 0.4% and Bittrex around 0.5% of every transaction, which are respectively 400% and 500% higher than what WCX intends to charge.",False
