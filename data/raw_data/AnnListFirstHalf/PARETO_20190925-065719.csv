The white paper answers this  https://pareto.network/download/Pareto-Technical-White-Paper.pdf   ""Prediction markets rely on the wisdom of the crowd, promoting a binary side bet that something will or will not happen, or that opposites will happen. It is meant to aggregate all available information to determine what team will win, who will win an election, and other forms of binary events. The purpose is to create a limited incentive for people to put money behind a decision they believe in. The limitation comes from both the kinds of information that can be applicable to a prediction market, and the information available to the crowd to begin with. Finally, markets may not form at all outside of the biggest events already in the collective conscious, exacerbating an already irreconcilable liquidity problem. There are many circumstances to suggest that there is no wisdom of the crowd, such as in the options markets and in elections, yet prediction markets do not provide a liquid enough venue to make contrarian decisions. The liquidity concern is proportionate to the funds available to other bettors, whereas expert provided information is the only form of liquidity in the Pareto Network. The cryptocurrency financial markets are not transparent enough for the whole market to make rational decisions, and the market participants are not rational to begin with. The market consistently discounts improbable situations, and this is reflected in prediction markets. The Pareto Network provides an incentive to disclose the improbable. This results in enabling as many people as possible to make profitable investment decisions in the relevant markets before non-users, based on real-time information they obtain from the Pareto Network. The users are in turn incentivized to compensate the Content Contributors with Pareto tokens, as that action improves their ranking on the Pareto leaderboard and allows those people to get the next information disclosure sooner.""",False

If a content contributor posts poor quality information then they would have spent some Pareto tokens and nobody on the network would reward it.  Users gain an increased ranking when they reward a content contributor. Increased ranking gets them access to new content faster, and they'll only do that if they find information valuable.  Therefore in reality, a content contributor's maximum payout for each piece of content is proportional to the number of users that want a higher rank. But users won't reward just anything, they will choose which content contributors are making them money so they can keep buying Pareto.
