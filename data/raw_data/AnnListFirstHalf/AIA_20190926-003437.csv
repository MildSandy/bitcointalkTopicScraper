We will re-update a new post to describe our project  ALLCHAIN is a block-based IoT platform that drives the industrial Internet based on the individual needs of consumers. Based on the blockchain, ALLCHAIN obtains the personalized demand data of users and then gradually quantifies the data to derive a platform based on the Internet On the block chain C2M platform, and finally through the block chain distributed multiple SHA256 secure hash algorithm integration with the Internet of Things, extending into a blockchain as the underlying technology diversified industrial Internet C2M platform. Eventually to change the current inefficient manufacturing methods of low-cost operation. And break the trust island of data through the blockchain encryption and data sharing mechanism to establish a consumer investment recycling ecosystem.  ALLCHAIN platform core strategic advantages 1) C2M platform consumer demand for digital 2) ALLCHAIN product inventory digitized 3) ALLCHAIN platform product traceability 4) ALLCHIAN platform assets can be securitized 5) ALLCHAIN resource integration 6) ALLCHAIN platform resource value sharing  The construction of C2M platform will drive more enterprises to realize 0 inventory sales of their products on the platform, and users will be able to use AIA to consume the platform anywhere in the world. AIA will be in the free flow of business and users, high circulation can produce high value. When all aspects of business applications and user engagement enough AIA has a real value,By March 2018, three exchanges will be launched, including one of the top ten digital asset exchanges in the world.
