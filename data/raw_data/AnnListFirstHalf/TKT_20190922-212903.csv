The crypto.tickets ICO will enable the creation of the backend blockchain for this platform, the missing link which will enable a full service solution.  One powerful competitive advantage is that we are building a universal solution for any ticketing system. Crypto.tickets is a foundation blockchain solution; the central hub which will regulate the interaction between all players in the market. Each event established in the system is a smart-contract, which is responsible for processing payments, issuing and returning crypto-tickets for their transfer and resale in the secondary market, the decentralised ticket exchange which works directly on the blockchain.

There are currently seven startups with plans to launch blockchain ticketing platforms, none of which are currently in production. Ticketscloud.com is a cash flow positive business with strong venture backing. The business is scaling quickly and meets all requirements of the modern ticketing solution. The crypto.tickets ICO will enable the creation of the backend blockchain for this platform, the missing link which will enable a full service solution.  That said, the solution is not exclusive to Tickets Cloud. One powerful competitive advantage is that we are building a universal solution for any ticketing system. Crypto.tickets is a foundation blockchain solution; the central hub which will regulate the interaction between all players in the market. Each event established in the system is a smart-contract, which is responsible for processing payments, issuing and returning crypto-tickets for their transfer and resale in the secondary market, the decentralised ticket exchange which works directly on the blockchain. The Ticket Chain is a universal solution for any ticket system, which gives it and its clients all advantages of blockchain technologies.  And one more difference - Aventus makes an Eventbrite competitor with blockchain - they will face heavy competition in the B2C ticketing market. We will build the first blockchain platform for ticketing systems which they will be able to use to provide this function to their customers for the organizers.",False

Medium-to-high probability of investment return, considerable sensitivity to market environment.  The crypto.tickets is a project building a blockchain ecosystem that will change the mass event ticket sales market. For the time being, the global ticket industry faces the everyday problems, such as: speculation on the secondary ticket market, fakes and fraud, incomplete sale of tickets and lack of a common standard for the return of tickets. These are the main topics of all industry conferences around the world.  As founders promise, the blockchain technology will solve these problems forever, simplify the market parties’ intercommunications and provide transparency of all ticket transactions. The company claims that it will solve the problem of the lack of mutual trust as all transactions are made in blockchain and all relations are controlled by smart contracts.  Tokens of the Project have the potential for significant growth due to the architecture of the ecosystem, in which each ticket purchased for fiat currency in the Tickets Cloud and other ticket systems. Through the back-end it will be organized as a request to purchase the required number of TKT tokens on the exchange. However, the motivation of companies selling tickets to receive payment in TKT tokens is not clear at the moment. Moreover, their motivation to instantly exchange TKT for fiat currency threatens the economic stability of the crypto.tickets system and the future value increase of tokens.

After the purchase, thesmart-contract sends the crypto-ticket to the unique wallet in the Tickets Wallet. Whenattending an event, a user shows the ticket’s QR-code which is scanned and the entrysystem makes a record in the blockchain that the ticket is used. After the event is over, used tickets are canceled.",False

There are currently seven startups with plans to launch blockchain ticketing platforms, none of which are currently in production.

One powerful competitive advantage is that we are building a universal solution for any ticketing system. Crypto.tickets is a foundation blockchain solution; the central hub which will regulate the interaction between all players in the market. Each event established in the system is a smart-contract, which is responsible for processing payments, issuing and returning crypto-tickets for their transfer and resale in the secondary market, the decentralised ticket exchange which works directly on the blockchain. The Ticket Chain is a universal solution for any ticket system, which gives it and its clients all advantages of blockchain technologies. ",False

The project will become a universal global decentralized ticketing platform open to all market players. The ICO starts on October 5, 2017, and will last for four weeks. But we are not the only player in this area. Lately, the entertainment industry has seen the emergence of a number of projects that aim to solve the most pressing issues of the ticketing market: profiteering, fakes, and high barriers for new entrants. Every company seeks to address them in its own way and develops services that soothe the typical pains of event organizers, ticketing systems, and end users. Based on two blockchain-powered services, we will show the distinctive features of our service. London-based Aventus is working on a blockchain solution to prevent ticket counterfeiting and profiteering. The platform enables organizers to create and manage tickets, be in full control of resale pricing and earn the associated fees, and combat costs. In addition, Aventus features loyalty programs for ticket buyers, where the most active users receive rewards for promoting gigs and helping spot fraudsters. Aventus has raised over US$18 mln in an ICO. The company has no plans to offer analytics or an API for ticketing systems, so it is not possible to integrate it into third-party processes. All the advantages are sealed within the Aventus platform, including their customer service tools. The company thus will have to compete against the entire industry, including the incumbent players clearly unwilling to yield their market share. Another debutante, KickCity, advertises itself as Facebook meets Slack, a blockchain-based social event platform. The team of KickCity has a tremendously ambitious goal of creating a value-based social network where users could obtain any necessary information on blockchain and crypto-currencies, with rewards for those who provide it. KickCity intends to use events and gigs as leverage to form a community around blockchain. To enable it, the team is developing a social event platform centered around the communities of organizers and attendees. KickCity is focused on creating communities around events and empowering organizers to launch, promote, and make money off events. Essentially, the main idea behind KickCity is centered around event management and is not aimed at end users. It is tool to promote events and draw more crowds. Why crypto.tickets is different Instead of competing with the incumbent players, crypto.tickets provides a technology for both the existing and new players. Our team believes that a blockchain ticketing platform should be open to all market participants. That’s why crypto.tickets has been designed as a decentralized platform, which connects to any existing ticketing system to provide the full advantages of blockchain to its customers. Crypto.tickets is sending the entire industry into a new orbit. With paper tickets being replaced with electronic ones, the next step of the evolution is a crypto ticket with embedded monetary policy. Numerous projects that employ blockchain to a varying degree are designed to manage events and ticketing centrally. E.g., to tap into the full potential of KickCity or Aventus, organizers are forced to abandon their current ticketing solutions: the most control they can hope for is to embed a third party widget on their website and play by rules set by others. In turn, crypto.tickets offers an API which organizers and ticketing platforms can use to set their own rules of distribution, resales, and refunds with the help of smart contracts. This way organizers can compete more openly, giving customers more choice. The relationship between organizers and spectators are regulated via smart contracts, and unlike other blockchain-based products, we actually do subscribe to the ideals of decentralization. Crypto.tickes will also enable a vibrant secondary market for tickets, a decentralized exchange where attendees will be able to resell their own tickets. For big gigs, holders will be able to auction their tickets off to a person who offers the most money within a limited timeframe. It’s also worth pointing out that the creators of crypto.tickets have a trove of experience in the ticketing industry and business in general. Their current platform, Tickets Cloud, serves over 1,000 event organizers and 100 distributors, yielding a monthly turnover of US$2,000,000 and over 400% growth.",False

One powerful competitive advantage is that we are building a universal solution for any ticketing system. Crypto.tickets is a foundation blockchain solution; the central hub which will regulate the interaction between all players in the market. Each event established in the system is a smart-contract, which is responsible for processing payments, issuing and returning crypto-tickets for their transfer and resale in the secondary market, the decentralised ticket exchange which works directly on the blockchain. The Ticket Chain is a universal solution for any ticket system, which gives it and its clients all advantages of blockchain technologies. And one more difference - for example Aventus makes an Eventbrite competitor with blockchain - they will face heavy competition in the B2C ticketing market. We will build the first blockchain platform for ticketing systems which they will be able to use to provide this function to their customers for the organizers. Also you can find a comparative table in WP!  We understood the unit economy and began targeting advertising to medium-sized organizers. To work with large organizers we have built a b2b sales department - every major client with its own characteristics. When appeared large events, ticket sellers began to connect to the system themselves, so we were the first in the world who launched the sale of tickets for AliExpress.  Finalizing the system for large customers, additional functional was created. Soon we will be ready to sell the system to large customers using less b2b sales.",False

Crypto.tickets is a foundation blockchain solution; the central hub which will regulate the interaction between all players in the market. Each event established in the system is a smart-contract, which is responsible for processing payments, issuing and returning crypto-tickets for their transfer and resale in the secondary market, the decentralised ticket exchange which works directly on the blockchain. The Ticket Chain is a universal solution for any ticket system, which gives it and its clients all advantages of blockchain technologies.  And one more difference - Aventus makes an Eventbrite competitor with blockchain - they will face heavy competition in the B2C ticketing market. We will build the first blockchain platform for ticketing systems which they will be able to use to provide this function to their customers for the organizers.

The crypto.tickets ICO will enable the creation of the backend blockchain for this platform, the missing link which will enable a full service solution.

Crypto.tickets is a foundation  blockchain solution; the central hub which will regulate the interaction between all players in the market. Each event established in the system is a smart-contract, which is responsible for processing payments, issuing and returning crypto-tickets for their transfer and resale in the secondary market,  the decentralised ticket exchange which works directly on the blockchain. The Ticket Chain is a universal solution for any ticket system, which gives it and its clients all advantages of blockchain technologies.

If you originally bought the ticket with the TKT tokens, the tokens are refunded to your personal account with Tickets Wallet (minus the percentage specified in the rules for ticket return). If it is done with USD (or any other fiat currency), the procedure is the same; the cash is refunded to the visitor’s personal account in fiat currency after the tokens are converted in the exchange gateway. Please, pay attention to the fact, that when the fiat currency is refunded, you bear the risk of TKT currency volatility.

At the moment, the ticket sale market is surviving numerous problems, such as speculations at the secondary market, fraud and ticket falsification, incomplete sales and a lack of a consolidated tool for for the return of tickets. These are the basic topics for all industry’s conferences across the globe.   Blockchain technology forever gets rid of these problems, simplifies interaction between all of the market players and ensures transparency of economic processes, taking place in this industry. The Parties no longer need to trust each other as all deals are done right on the blockchain, and the interaction between them is regulated by smart-contracts.      crypto.tickets – is a new standard of the ticket industry, a universal blockchain platform for ticket systems, which combines three basic products: Tickets Chain, Tickets Cloud and Tickets Wallet.         Tickets Chain – is a blockchain solution, which regulates interaction between all players in the market. Each event established in the system is a smart-contract, which is responsible for processing the payments, the issuing and returning of crypto-tickets, for their transfer and resale at the secondary market – at the decentralised ticket exchange which works directly on the blockchain. The Ticket Chain is a universal solution for any ticket system, which gives it and its clients all the advantages of blockchain technologies.    Tickets Cloud – is a 100% ready product, representing a global system of ticket distribution (ticket system), which for already 4 years has operated successfully on the ticket market and will be the first ticket platform that will transfer all of its settlements to the decentralised blockchain system Tickets Chain, ensuring the token’s liquidity by the turnover of $ 2 million monthly. The Tickets Cloud team has a great experience in the event industry and is responsible for the implementation of the whole crypto.tickets ecosystem.    Tickets Wallet – is an online wallet (Web & Mobile Apps), which is used for a decentralised storage of crypto-tickets and internal tokens of the system: Tickets Chain of coins (TCN). Working with the blockchain has never been so easy. Using the Tickets Wallet, a common user cannot even guess that all his operations with the ticket and tokens are happening decentralised, on the Tickets Chain blockchain. A working prototype can very soon be downloaded from GooglePlay and Appstore.                            We are happy to announce the official crypto.tickets bounty program details!
