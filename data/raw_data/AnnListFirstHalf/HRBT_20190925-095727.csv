The HireBits Token  The HireBits Token is a utility token. It will serve a role in the HireBits ecosystem as the token of choice. We aim to incentivize the utilization of the token within the platform in several ways. It is an ERC20 token.  Utility  The HireBits platform will be home to a large number of individuals, consultants, companies and institutions. It will also have hundreds of micro services among the different players in the ecosystem. The HireBits utility tokens will be the preferred mode for settling these transactions. For example, if a consultant wants to initiate a transaction to verify the credentials of an individual, the transaction will be settled through a specified number of HireBits tokens.

As a digital platform, HireBits is for the world. However, the business behind the platform depends on the number of institutions and companies we can partner with. For that reason, we are focused entirely on one market, India.  The size of the opportunity is close to $1 billion, just in the online and organized recruitment space. We believe we will be a major disruptor in the market. In one of our white papers, we mentioned that we are looking to sign up with at least 50 partners, who will actively source their talent with us. We are steadily making progress towards that goal. It is our belief that these partnerships will help us pilot, test, and enhance the platform, while helping us become profitable within 12 months of the platform launch.    A Word on the Token Sale  Our token sale is still over 20 days away. We will run the sale directly through our website. We are also trying to launch it through KickICO (no conformation from them yet).  As a bootstrapped startup, we are not very big on marketing.

Everyone claims to be different.  Is HireBits actually different? We'll let you decide. But here is something to convince you we might be.  Analytics is the most important element of the HireBits platform. Unlike most others who consider Analytics as a one size fits all, we started with the assumption that our market has unique characteristics. Today, we have the data and algorithms to prove it. So, our approach is very different from other cookie cutter approaches. The HireBits platform actually needs a blockchain. We are certain we don't need a million dollars to build a functional platform. Frugal innovation.

The platform is host to a lot of micro-services. HireBits tokens will be the ‘currency’ at the heart of many micro-transactions between parties on the platform.  Some of the tokens will be spent to enable users, institutions, and partners for their transactions on the platform. Backers of HireBits can either hold them for future use or trade them on exchanges. A wallet will be integrated in the ecosystem, where users can 'pledge' their tokens. This will be used to ensure liquidity for users who want to purchase the tokens.  The fundamental business behind HireBits will impact the value of the HireBits tokens over time.
