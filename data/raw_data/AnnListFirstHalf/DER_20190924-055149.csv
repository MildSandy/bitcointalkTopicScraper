We are a privately held clinical-stage biotechnology company focusing on the development and commercialization of a revolutionary new immune therapy technology platform for the treatment of chronic viral infections, cancer and allergy. Our Immune Therapies are designed to boost specific immune response in order to modify or control presently incurable diseases.  Our proprietary Platform Technology includes a plasmid DNA-based, disease specific antigen, a nanomedicine formulation which encapsulates the plasmid DNA to closely resemble a virus, and a topical (through the skin) administration device which delivers the vaccine via dendritic cell to lymph nodes of the immune system. Our technologies support the rapid and cost-effective development of original biologic (as opposed to drugs) products.  Our Lead Therapeutic Vaccine for treatment of HIV, referred to as “DermaVir”, is effective in boosting immune response which in turn kills HIV-infected cells. Our human clinical trials in Phase I, Phase I/II and Phase II have demonstrated our vaccine is capable of killing HIV-infected cells. DermaVir has an excellent safety profile similar to vaccines used in healthy adults and children. DermaVir can also be a co-treatment option if administered with antiretroviral therapy.  We are raising funds in this ICO to complete the regulatory documentation needed to seek United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on the best path to marketing approval, including Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Fast-track.  Post approval our products will allow people to live better and longer lives.  Our White paper is available HERE  Please visit our website for complete information on the Dermavir ICO at www.dermavir.com",False

Unfortunately business always entails compromise. We have decided to pursue an ICO because we truly believe the outcome of this ventures, long time in the making, is too great have it end up in the hands of already wealthy venture capitalist. An ICO gives us greater control over our destiny.  With this decision came the compromise of not having enough liquidity until there is at least a partial ICO (which is why we have ICO steps) to pay the people who are helping us make it happen.  These people, with decades of pharma experience, have jobs at other companies. They have been advising us on a private basis while maintaining paying jobs. Everything costs money. Until we can pay their fees, and can afford for them to transition over to our company, we have to protect their livelihood. There is a preregistration for our ICO on our website. I think a compromise we can make is if enough people preregister, and we see that the work put into this will be fruitful, we will ask our experts to consent to posting their names, initially in an advisory capacity. This should be a compromise acceptable to all.  We have to complete our regulatory documentation in order pass, or fail, the ultimate test of all biotech companies. To learn what the regulator thinks of our data. In our experience they are very smart, dedicated people. Once again I am confident some level of compromise can be, will be reached that will allow our vaccine to help millions of people. But we must meet this ultimate challenge because to fail on the account of not enough funds is not an option here. This ICO is about completing what needs to be done, period.",False
