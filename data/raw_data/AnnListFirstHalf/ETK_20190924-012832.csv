We currently use AI and blockchain technologies in the energy sector to reduce cost and consumption of electricity in global markets. We feel our overall model will lead to:  1. A reduction in global energy consumption 2. A reduction in retail energy prices 3. The creation of an eco-system, including a transparent peer-to-peer platform to trade energy  Energi Token (ETK) is the next step in our revolution of the energy sector. Traditional incentives to reduce consumption previously have not worked, and we feel that the reason for this is that consumers need to see the monetary value of their change in behaviour before they are likely to act upon this. Our token will offer incentives for a range of energy-efficient behaviour such as taking low-carbon transport and buying energy-efficient appliances. ETK can then be re-used in our eco-system to trade energy or charge your EV.  ETK is designed as a reward mechanism to encourage energy efficient behaviour from consumers and there are various ways in which these can be obtained through different methods which we have outlined below.  The tokens will be based on the Ethereum ERC-20 standard and can be bought via coin exchanges for several purposes such as individual/company incentive schemes. For example, a company can buy x tokens from the exchange and distribute them amongst its employees for showing energy efficient behaviour that saved the company y amount on their energy bill.  Tokens can also be earned by individuals by implementing energy saving behaviour such as commuting via public transport, buying an electric vehicle or consuming less energy at home.  If an individual was to commute via public transport they would receive an amount of ETK for using a more energy efficient method of transport. If they purchase an electric car then the car manufacturer or the local authority would reward them with ETK for purchasing an energy efficient vehicle. If they consume less energy at home through behavioural change or more efficient appliances, they would be given ETK for showing energy efficient behaviour.  Ultimately the mechanism is designed to encourage energy efficient behaviour and as a by-product, the consumer will become more proficient in the energy industry, leading to more informed decisions being made. The tokens will have a market value and can therefore be exchanged for flat currency, or the consumer can choose to save the tokens and use them to pay for future energy bills and electric vehicle charging.  Energi Token has so far gone on to win at the ICOSummit Zurich and come in at 4th place at the d10e Conference on Kiev.  Please contact us for more information: www.energimine.com",False

Company is legit, from UK.     It is about Energy, which is quite important.    For example I participated in another Energy ICO last summer - Power Leger (POWER tokens) - token costed $0.08 during ICO, and now it is $1.6  -   20 times increase    There was information about this ICO on Forbes as well :     Brilliant Startups Are Using ICOs To Revolutionize The World Of Blockchain  https://www.forbes.com/sites/haroldstark/2017/10/27/brilliant-startups-are-using-icos-to-revolutionize-the-world-of-blockchain/#1a17ba54a797  ICO will finish soon.   Anybody knows how many tokens they sold already?  they don't show this info on website.  Token price is 30 000 tokens for 1 ETH - which is about 3 cents per token.   BTW, people can join the sale with this reference link (if you want )  :   https://tokensale.energitoken.com/signup/?referrer=Q4GN4M",False
