CEO Bill Heyn:  The ongoing market downturn has, unfortunately, begun to create casualties among the world’s crypto exchanges. However, at trade.io we have been prudent with our resources; our balance sheet, cash flow and growth prospects remain strong. Our current position allows us to not only weather the storm but also invest where we see opportunity. We adamantly believe that trade.io’s long-term potential is not adequately reflected in the current market price of TIOx.  We feel this token repurchase program underscores the utmost confidence we have in the future of trade.io and further serves to align Company interests with those of our faithful TIOnauts.    The buyback program will be financed through free cash flow and any TIOx purchased as part of this program will be held as treasury tokens. The timing and price of any TIOx that are repurchased under this program will be determined solely by trade.io’s management at its own discretion based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The buyback program may be suspended or discontinued at any time"".",False

Things are moving so fast right now that it feels like I hardly have time to put pen to paper for this letter; good news though, this one's basically going to write itself. More to the point, it's going to be a bit of a challenge to fit everything we accomplished in February into one quick note.  So, to start off with, some pretty major improvements to the exchange have been implemented this month. Aside from the usual tweaks and turns that occur, we deployed our guest mode so that investors who are considering joining the vaunted ranks of the TIOnauts can get a preview of the exchange.  We also had our iOS app included in the Apple App Store. If you use an iPhone, make sure to look into it; I can vouch that it looks great. Not to leave anyone out, we are actively beta testing our Android app as well, feel free to check it out at Google Play.  In perhaps our biggest success of the month in attracting people from around the world to become TIOnauts and participate on the exchange, we launched our integrated solution for purchasing crypto with a credit or debit card. From the BALANCE tab in your exchange account, you will see a credit card icon next to the tokens that you can purchase with card payment. Just click on the icon and you’re on your way.  Along with all of the other improvements, we have been actively working to add new tokens to the exchange. This is something we decided to push at the beginning of the month and I had hoped to be able to report to you in the letter that we had listed four or five new tokens.  Instead, I am happy to report that we have added four new blockchains and, in total, nine new tokens, GRIN, NEO, EOS, HOT, AOA, LTO, EDR, LAMB and SOLVE. We have more coming and are planning to start a more organized process where anyone participating on the exchange can have some input on what we list.  Of course, not to forget, the most recent trading competition ends today - 5 BTC is up for grabs. Congratulations in advance to the best of our traders and the most fortunate of our TIOnauts in the lucky draw.  Looking ahead to March, our focus is on three major initiatives: adding fiat deposit options and trading to the exchange, expanding our regulatory footprint and beginning our marketing campaign for TIO Markets. Of course, exchange improvements and token additions will be ongoing along with ramping up marketing for trade.io.  Lastly, I want to touch again on the buyback program we announced earlier in the month. I know that there has been a bit of confusion as to how buybacks work and what they mean. I think that we have cleared up most of the technical questions in the last few weeks, so I want to focus on the meaning, the implication of a move like this on our part. However, at its core, it is pretty simple. Because we have been conscientious with our money, our balance sheet is strong and we have available funds. As we run the company it is up to us, every day, to determine how best to spend that money to create the most possible value for the TIOx. Everything from hiring people to giving away 5 BTC in a trading competition, we constantly strategize on how best we can use each and every penny to maximize value for our TIOnauts.  In this case, we decided to invest in what we felt was a hugely undervalued asset - TIOx. Hopefully, you will all see that for the vote of confidence that it is - we are quite literally putting our money where our mouth is.  With all of that said, I am going back to work for you, for the company and for TIOx.  Sincerely,  Bill Heyn  CEO",False

The account manager would email the client: KYC/AML requirements & Risk Disclosures. Upon approval, the client would bank wire $100K, and upon receipt the account manager would contact the client for instructions and would hold their hand from start to finish. Immediately following the transaction, the BTC would be sent to the clients pre-defined wallet.  Fees, minimum limits, a variety of accepted cryptos & additional terms will be announced along with timing during the course of next week.

In light of a security issue with a well-known exchange last week, we took a further precautionary step to have a second independent audit of our exchange & hot wallet schema from top to bottom. While fortunately no material issues have been found, the audit will not be 100% complete by time of the launch.  While we fully expect the second audit findings to come back in line with our initial audit, we want to err on the side of caution to allow completion. As a result, we’ve made the decision to postpone the launch six days, to Monday, July 23rd, 12PM EST.  While we’re frustrated in delaying the launch, as we’re as anxious as you to show off our innovative exchange, we need to exercise prudence when it comes to security, and feel this is the right thing to do.  On the bright side, the slight delay will allow us to complete USDT integration, which will bring the list of cryptocurrencies at launch to: BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC, USDT and of course TIO.  Lastly, due to any inconvenience as a result of the delay, we’ve decided to waive all withdrawal fees for the first 30 days. This means that there will be no deposit or withdrawal fees, and no maker or taker fees as previously announced for the first 30 days, in other words, 100% free trading across the board.  We appreciate your continued patience, and assure you, we have built something very special that will be well worth the wait.!!!",False

As we know that today on 17th July, the trade.io exchange was planned to launch but due to some technical issues have been occured during the audit & was not audited 100% which is required to launch it today. It has been postponed  to next date and fixed to launch it on 23rd of July. There is nothing  to worry about it because  the team is working on it to sort out all the pros & cons and complete all the necessary works before the next launch date, so that none of the serious issues could disturb in near future. In the year 1996-97, when dot com industry was flourishing & those who are invested in IPO's of Amazon & Ebay, they all became millionaire  & billionaire. Now comes crypto industry which is another breakthrough of technological innovative  of blockchain know as ICO's. This is also not very much different than IPO. But the only difference  is that,  here no need to wait 20 years to get that much of growth. It could give you that kind of returns in 2 to 3 years, but it is depends upon the right selection of ICO. Trade.io was launched their ICO in last quarter of 2017 with the rate of $1.00 per TIO & now the price is very much down due to bearish behaviour of crypto market due to uncertainties of regulation in some countries including India. This is not going to last so long. I think this is the best time to get into this market & pick some good ICO. I personally consider TIO would be a better one to hold for long term. Who know this could be a next Amazon or Ebay. This is my personal research & opinion. If you want to know more about It, just visit the site & do your personal research as well.  https://trade.io  Thank you & good luck!!! Regards, Manoj Kumar Ram",False

A: Initially it will be the basic, big coins, but then we will roll out a ton after, especially ERC20. Have a bunch of listings and ICO clients that will come out quickly as well. So at start:  BTC — Bitcoin  BCH — Bitcoin Cash  ETH- Ethereum  LTC — Litecoin  TIO — TradeToken  USDT — May be available right at launch or at the very least within 2–3 days following launch.  ERC20 — we are looking at rolling out maybe 200 as soon as possible, but priority is on listing clients and ICO clients.  EOS and XRP soon.  Q: When will the exchange support FIAT?  A: Soon, there is no regulatory issue, just want to scale into features.  Q: Will we have any kind of voting system for new coin listings? Can you tell us anything about your plans on how new listings will be done? Would TIO owners have any privileges over others?  A: We are not looking to limit coins by any means, just need a controlled process to roll them out.  Regulations and Jurisdictions  Q: Can you speak on the progress with regards to regulations in the various jurisdictions? Which jurisdictions is trade.io currently focusing on, or which is top priority at the moment?  A: Working on HK, Singapore, Switzerland, Malta right now as the bigger ones. Smaller ones as well. We are meeting with regulators in the US as well.  Q: Are u also considering India?  A: India is unclear as to regulations right now.  Q: Will trade.io move to comply with the SEC and other regulatory bodies worldwide as they ask for information on customer protections, etc?  A: Already started, meetings already happening. We will do what we can to eliminate insider trading, wash trading, bots, fake volumes, all the bad things that hurt customers and plague other exchanges.  Roadmap  Q: When is the new Road-map being published?  A: After exchange and LP launches.  LP  Q: When will the LP fully launch? After 30 days of exchange? And the profit of the LP will count from the 1st day of exchange launch?  A: There is only a full version of LP, there is no beta version of LP. Profit starts immediately, LP will launch after 30 days i.e. profits start from next week at launch of the exchange. ICO consultancy revenues will be included regardless when exchange launches.  Q: Will there be something which tells the day’s profit with detail for transparency before LP launch?  A: There will be a LP distribution amount widget, but not promising that before LP launch.  Q: How much can we expect from LP daily payouts in the first month? Nothing at all? Something more than current airdrops program? Or much more than current airdrops?  A: The exchange needs to ramp and generate volume, then the LP will have meaningful distributions.  Q: There were some thoughts that the running costs would eat up the revenues that was already generated from consultancy arm that would left very few to be distributed. Could you tell us this is not the case? And in general, costs to be subtracted from LP is only direct costs that affects it, could you confirm that as well?  A: You mean operations? No that is covered from our 50%.  TIO Token  Q: After the exchange has been launched, how is the price movement of TIO expected to react? Do you not have any estimation for it?  A: Impossible to know, however, we are actively exploring moving TIO to exclusively be traded on trade.io exchange and de-list from other exchanges, for more control over price manipulation.  Q: What’s the solution in the future to avoid something like Bitforex?  A: They picked us up on their own. It is impossible to prevent a supposed decentralized exchange from listing TIO  Q: What measures will be taken to boost the trading volume of TIO token after launch of exchange. With the LP, the volume might be very low as it is today?  A: If you look at the token economics of TIO, it is designed to be more like a Berkshire Hathaway than a high volume penny stock. The goal is to drive value, not volume. The more value we create, and with low float, this will be good for price.  Q: Will TIO be trade-able with other commodities listed under FX Primus ?  A: Most likely not, as its a crypto asset so it will be traded against other cryptos.  trade.io Exchange  Q: What is the ETA for decentralized exchange?  A: There is no ETA at this time, we’re fully focused on making sure we have a flawless centralized exchange and execute on the liquidity pool.  Q: Will trade.io offer margin trading?  A: We will. Working with risk management to get it structured.  Q: What about futures and options?  A: Talking to some vendors specifically about this as possible partners.  Q: Will trade.io have algo trading?  A: Talking to a partner on that currently as well  Q: Why limit the launch to just 1000 initially?  A: The limitation to 1000 is not really for technology reasons, its more to allow customer support to get feet under them before we pummel them. It’s 1000 on Day 1, looking to open up to many thousands, within only a few days following launch. There is no level of training that can prepare support/finance, etc. once live users come through the door. This is not our first rodeo with running brokerages, so we understand its a completely different ballgame once the bright lights are on.  Q: What about Blossom wallet?  A: That wallet is under development, which makes it easier to participate in ICOs, have KYC, etc.  Q: Are MEW or other wallets going to be integrated in such a way as to make it possible to be able to participate in the LP without having them on the exchange? If this is actually possible that is. Will Private Keys be made available to the holders of the wallets in trade.io?  A: Not sure on security on that. May be part of hybrid DEX solution. Also, transaction fees would be high, since every transaction would be recorded on BC, cant really use ledger. Not ideal overall.  Q: Will trade.io place their own buy and sell orders to maintain liquidity?  A: We will keep risk low initially, but over time us and outside (institutional) providers will be doing this.  Partnerships  Q: What are the plans with FX Primus?  A: The current initiative with FXP, is to accept TIO as a deposit method, then eventually allow TIO to be traded on the platform.  Q: Are there any updates on the Angel Investors Program? What roles do Kosmos, Plutus VC and Blockway Capital play in the Angels Investors Program?  A: We are sending them deals to look at where they know we already did KYC, took a first pass, etc. They are also bring us deals to look at as well.  Security  Q: Can u please tell us about the security measures taken for exchange. As these days many exchanges are being hacked even the so called best exchange i.e. Binance , Bancor etc.  A: We have in-house, outside team, Cloudflare, Fireeye, etc. To elaborate, virtually all client assets are kept in cold storage as well.  Q: Are there plans to provide insurance against hacking? If wallets get hacked is it guaranteed that owners will get all their tokens back? One suggestion is that part of the undistributed funds from the LP (due to tiers with percentages less than 100%) can be used to offer such insurance, If necessary…if not, could be retained by the company …Security is obviously of the utmost importance especially if trade.io is targeting institutional investors. This insurance would bring extra peace of mind.  A: We are looking for answers on that, so I like the suggestion. Nothing definitive yet. We will explore insurance and other things, but same answer for all of crypto, there is nothing like FDIC yet.  join trading revolution.  join trade.io sign up here: https://trade.io/l/lb1x",False

As I was also a forex trader before and actively traded for more than 3 years in a row. What I have seen that, still I do not understand the fee structure of forex trading platforms. The trading charges are very high which minimize the profits. But when I recognise the developing stage of cryoto trading platform, it fascinated me a lot due to it's decentralized & peer to peer trading features & low cost trading fees. Where your funds are totally under your control. So I left the forex trading & started cryptocurrency trading. Since, I came across to know about trade.io in the last quarter of 2017 & constantly following it. If they have planned to implement all the forex instruments on it in future, than it will break the negative perspective of the people & attract fresh investors in this field. I found the best part in it, which is 50% revenue share program on a daily basis, means whatever profit it makes, half will be distribute to the TIO token holders into the platform. Or, if losses occurs, 50% of that losses would be deduct from them on that day. I think this is a fair game. In traditional trading system none of the trading platform has shared their profits with their investors. So this makes it different with the others. There are zero % chances to make lose.

It behaves in the same way as a lending pool . Participants will use their TIOs as an access key to the LP. After the Liquidity Pool has been launched, the Participants can loan their assets to the LP. The assets will be converted and held in USD until the time the participant exits the pool. In addition to TIO, which is required to access the LP and may be used for the lending, the In addition to TIO, which is required to access the LP and maybe used for the lending, the participant will have the option to contribute to the LP with other assets, such as ﬁat and other crypto currencies. In return for the loaned assets that are contributed to the LP, trade.io will pay back interest to reward these clients for their participation. Participants will receive their original contribution( s ) back once they chose to exit the LP. It is important to understand that the beneﬁts from the liquidity pool are not related to the Trade Token ( TIO), which is only the key to access to the pool, but only to the amount of assets which are put into the liquidity pool . This is what the pool will consist of :  trade.io will provide the seed capital of up to $50 million USD trade.io will be the front line risk capital 50 million reserve Trade Tokens ( TIOs ) to further cover participant ’ s risk and provide additional liquidity The balance sheet of TIOs & the customer s ’balance sheet of TIOs Clients may be able to lend various other assets, including crypto currencies and ﬁat currencies .   How Can I Join The LP? Participants need a minimum of 2500 Trade Tokens ( TI O) to be eligible to join. Click on the JOIN LIQUIDITY POOL button which will be available via the TIO Exchange Member s ’Area. Participants can choose to join or leave the LP daily during the appointed entry /exit time.  How Does The Pool Generate Interest For The Participants? Participants lend their TIOs and other assets to the LP for the company to make markets and provide liquidity via the balance sheet associated with the loaned value of the TIOs and assets in the LP. 50% of the funds generated from the operations of the utilized LP assets will be distributed to the participants in the form of interest. Interest will be distributed to participants of the LP in the form of the various assets that have been generated from the utilized loaned assets in the LP on the trade.i o exchange platform.This includes BTC, ETH, and altcoins depending on the accumulated assets during that days LP loan utilization. Why Do I Loan my Crypto And Fiat But My Interest Is In Other Cryptocurrencies?  trade.io pays the participant( s ) in crypto used by the LP rather than crypto and ﬁat lent to the LP. This is because the company is only generating speciﬁc currencies / assets during that days utilization. Interest will not be disbursed in TIO or ﬁat since there is only a ﬁnite supply of TIO and the exchange/distribution of ﬁat is time consuming and inefﬁcient. Our exchange occurs in multiple crypto currencies and therefore we will pay our lenders in the assets in which we have excess supply. How Do I Beneﬁt From The Pool ?  Your return is based on the following: o How much you contribute o How many other people are in the pool o Your tier level  What the LP generates that day Payouts will be daily, in the instrument that the company has generated Your funds will appear in your wallet without any compatibility issues  Here is an example of how much revenues you could be generate per Tier:    What Are The Risks To Joining The Pool ?  The high water mark is to protect investors meaning no distributions will be made until that high water mark has been reached. There is minimal risk to the participant.

However, I’ve seen so many questions asked about all this on trade.io’s Telegram channel that I feel I need to elaborate on the information provided till now in the Fact Sheet and by the management in the hopes of clarifying some misconceptions that many seem to have.  I feel that the Fact Sheet does not make a proper distinction of the three variables used in the calculation for the potential daily profits and may be a source of confusion for some.  So here goes:  To start, the daily profits are calculated using three independent variables each explained in somewhat simple terms below:  The first variable is calculated as 50% of ALL the profits/losses made on the day by the whole company. This means that all sources of income/costs contribute to the daily profits of participants. This would include: ICO advisory charges, exchange fees, running costs etc. The Fact Sheet in my opinion is a little too optimistic even though I do hope one day we’ll actually see those figures, but basing my calculations on current big exchanges we should be looking at a more conservative value of $2,000,000, short to mid-term, after launch. So let’s base our calculations on a more realistic profit from the LP of $1,000,000 daily (50% of $2,000,000). The second variable is calculated as the individual participant’s total amount of TIO in comparison to ALL the TIOs (of all the PARTICIPANTS) in the pool. This excludes the 50 million TIO seeded by the company as has been clarified by management. The Fact Sheet estimates the total of TIOs participating in pool at 50 million which, based on all factors, seems reasonable. Let’s say I locked in 16,000 TIO. This means that the value for this second variable in the calculation for my personal contribution is 16,000/50,000,000 = 0.00032 Finally, the last variable deals with the various tiers based on the amount of TIOs a participant decides to contribute. and they come in bands as follows: From 2,500 to 4,999; 10% 5,000–7,499; 20% 7,500–9,999; 30% 10,000–12,499; 40% 12,500–14,999; 50% 15,000–17,499; 60% 17,500–19,999; 70% 20,000–22,499; 80% 22,500–24,999; 90% 25,000+; 110% Thus, if we have 16,000 TIOs locked in we would fall in the 60% tier.  As such, the daily profit would be 1,000,000 x 0.00032 x 60% = $192.  What seems to confuse the most is the distinction between variables 2 and 3. These variables are completely independent and as such contributing 15,000 or 16,000 will at the end of the day make a difference in the amount you’ll be getting daily despite both falling in the same tier. Let’s calculate the profits if let’s say I contribute 17,000 instead of 16,000:  1,000,000 (50% of company profits) x (17,000/50,000,000) x 60% (still in same tier as when we contribute 16,000) = $204  i.e. a $12 dollar difference in this case.  With this out of the way, here’s some more info in regards to the way the LP is planned to work:  Whatever amount of TIOs you lock in the pool will always remain the same (unless you withdraw or add to it). So, if I put in 16,000 TIOs that’s the amount of TIOs I will always have no matter what the USD value of TIO is. The conversion into USD of your contributions mentioned in the Fact Sheet is done internally but does not affect the amount of TIO per se. The daily company profits depend on several factors including costs for running the operations. As such, there might be days where losses are registered. This means that only once these losses are covered can participants start seeing profits again. Having said that, trade.io will be the front-line risk capital which means that losses are first and foremost covered by the 50 million TIOs seeded by the company so participants are pretty much covered from losses unless the company goes completely belly up.

Hey friends, what's going on ?  I believe that,  most of you are getting the information about launch of new exchanges everyday, & offerings free airdrops to promote & increase their user base. This is all because Crypto market potential is very big. Some experts reveals that, by 2025 Crypto market would be $40 trillions. So the Blockchan  developers are working to give their best to attract the institutional investors. Trade.io is also from one of them, which is equipped with all the required mechanism for giving smooth trading experience anywhere anytime. I think it has a potential to be the next binance, Kucoin or Coss, because the best part is, it has also it's own native token which is already trading on world's best trading platform now. And it's own trading platform is ready to launch on 17th July also. The preregistration is going on. https://trade.io  So this is just a reminder that if you missed the binance or any other good exchange's token, than this could be a better chance to hold it, because the price is very less now. Visit the above mentioned exchanges & buy some if you wish. Token code: TIO You may buy with BTC OR ETH The current price on Kucoin is $ 0.37  Thank you!!

Quote WHEN IS THE EXCHANGE BEING LAUNCHED AND WHAT WILL IT INCLUDE?  This is by far the question that myself and our support staff are justifiably asked the most. The answer is prior to the end of April. Note the following key points for the launch below:  WE ARE ROLLING OUT THE LAUNCHES OF BOTH EXCHANGE & LIQUIDITY POOL IN STAGES  < We will initially launch the exchange with around 10 tokens including BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, TIO and others. As the exchange grows, as our client base grows and as we continue to prove to you - our community - the strength and reliability of our technologies, we will ramp up more and more currencies over time, eventually offering hundreds of tokens to create the ultimate in diversity for our community.  < The launch will initially occur to a select group of TIO holders who will thoroughly and rigorously test the environment. We anticipate that this will take a few weeks maximum, before we will make it available to the entire world.  < At launch the exchange will be crypto to crypto only, meaning that withdrawal will be available initially in crypto currencies only. We're delighted to confirm that we are currently pursuing certain licenses which will enable our exchange participants to deposit or withdraw by fiat at a later stage. We anticipate this will happen by Q3 of this year, and as always will provide updates accordingly.  < The platform will be unlike anything you’ve seen before. As we have outlined thus far, it will be a fully customizable interface allowing traders to tailor it to their specifications with our numerous trading widgets and views.",False

After a few successful roles, it wasn’t actually until his marriage and the birth of his child, that he realised he wanted more for both himself and his family. And that’s when he decided to build up a network and business for himself.  At that point, it was the early days of thedot.com boom, and he knew plenty of people involved in making websites. Luckily enough he had the aptitude for it so he started teaching himself HTML. His sheer determination to succeed and ability to adapt to an ever-changing digital world reflects the type of person he is and how far he will go to teach himself all of the tools of the trade. https://medium.com/@trade.io/introducing-trade-ios-highly-experienced-and-innovative-cto-7653f25c24d9",False

Not only are we working to adapt to the ever-changing regulations in the crypto-space, but we are also responding to the concerns and needs of our own community. So, why not take things to the next level? Our talented staff and innovative leaders are excited to present to you weekly articles with updates that are both informative and engaging.  I’d like to begin with my own update on a pretty hectic, yet exhilarating schedule which will include a number of important and potentially game-changing talks that I am giving.  Dealing w/ Regulation  One of the largest parts of my role setting up the trade.io Hong Kong office is making sure that we are regulatory compliant, and are in the good graces of the regulatory authorities here in Hong Kong, mainly the Securities and Futures Commission. This involves constant and open communication with lawyers and with regulators, in turn, to make sure that everything trade.io does, is compliant on a global scale.  Ivy League RoadShow  A major part of my role as the MD of Business Development is hitting the road, and making sure that trade.io gets its name out there, as well as meeting the top tokens for listing on our next-gen exchange platform, as well as projects for potential consulting roles.  I’m very excited that at the end of this week, I’ll be traveling to the USA for a variety of speaking engagements, and will be looking forward to meeting members of our awesome community. As part of our strategic partnership with Harvard-based ICO, HelloFriend, I’ll be speaking at several of the top Ivy League Universities, including Harvard and Brown, about blockchain, cryptos, and the FinTech scene in Asia.  Cryptoworld Conference  Additionally, I’ll be speaking at the CryptoWorld: Wall Street and the Internet of Money conference in New York City on March, 22nd. If you’re in the city, make sure to pay me a visit. I’ll be on a panel with industry veterans including Stephen Gandel, Senior Editor of Fortune Magazine, Alex Mashinky, VC/Angel Investor/Blockchain Founder, Daniel Aranda, Managing Director of Ripple, and Jonathan Nelson, who is on the SEC advisory board.  Cryptoconomy  After all the exciting events in the snowy Eastern US coast, I will be traveling to sunny Tampa Florida for the Cryptoconomy Summit. I’m looking forward to meeting with other fellow crypto/blockchain enthusiasts, and if you happen to be nearby, please don’t hesitate to reach out.  What’s next?  It seems as if I’m living on the road recently, but that’s the life in an up-and-coming blockchain startup. We are all working very hard, gearing up toward the launch of our crypto-asset exchange in April & May, and will be looking forward to showing you the results of our hard work. I'm still solidifying my schedule for April, but I'll make sure to keep you all informed of my whereabouts.",False

The Blockchain Trade Verification DAPP is live and is available for use by any broker, using data from any trading platform for any asset class.  The Blockchain Trade Verification tool or BTV provides traders with immutable proof that their trades are being executed at fair prices and not being unfairly slipped. It does this by using mt4 reporting servers. Trade data is written into a database which is collected on a daily basis, hashed and saved to IPFS then entered into the Ethereum blockchain. The dashboard then gives users the option to check the saved hash from the blockchain, fetch the data from the server, and compare the two hashes. The hashes being the same are proof that the data has not been tampered with. The data can also be downloaded directly as a CSV for a more granular audit.  https://medium.com/@trade.io/brokers-rejoice-blockchain-trade-verification-is-live-powered-by-trade-io-7f3d6823c01a",False

Quote from: Mislav on December 30, 2017, 09:46:12 PM Hello! New here! After so many attempts to resolve issues with trade.io support, I'm writting to see if anybody hase same problems.  I transferred 0.5 ETH to TRADE.IO ICO on 24.12.2017. but didn't receive my TIO tokens to this day. Their instructions said to pay ETH from ETH wallet ""like"" MEW that is not exchange wallet. So I payed from my CoinPayments wallet. When I contacted their chat support why I didn't get TIO tokens, they said I have to send 0 ETH to their wallet to get tokens. Problem is that CoinPayments doesn't allow 0 ETH transactions. Minimum transaction is 0.0024 ETH (0.0012 + 0.0012 fee).  From that time till today, after many mails and chats with different persons (which I suspect are all fraudsters) I haven't been able to get my tokens I payed for. What I got was another amount of money transferred to them by their chat support instructions:  ""Scarlet O'Neil   02:54:12 am      Ok. I'm not getting a response from Funding team whether the tokens have been sent out yet or not. But in either case, you will need to change the wallet address in your member area to MEW. Here is how to do it:  Send 0.004 ETH to 0x58f75ddacffb183a30f69fe58a67a0d0985fce0f  AND  email funding@trade.io the following:  a. Account UserID b. The TxHash of the 0.004 transaction c. The new wallet address to be used    Do this first.    I will follow up with Funding about the tokens.""  So I payed even more, 0.004 ETH and sent everything they asked for to Funding, cc to Support. No reply from Funding.  After that I got this e-mail from Support:  ""Hello,  As previously explained to you via email and chat, we cannot change your wallet address anymore. You will need to seek Metamask help how to send 0 ETH in order to retrieve the tokens.""  Now I'm so confused will I ever get my tokens as CoinPayments doesn't respond to e-mails and I don't know how to send 0 ETH from initial wallet, and trade.io members area doesn't allow me to change wallet to MEW nad send 0 ETH from there. And whst the hell is Metamask now???  Trade.io has confirmed that they received my payment but are doing nothing to send me tokens. Just going in circles and feeling miserable.    ""HI Mislav  I am very sorry to hear of your poor experience and i assure you that everything is by the book. I have looked in to this and can confirm we have received your purchase. If you cannot see your TIOs on your MyEtherWallet (or the wallet you have used) kindly follow the below instructions:  👉How to receive your Trade Tokens:  Due to additional security measures please use the following “Token Retrieval Process”:  To securely retrieve your tokens from the crowdsale contract you must send a transaction of 0 ETH to the tradeio.eth with advanced data 0x8d8f2adb.

It seems that the problem occurred when you made a contribution from an exchange which if you see clearly all over trade.io website, telegram, instructions in members area, video, pdf and etc, You Should Never Send from Exchange, and it recommended MyEtherWallet.  The recommendation came after research to avoid problems such as this.  To answer your question I must first explain how an ICO works. A smart contract was created, at which nobody can interfere with.  That means that whenever someone sends Ethereum to the address of the smart contract he will be allowed (locked to that specific sender address) a specific and correspondent amount of tokens. That means, you send ETH from your wallet, your wallet is entitled an X amount of Tokens.

New here! After so many attempts to resolve issues with trade.io support, I'm writting to see if anybody hase same problems.  I transferred 0.5 ETH to TRADE.IO ICO on 24.12.2017. but didn't receive my TIO tokens to this day. Their instructions said to pay ETH from ETH wallet ""like"" MEW that is not exchange wallet. So I payed from my CoinPayments wallet. When I contacted their chat support why I didn't get TIO tokens, they said I have to send 0 ETH to their wallet to get tokens. Problem is that CoinPayments doesn't allow 0 ETH transactions. Minimum transaction is 0.0024 ETH (0.0012 + 0.0012 fee).  From that time till today, after many mails and chats with different persons (which I suspect are all fraudsters) I haven't been able to get my tokens I payed for. What I got was another amount of money transferred to them by their chat support instructions:  ""Scarlet O'Neil   02:54:12 am      Ok. I'm not getting a response from Funding team whether the tokens have been sent out yet or not. But in either case, you will need to change the wallet address in your member area to MEW. Here is how to do it:  Send 0.004 ETH to 0x58f75ddacffb183a30f69fe58a67a0d0985fce0f  AND  email funding@trade.io the following:  a. Account UserID b. The TxHash of the 0.004 transaction c. The new wallet address to be used    Do this first.    I will follow up with Funding about the tokens.""  So I payed even more, 0.004 ETH and sent everything they asked for to Funding, cc to Support. No reply from Funding.  After that I got this e-mail from Support:  ""Hello,  As previously explained to you via email and chat, we cannot change your wallet address anymore. You will need to seek Metamask help how to send 0 ETH in order to retrieve the tokens.""  Now I'm so confused will I ever get my tokens as CoinPayments doesn't respond to e-mails and I don't know how to send 0 ETH from initial wallet, and trade.io members area doesn't allow me to change wallet to MEW nad send 0 ETH from there. And whst the hell is Metamask now???  Trade.io has confirmed that they received my payment but are doing nothing to send me tokens. Just going in circles and feeling miserable.    ""HI Mislav  I am very sorry to hear of your poor experience and i assure you that everything is by the book. I have looked in to this and can confirm we have received your purchase.

The agreement allows trade.io the ability to provide Civic's revolutionary identity verification services for the convenience of future users in the trade.io ecosystem. Civic's verification service reduces the overall cost of know your client (KYC), removes inefficiencies, enhances security and privacy, and greatly improves the user experience.  trade.io, which also provides the industry's first liquidity pool, which distributes up to 50% of daily revenue to liquidity pool participants, intends to utilize Civic's identity verification services to qualify clients for the liquidity pool and trade.io exchange. By offering Civic's services, it will be able to cut down the time to onboard clients in an AML-compliant manner significantly.  Commenting on the partnership, CEO Jim Preissler commented, ""In the world of finance there is a delicate balance between being AML compliant, but also providing your customer an efficient, scalable solution to make sure they're accessing our platform, and trading in a short amount of time. After extensive vetting, we were happy settling upon Civic who is without question the leader in this field.""  Civic CTO, Jonathan Smith remarked, ""We were intrigued withtrade.io's experience in the industry and approach to ensuring compliance and adhering to regulatory matters. We are looking forward to a long mutually beneficial relationship withtrade.io.""  trade.io is currently in the midst of its ICO and has raised over $18.2M thus far from over 7,000 participants. In October, Civic made headlines by raising over $30M which at the time was the largest ICO raise of 2017.

Thank you all for your comments. As everyone very well knows, we have recently revised both the Liquidity Pool rules as well as TIO pricing based on market reaction as well as ETH pricing. There are no plans at the moment to proceed with any additional changes. Some concerns might be valid due to Ethereum's recent increase in price but please do take into account that once our token is listed on online exchanges, its price will skyrocket so participation at any cost will yield profit many times over. Hard cap does not affect the overall progress and functionality of our project at all so, it's not necessary to do anything about that.",False

For those of you who have purchased tokens during this ICO, take note of the following.  If your purchase was successful from your wallet, follow the below to retrieve tokens.  Due to additional security measures and following Ethereum’s best practices, we added an extra security layer to our Trade Token retrieval process.  In order to retrieve Trade Tokens once you have a successful transaction, which can be found here on Etherscan:  https://etherscan.io/address/0x86fe3c20379ac71ebbf8c0499b41fd2b457e4e9e  1. Send a 0 ETH transaction to tradeio.eth 2. Gwei = 60 3. Gas limit = 250000 4. +Advanced data = 0x8d8f2adb (this is very important) 5. Generate Transaction 6. Send Transaction  Upon doing this, you should retrieve your Trade Tokens.  Please note you will only be able to retrieve tokens if you have a successful transaction on etherscan.  Additionally, again, due to the network congestion, we are noticing a large amount of failed transactions to purchase Trade Tokens that were at one time pending.  We highly suggest checking to see you transaction was successful, and if not, you should attempt to resend your Trade Token purchase.  1. If your purchase was not successful .i.e. FAIL, try again with higher gas and gwei.  2. If your purchase is PENDING, wait for it to resolve to either FAIL or SUCCESS.  3. If you send it and no confirmation comes back and even if you have the TxHash code, searching on Etherscan returns :  ""Sorry, We are unable to locate the Transaction Hash""  What happens is that when the blockchain gets heavy traffic, your transaction (sending ETH or receiving tokens) will be put in a queue and could take anywhere from 5min-5hours to go through.  What you can do is to wait and check the TxHash on etherscan.io every few hours. If it fails, try again and set the Gwei to 80 or higher and gas to 250K or higher. The higher the Gwei and Gas the faster the transaction will be processed.",False

Tokens provide a secure, anonymous way of paying for goods and services by using a number to represent an algorithmically generated virtual wallet ID.  The tokenization of the economy is accelerating as more commerce is transacted with tokens and digital money via transparent, cryptographically secure smart contracts. Consumers are quickly learning of the benefits of using smart contracts to buy and sell goods on the peer-to-peer network. Disintermediation of middlemen allows travel reservations to be made at 30 percent cheaper. Fractionalization enables art aficionados to buy shares in great works of art. Real-time asset and activity monitoring allows insurance contracts to assess damage and pay out on the spot.  Consumers will have to wait a little longer for instant gratification though. The financial system has failed to keep up with a tokenized commercial world. The tokens and cryptocurrencies used to access these smarter services lack the liquidity to provide sufficient trading and risk management opportunities.  Trade.io exchange Trade.io’s solution is to develop an exchange platform for the sharing economy where traders can not only exchange tokens, crypto and fiat currencies and other assets but also share in the risk and revenue of the liquidity pool. To participate in the liquidity pool, members buy 2,500 Trade Tokens secured by financial assets in their trade.io wallets. Crypto and fiat currencies are accepted as collateral.  Trade Token owners share in 50 percent of the gains or losses of the liquidity pool, which are distributed to the wallets of pool participants. Besides trading fees and commissions, revenue is earned from investment banking and P2P lending fees. The revenues are allocated based on the level of token ownership, starting with a 10 percent stake for those who own 500-999 tokens. Over 5,000 tokens, a 10 percent bonus is added, resulting in a 110 percent gain to the investor’s wallet, as the case may be. Members can also use their wallets as collateral for other exchange participants through the peer-to-peer lending program, allowing members who require margin interest to borrow from peers at cheaper rates than exchanges typically charge.  Playing by the rules Meanwhile, trade.io’s investment banking service is working hard to help more innovative businesses running on smart contracts enter the crypto economy. The management team is leveraging its strong experience in foreign exchange trading and investment banking, including  IPOs, to advise companies on token issuance and initial coin offerings (ICOs) on the more efficient digital ledger system. Trade Token holders can invest in initial public offerings (IPOs) and ICOs, as well as benefit from preferred access to ICOs, discounts and other market benefits. Pre-ICO, trade.io has a Seed & Venture Fund to support the development of Blockchain technologies. In a crypto economy in which many crypto exchanges are operating outside the purview of regulators, trade.io provides added security as a licensed bank and financial exchange. As China and Morocco outlaw unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges and other countries sweep them under the regulatory regime, the management team is applying its expertise in regulated financial services businesses to ensure the trade.io platform has proper compliance and risk management systems in place.  Trade.io ICO The ICO launched on Dec. 7, 2017. Two-thirds of 500 mln Trade Tokens (Symbol: TIO)  will be available for crowd sale.",False

Well, I'm out of this as you can't say anything  EtherDelta is a decentralized trading platform that lets you trade Ether and Ethereum-based tokens directly with other users. The objective of EtherDelta is to allow anyone to trade Ethereum-based tokens. This makes it a perfect solution for people looking to exchange cryptocurrency ICO tokens. They have agreed to list the TIO token and we had an announcement a while back related to this. Why would you say that your post was deleted if it was about EtherDelta and were not breaking any forum rules?",False

Thank you both for your comments and concerns. What you are saying is understandable and reflects the opinion of some.  Please keep in mind the following: The initial PRE-ICO rules stated that with 1 ETH, participants, would receive 200 Trade Tokens. The hard cap had to be revised based on market and member concerns as well as due to the sharp increase in Ethereum's price (up 175% in less than a month's time - $300 on 09/11 up to $522 on 29/11), making it easier for everyone to participate as well as the project more realistic. Trade Token pricing was thus reduced by a factor of 5. So, this was reflected in the revised price of 1 ETH for 1000 Trade Tokens with everyone receiving 1000 TIO instead of the original 200. Moreover, all PRE-ICO participants had been given an additional 150 TIO as a bonus for their early participation and trust, raising the final actual PRE-ICO price to 1ETH for 1150 TIO. Essentially, PRE-ICO participants have received for 1 ETH, 250 more Trade Tokens than early ICO participants (first week's ICO pricing stands at 1 ETH = 900 TIO). That's 28% cheaper. After having proceeded with this fair adjustment, we had received a lot of praise by most PRE-ICO participants for which we are thankful.   General Information: If an organisation isn't quick to react and adopt it is doomed to fail. Rest assured that trade.io will not keep changing it's game-plan if there is no valid reason for it. We had to take decisive action due to the many major changes that have happened during the last month. We also had to take notice of our members' comments. Please keep in mind that no one has been left uncompensated and that all of the early contributors received an additional bonus number of tokens as a thank you over and above what was originally agreed. The reaction we've received from industry experts around the world as well as forum members and contributors, the increase in the number of funds flooding in during the last stages of PRE-ICO, the number of inquiries and membership applications we are receiving right now in the days leading to the ICO, as well as the revision seen in regards to the reviews our project is getting all indicate that the changes made were wise and widely accepted.  Once more, thank you for your comments and concerns. Any opinion or advice from dear members is always welcome.",False

In regards to question number one, here is the updated information based on the new Trade Token price:   In order to participate in the liquidity pool, clients must commit a minimum of 2,500 Trade Tokens as a membership fee.  A Graduated Plan will be used when it comes to the participants’ daily share of the profit as per the table below (Trade Token participation):    As the table suggests, the higher the amount of the participation is, the higher the percentage share of the profit will be with 25,000 Trade Tokens being the minimum number of Trade Tokens locked for full / maximum profit share (Investing 25,000 Trade Tokens and above carries an additional 10% as a bonus).   Example of Liquidity Pool Participation  To illustrate a sample situation using the graduated plan in the table above, let’s take the following hypothetical situation:  Participant A has locked 2,500 TradeTokens - this means they will be eligible for 10% participation. Participant B has locked 12,500 TradeTokens eligible for 50% participation. Participant C has locked 25,000 TradeTokens eligible for 110% participation.  Now, let’s assume the 3 participants above are the only participants in the liquidity pool and $10,000 was generated in revenue on a hypothetical day:    Participant A accounts for 6.25% of the Trade Tokens found within the liquidity pool (40,000 Trade Tokens x 6.25% = 2,500) or a share of $625 out of the $10,000 generated revenue ($10,000 x 6.25%). Since they are entitled to only 10% of their share, their allocation for the day would equal to 10% of $625 or $62.50.  Participant B accounts for 31.25% of the Trade Tokens found within the liquidity pool (40,000 Trade Tokens x 31.25% = 12,500) or a share of $3,125 out of the $10,000 generated revenue ($10,000 x 31.25%). Since they are entitled to 50% of their share, their allocation for the day would equal to 50% of $3,125 or $1,562.50.  Participant C accounts for 62.50% of the total number of Trade Tokens found within the pool (40,000 Trade Tokens x 62.50% = 25,000) or a share of $6,250 out of the $10,000 generated revenue ($10,000 x 62.50%). Since they are entitled to 110% of their share, their allocation for the day would equal to 110% of $6,250 or $6,875.   In regards to your second question an announcement will be made when necessary.

This is the only way to safeguard yourself and your assets. In regards to our project, it is not just about a software solution. Where did we give that idea? It is a whole trading platform - an unrepresented at that. There is a whole ecosystem with hundreds of people behind it. There are tremendous costs involved to acquire all those licences as well as connections with the global financial industry and a lot of R&D required to proceed with something that was never done before. Plus, it includes a Liquidity Pool where all participants will be bale to deploy funds found within to fund upcoming projects thus boosting global development. Keep seeking the truth and it shall be given to you - a wise man said! Have a great day and thanks for your concern and question.

And how will this help the Investors?  And to the people involved in liquidity pool?  Thanks for your valid question. The purpose of the adjustment is trust building. There were a lot of comments regarding the fact that our previously suggested hard cap that was in the range of $450-990 million was simply too high and unnecessary. Many of our investors were reluctant to invest just because of the huge risk they perceived in this number. It cost too much for investors to participate in the project and their participation within the project as well as within the Liquidity Pool would be simply to small - percentage-wise - had the original number stayed. Taking into account the fact that Ether now costs 25% more than what it did just before the start of PRE-ICO, we simply had to listen to our members' and investor's comments. This now makes for a more 'personal' trading platform and Liquidity Pool.  Can you explain more on ""personal"" trading platform? So does this mean that every time investors complain about the way you do things you're just gonna adjust with their liking? And every time your members will suggest something, you're sure to comply to their suggestions? Or does this only relates to the ethereum's price? Like what happened now. Will you eventually lower the minimum amount of tokens to join the liquidity pool if people will demand it to be lower? Or will you just lower it if ever eth's price will increase more?  Again thanks for your question. We have proceeded with only two adjustments during PRE-ICO (this is a very early stage with our project still in its infancy): The price of the token and Liquidity Pool participation requirements based on the market reaction.  If an organisation isn't quick to react and adopt it is doomed to fail. Rest assured that trade.io will not keep changing it's game-plan if there is no valid reason for it. The reaction we've received from industry experts around the world as well as forum members, the increase in the number of funds flooding in as well as the revision seen in regards to the reviews our project is getting all indicate that the changes made were wise and widely accepted.",False

This change was made only once and it won't happen again. In regards to the fluctuation in Ethereum's price (and all crypto assets for that matter), it is understandable that this is just the way it is and it's impossible to proceed with solid predictions as well as expect that every time there is a change we will be re-adjusting our market cap or the price of our token.

PRE-ICO ends on the 25th of November. ICO will last from the 28th of November till the 15th of December. Thanks for looking into our project - it's much appreciated.

How much would the coins be after ICO? Would it still be the same?  Thanks for your question and consideration. If we have understood your question correctly, once ICO finishes (15/12/2017), Trade Tokens will be distributed (by the 15th of January). All unsold tokens will be burned. A month after that (somewhere along February 2018) Trade Tokens will be listed within major trading platforms where everyone will be able to sell and buy at the market's then current price (prices will fluctuate based on demand and supply) as is the case with Bitcoin for example.

I think this would be the point, whenever someone has a token or is a contributor , they would have shares of their dividends. I'm not quite sure of the disadvantages.  Thank you bamb and thank you creatine413 for helping other forum members out. Not everyone will have the necessary funds at all times to be able to participate in the liquidity pool. There will be days that for some reason trade.io members will prefer to invest their funds elsewhere. Taking this into account we have made it so that everyone will be able to join in and out on a daily basis. Due to the number of participants of the liquidity pool, we don't feel that this will have a great effect on the pool and its performance as there will be always members jumping in and out...   Quote from: laurenB7742 on November 20, 2017, 09:37:46 PM Trade.io is number 5 on the list of ongoing ICOs by the amount of ETH raised so far. This is quite impressive and that's how I found your project. I see that you have many ideas so I am sure you will spend all the money wisely. I see Trade.io as a long term project, so investors don't need to worry about token price. When the online stores start operating and tokens start circulating, the price will only go up. It's interesting that average contribution to this pre-ico is more than 11 ETH which means big players also backed this project.  Thank you very much laurenB7742 for your informed opinion and for sharing this with forum members.

Quote from: creatine413 on November 20, 2017, 06:06:45 AM Quote from: Bakukang on November 19, 2017, 11:14:09 PM Its good to know that they are paying much of their attention for their consumers and costumers of this platform.And what about their liquidity pool?  I think in their liquidity pool, you have to use the Trade Token to participate in the trade.io shared liquidity pool. Users that are participating will ge their share of dividends which is a good thing for consumers/users  Thank you creatine413 for helping out other members and trade.io    So essentially, trade.io is a next generation trading platform or broker.  In contrast with all of the currently established brokers, trade.io will be sharing 50% of its proceeds with its clients (traders). This 50% will go into what is called a 'liquidity pool'.  trade.io clients (cell them traders, members and so on!) will be able to add their share of the funds they have available for investment within the pool (with the minimum amount being 500 Trade Tokens / trading on our platform does not get them a share in the liquidity pool automatically) should they choose to. This way they will be able to get their share of the proceeds trade.io makes (essentially becoming a shareholder in trade.io).  Now, the pool, containing the assets added within by trade.io and its clients will be able to act as a 'bank' financing / investing in new projects, start-ups or organisations through ICOs or IPOs thus having a share in the proceeds this new project will have, further boosting the pool's value as well all participants' share in the proceeds. Everyone participating in the pool will be able to democratically approve where to invest the money with their voting power being based on their share of the total amount of investments found within the pool.  Please keep in mind that liquidity pool participants will be able to join using other assets as well as as major fiat and crypto assets receiving their share back in the same asset they've invested in, but Trade Token will pay the highest return.  Please see our whitepaper by clicking HERE going through point 4 for more details.  Hope this helps! Thank you.",False

I’ll preface my message by being transparent and saying I’m indeed a trade.io supporter and have purchased a large amount of Trade Tokens after having deeply studied this project as well as their whole team.  In return, you should probably be transparent too, and admit you’re a troll with obvious ulterior motives.  The problem is you’re not even an informed troll.  Please sit back, grab a coke and smile while I put you in your place, point by point:  1) There are ZERO board members from FX PRIMUS on the board of trade.io.  Zero means none, nada, zilch.  There is one board member, Damian McDowell, who is on the board of Primus Capital Markets UK, which is an FCA regulated entity that is also on the board of trade.io.  Before you correct yourself and try to work this angle, I’m fairly sure no reasonably minded human being will have an issue with an FCA regulated individual being on the board of a financial company.  With that said, I’m sure you’ll try, and wind up making a fool of yourself in the process.  2) Charles Voltron is the CTO and assisting with the blockchain piece of the trade.io project.  On the website and White Paper, the management is listed.  In case you are new to the business world, management usually means you manage people.  So one could assume that Charles manages a team of people that also work on blockchain, couldn’t one?  If this is a tough concept for you to grasp, you should take a break from being a troll, and read up on how this sort of thing works.  3) Yes trade.io released how much it had raised.  How exactly is this different than any other ICO that reports amount raised throughout an ICO?  Please inform the fine people of this message board, Senor Troll.  4) Yes, it appears they raised $2.4M in ETH and the rest appeared in fiat (note I said fiat and not fiat money as that is sort of redundant, kind of like calling a Ferrari a Ferrari Car.)  See #3 for the rest of my answer here.    Obviously your insinuation is that trade.io is fabricating their fund raise…..apart from being a sad troll, any specific reason for this accusation….I’m sure people would love to hear it.    5) Yes, they made a major change to accomodate more participants, not sure what your point is here.  Based on what I observed from their telegram, many people asked about participating in the liquidity pool but didn’t have the money for the 5K Trade Tokens, so the company lowered it.  This is a bad thing?  Lastly, you say you “hope, wish to be wrong and wish success”……no you don’t, you’re a miserable person who more than likely has a sad life.  What irritates me so much about people like you, is that there’s a company here in trade.io that is run by respectable, successful people that is trying to do things the right way on multiple levels…not by a bunch of kids that have never run a business in their lives.  Trolling is a part of the internet and message boards and it goes with the territory…the problem is you’re a bad troll with lame arguments, and above all baseless accusations.    I hope you find peace in your life, and can’t wait to see the success of trade.io to shut trolls like you up once and for all.  P.S. People, just check this guy's profile and posts. For him talking about transparency is unfortunate and ironic at best. He's a newbie with just 7 posts under his belt ALL of which with the specific purpose of slandering our project. Is this a coincidence? Are his motives pure? Draw your conclusions...  ",False

Everyone trading on our platform will have access to real-world prices thus providing fair trading to all - something that isn't the case with traditional forex. This in itself is a huge advantage over traditional forex trading and a huge reason for someone to use our platform rather than our competitors'.  Additionally, for people that will be able to participate in our liquidity pool (they will need to lock a minimum of 500 (scheme just changed) of their tokens as a participation fee), our platform will offer the unrepresented advantage of sharing 50% of its profit with its traders. Participants will be able to join for short periods of time, even for just 24 hours since the pool will be sharing its proceeds on a daily basis. This is groundbreaking in contrast with traditional investments that require your funds to be locked for a specific period of time sometimes up to a year or even more. The liquidity pool provides freedom never heard of before as well as transparency in regards to its real performance.  Another positive aspect of the liquidity pool is the fact that it will be able to fund upcoming ICOs / IPOs giving the right to its participants to vote which projects will be funded, empowering pioneering projects / technological breakthroughs that would otherwise stay unmaterialized, boosting global advancement.",False

That's how we learn and we should never stop learning!  So essentially, trade.io is a next generation trading platform or broker.  In contrast with all of the currently established brokers, trade.io will be sharing 50% of its proceeds with its clients (traders). This 50% will go into what is called a 'liquidity pool'.  trade.io clients (cell them traders, members and so on!) will be able to add their share of the funds they have available for investment within the pool (with the minimum amount being 500 Trade Tokens / trading on our platform does not get them a share in the liquidity pool automatically) should they choose to. This way they will be able to get their share of the proceeds trade.io makes (essentially becoming a shareholder in trade.io).  Now, the pool, containing the assets added within by trade.io and its clients will be able to act as a 'bank' financing / investing in new projects, start-ups or organisations through ICOs or IPOs thus having a share in the proceeds this new project will have, further boosting the pool's value as well all participants' share in the proceeds. Everyone participating in the pool will be able to democratically approve where to invest the money with their voting power being based on their share of the total amount of investments found within the pool.  Please see our whitepaper by clicking HERE going through point 4 for more details.  Hope this helps! Thank you.

This is what EVERYONE should be doing BEFORE proceeding with investing their hard-earned assets into anything new.   There are literary hundreds of ICOs out there right now that unfortunately are taking advantage of the 'unregulated' current nature of ICOs, creating a bad name for those few legit projects. This is by the way, an area we wish to address with our project. NO ONE should simply follow a hype or the crowd when it comes to investing. EVERYONE should keep asking questions until they receive satisfying answers BEFORE proceeding.  We wish to assure you that our project is legit and that trade.io will not make a run with our investor's money.  Please keep in mind that we are really into the early stages of our project and as is the case with all projects being at their infancy, there are still details being cleared out as we speak. For example: Depending on the amount collected during ICO, the number of adopters that come along, the number of major investors that join our program as well as the number of the technical alliances that trade.io proceeds with, the different the outcome, the final functionality, acceptance, team configuration and board configuration will be. Please keep in mind that this is ALWAYS the case - this is reasonable.  Every successful organisation must be able to swiftly adopt within a constantly changing environment as well as listen to its clients' comments. It is impossible for any given organisation to disclose ALL of the details behind their business to the public.  Despite the above, once trade.io enters the official ICO period, more information and details will be disclosed to everyone's satisfaction. Please stand by for this.  A LOT of detailed information is constantly provided in our Telegram Group in real time. Please feel free to join - YOU HAVE TO JOIN actually!

The response to our liquidity pool has been overwhelming! However, trade.io's management has decided to revise the minimum number of Trade Tokens required for participation based on the feedback we received from our dear community members and supporters.  Please find the exciting details below in regards to the revision made (comments taken from our updated whitepaper):  In order to participate in the liquidity pool, clients must commit a minimum of 2,500 Trade Tokens as a membership fee.  A Graduated Plan will be used when it comes to the participants’ daily share of the profit as per the table below (Trade Token participation):    As the table suggests, the higher the amount of the participation is, the higher the percentage share of the profit will be with 25,000 Trade Tokens being the minimum number of Trade Tokens locked for full / maximum profit share (Investing 25,000 Trade Tokens and above carries an additional 10% as a bonus).    Example of Liquidity Pool Participation    To illustrate a sample situation using the graduated plan in the table above, let’s take the following hypothetical situation:  Participant A has locked 2,500 TradeTokens - this means they will be eligible for 10% participation. Participant B has locked 12,500 TradeTokens eligible for 50% participation. Participant C has locked 25,000 TradeTokens eligible for 110% participation.  Now, let’s assume the 3 participants above are the only participants in the liquidity pool and $10,000 was generated in revenue on a hypothetical day:  Participant A: 2,500 Trade Tokens (10%) Participant B: 12,500 Trade Tokens (50%) Participant C: 25,000 Trade Tokens (110%) Trade Token Total in the Liquidity Pool: 40,000  Participant A accounts for 6.25% of the Trade Tokens found within the liquidity pool (40,000 Trade Tokens x 6.25% = 2,500) or a share of $625 out of the $10,000 generated revenue ($10,000 x 6.25%). Since they are entitled to only 10% of their share, their allocation for the day would equal to 10% of $625 or $62.50.  Participant B accounts for 31.25% of the Trade Tokens found within the liquidity pool (40,000 Trade Tokens x 31.25% = 12,500) or a share of $3,125 out of the $10,000 generated revenue ($10,000 x 31.25%). Since they are entitled to 50% of their share, their allocation for the day would equal to 50% of $3,125 or $1,562.50.  Participant C accounts for 62.50% of the total number of Trade Tokens found within the pool (40,000 Trade Tokens x 62.50% = 25,000) or a share of $6,250 out of the $10,000 generated revenue ($10,000 x 62.50%). Since they are entitled to 110% of their share, their allocation for the day would equal to 110% of $6,250 or $6,875.",False

Thus a large amount of funds came from deposits.  2) The response to our liquidity pool has been overwhelming. However, the feedback by some in our community is how they can participate if they don’t have the minimum 5,000 TradeTokens. Well, management has taken this feedback into consideration, and is happy to announce a revised liquidity pool schedule that allows those with as few as 500 TradeTokens the ability to participate using a graduated schedule.  So basically to my understanding is that many people wanted to participate in the trade.io project but wanted to do so if there was a chance to participate in the Liquidity Pool. Because there's many people that wanted this, management found a fair way to make this happen.  The table found above, illustrates how a participant with 5000 Trade Tokens, gets 110% participation, so that people who already have participated with trade.io get an added benefit.  At the end of the day, the bigger the pool, the better for me and you and everyone. Is a win-win situation here.

Except that the guy is SUPERMAN,  I don't see him ending all 4 projects  I hope is not coming another out of subject answer.",False

For trading, the Trade Token will be used for maximum profit, but other types of currency will be accepted as well, crypto as well as fiat.   Quote from: Mysterious01 on November 13, 2017, 09:50:51 AM Burning of tokens is a wise idea but could you enlighten me about this phrase ""percentage burned will also be matched across other allocations"". I'm a little bit puzzled with this phrase.  Thank you for your query.  Based on our initial planning, 500 million Trade Tokens will be issued. From that, a specific percentage is reserved towards the liquidity pool, another towards Advisors and Vendors, and yet another towards Founders and Developers. Based on the percentage of unsold tokens, if any, an equivalent percentage of reduction will be made towards the allocated percentage of tokens reserved for Advisors and Vendors and Founders and Developers.  What does this mean in numbers - as an example:  The original number of tokens issued towards PRE-ICO and ICO is 275 million and the original number of tokens issued towards Founders and Developers is 100 million. If 247.5 million are finally sold (with 10% left unsold) it means that the same reduction of 10% will be made on the total allocated number of tokens reserved towards Founders and Developers, thus they will keep 90 million instead of the original planned 100 million (100 million - 10% = 90 million). The number of Trade Tokens originally allocated towards the liquidity pool won't be affected by the outcome of the token sale (it will stay at 50 million).  Please visit our website to see the numbers by clicking HERE. Hope this helps. Thanks.

It will pave the way for - hopefully - others to follow leading in a transparent global market promoting and solidifying trust between all parties involved.      Thank you for your query. For Pre-ICO, we’ll be accepting payments via Local Bank Deposit, Ethereum & International Bank Wire. If you have Bitcoin, there are instructions in the Members Area (website: trade.io) to convert to Ethereum. For ICO, we will only be accepting payments via ETH. The reason that most companies only offer ETH during the ICO, is for automation, as during ICO many of the wallets include smart contracts, which are automatically disseminated into the clients' wallet at the time of purchase.

Yes, our platform will support major crypto as well as fiat currency.  Each member will be able to participate in the liquidity pool with a minimum of 5000 Trade Tokens as a fee frozen towards the needs of the pool. Each member will have of course the option of investing more in the pool either via Trade Token, fiat or crypto currency. This way, they'll have a higher share in the pool's earnings as well as bigger voting power come election time (on where to invest and which project to support (ICO/IPO). The idea is that each pool member will get their share of profit in whatever currency they've initialy invested in. So, if a member added for example $2000 (over the 5000 Trade Tokens) in the pool to have an extra share, they'll be receiving the earnings back in USD (plus their Trade Token share of the earnings). The same principle applies of course if a member invested Bitcoin instead of USD or both, and so on...  Of course, the project will expand as time progresses and new or different features might be added based on the market's needs...

Message noted and private message sent.   Quote from: zedkiel08 on November 11, 2017, 05:04:10 AM There is a slight that i did not get in this one , can someone explain it , thanks in advance .  ""At end of the ICO, all unsold Trade Tokens will be burned. Additionally, the percentage burned will also be matched across other allocations with the exception of the liquidity pool.""  Thank you for your query.  Based on our initial planning, 500 million Trade Tokens will be issued. From that, a specific percentage is reserved towards the liquidity pool, another towards Advisors and Vendors, and yet another towards Founders and Developers. Based on the percentage of unsold tokens, if any, an equivalent percentage of reduction will be made towards the allocated percentage of tokens reserved for Advisors and Vendors and Founders and Developers.  What does this mean in numbers - as an example:  The original number of tokens issued towards PRE-ICO and ICO is 275 million and the original number of tokens issued towards Founders and Developers is 100 million. If 247.5 million are finally sold (with 10% left unsold) it means that the same reduction of 10% will be made on the total allocated number of tokens reserved towards Founders and Developers, thus they will keep 90 million instead of the original planned 100 million (100 million - 10% = 90 million). The number of Trade Tokens originally allocated towards the liquidity pool won't be affected by the outcome of the token sale (it will stay at 50 million).  Please visit our website to see the numbers by clicking HERE. Hope this helps. Thanks.",False

On top of Forex trading (obviously trade.io will offer the same functionality), trade.io offers the following:  Full transparency thanks to blockchain technology. Everyone trading on our platform will have access to real-world prices thus providing fair trading to all - something that isn't the case with traditional forex. This in itself is a huge advantage over traditional forex trading and a huge reason for someone to use our platform rather than anything else.  Additionally, for people that will be able to participate in our liquidity pool (they will need to lock a minimum of 5000 of their tokens as a participation fee), our platform will offer the unrepresented advantage of sharing 50% of its profit with its traders. Participants will be able to join for short periods of time, even for just 24 hours since the pool will be sharing its proceeds on a daily basis. This is groundbreaking in contrast with traditional investments that require your funds to be locked for a specific period of time sometimes up to a year or even more. The liquidity pool provides freedom never heard of before as well as transparency in regards to its real performance.",False

Everyone trading on our platform will have access to real-world prices thus providing fair trading to all - something that isn't the case with traditional forex. This in itself is a huge advantage over traditional forex trading and a huge reason for someone to use our platform rather than anything else.  Additionally, for people that will be able to participate in our liquidity pool (they will need to lock a minimum of 5000 of their tokens as a participation fee), our platform will offer the unrepresented advantage of sharing 50% of its profit with its traders. Participants will be able to join for short periods of time, even for just 24 hours since the pool will be sharing its proceeds on a daily basis. This is groundbreaking in contrast with traditional investments that require your funds to be locked for a specific period of time sometimes up to a year or even more. The liquidity pool provides freedom never heard of before as well as transparency in regards to its real performance.'  &  'TradeToken holders may receive other coupon benefits such as preferred access or discounts on future products or new listings. To summarize, TradeToken’s act as:  - a lower cost medium of exchange on trade.io - a store of value that can be used to purchase goods and services - a membership key in the trade.io wallet to the liquidity pool - a coupon enabling wallet participants to receive higher levels of benefits - a coupon for preferred access to products or new listings on trade.io when used in the wallet'   Quote from: Sevaev on November 10, 2017, 07:35:36 AM I hope the project has a big future, good luck all the way, I am with you.

What if an investor would like to buy again trade tokens or other interested people who missed the pre-ICO and they prefer to use fiat and altcoins to participate in ICO because they out of funds of ETH?  Thank you for your query. That’s a very good question! What we can do is make exceptions for certain people with high dollar purchases, and if that includes you, then simply email us at VIP@trade.io. The reason, for your information, that most companies only offer ETH during the ICO, is for automation, as during ICO many of the wallets include smart contracts, which are automatically disseminated into the clients' wallet at the time of purchase. It’s convenient for both the company doing the ICO and the customer. Feel free to check out our website's FAQ section found HERE for more details. Check points 5 to 7.

The token holders that trade in trade.io ecosystem will be given an opportunity to contribute certain amount from his/her e wallet to P2P Liquidity pool.

Some numbers in regards to FXPRIMUS our first of our early adopters: - 9 years of trading experience - Transactions of well over $180 Billion annually - Over 150 trading instruments - Industry first $2.5 Million insurance policy - Over 500.000 active members trade on their platform  FXPRIMUS has already committed into adopting the trade.io platform.  Our platform will revolutionise trading since it will be the first ever fully transparent broker platform featuring much lower fees as well as offering the opportunity to traders to have a share in our profits by participating in our liquidity pool where 50% of all the platform's profits will be allocated.  'What's in it for us' you may ask! Well, in all honesty, by gaining the trader's trust, we will expand our clientele exponentially. We are also planning to acquire a Swiss Banking license and Launch trade.io Investment Bank sometime in July 2018, thus keeping all the profit that is now being funnelled into the established status quo of globalist institutions. At the same time, 50% of these otherwise lost profits will be ending up within the liquidity pool and back to the traders with everything being fully transparent.",False

They have already proceeded with multiple road shows as well as global announcements in related magazines and news channels and was really curious as to why these people haven’t appeared in the forum yet! It seems that they have finally arrived – Welcome!   I’ll be definitely joining trade.io and keep a close eye as to what they are up to because their project is set to be one of the most successful ICOs yet!  16/11/2017 Update: STOP THE PRESS! MORE GREAT NEWS ABOUT trade.io! PLEASE SEE BELOW (I am quoting here):   We are really excited to announce a major change in regards to the requirements of participation in the liquidity pool.  The response to our liquidity pool has been overwhelming! However, trade.io's management has decided to revise the minimum number of Trade Tokens required for participation based on the feedback we received from our dear community members and supporters.  Please find the exciting details below in regards to the revision made (comments taken from our updated whitepaper):  In order to participate in the liquidity pool, clients must commit a minimum of 2,500 Trade Tokens as a membership fee.  A Graduated Plan will be used when it comes to the participants’ daily share of the profit as per the table below (Trade Token participation):    As the table suggests, the higher the amount of the participation is, the higher the percentage share of the profit will be with 25,000 Trade Tokens being the minimum number of Trade Tokens locked for full / maximum profit share (Investing 25,000 Trade Tokens and above carries an additional 10% as a bonus).    Example of Liquidity Pool Participation  To illustrate a sample situation using the graduated plan in the table above, let’s take the following hypothetical situation:  Participant A has locked 2,500 TradeTokens - this means they will be eligible for 10% participation. Participant B has locked 12,500 TradeTokens eligible for 50% participation. Participant C has locked 25,000 TradeTokens eligible for 110% participation.  Now, let’s assume the 3 participants above are the only participants in the liquidity pool and $10,000 was generated in revenue on a hypothetical day:    Participant A accounts for 6.25% of the Trade Tokens found within the liquidity pool (40,000 Trade Tokens x 6.25% = 2,500) or a share of $625 out of the $10,000 generated revenue ($10,000 x 6.25%). Since they are entitled to only 10% of their share, their allocation for the day would equal to 10% of $625 or $62.50.  Participant B accounts for 31.25% of the Trade Tokens found within the liquidity pool (40,000 Trade Tokens x 31.25% = 12,500) or a share of $3,125 out of the $10,000 generated revenue ($10,000 x 31.25%). Since they are entitled to 50% of their share, their allocation for the day would equal to 50% of $3,125 or $1,562.50.  Participant C accounts for 62.50% of the total number of Trade Tokens found within the pool (40,000 Trade Tokens x 62.50% = 25,000) or a share of $6,250 out of the $10,000 generated revenue ($10,000 x 62.50%). Since they are entitled to 110% of their share, their allocation for the day would equal to 110% of $6,250 or $6,875.",False
