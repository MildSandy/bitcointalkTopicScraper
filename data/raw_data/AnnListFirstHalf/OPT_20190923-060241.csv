Literally the whole team left that was marketed during ICO.

Its the same case with most ICO's however most of them are smart enough to at least continue to make money in the market however due to matteusz being young, busy with school and such, he doesnt have the drive nor the skill to operate in the crypto environment. Plus considering how things have happened after ICO, like i said the whole entire team leaving without notice, matteusz probably took it over and tried to continue on so it doesnt look like a direct scam and they can use the excuse of needing more time to prolong it and not tarnish his name since he is trying to do other things at the moment.",False

The original team from ICO all left immediately after raising the money; what happened to the money and who got what is unknown. Matteusz took over officially, he was the only one who didnt leave, and they have made false promises for the past year+. Development is horrible/nonexistent, the beta app was very bad and to be honest this project is likely going to go no where even if music on the blockchain was a good idea. There is no updates because there is nothing to say, or maybe because the marketing manager they hired immediately left as well, that Hubert Dolata clown, he works for a different project now. The only reason they didnt formally just shut the project down and run with the money like the scam it was is because Matteusz has tried to make a blockchain incubator company (Nextrope) so he doesnt want to give himself a totally horrible name since then no one would come to him.

They keep employing kids, not professionals and this is how they dig a grave for themselves. You need people with knowledge and long years of experience to know what the fuck you are doing and how to get there. I've seen it soon after ICO, how they managed everything... It's really unfortunate how people with no clue on how successful businesses work, started with such projects. I hate to be rude, but this is just simply a fact. Let me give you an example... They were adding artists one by one, which i don't have a problem with, however, having artists will never make the platform succeed. It's the buyers/listeners who will. Inventor job is to bring as much traffic/users to join as possible and make them stay, having artists is secondary and can be substituted with buying music rights for the start. When you start hitting numbers with active users, guess what happens?! Singers, musicians, even more famous ones will come naturally without you even asking them. This is the basic principle of how things should go not the other way around. If you are unable to bring buyers (in this case listeners) everything else is a waste of time, no matter how many developers you have... Oh and no one gives a fuck about technology especially if it doesn't do what it supposed to - make income for content producers, which i can assure you it doesn't.  Similarly, dumb crypto teams are developing their own PayPal's and Stripe's, announcing how many businesses/merchants now accept money through their stupid coin payment processor and people are cheering them up, LOL. It's not about the merchants, it's about the users who actually pay with this shit coins, which there are none. Barely anyone seems to understand that, but you should if you are investing your hard earned money.  Anyway have a nice day",False

There is so many childish mistakes on the player its unreal. You will never get a direct and truthful answer from them so dont bother asking. They have many shady and questionable practices. Also, there is no lockup on the team tokens. I contacted a few of the original team members, who mind you left the project RIGHT after the ICO (who does that) and they cited that they all sold out already, and gave the excuse of crypto volatility is too much for them. How they sold when tokens were supposed to be a 1 year lockup is beyond me. Where the ICO funds went and why did they go through multiple mixers is another questionable thing. The only hope this project has is for someone with big pockets  to run and pump and dump since the market cap is so low, wouldnt take much to pump it. However to do this, we need a better exchange and they dont have any desire to get listed and even if they did, I highly doubt any reputable exchange would list them since they all do heavy due diligence now on team members, ICO funds, github activity and such, and OPUS has the most questionable answers in regards to these areas. Team members all left after ICO, literally every single one as you can see in the original post, including the CEO, ICO funds through mixers, github has 0 activity for over a year, they have no chance to get listed. Plus they couldnt afford the listing fees either way. I wouldnt even bother with this project, maybe buy a few hundred dollars worth at these prices since its basically at 100-200 sats now and roll the dice for a lucky gamble. The released players barely play music, if at all, and has so many little mistakes it makes you facepalm. Sad that these criminals dont get arrested for fraud.  Only reason they are still around is to not totally give nextrope, which is Matteusz ICO scam company, a worse name than it already has. How they list OPUS as a ""sucess story"" its insane.

I already well described it HERE:  Quote from: Deepfoelife on July 07, 2018, 01:03:50 PM Do you know how many ETH Opus team raised during ICO?  ~ 17000 ETH.  The established OPUS STREAM LTD capital is 3000 GBP. (https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10603019/filing-history)  - These guys came to us with beta version of platform which completely differs from the one we have now. - The road map completele differs too. It was made the way to get more money during ICO  (established mainnet month was December 2017, together with promises about Bittrex listing from the CEO it seemed the best way to get money from investors). - The team is differs too.  Everything they promised and showed us bacame useless and lie after they got our money: - no ""biggest"" (as stated by CEO) exchanges; - no team of developers; - no office; - useless roadmap and whitepaper; - the CEO disappeared from the Slack and Telegram. Then the CEO was changed.  EVERYTHING AROUND OPUS ICO WAS SHOWING UP TO GET MORE MONEY.  What happen next? - You just got the money let's LAUNDER IT.  Seems like they really started to take care about the project.... but the way they do it... seems like it's another SHOWING UP thing:  - no working platfrom. In the latest update they stated that a lot of bugs are fixed, but I just tried to play the tracks - ITS STILL DONT WORK. - conferences? Lol, who need it? It worth couple of dollars to rent a room and told couple of words to the few people... another ""showing up"". Instead of it you guys beter make the working platfrom and invite couple of superstars as you promised us. Those conferences are USELESS. - with such raised funds, the way everything happens is too slow.  Seems like you guys just LAUNDERING OUR MONEY and really spend 3000 GBP or lil bit more on making SHOW insted of real work.  And I think everything that will happen next around Opus (all the delays, no working product, no better exchanges) will only confirm this point of view. Will see.   AND HERE:  Quote from: Deepfoelife on July 07, 2018, 12:26:47 PM Yall still have faith in this project?  Why nobody outlined the way this team solve exchange issue?  Everybody remember how they promised to get on better exchanges in Q2 and they even made official post about it. CEO of Opus Mateusz Mach (yeah, right, it's not more that Chinese guy that dissapeared after they got our money, the wonder way Mateus became CEO and they even didnt told us about it )  stated in telegram that this issue will be discussed and solved in 1-2 weeks after the May release.  What we have seen instead of it? - ""We will discuss exchange issue in our next weekly update"".  ""All right, we will finally get all the details about listing"" - were our thoughts. But.... It was another update about update about update  ""We recognize the importance of appearing on exchanges for the benefit of our users, who will have easier access to our tokens and, as a consequence, to the services offered by the OPUS Player. As such, we will discuss in depth any plans regarding exchanges when we launch OPUS on the Ethereum main network.""  BOY WHAT    Quick overview about ""Opus & exchange promising issue"":  1. The very first time CEO of project Mateusz Mach promiesed us exchanges was time before they raised their funds. He told us that OPT will be ""90% on Bittrex"". When you states such information means everything is ready to listing and only thing is have to be done is make tokens transferable. Otherwise it's SPECULATION to raise more funds. And yes IT WAS SPECULATION from the CEO.  2. After they got our money their ""priorities shifted"" and they promised DISCUSS exchanges issue after they move to the Poland.  3. After 3 months of movement to the Poland they discuss it in their favorite way: ""the exchange issue will be discussed solved in Q2 after the platform release"".   4. The next ""promising"" step I discussed above: at the end of Q2 they said that they really care about investors and considering exchange issue as one of the main issues so they ""will discuss in depth any plans regarding exchanges when we launch OPUS on the Ethereum main network. (august - september)"".  And guess what? What is the time when their 109 millions of OPT will be unlocked? - Right, it's September, the month they shifted to another detailed discussion about exchanges. And I didnt told yall they will finally solve it and will slowly dump their tokens to the market. I think it will be another update about discussion     Here is the definition of the ""LIE"" word:  1) a false statement made with deliberate intent to deceive; an intentional untruth; a falsehood.  3) an inaccurate or false statement; a falsehood.  Remember Mateusz Mach statements about Bittrex, remember all the Phillipp's statements about exchanges and platfrom release details and make it like 1+1.

First, the whole original team were all classmates at NYU Abu Dhabi together, including Matteusz. If you look at the original post that shows the original team, they are all GONE, including Bokang. Some of them even sold their tokens they said (what about team 1 year lockup?) citing that they just couldnt handle the crypto volatility. Since day 1, no one made a public appearance other than Matteus in the slack/discord/telegram. No one from the team has ever been around and after the ICO, the project went silent for 3 months. Matteus then brought Phillip onboard, a polish friend that has been with him since nextrope early 2017, months before the Opus ICO, same with Konrad their CTO. Nextrope was originally just a tech company; websites, mobile apps, marketing etc and then recently they are trying to be a Blockchain ICO incubator company, citing Opus as one of their success stories LOL. I guess they figured out how easy it is to make a few million in the ICO space based on nothing. If you go to their website, it looks like they are trying to launch a few more ICO's, all the websites are just copy/pastes of each other, including Nextrope and Opus. Has there ever been an ICO where literally the entire team dissapears from day 1? Matteusz is probably trying to just milk the scam from being exposed so he doesnt tarnish his name, since he was somewhat known in EU Forbes for developing a sign language app. Yes, the beta is SEVERELY buggy, more buggy than it should be for a team of ""skilled developers"". There can be bugs found in many tech projects, but this one is like to a different level. Complete amateur mistakes, like they didnt even proof read anything before they released it publicly or glance over things. We get bullshit answers always, on delays and the fact that its been a year and they havent even attempted to get listed anywhere. My thought is no exchange would list them because exchanges do somewhat of a due dilligence and Opus just stands out in shadiness. There is a million and one red flags, why all the ICO money was sent through mixers and withdrawn, where the funds are and how they are being spent, where the original team went and why did they all dissapear, why is the beta insanely buggy and not even functionable; does it even use a blockchain at all? All they are trying to do is delay the inevitable, so they dont look like complete scammers and tarnish their name...they will just blame it on failure to adopt over time and the market. I wouldnt waste your time on this project, there is no liquidity to even sell if you wanted and there will never be. It's a complete scam, there is no other explanation, there is too many unanswered questions and all we get is vague bullshit excuses or ignored when mentioned. It's a shame it happened this way, they didnt even try to milk the project for what it could've gotten, they were just happy with the ICO money and they are trying to do it again with other Nextrope projects.  You can check it out here http://nextrope.com/ Same layout as Opus, Matteusz is just focused on making more ICO's and stealing money from idiots, he has no concern with building Opus as a successful or working project. Just a bunch of polish scammers, and they are idiots at that. I guess its true it does take 5 polish people to change a lightbulb; one to hold it and 4 to turn the chair.",False

A couple of things you forgot to mention is how their PR dude, Philipp, is very ban happy. When they released their updated roadmap, I was one of the only people that questioned their shady tactics and how they changed everything once their ico ended. Rather than answering my questions, I was met with a ban. To this day, Philipp still throws out threats of banning every other day and who knows how many bans he's given.  Philipp also stated several times that he reads every message on telegram, but 90% of all questions are ignored and usually the only ones he answers are questions he has repeatedly answered, rather than new questions. In otherwords, he's purposely ignoring our questions if he reads them and doesn't answer them.  They keep stating that they will do an AMA ""soon""^tm, and yet after a year, they still refuse to do something so simple that only takes an hour or two to do.  Since the team refuses to do an AMA to answer questions, they have been asked several times to join the telegram and step in every now and then to answer a couple questions, but again, refuse to do it.  This ico, team, and project have been one massive shit show. But jokes on us, they already have our money and have nothing to lose.",False

The long-awaited OPUS Player is available on the App Store for iOS (available here) and on the Play Store for Android (available here), as one of the world’s first functioning implementations of the blockchain. The web player is also available on our new website: opus.audio, with a limited amount of content.   For Mobile App Users  We are incredibly excited to announce the release of OPUS for iOS and Android. As a decentralized app, we have become a pioneer in the blockchain world with one of the first widely accessible blockchain apps on the market.  You can download the iOS app here and the Android app here.  There is still quite a way to go, as the app is based on the TestNet, similar to the Web Player released a few days earlier. As such, transactions are not based on actual tokens and we encourage everyone to test the apps as much as they can while we conduct extensive research to ensure a smooth user experience.  We are aware that there will be bugs and errors in the beta, but we are releasing the player nonetheless so that as many people as possible can help us find those errors and get rid of them.  We are looking forward to soon releasing many more exciting news!  OPUS is teaming up with more and more artists from around the globe, so our library will keep growing and you will have the opportunity to explore new music from a huge variety of genres.  When we are certain that the platform is fine with the small amount of content on there, more artists will add their tracks by the day.  With this release, OPUS has become one of the world’s first platforms based on the blockchain. We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved and look forward to many more successes down the road. Of course, there is still a lot of work to be done, and we will be fixing issues as soon as they come to our attention.   For Web Player Users  We are releasing the first beta of the OPUS Web Player on the TestNet to test all the functions.  Over the next few weeks, we will be conducting extensive tests, taking feedback, and fixing any issues we find on the OPUS Web Player. We want to ensure that the UI/UX is intuitive and easy to use, for artists and fans alike.  The player can be accessed below for fans and for artists.  Fans: https://player.opus.audio/ Artists: https://artist.opus.audio/   Artists  While OPUS works closely with many artists from around the globe, the library currently available will be quite limited as we give artists time to upload their music. It is important to stress again that we are in the testing stage, and our music library will grow significantly in the coming weeks.  Presently, the platform is less about the amount of content, and more about how well everything is accessible and how smoothly everything runs. When we are certain that the platform is fine with the small amount of content on there, more artists will add their tracks by the day. Contact  We ask kindly for patience while we fix any issues we encounter, bearing in mind that we are more concerned about technical and graphical issues right now, than with the size of the library; and encourage everyone to get in touch with us on any of the following if you find anything that needs fixing:      Email contact@opus.audio     Facebook www.facebook.com/opusfoundation/     Telegram t.me/opusfoundation     Medium medium.com/@info_62555     Reddit www.reddit.com/r/opusfoundation/   Our two new email addresses are:      contact@opus.audio: used for all correspondence regarding OPUS.     artists@opus.audio: used for correspondence with artists, both those who have already joined OPUS and those interested in coming board.  Our current email address, info@opus-foundation.org, will remain functional and will continue to be checked during this period, but we strongly encourage everyone to use the new addresses provided above.

The news is not huge but it is more than enough imo to confirm that the project is very active, is setting up and taking the right steps to build up the foundation.  Most of the info is on their blog (https://medium.com/@info_62555) and new discord community channel. Also on their official twitter.  - Tokens have been burned as promised. Cryptocompare still has the wrong volumes but coinmarketcap has adjusted the volumes. - Roadmap progress has been updated - Community manager is on board, new developers are being hired in Poland (team is first relocating there in a few weeks) - Advisory board start-up and first advisor is on board. - The first artists should be announced in the coming weeks (confirmed on discord). Will be smaller artists for what I read but its a nice step into making the connection with players in the industry itself. - New communication channel on discord  I've also asked the team on discord if they would set up a streaming service in the future (think for example of the 'all-you-can-stream' monthly subscriptions on Apple music or Spotify) and they confirmed they will look into a streaming option in the future (IMO a quite important decision since a lot of the music industry revenue comes from streaming instead of per unit or per album buys)  They confirmed on discord they will also apply for binance in one of the monthly coin community contests and they are also in the voting list of C-Cex now. To be honest I'd be surprised if they would win these votings right away at this point in time because there are several bigger coins to be listed still if I'm not mistaking.. but the fact that they are listing up for votes atleast shows the right intents.

For those not in the know, Opus is a music platform that allows both streaming & purchasing songs, while in the same time being very artist-oriented & offering musicians a nice way of getting heard & earning money.  At this point of time, it is no secret that hardly any independent artist can rely on music sales as the main — or only — way of making a living. Pretty much the only way to make it financially is touring & selling merchandise, and all of that at the same time the music streaming market is worth billions of dollars. What is unfair is the fact actual artists are only getting a thin slice of profit, while someone else is turning rich, and this is what Opus is going to change.  Much like many cryptocurrency related startups, Opus is about equity & fairness, and do not agree with traditional way of doing things. We fully support the company for their dedication & business model (100% revenue for music makers: way to go!), and advice that you check out their live demo.  The only thing that is unfortunate is their bounty program has recently ended, we'd love to let more people know of opportunity to support nice initiative while earning tokens at the same time; hopefully Opus will start a new campaign soon. / Thanks, ICOBounty.co",False

Let’s start with the Bounty campaign as this is strictly related with the Crowdsale which finished just a few days ago. All of the stakes will be given to our contributors in the next two weeks. We very much appreciate your help and engagement and it would be great if we could sustain the same kind of partnership when the product is ready to launch.  A lot of people have been asking us about exchanges and some of them definitely got wrong our last announcement. We never said we do not want OPUS to be listed on the exchanges and it is definitely not our goal. However, listing on the exchanges is not our priority at the moment. We respect your vote of confidence and it is exactly why we are going to devote a majority of the funds for the product development. Because we did not raise as much as planned we will need to change the proportions described in the whitepaper and devote more for development. We believe in the long-term perspective of the project and making the product as easy to use for users as possible is one of our biggest steps. Of course, the buyers who don’t want to wait several weeks for bigger exchanges might check out Etherdelta. Even though we did not contact them, our token is going to be listed there. Please remember that because of the tighter regulations a lot of exchanges changed their process of verification. One of the best examples is Bittrex which did not add any new coin since August 1st. At the end of the next week, we will release next update and we would like to keep it that way so you can learn more about our dev. You can expect there more news regarding the burning of the tokens.  Thanks!",False

Some exchanges have reached out but we can't say anything final on this matter right now. Regarding the future, we are here for the long term success of Opus as a music platform for artists. Later this year, as we finalize things, we will be releasing additional details regarding new team members, Our permanent office, Shifting roles of the current team, and new artists / advisers. In fact, we have already met a few who are interested in joining us on our team. It will be an exciting year, not to mention potential scaling upgrades we are exploring(Raiden, EOS, custom chain and Pay Per Play) which have been brought up by you guys. We are excited and and we hope you are also excited for the future of Opus! We have noticed concerns that we have not sold as many tokens as we had originally intended (133M out of 900M). However, we would just like to reiterate here what we have said earlier. The amount will only affect the speed/scale, not the actual development of Opus. We will published a more revised development plan later as we incorporate additional members onto our team. Following up on our pledge to ensure more decentralization, we will be burning the foundation's tokens. Burn address will be announced soon. Thanks again for supporting us during this hectic time!

Any project that respects itself says in disclaimer that the tokens are not intended for speculation or can guarantee any specific value for them. This is in order to cover their ass and avoid stupid lawsuits.  Mateusz said on slack it will take couple of weeks to list on exchanges. They are in contact with bittrex about listing. He said listing for sure won't be on this week since they are busy with other stuff.  I think everyone waiting to make a quick buck should relax, If you have made even a  finder nail worth of research before investing you would have seen that there were no exchanges planning to list the token with 100% certainty at time of ICO. This is just FUD from people that don't have patience.  Give the team some time to breath. It will come, it just needs time. Tokens transfer will be enabled after block #4211033. Anyone can trade them OTC and transfer them.   If you want the project you invest in to succeed you can't bash it with negative FUD just because you are impatient or have not done your research properly.  Relaaaaxxxxxx....",False

Opus collected almost $6 million which is a good amount for the project. Especially as they already have the beta system running - the development costs won't be that high really (anyone with experience in IT can acknowledge this). I assume the majority of the collected funds will in reality go towards marketing which is the major aspect of success in any business.  Also the tokens for the devs are not an issue at all - it's not a huge amount since they will burn the same percentage of the foundation’s tokens as from the crowd sale supply. Furthermore, 95% of their tokens are locked for one year.

As I understand it: each tune is encrypted with a single symmetric key by AES256 and the encrypted tune is stored on IPFS this symmetric key is distributed to each purchaser in end-to-end encrypted fashion via Ethereum smart contract, whereas the symmetric key is encrypted with the purchaser's public key for each purchaser individually  This means: whoever knows the key and the IPFS hash can listen to the tune whoever purchased the tune knows the key and can potentially share it publicly moreover, encrypting the same key with millions of public keys will reduce the strength of the encryption (the whitepaper doesn't state if RSA or ECC key pairs will be used or how many bits they plan to use, so it's hard to quantify this flaw. 'lightweight' might mean few bits.  One way around this problem would be to end-to-end encrypt the tune for each purchaser individually. But this would mean that there is one file per purchaser that has to be stored (and one IPFS hash per tune and purchaser that has to be stored on the Ethereum blockchain). I doubt that such an amount of data can be stored economically, even with filecoin-like incentives.  Another question is: who knows the tune's symmetric key and is able to encrypt it for new purchasers? Will the publisher have to run a node that does this for new customers?",False

Opus is 3 steps ahead. We raised a round of VC funding this January, and now we have a working beta and a demonstrable product.  2. Voise, Is simply a coin that can only be used on their website. That's it. It's basically bitcoin with a different name. Opus is an entire music sharing infrastructure. We use IPFS and Ethereum such that all songs and metadata data are stored decentrally and rapidly on the IPFS swarm and Ethereum.

Uploading tracks The Opus foundation’s core uploader will provide an interface between the IPFS and EVM. Uploading tracks can also be achieved through any third-party uploader that follows UMRN formatting and the Opus encryption algorithm. Uploads that don’t follow the correct standard will result in music tracks unable to be played and purchased by other third-party Opus players, thus reducing their potential market.  What if a third-party uploader does not follow the correct format?  Track uploads are guided by economic game theory. It costs a tiny fraction of OPTs (Opus tokens) to register tracks to the UMRN. If a third-party uploader does not upload according to specification, other players will not recognize the track, and sales from that particular uploader will be reduced. Since artists want to have a broad reach, they will upload tracks in the correct format and correct metadata to access the biggest market.

We got Bitcoin & Ethereum. IPFS is simply just the next big thing and thus, seeing that this project is use both IPFS & Ethereum is a good point.  I've been reading the whitepaper really fast, it might be possible that I missed the point. It is also possible that you already answer the question (a basic Q&A could be good, there are always too much gerbish comments on announcements thread to read everything). Do not hesitate to point me out to somewhere that have the answer instead of losing your time repeating things     You are comparing your service to Spotify and Deezer which are streaming platforms. Both allow us to :  - Listen music for free (no subscription plan), even if they pay for, because adds are giving enough income. - Listen music without adds or limit with a pay subscription plan.  I may have badly understand Opus, but it doesn't seems like it is a streaming platform and doesn't allow any of the 2 points above. But then, why would you compare to Spotify & Deezer ? If it is not a streaming platform, how is it different from some kind of decentralized marketplace we already have ? Do we have to pay for each song we would like to listen ? (big deal) Can we download and listen music offline ? (this one isn't a big deal because in ~ 10 years, we'll all have unlimited data and network everywhere).   Your are speaking about 0 censorship. I don't understand. Is there a team at Opus who will valid songs ? Let's study a case with the lovely Taylor Swift. Let's say she releases a new song :  - Spotify : She connects to her account who has been validated by Spotify team. She had to provide documents proving she is Taylor Switf while registering her account. She sends her song to Spotify and negotiate a price per 10k/listening. Spotify release the song. If someone other than Taylor Switf try to send Taylor Swift song, it will not get accepted because the guys doesn't have the right on it.  - Opus : Does the artist have to provide proof of ownership on the song ? How do you protect artist from stealing ? If Opus team is monitoring new songs to protect artist from this, who tell us that you're not censoring others song ?  Also, does an artist have to pay for uploading one song ? Because IPFS storage cost some money. If not, who pays for it ? Opus ?",False

It's great you have doubt. As always we recommend you understand a technology fully before investing. Now to answer your questions.  First there is a Q&A. It is in the Navbar of the website. Most of these questions are answered there.  Regarding the verification system I will paste the answer here. Quote We, at the Opus foundation, frown upon infringing music. As such, we will be removing infringing songs and music from our Core player, just like youtube does. We will not permit copyright infringing content. If we find copyrighted content, we will try our greatest efforts to claim revenue back, if the artist can prove ownership. Unfortunately it is impossible to control what 3rd party players do and they should be advised to remove infringing content as well.  These 3rd party players use APIs to communicate between IPFS and Etherem and are not endorsed Opus foundation but, like anything blockchain related, they can also use the infrastructure that is running on IPFS and Ethereum. This means that they may be a small risk of rogue players sharing copyright infringing songs. But you should keep in mind that this has nothing to do with Opus foundation. Think (Bittorrent and Piratebay) are nothing related but they use the same infrastructure (P2P)  Ofcourse on the internet there will always be imposters and rogue 3rd party players. And while Piratebay exists, fewer and fewer people use it. The reason is because many people do care about the artist, and want a great experience compared to pirated content on a rogue player that could be shut down at any moment. Think (Napster). Nevertheless, in both situations the Opus network will grow and our budget would increase because the more people use the infrastructure, the great the value of the system. (Drawing parallels to bitcoin in 2013, people were afraid of it's use in crime, yet nowadays people use bitcoin for normal goods because in the end the legitimate service will always win.  Regarding the storage costs, there are solutions to IPFS hosting such as Filecoin which can be paid for through the opusDAO treasury. Storage is extremely cheap however, and music files are small so this will not be an issue.  We compared ourselves to Spotify/Deezer because a majority of our market share is currently in those services.  Hope it cleared up some doubts, for more questions do ask the Devs on slack!",False

It doesn't fully answer my questions though. See them below.  Quote What makes Opus different from central streaming services? The question leads to understand you are a streaming service. However, the main goal of streaming is that it is temporal. From what I understand, you are not a streaming service but a music marketplace. As stated below, it is rather permanent  Quote Once you purchase the decryption keys to Opus tracks, they will be yours permanently on the decentralized IPFS no matter where you are in the world. If we can't pay for a subscription plan, then is there a possibility we pay for some kind of temporal access to the song ? (eg, 0.001$ for a one time listening) ?  Quote Regarding the verification system I will paste the answer here. Quote We, at the Opus foundation, frown upon infringing music. As such, we will be removing infringing songs and music from our Core player, just like youtube does. Ouch. This seems so much like censorship isn't it ? I mean, firstly, comparing to Youtube, who is censoring MANY videos & artist was the worst idea ever   Then, again, what tell me you are not censoring some music ? Everything can't be decentralized I agree. And this part is not decentralized (simply because it cant). In this case, I'm not sure the world uncensorable is right. While I'm not saying your team might delete tracks on purpose because they don't like it, you might receive threat sooner or later !

It will benefit that more people can see it and get clarification.  1) Yes we are a streaming service and also not. We are streaming in the sense that when fans are listening through our Core players, the music files are decrypted and streamed on the fly Songs do not need to be pre-downloaded. Now, we are not a streaming service in the sense that users need to pay for songs only once and upfront. It's useful to note here that Amateur artists can set a low price such that songs can essentially be ""streamed""  2) The reason we did not go for a (Pay 0.001$ per play) is because we are a development team focusing primarily on existing and technologically feasible solutions. There simple isn't a system (even if Ethereum reaches serenity with raiden, sharding, LX etc...) that can handle tens of millions of microtransfers per minute with close to 0 fees. It's easy to advertise this but when you look at decentralized technologies it's simply not feasible technologically at this moment.  3) Hence you are free to use 3rd party players that may not be fully legitimately developed. I like to point to the PirateBay in this instance with less and less users by the day. History has shown time and time again that users will prefer to pay a small amount to use a legitimate service that supports artists than try to use a un-reliable player that serves illigetimate music. Ofcourse Law enforcement will also limit the success of non-legitimate players. Us removing infringing tracks isn't censorship it's basic intellectual rights. If we for instance censor songs we don't like then 3rd party players can legitimate offer those tracks and attract our ""core player"" fans.  And thanks again for asking these questions on behalf of others",False

Firstly, you seem to try taking shares from Deezer and Spotify. I think it's an error : the public going to those platform is interested in listening a LOT of music unlimitedly. A vast majority of this public is incompatible with what you are trying to accomplish. The target of your platform (as state in your whitepaper) is more focus on pure artist' fans, which is far more restrictive and have a smaller public (= less money flowing). I agree that, in your configuration, a pay per play seems totally unfeasible, considering that the gas price for a single Ethereum transaction is 2-3$. But is it even viable for song purchase, which are I guess (I never buy songs), somewhere near 1$ each ? If you need to pay 3$ for a 1$ song, it's not viable neither.  So I came with a potential solution. I mean, I'm also a dev (never dealt with blockchain though), I know that what I will say seem simple but is really not that simple in practice. Why wouldn't you create your own chain ? This chain will have 0 fees, allowing both pay per play and buying song. Miners could be rewarded with Opus coins, which would allow them to either sell them or use them to listen music. We could even imagine the mining software integrated in the player. Those who mine would get free listening. Now come the question of blockchain size and number of tx/s. It would be huge, that's right, but there are solutions currently being developed, eg, by Vitalik (https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/06/26/state-tree-pruning/, https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ). With this chain, no need of Ethereum anymore and those high fees. You'll still need of IPFS though, but as you said, fees are low.",False

And sure. the public can still listen to a LOT of music effectively unlimitedly but that is up to the individual arist. What we do is give them freedom in what they can charge. And yes one of our biggest audiences is artist's dedicated fans (As those are who will be supporting artists who can afford to charge premiums if they wish), however that is not the ultimate goal of Opus.  We know Ethereum's potential but from a technical perspective, it's unlikely for tx costs to go significantly lower than $0.0001, which would still be a significant cost to stream. Your solution also failes to realize that mining has a huge hidden cost in terms of inflating the supply. While it's not visible to each individual user, every token mined/issued to secure the network dilutes existing token holders. In addition, as specified in the whitepaper, securing a POW chain such as Opus against massive streaming sites is very difficult. Remember each hash costs $ from the network. To protect against individuals and institutions who may have incentives to disrupt Opus (Look into Ropsten network attacks) we would need a secure chain and Eth main chain is the go to solutions, especially with respect to those upcomming EIPs",False

On the core player (Player by the Opus foundation) we will follow all measures to identify and remove the infringing content that exist on the network. We will not permit copyright infringing content. If we found copyrighted content we will try our greatest efforts to claim revenue back if the artist can prove ownership.  Regarding 3rd party players. These are using APIs and not endorsed Opus foundation but, like anything blockchain related, they can also use the infrastructure that the running on IPFS and Ethereum. This means that they may be a small risk of rogue players sharing copyright infringing songs. But you should keep in mind that this has nothing to do with Opus foundation. Think (Bittorrent and Piratebay) are nothing related but they use the same infrastructure (P2P)  Ofcourse on the internet there will always be imposters and rogue 3rd party players, however, so does Piratebay exist and fewer and fewer people use it. This is because most people care about the artist and want a great experience vs pirated content on a rogue player that could be shut down at any moment. Think (Napster). Nevertheless, in both situations the Opus network will grow and our budget would increase because the more people use the infrastructure, the great the value of the system. (This kind of reminds me of Bitcoin in 2012, people were afraid it would only be used for crime, but nowadays people use it for everything because in the end the legitimate service will always win)  Also the dev team is considering to implement an Oracle system that people can ""Judge"" on legitimate uploads, but because we don't have this planned or experimented this Oracle system just yet we have omitted this from the post.  Hope this clears it up and for more information check our website http://opus-foundation.org/",False

In regards to this, I'm not too familiar with Decent but from what I know, they are trying to build, and I cite, a reputation system of some kind, some kind of netflix, An Amazon(?) and I quote ""Are Into internet of things"". And a chrome cast device. (To be honest I'm not sure how they are planning to do this and their whitepaper not very detailed and they seem focus mostly on buying tokens rather than the technical side; I cite here. ""The best way how to make money when you see the potential is to buy DCTs"". I won't make any comments regarding their legitimacy as I do respect all competition in the field, but I do question their grandiose ambition of targeting every market, even IOT which has very little to do with music.  What Opus is building is specifically and targeted towards music sharing. We have a working infrastructure IPFS/ETHEREUM demo and our Beta is public. http://opus-foundation.com/demo.html Our code is also written and open-source you can check it out here https://github.com/Opus-foundation/contracts Unlike many projects we dont just make wild claims, we are mostly computer scientists and developers and so we focus on the product.

Voise is just a rename of a coin that you can only use on their ""concept platform"".  Quote from: Opusfoundation on July 09, 2017, 03:11:21 PM Quote from: acpr23 on July 09, 2017, 02:56:26 PM Voise VSM recently had their ICO and it is quite a success they are also a decentralized music streaming/sharing platform,  What could be the difference/advantages of Opus to them and other music related crypto?  Sorry to say this, but to call Voise VSM a decentralized music sharing platform is completely incorrect; They they store everything on their central server.  1.Voise raised their money with no product. Opus is 3 steps ahead. We raised a round of VC funding this January, and now we have a working beta and a demonstrable product.  2. Voise, Is simply a coin that can only be used on their website. That's it Opus is an entire music sharing infrastructure. We use IPFS and Ethereum such that all songs and metadata data are stored decentrally and rapidly on the IPFS swarm and Ethereum. We are also going to release APIs for third party player developers to create their own Opus players, ensuring decentralize in every aspect of the stack.

On opus artists can list their tracks for sale. Once you purchase the decryption key to your smart contract, you can read it from the contract forever.  So this is up to the artist. If the artist wishes to allow more people to listen to their songs they could for example list the price as 0.003 OPT. We have designed with playlists in mind with the Directory layer on IPFS, and so ""streaming"" playlists with cheaper songs will appear if the artist wishes the adopt the streaming model. Although that is usually worse for the music community.  And ofcourse if the artists wishes he can list a price of 0 and allow people to listen to the tracks for free. ( And to gain publicity)",False

Sorry to say this, but to call Voise VSM a decentralized music sharing platform is completely incorrect; They they store everything on their central server.  1.Voise raised their money with no product. Opus is 3 steps ahead. We raised a round of VC funding this January, and now we have a working beta and a demonstrable product.  2. Voise, Is simply a coin that can only be used on their website. That's it Opus is an entire music sharing infrastructure. We use IPFS and Ethereum such that all songs and metadata data are stored decentrally and rapidly on the IPFS swarm and Ethereum. We are also going to release APIs for third party player developers to create their own Opus players, ensuring decentralize in every aspect of the stack.  If you have more questions regarding the technical development, check our Github or ask us on our slack: http://slack.opus-foundation.org/  As for Muse, I'm not too familiar with the technical details but it appears what they are doing is kind of a registry (Think ISNB) where artists can register their music. We are a music service platform including storage of music tracks and value stransfer. Actually we are already planning a system similar to Muse's (UMRN) where artists can register their music.

Artists can upload the songs to the platform and just set the price to 0 if they wish to. In that case, it will be completely free to listen to them. The encryption system will offer the same protection to artists.  Speaking of the music festivals, this is a great idea, and would be part of the marketing budget in the money we raise.
