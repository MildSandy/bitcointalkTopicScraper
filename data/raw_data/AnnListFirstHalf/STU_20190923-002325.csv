This will effectively provide a convenient ‘Point Of Exit’ for students (in the UK at least), wishing to cash out their earnings for jobs undertaken through the service.  So What’s a bitJob?  In an ever more competitive job market, University leavers need relevant work experience just to get a foot in the door. Not to mention the fact that some extra cash to fund that fancy student lifestyle wouldn’t go amiss.  At the same time, many employers find it hard to source reliable, skilled and cost effective talent. This is especially true for short term contracts and piecework.  bitJob aims to sit squarely between the two camps and play matchmaker. Students will build a Dynamic Portfolio Resume (DPR) of the work undertaken. This can also be used to apply for graduate positions outside of the service. Employers can view this DPR along with a students reputation profile, to help choose the right candidate.  bitJob Co-founder and CMO Elad Kofman explains:         Show Me the Money  Students can use the service for free and are paid in bitJob tokens (STU) on completion of work. The tokens are being developed on the Ethereum blockchain, and there will also be an option for employers to make payments in Fiat via PayPal.  To encourage participation and promotion within universities, the students’ unions will receive a commission on each transaction through an affiliate program. This will come from fees paid by employers who use the service.   STU tokens will also be available for trade by investors, and the company is currently undertaking funding at the Pre-ICO stage. Pre-sale investors are even being offered a free Trezor hardware wallet.  More information on the service is available in the whitepaper.   And What Can I do with STU?  Outlets on campus will be encouraged to accept STU tokens for items and services such as coffee, study materials, haircuts, etc. As uptake of the program grows, this will open them up to new markets.  Students and investors will also be able to convert STU tokens on exchanges, and bitJob intends to maximize the number of exchanges on which this is possible. It will also be possible to transfer STU to other students (e.g. for that pint your mate had to lend you the money for last night).  Finally, with this weeks announcement, UK students will be able to use their STU to withdraw cash from ATM machines run by BCB ATM UK. And as we all know, for students, nothing talks quite like hard cash.  Landry Ntahe, BCB ATM UK Head of Operations, states:       We aim to facilitate users on the Bitjob platform the means to exchange tokens across the UK through our BCB ATM’s",False

This is expected behaviour.  The minimum in the presale is 22.50 Eth. If someone sends less than this, the transaction will fail. Bad jump means that programmer wanted it to happen when condition was not met.  Occasionally it might happen that not enough gas will result in such an error.

I also like that they offer the option of getting paid in fait or crypto. Crypto is really new still in my opinion, and using PayPal (something every college kid has) makes this an app most people can use.  And the team seems like real people, for once. I never understand how people can fund anon projects; its literally like giving money to a stranger. Who does that?  I like the investbox style feature on the platform; thats a pretty decent rate of return, and if people lock tokens they wont sell them, keeping the price stable.  I might throw a few ETH at this.

We are also negotiating with several leading job search engines to ensure a continuous flow of quality jobs.  With the help of the ICO and our STU token, we will be able to set up an Affiliate program for student associations (for registration of students to the marketplace) and HR companies and search engines firms (for supplying relevant jobs on a regular basis).  bitJob highest value will come from developing new ways to earn money for the HR firms and job search engines firms. Nowadays, both sides are losing. These firms do not get serious revenues from the student segment, due to the dynamic life of the students, making them hard to obligate to fulltime jobs. Blockchain technology gives bitJob the chance to increase the distribution channels earnings from a massive and globally segment, which has been neglected without real alternatives or creative solutions.

It's about time that students will be appreciated by their true skill set! these days, Students are ""all-around players"", they can design, code, analyze, research, you name it! Employers on the other hand are desperate for quality and low cost labor force. they have no place to get that.  We all know how students struggle to pay their tuition. The bitJob vision is to allow the students to earn a living while enriching their online portfolio,  a dynamic digital resume that will be adopted by employers. Every student will get his own Domain-named site with all of his records and reputation assigned to him.  More updates coming soon...

No doubt. But non of them are dedicated for students, they don't even have any students category. They don't have any collaborations to universities, unions, or other academic institutes.  Those platforms got ""ruled"" over by freelance experts (which are not cheap as well), causing students to be left out, students don't stand a chance to get any degree related work in today's freelance platforms.  Fiverr ""gigs"" are not providing real long lasting experience we wish our students to acquire over bitJob platform. A 5$ gig is not something an employer would care about while considering you to a position after you graduate.  In our vision, students could acquire true experience while fulfilling tasks suitable for their skill set level and degree, earn a living, while also be VERY proud in expanding their resume.  All of the above is just an addition to the great benefits of using a decentralized platform to vote, work & connect students worldwide. bitJob will deliver students global education of the amazing blockchain technology.

The plan is to build blockchain solution and record both PayPal and STU necessary activity on the blockchain.  Tasks like member registration, job posting, interviews, job engagement and completion will be stored on the blockchain ( or necessary minimum related to those tasks).  Users will then have the option to choose method of payment. In case they choose to use PayPal, our role will be to make the payment to them in form of FIAT. This might include some conversion fees. We will partner with organizations/exchanges which offer such conversions.  The end result to the user will be that they will receive their pay in the selected currency. Choosing FIAT will have obvious disadvantage in form of additional fees, while choosing STU will have no fees attached to it, other than fees of using Ethereum network and platform fee.  With the time, students will become familiar with the platform and switching to STU will be as hard as making choice in the drop down of available payments.  Allowing FIAT transaction in the platform will increase adoption of  bitjob.io  Once the market becomes more liquid we will work with University facilities like cafeterias, book stores to accept payments in STU.  Possibly down the road more merchants will accept Bitcoin as form of payment and accepting STU will only either require converting to BTC through e.g. ShapeShift or paying directly to the merchant.    We believe this future is not very distant.  Bogdan Fiedur Bitjob CTO",False

We can all agree that Blockchain tech has some major problems: https://cointelegraph.com/news/major-challenges-to-blockchain-mainstream-adoption-industry-view  We are blockchain & bitcoin enthusiasts. We want to see it go mainstream! That is why we chose to do it through education, giving the opportunity for more than 300 million students in India (for example) to get some crypto hands-on experience. We see it as focussing on the right segment, rather than limiting ourselves.  The students segment nowadays holds the sharpest minds of the next generation, but they don't have a true solution for their problems - Experience & Cash. On the other hand, HR firms finding it hard to recruit students, meaning they don't earn money from that segment. We understood the blockchain problems. All the mentioned above are BIG PROBLEMS and www.bitJob.io will solve them. bitJob will actually create a new revenue model for the ""Old World"" HR industry using WIN WIN situations!  💵🎓 bitJob will create revenues from a segment that's hungry for a solution NOW 💵🎓  With that business model we can differentiate ourselves from our competitors. Freelancers today can get work at Fiverr, Upwork and even Ethlance if they look for Blockchain oriented employers. Don't understand me wrong, In the future we do plan on creating several collaborations with relevant freelancers marketplaces...  But first let's deal with millions of students, SMB & SME, globally!

Thanks for the kind words, You are absolutely right. bitJob will reach out to hundreds of millions of students around the world, allowing them work on an Hybrid Platform which enables payments in both STU and Paypal. No tie or limitation for receiving payments in Paypal, no small letters.  We honestly believe that Fully decentralized solutions are not ready yet for global expansion, most of the students worldwide aren't using blockchain or cryptocurrency in their everyday lives. bitJob will educate those students (As you said!) about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. bitJob will endorse those students to use STU token in different ways by supplying incentives. (For example, no exchanges fee from USD to STU, collaborations with supported business around campuses, Affiliates fees by referring their friends to the platform, and much more).  We strongly believe that Education is the key to Blockchain global adoption. We aim to reshape the way Students recruitment industry works (Or actually doesn't work, because it doesn't even exists!  )  Cheers!
