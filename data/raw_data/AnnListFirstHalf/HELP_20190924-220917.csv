We are not kidding, we have better things to do than spam our own telegram chat with accounts. 2. Regarding the roadmap, that iteration is September, October, November (3 months). As you are probably aware, it is only 2nd of November. 3. The main page starts correctly, only when you refresh the page, it doesn't know how to proceed; that is a issue because nginx not being configured to do so - which we are aware of since the day we deployed it, so on this side you can expect everything to be fine with the new deployment - we will probably setup the configuration on nginx or switch to nodejs; there is no apache being involved in our arhitecture 4. Related directly to 3  If you have any other observations, please let us know.  Thank you, GoHelpFund Team",False

Go Help Fund SCAM !!! http://a.radikal.ru/a12/1810/16/8efb1d798449.jpg  So Friends, recently on coinmarketcap.com a HELP token from the go help fund command was added. This token interested me and I decided to figure out what he is the whole project.. Let's start with you a careful study of this ambitious project from go help fund.. The project with careful consideration was very difficult and in its own amazing. Why amazing? Yes, because wherever you look, whatever you start to study carefully, everywhere there is only lies and deception, which in principle is the essence of this ""miracle project"". But first things first..  1. Let's start with the office address listed on the team's website: Fundac Sf. Teodor, nr. 1, Iasi, Romania, open Google maps.. And what we see. This is College! http://a.radikal.ru/a06/1810/ed/6585898813be.jpg What's this bullshit about a College office? No signs of the project, no signs, I wonder, and the College administration is aware that in their building are rented and used premises for offices?? Yes, it's just COLLEGE and that's our first conclusion: GO HELP FUND SCAM!!!  2. Let's go ahead and see a group of telegrams and immediately see that not live people are added there, but bots. ""deleted accounts"" at every step, see for yourself and everything will become clear – you will see that  GO HELP FUND SCAM!!! https://t.me/gohelpfund http://d.radikal.ru/d05/1810/32/3baf0665371f.jpg  http://b.radikal.ru/b24/1810/1b/55e1a9200155.jpg  http://b.radikal.ru/b33/1810/30/8aa584d46234.jpg  http://d.radikal.ru/d02/1810/ee/f88a2e1b8627.jpg  3. Go on.. And on coinmarketcap.com we see that this strange token, which in truth already seems doubtful to us, is traded on two exchanges. This mercatox.com and stellar port.io if mercatox paired with BTC, we still see some trades or at least the created visibility of these trades-then, on stellarport.io we only see this: http://b.radikal.ru/b00/1810/02/864dd8932042.jpg - and again conclusion: GO HELP FUND SCAM!!!  4. Well.. Now it's time to go to the official website https://gohelpfund.com/ where except deranged whitepaper https://gohelpfund.com/assets/whitepaper.pdf Why then are these well-known and respected of the exchange as bitrix, balance, hitbtc, ku, coin, cryptobia.co.nz But these exchanges not traded the token for this command. And again we are misled – and again the conclusion: GO HELP FUND SCAM!!! https://gohelpfund.com/ http://a.radikal.ru/a40/1810/55/719ae6be7a4a.jpg  5. And now the most interesting.. The team has been working on the project since may 2017 and even released a beta platform... Maybe we're not talking about the fact that this project is a real Scam? Let's look at what these guys have been working on for so long and what the team has provided us as this very beta platform that they have been working on.. http://beta.gohelpfund.com/ Well at first glance it looks quite cute.. http://c.radikal.ru/c08/1810/a6/3f6c7efb89a9.jpg Let's look a little closer and rewind the page down..  And what we see.. http://a.radikal.ru/a30/1810/cd/9cdc03fd986b.jpg Let's see what is this beta platform on which the team has been working for so long.? Yes, this is the easiest site that any of my students will write in no more than an hour. There is a button to Create a fundraising company. Anything and anything.. But what about after the fundraising company is set up..? That's it! The help button doesn't work! This beta platform is just a real shame! http://a.radikal.ru/a28/1810/82/3293bdca001f.jpg And this is what the team gave us as a beta platform? This, in principle, impossible to articulate! At all! No way! It's pure deception! Conclusion: GO HELP FUND SCAM!!! ----- Friends! Stay away from go help fund and never mess with these scams! ----- Good luck to everyone and have a nice day, friends!",False

First of all, you moved way to the left on the street. Second of all, the real building is way back to the right, and is embedded in the company incorporation certificate. 2. We can not prevent accounts with bad intentions entering our telegram chat, but we have an admin bot that deletes their messages if they try to spam our chat. 3. We are available on mercatox.com and stellarport.io, whereas the last is adding a new bridging functionality to enable withdraws and deposits of ETH20 tokens, like ours. I don't really see your point here. 4. Stay tuned for the new website which will contain a new layout and product-focused information. What are you seeing now is information from the Token Sale, such as the 'inquired exchanges'. 5. You are confusing platform with blockchain r&d. The beta platform is under development, and although there is a little amount of things to do on it now, there is a lot of infrastructure behind it, in order for us to be compliant with the legal and financial regulations that exist.

After an objective analysis, we have concluded that the best option is to do a rebranding which will benefit both investors like you and founders like us because it will incentivize us to work full time on the platform.  To resume it in a phrase, we will be rebranding the coin/platform into a single entity: platform+coin  > 'Go Help Fund' - platform and token name with the token symbol being 'HELP' ( referred as HELP tokens)  > Full professional redesign of the website and integration to invest with other options for the crowdsale (such as BTC, LTC, BCH, and more)  > Token Pre-Sale equivalent of $125,000 : - full details will be released soon  > Token Sale equivalent of $475,000: - full details will be released soon  > The Token Pre-Sale will take place in January.
