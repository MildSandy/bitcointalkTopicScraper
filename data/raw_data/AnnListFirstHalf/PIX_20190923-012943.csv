The Lampix team refer to the ""mining"" opportunities so that people who already mine coins can now use their time and computer to upload the files needed for image recognition, rather than relying on bought database entries. This is just as relevant I think as Sia coin hard drive sharing, Golem processor distribution.....not strictly mining for coins but same end result.  I think the reason the price is so low is because the downturn in market put most crypto projects down on their arse. Some of the really big ones have bounced back purely through hype and marketing, some are concentrating on their product first. I believe Lampix will get onto the radar later this year and when it does it will be a game changer, offering a real - and incredibly versatile - product and you will see the price shoot up. Not shilling this, I have no presence here and am not heavilly invested, but I think smart money would be at least dipping their toe into this or you will be regretting it by Q4.

Please remember that it’s important to note that the power of PIX extends far beyond the Lampix use case. While Lampix will leverage the platform quite heavily and all Lampix progress is favorable to the PIX ecosystem, the utility of the PIX token extends far beyond the exchange of training data for Lampix. From self driving cars, to recognizing satellite images, and an infinite list of use cases not yet realized, as AI and image recognition continues to skyrocket as a field. We aim to ensure that PIX is accessible to all interested parties in its utility. That’s why we have introduced new branding for PIX and will continue to develop the PIX ecosystem marketing with content and assets to appeal to a wide audience.  In addition to PIX marketing, we continue to make progress to plan on the development of the platform code and the buy and sell side ecosystem in general:  THE MILESTONES —  * Setup: Assemble team of front/back-end developers + database specialists + blockchain experts to create PIX ecosystem. Analysis of requirements → What needs to be done? COMPLETED  * Milestone 1: Enabled trading of data of gathered samples. COMPLETED  * Milestone 2: In May, automated data set quality assessment to avoid getting junk in the ecosystem. COMPLETED  * Milestone 3: Implement first version of PIX ecosystem for closed beta with smart contract architecture. COMPLETED  Currently, working on crowd voting process in such a way that manipulation for reward is thwarted. IN PROGRESS  * Milestone 4: Migrate image database from Amazon 5 system to IPFS. Parallel to this, create open beta ecosystem. UPCOMING  * Milestone 5: By end of this year, open source the whole system. UPCOMING  Concurrently, other departments in the company are working diligently on supporting initiatives which keep the project and organization strong —  MARKETING  PIX: Launched pixtoken.com with its own distinct branding. Website content will continue to expand to market the token and its many use cases. Created input form on PIXtoken.co to collect new leads for pix ecosystem bounties to expand our footprint beyond Lampix use case and welcome brands / companies that otherwise might “compete” with Lampix to feel welcome to use PIX as a neutral space.

Many enterprise level businesses use cloud storage, there is a high priority for companies who provide these services to be as secure as possible.  As long as it's properly secured, which is the key it will be at no more of a risk than traditional methods.  This is more of a philosophical discussion but I don't think just because there always will be small groups or individuals in society attempting illicit activities that they should be pandered too and everything should be made ""free"" based off the idea that they will always exist.  I know that's not your exact argument but you have to remember there are always indirect consequences to everything so with any extreme or drastic ideas it becomes complicated in measuring the real effect.  These are just my opinions though not the company so I won't discuss it too much here.  Simply put, the system we are building is a marketplace of image datasets incentivized by the PIX token and driven by demand in the computer vision and machine learning fields.  We expect computer vision and machine learning to strongly increase in growth which in turn will grow the demand.  With regards to the higher PIX value making it more lucrative and desirable to image mine I don't think it's a topic that is being avoided but just the opposite, I think that's what we want.  So as you explained, yes you are right, it would be better for the mining and building the ecosystem if the PIX price increased.  Similar to what happened last year with ethereum which rose in price dramatically and you saw a lot more people mining as a result as well as graphics cards being sold out for a period of time.",False

Standing together in front of the difficulty, sometimes a single player creates a solution that benefits everyone. This is the story of Lampix.  Founded by George Popescu, founder of Boston Technologies, Lampix started life as a platform to create and build augmented reality (AR) systems that can transform any surface into a smart surface.  Imagine turning to any surface in a room, and immediately transforming that surface into a computer via AR - ala Tom Cruise in Minority Report.  As the Lampix team continued to develop their platform, they discovered that there were many around them who were having the same issues - access to machine learning for AR and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be nearly insurmountable without significant resources.  As they saw the needs around them growing, the Lampix team decided to put Blockchain technology to work, not only for themselves, but for everyone with the same issues.  The team realized that Blockchain technology was uniquely helpful in creating the first ‘image mining’ network for computer vision systems, like Lampix’s original product. They decided the next step was the creation of a billion-image database of real world objects that are critical for AR systems.  As they began to consider disrupting traditional models of image production and distribution through Blockchain technology, the company realized that the best way to create a database large enough to serve the needs of the AR/AI world was by decentralizing participation.  Large companies with such databases (Google and others) had autonomous control of the images and could forbid use to competitors, centralize profits from the database, and control use arbitrarily.  Decentralization, however, would produce a large-scale database without such centralized control mechanisms in place. The needs could be met.  https://cointelegraph.com/news/lampix-creating-blockchain-based-decentralized-database-of-images-for-arai?utm_content=bufferfa653&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer",False

We are working on all three.  Remember the market value right now is pre-mining and pre-ecosystem.  We are looking at creating real value with real innovative technology which tends to take longer than simple pumps.  You are correct in saying that most people don't understand at first the use of the token and concept of incentivized systems, I believe not just with our token but in general.  This I believe is partially due to the enormous amount of tokens that have been created recently, which has brought skepticism within the community about whether certain tokens are necessary or whether they are just taking advantage of the cryptocurrency craze.  So it is necessary to explain the use case of our token.  This is explained in our whitepaper and FAQ and I have been working on explaining this succinctly within our communities as well (as I know that most people tend to skim through or not read whitepapers at all).  The incentivized concept itself is very simple, like you mentioned the Facebook example became popularized because of Zuckerberg's leaked messages to his friend regarding his ability to get everyone's information because they volunteered it for free (which was stated in a very profane matter gaining notoriety).  While it's not an exact comparison as some can argue that there is some social-value in posting content to Facebook, the idea of receiving payment for contribution to a system that is receiving billions in advertising is appealing in a society that is shifting towards automation and where there is value to finding income through alternative means.  This probably follows closely how BAT (Basic Attention Token) will work as well.  All of this is still new so the more projects that follow this concept and the success of them will help more people understand and adopt.  Another way to look at it is as a decentralized marketplace.  Earn PIX tokens by providing image datasets and by voting on integrity of the datasets (which is a safety against spamming), the demand for the datasets are from companies, projects working on computer vision, machine learning, researchers, developers.  The demand should continue to gain as technologies in computer vision and machine learning grow.  Additional value can be created outside of the ecosystem as well through markets of course.  Thanks for the post as this is an important discussion I think but it's not something that is at the forefront of the crypto community.  I think Lampix is a unique project because it can merge the crypto community, tech enthusiasts and people interested in studying incentivized ecosystems/marketplaces.  All of these things are both new and exciting with great potential.",False

(As answered by George Popescu, CEO) Lampix will be just one device that will use the PIX ecosystem. Many more devices will be able to use it.  The vision is for Lampix to be like an Operating System that runs on any hardware.  For now nobody else makes Lampix compatible hardware but we are talking to multiple firms.  More Kickstarter details The Kickstarter will be launched by March with delivery in the summer.  Expect at least 3 apps, one of which will be a mining app.  Cost of the Lampix Device? Lampix will be affordable for the home and workplace at around $400.  It will come with a mining app so you will be able to earn back the cost and you will also be able to purchase the device using PIX.  The price in PIX has not yet been determined. Can we have an in-person demo or be able to test the device? You can contact us (george@lampix.co) to schedule to test the device in-person for 20-30 minutes on location.

I am looking back at what we had two years ago compared to what we have today. I am shocked. Every day feels like somewhat of a fight and a struggle but, if you look back at the path behind us, it feels we have climbed Mount Everest twice already.  The secret of building companies? It is the same as climbing a mountain. From time to time, I look at the map and the path ahead, but most of the time I just focus on the next step. Another secret? Focus on what the customers want. Put yourself in the customer's shoes. Forget what you know. Forget what you've previously built. Instead, imagine you are a new person who has never seen anything from Lampix and knows nothing. How will they react?  One other trick. Make it as simple as possible. Idiot proof. One button if possible. Try to make it so it doesn't need instruction. Could your grandmother figure out how to use it?  I am trying to imagine where we will be in two years from now. I honestly think it is hard to predict. We are now accelerating. Time is of the essence. Time is our most valuable asset. If you can save a day today, it will translate into being ahead of the market, the competition, and the deadline by months sooner or later.  At Lampix, we have the means to do whatever we choose to do. It all depends on us. We are aiming high. What does Apple, Google, or Facebook have that we don't have? Nothing. I believe we have it all. Our vision is to free human-computer interaction from digital screens, mice, and keyboards. We are ahead. We have the means.  How will we get there?

Quality of dataset.  You want the best possible dataset for the best results and if you are a company any edge you can against competition. 2. Clean categorization of dataset (simple data scraping may bring in unrelated images due to the ambiguity of search terms and language) 3. Companies will have legal issues using copyrighted images through data scraping.

We believe ICOs are a way to allow for anybody no matter how much money they have to equitably participate in Internet 3.0 in a transparent and cheap way. No other system allows a human to buy for 1 yuan with the same rights as buying for 10 billion yuan. Many people have bought the PIX token at the crowdsale. When the tokens were bought the purchasers had a dream and an aspiration to participate in our community. We are not going to prevent some participants from achieving their dreams. We do not think it is fair to treat different purchases differently. Our Crowdsale was done via a smart contract which is out of our control by design and architecture. That is the whole purpose of a smart contract. Therefore and without anything we can do, the smart contract will continue, as initially set, and the PIX tokens will be distributed on September 19th as scheduled of course. We look forward to building a world wide community, revolutionizing how humans and computers interact and enabling the future advances in computer vision and AI with our entire community.

Artificial Intelligence is definitely an interesting topic, but with the case of Lampix, its AI is limited to object and motion learning recognition. Lampix uses computer vision and machine learning, which is a form of AI that is intended to help it learn to identify objects and motions. This is only possible with a large amount of data.

The key is in the computer vision. Other similar systems use infrared sensors that can detect human fingers on a room-temperature background. Or 3d sensors using lasers that can detect object size.  Because we use just a normal smart phone camera we can detect room temperature objects on room temperature background ( a pen on a table !) or flat objects on a surface ( a piece of paper on a table !).  But to make this work we need to train a computer to recognize objects. Think like a baby: you show them a paper and say paper!. The baby answers goo gaa gaa. You show again and say paper. Baby says paaaa. Again, again , again, papee, papeeeeer. Until you get PAPER. Then you move on to... pen. So we need the help from the crowd to source a lot of images with description we can show , not only to Lampix apps, but to anybody else who is trying to use computer vision in other environments or for other applications.  It's a LOT of work. But we demonstrated with thousands of pictures of fingers that we can reach 99% accuracy in detection if we have pictures in the same conditions where you measure (aka same light, and similar background)  So we need... a LOT OF PICTURES, with descriptions.  I can talk about this all day. I guess I'll stop here for now  George Popescu CEO LAMPIX",False

We are creating a new blockchain that will hold {image, description} datasets of real world objects. This data is a vital prerequisite for augmented reality systems ranging from smartphones, wearable glasses, or our own Lampix device.   Lampix Device Lampix is a hardware and software solution that transforms any flat surface into a smart, augmented reality surface, freeing human-computer interaction from digital screens.  With an open source API, integrating both computer vision and artificial intelligence, developers can create applications and content that can interact with real world objects, movement, and even hands.  _____________________________________________________________________   Lampix Use-Cases  The restaurant use-case below is one of many possible applications for Lampix. To see more examples, visit our Youtube Page.  Lampix Restaurant Use-Case   Why would you want a Lampix? The user can be free from digital screens, and use applications that could make their life easier and more enjoyable. For instance, imagine placing a few ingredients on your kitchen table and having a list of recipes pop-up, giving you recommendations you might have not thought of, and then providing step-by-step instructions for making a selected recipe. Even if you have dirty or wet hands, you can still use Lampix, without error. The applications for the lampix are only limited by imagination and data available.  This is why we are creating the largest computer vision machine learning database for the advancement of augmented reality and artificial intelligence.   Lampix Database The database is a tool every augmented and virtual reality developer can tap into for their own applications. Computer vision and machine learning are dependent on the availability of data that is curated and described. We want to meet this demand for data with the largest database composed of pictures with descriptions.   http://i.imgur.com/fNif5lW.png    Lampix introduces picture mining If you are a miner and would like to be rewarded for your contribution to a data ecosystem, then picture mining may be your next venture. With the use of a Lampix device or any other device with a camera, miners can take pictures of objects, write a description, and submit it to be verified. Once approved by multi-voter consensus, the dataset is then submitted to the database.  The cost of electricity is minimal Most miners must worry about the variable cost of electricity, which is usually the biggest hurdle to obtaining an acceptable ROI. However, with picture mining, there is no proof-of-work mining needed to be done to reap rewards, instead the miner only needs to submit datasets.  Don't have a Lampix or a device with a camera? No problem, become a voter! Another way to contribute to the data ecosystem is by voting on datasets. Voters can review pending datasets to make sure the description matches the picture. Once the dataset is approved by the network, voters aligned with the consensus of each dataset will be compensated. _____________________________________________________________________  Read the Lampix Whitepaper with detailed description of the Lampix device, database, financials, and other essential information:  http://i.imgur.com/I0UhJj6.png  Do you have further questions?

PIX tokens will be used to pay miners and voters for their contributions. There are many modules used in the architecture of the Lampix device and database ecosystem. A few include the data storage database, gateway and data submission, and smart contract for voting module. A simplified version of how the modules interact within the ecosystem is displayed below.  http://i.imgur.com/JKeH4io.png  Read the Lampix Whitepaper to get a more detailed explanation of the hardware, software, and Lampix ecosystem.  http://i.imgur.com/I0UhJj6.png   http://i.imgur.com/xEtz53j.png    http://i.imgur.com/49BR9Lm.png  George Popescu CEO at Lampix http://i.imgur.com/CoJTHru.png  George is an MIT alumni based in New York and has 3 Masters degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineer, 3D Printing, and Nanoscience.
