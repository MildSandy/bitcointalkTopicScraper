And second, our smart contracts include only simple token and crowdsale functionality. These are already well known in the industry and the methods used in them have been audited and used are re-used over and over again. A third-party audit is needed once custom business logic enters the scene. So if a project needs smart contracts for a freelancer website for example, or for a marketplace, then they will have additional smart contracts that are not of the standard token and crowdsale functionality. Then, it is a really good idea to get these smart contracts audited by someone else, capable of doing it right.",False

Quote from: longyenthanh on January 03, 2018, 02:39:12 AM Hi guys! There are many names of different stages of ICO - presale, sale, public sale - i'm confused. But anyway i would like to know a specific ICO end date? Is this already established, I couldn't find this information ... The ICO will end either on April 1st at 10:00:00 UTC or if the hard cap is reached. For more info, refer to the token sale page: https://fabrictoken.io/token-sale/  Quote from: reallyhawk on January 03, 2018, 11:10:46 AM Good afternoon. I’ve suddenly become interested in the following issue: how many parts will your app consist of? It seems to me that there will be too many of complex elements. If you are talking about DApp Workbench, then two - a desktop application consisting of a drag-and-drop UI and a cloud where smart contracts will be compiled and tested.  Quote Will the app be universal? I  mean, the staff of my company uses various OS. Yes, we are using the Electron framework so it won't matter which OS you are using.  Quote Great, it was thought out. What programming language are you planning to use when developing Fabric software? For the smart contract components, we are going with Solidity. For TokenGen - React for the front-end and Golang for the back-end. For DApp Workbench - the Electron framework coupled with a few other technologies. We will be writing a detailed post about DApp Workbench soon enough explaining exactly how the software will work so stay tuned.  Quote from: newboi on January 03, 2018, 11:43:39 AM Hey.

How Fabric is going to solve this problem? DApp Workbench will allow the development, monitoring and deployment of smart contract/business processes in real-time, thus allowing businesses to improve their processes and automation.  Quote from: Ackedy on December 30, 2017, 10:02:06 AM Good afternoon. Has pre -sale already been completed? We won't be holding a pre-sale. The project is already well-funded thus we don't need a pre-sale or a secondary sale.  Quote from: nextwalker on December 30, 2017, 10:03:29 AM ETH blockchain was overloaded recently and partially suspended its operation. How do you plan to protect your networks from a similar scenario? The Fabric Token is based on the ETH blockchain, but it can be migrated to a different blockchain if needed. DApp Workbench works with either blockchains of the client itself or the public Ethereum blockchain. This question is only relevant to the Fabric Store. The idea is to use a permissioned blockchain, based on Hyperledger Fabric, as it has multiple features to provide isolation and means to mitigate large variety of attacks. We will research that topic further once TokenGen and DApp Workbench are ready to support user-contributed extensions.  Quote from: Immer on December 30, 2017, 10:13:51 AM Good afternoon. How many blockchain platforms will your app support? In my opinion - the more of them, the better it is. We have planned to support multiple blockchain platforms for both TokenGen and DApp Workbench. As a start we will target Ethereum and in the case for the DApp Workbench we also target Hyperledger Fabric. Once those capabilities are mature, we can easily add more platforms in our ""expansion"" epic (epic as in SCRUM).  Quote from: reallyhawk on December 30, 2017, 10:23:35 AM Why did you choose BPMN 2.0 exactly? I’ve heard that its maintenance is very expensive. We chose a subset of the BPMN 2.0 specification that will allow workflow automation, in addition to that, not all activities are relevant for processes running on a blockchain.  Quote from: slavonicpl on December 30, 2017, 10:29:57 AM Does your team have experts who understand how blockchain technology is developing? If you anticipate the direction, you can significantly increase the value of the token. Yes we do. Our entire team has a great understanding of blockchain technology and each brings a unique view of the industry. If there's an opportunity, we are sure to spot it right away.  Quote from: termonator61 on December 30, 2017, 10:30:57 AM Hello. I got interested in your project, but first I’d like to learn: how much will one transaction cost me in the framework of DApp Workbench? DApp Workbench will support, as a start, the Ethereum blockchain and Hyperledger Fabric. So, a transaction will cost the standard ETH gas cost if the smart contracts are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, and if they are deployed on a Hyperledger blockchain, the transaction cost will be literally 0 due to Hyperledger being a private blockchain for businesses.",False

Employees of the company won't need to learn new technologies or software because DApp Workbench uses BPMN, an already established standard for BPM, which most companies are already familiar with.

For TokenGen, you will need to go through a step-by-step process in order to get the smart contracts and for DApp Workbench, you will use a drag-and-drop UI. It is not exactly automated smart contract creation, but it does eliminate most of the manual work needed.   from: deort on December 28, 2017, 08:30:37 AM Why do you launch two different apps for creation of smart contracts? In my opinion, Workbench and TokenGen are very similar in terms of functionality.

Quote from: CAraBuss on December 28, 2017, 12:53:35 PM Hi there. Today there’re a lot of solutions of the day for transformation of the business from paper to digital form in the market. What is your ultimate advantage? The ultimate advantage of the Fabric Token platform is the fact that it will tremendously speed up this process of transferring from paper documentation to digital. Of course, it will cover a lot more use cases than that, but I just wanted to illustrate with your example. The fact is that, we aim to allow businesses of any size, to easily integrate blockchain and smart contracts into their operations. This may include replacing paper documents with documentation held by smart contracts and stored on the blockchain, replacing intermediaries required to sign specific documents with self-executing smart contracts, etc.  Quote Good afternoon. Does it turn out that your platform acts as an intermediary by providing technology for interaction between different companies? BPMN already provides that on a certain level. What we will do with our platform is allow for this interaction to become trustless i.e. by including blockchain into their BPM, and much more efficient i.e. by introducing smart contracts that replace inefficient parts of the business process.

We are pushing hard with the marketing of the project and the community is growing nicely and steadily. So, once the ICO begins, and we have gathered a big enough community, we do believe that most, if not all, Fabric Tokens will be sold during the launch.  Quote I got it, thank you for your time. The last question is the following: will a person who is good at programming be able to edit the smart contracts created by this platform? Yes, you will be allowed to edit the smart contracts.  Quote Hello. Why did you choose Solidity as the programming language for your platform? Have you got a sponsorship agreement with them? The main reason for choosing Solidity is that it is the most popular programming language for development of smart contracts. We are in no way sponsored or affiliated with the Ethereum project or the Solidity programming language.  Quote can we give altcoins to get tokens? Only Ethereum will be accepted during the ICO.  Quote I can’t find the date of the start of your pre-ICO. When will it be held? There won't be a pre-sale. Just one sale of the tokens. We want to make this as simple as possible, because our primary focus is on the products themselves.  Quote Hello. How many tokens will it be possible to buy for 3 ETN? Once the ICO closes in, we will be able to more accurately calculate the amount of FT you will receive per 1 ETH. If you'd like to do some math with current exchange rates, 1 FT will equal exactly $0.1125 USD.  Quote Can I create my own decentralized apps only with the help of the tools offered by your platform? That's the whole point of the platform.  Quote Good afternoon. Aren’t you afraid that your platform will create too much various tokens in the secondary market and it will worsen the confusion? TokenGen will simply ease the creation of tokens, however, if the project behind the tokens is bad, they will fail, just like they do now. So no, we don't think that there will be a spike of tokens due to our platform. The bad projects will die out as they usually do, there will simply be more good projects on the rise.",False
