This helps us build the network more quickly, making the product better for everyone. Logically, if the network is successful, then the tokens should be bought by advertisers at around face value.  The face value of the token/coupon is arbitrary, and is related to the token supply.  Because the face value of the coupon is denominated in Ether, the tokens are worth more to advertisers if the price of Ether goes up.  Thanks for asking a good question.    ",False

Love it. If there is one thing publishers are bad at, it is being transparent. Sure there are power-houses like Google Adwords that are transparent to a high degree, but the smaller ad networks are sadly not always as transparent - this cuts right through that so that publishers and advertisers can trust eachother.

This is great for investors for the following reasons:  1. The coupon’s value will rise with the price of Ether because the coupon is denominated in Ether. 2. Most importantly, holders of the token know EXACTLY how much our token is worth if the underlying business succeeds (it’s the face value of the coupon).
