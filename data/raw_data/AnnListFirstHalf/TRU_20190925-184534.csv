Moreover, the Tru Reputation Protocol establishes an economic model around Reputation by rewarding contributions and charging for consumption ensuring all parties involved in the transaction are incentivised for providing feedback whilst ensuring value is derived from those who consume the reputation data from the Tru Reputation Network.

We're using Ethereum for the token economy, and for linking the encrypted data in IPFS to transactions (using Ethereum as a blockchain was intended- as a distributed ledger). In future could we migrate off Ethereum to another chain for that? Sure- we could move to EOS, etc- and the system would remain the same. Ethereum is just the validation engine, with the Oracle Service acting as the broker between any and all transactions and IPFS as the secure data store.",False

Before I give the value, a bit of context: Patent valuations have a few methods for calculating the value over the patents lifetime as they provide 20 years of monopoly on the system in use (and the way the patent is constructed, essentially bars anyone from using a system of feedback derived from the more natural semantic language methodology given the claims made and the system design). In our case, we've used the income-based method for valuation (Discounted Cash Flow)- and that leads to a range.  So, the valuation range is: $180 Million USD to $320 Million USD based on current market opportunity as value over the course of its lifetime. Again this is provisional, and was calculated as we talk to several VCs, but I wanted to share it given it's wide ranging effect.  I've certainly had worse news on a Saturday morning.",False

Quite a bit.  Darron Antill- Executive Leader for over 20 years, negotiated the acquisition of Vistorm by EDS (and then of EDS by HP) for over $30M; raised $70M from Goldman Sachs as the Series A investment in AppSense Inc when he was CEO of Appsense, also grew revenue by 30% each year to over $110M. Currently CEO of DeviceAuthority who closed a $2M seed investment round.  Matt Murphy - Currently VP of Global Technology at JP Morgan Chase- who are pretty much leading the way on Enterprise adoption of blockchain technologies. Currently dealing with a lot of blockchain technology as JPMC assess it and has been involved in crypto since about 2014 on and off.  Rich Martindale - Currently at Ivanti, Inc- part of the of $200M acquisition of AppSense by LANDesk, been in crypto for a few years.  Between the team and the Advisors we've raised over $100M in capital for various business, and delivered over $500M in sales through our leadership, products & initiatives. Personally, I've been in crypto since around 2011, as has Dr Bray and we've been actively developing the Tru Reputation Network to leverage the virtues of the blockchain in a wider context- something that right now isn't really happening with a lot of the new tokens, they're more addressing internal cryptocurrency needs than looking to grow the market out beyond the bounds of just those who currently are active in the crypto space.",False

We've got an serviceable obtainable market of 3.6 Billion Transactions a Year, we've got a platform already on board that is targeting 500K users per month by the mid-2019 (Trubador), and we are actively talking to other platforms to have them onboard on day 1. Right now- we're looking at 50,000 users active on day 1, with a potential to grow that very rapidly and the network effects of the platform making it easier to platforms to on-board.  FYI, we've been working to the basis that 1000 TRU equals around 1,000 reviews- and based on the number of reviews people perform per year on average and the price paid by platforms for that data, that puts the price per 1,000 in the $4.00-$5.00 range initially and may well end up much higher depending on the quality/value of the data to the market.",False

There is a CrowdSale after this, and the reason we decided against a short sale period was to remove the wrong incentives- panic rushing to buy, and not giving people enough time to participate. Equally, a lot of Pre-Sales are not open to everyone and while we're closing out terms with some VCs right now (when I can talk about them, I will), I wanted to ensure anyone could participate at the same bonus rates they can. The Pre-Sale may not run until the 5th March- if we hit our Soft Cap way before then, we will be closing the Sale down- we're not trying to over raise, we know exactly what we need to get where we want to go. The Crowd Sale will follow at the end of Q2 and will be shorter than this- and depending on what happens between now and May 2018, may actually be incredibly quick- it is purely there to offer tokens prior to the launch for institutions, platforms and general users to buy the supply before the general launch- and determines the total size of the pool.",False

Once both parties accept feedback, the algo determines based on the market depth how much Tru Reputation Tokens they receive for their feedback and splits it between the parties. The Tru Reputation Network isn't linked to any single platform or site as well- it's designed to be really easy to remove any existing feedback mechanism and just replace it with Tru- and better, you can then persist your reputation between every platform in the Tru Reputation Network (and platforms can read that reputation as well, making their offering more valuable: getting passed the 'walled gardens' of E-Bay, Yelp, etc).

Iâ€™ll answer your questions in two parts if that's ok:  1. Competitors:  There are competitors both on and off the blockchain. From the 'old guard' like TripAdvisor (who recently spectacularly failed to address the issues weâ€™re solving), Amazon and Yelp- to on-chain solutions like Revain. he issue is that they all attempt to deal with the problem in the same way with solutions that have been proven time and again in the real world to not work. If they did work, there wouldnâ€™t be 20% review fraud. It is not like Amazon, Yelp and TripAdvisor do not have access to significant resources and view this as a huge problem. Putting the same old solution into the blockchain (and throwing around 'AI' without any genuine USP) wonâ€™t address the issue- and no amount of marketing can change that.  2. Our Competitive Advantages:  To summarise why weâ€™ll win in three words: Technology, Traction and Team.  Technology: We have developed a robust and proven technology stack that utterly set us apart from our competitors, backed by unique and protected intellectual property that solves a set of problems that have, so far, been intractable. No one would accept 20% fraud in any other industry but that is the current state of the market- and the affected revenue is just staggering as a market problem ($321 billion).  Traction: Unlike many blockchain projects, weâ€™re not just a white paper and some slick marketing- weâ€™ve quietly been proving our technology through adoption. Our solution is used by over 25,000 monthly active users (as of Monday this week) in a closed beta of an app in New York & London. We're already talking to a dozen other platforms about how they could leverage the Tru Reputation Network- and that is going to be the driving economic force behind the Network- real-world mass adoption, not speculation on potential future prices.  Team: Weâ€™ve got a team that has 110 years experience, has a history of success with startups and knows how to execute. Between our team and our advisors weâ€™ve created companies that have generated more than $500 million revenue and raised over $70 million in funding, have a wide range of experience across a majority of market verticals and possess a broad knowledge of financial services & digital security technologies.  Hope that answers your questions- I'm more than happy to go into more detail as to why the current solutions will never work if you want me to.",False
