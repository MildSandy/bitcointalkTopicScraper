Ideas are incubated in a community model using the AdelWiki‚Ñ¢. Founders collaborate on improving ideas and moving them from the idea to project stage, and then to the execution stage. Founders create and develop business plans used to launch successful projects. They also decide on the funding needed, and how to raise seed capital, and even have employment opportunities in any project. In this way, Adel is  not a Venture Capital (VC) funding vehicle. Projects are incubated within the community.  In this self-sustaining ecosystem, the community decides on how projects take shape, including the funding approach.

Adel is an idea incubator that focuses mainly on blockchain projects. Submitting ideas and the execution of these projects are delegated to the Adel Members with the Adel core team supervising the end to end process.  An Adel member is a stakeholder who holds at least 64000 ADL coins (32000 if they participated in ICO). This allows the member to have access to all the community modules (eg. the collaboration module), participate to the project incubation and also submit own ideas.  The ICO was launched on May 1st and ended on the 31st of May 2017 collecting 442.5 BTC. Adel was the first KYC/AML/CTF (Know Your Customer, Anti-money Laundering, and Counter Terrorism Financing) compliant ICO in the world.  The result was below the minimum target of 900BTC so the members had to vote for keeping the project alive or if the collected BTC had to be returned to the investors. Members voted to go on with the project and Adel started its plan of developing the collaboration modules and follow their defined roadmap:    https://thewiring.com/2017/12/25/adel-investor-perspective/?utm_campaign=coschedule&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=adelphoi_io",False

I've been looking at your project for a week or so, reading up and educating myself on it. Seems very interesting to me.

I don't have any NXT, Ardor tokens etc. therefore i don't have an NXT wallet and i don't even know what it is, frankly speaking. So basically there's two options for me - either C-cex or Stocks exchange.  2. I've read about the swap process, so will it be okay for me to buy tokens on C-cex and hold them there (as you probably know, C-cex locked its withdrawals until January 20th)?  3. I don't get the total number of coins for Adelphoi. Coinmarketcap lists 23,472,224 ADL in circulating supply and 100,000,000 ADL in total supply.

Yes, both coins will exist in the ecosystem and serve as a transaction currency for members. This is the most practical scenario because it is unrealistic to expect that 100% of ADLs will be exchanged for ADE.   Q. Does this announcement mean that Adel is abandoning the Nxt blockchain?  A. No. We continue to support Nxt, and their robust features. Both ADL will reside as an asset on the Nxt blockchain. ADS will be an asset on the Ardor blockchain as a child chain. In fact we feel that the creation of Adel's ADE coin may even help to raise the profile of Nxt, within the Ethereum community.

In this stage, ideas are formulated into a marketing document that will be published on the adelphoi.io homepage. Ideas will be incubated as either i) a community-level, meaning that the whole community can participate in the Wiki process of document collaboration. Or ii) it will be developed at a group-level, where the Innovator of the project hand-picks members of the community who are best qualified to build their idea. Projects that receive the most attention moves to the P2 stage, or Project Planning. This is when the idea graduates to the business planning stage. The P2 process will follow a similar approach of community or group participation, and may include additional members, or external expertise. Then the community votes on the project, leading to E2, or Enterprise Execution.  Adel‚Äôs first incubated project will be iFin.io.

But before this can be accomplished, we feel that blockchain needs to move into the mainstream, similar to how the Internet moved from an academic, military and research tool - into mainstream markets - throughout the 90's. We feel the same will happen for Blockchain and the PoC's and applications that are born from this fantastic technology. Certainly there are crypto enthusiasts that want to maintain the purity of Blockchain anonymity, privacy, decentralization, etc. But as blockchain matures, it will inevitably bring a new spectrum of users, with new applications, and new ways to utilize open systems, break down international borders, and facilitate free flowing information. So we don't see blockchain as an ""Us against Them"" or ""Crypto vs. Brick & Mortar"" scenarios. We want to play across this spectrum, and incubate great blockchain projects.",False
