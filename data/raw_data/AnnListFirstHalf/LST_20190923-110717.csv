We are grateful for all the support we have received so far. I’d like to introduce something new and exciting today.  The weeks during and since the Token Generation Event have been intense. For better or worse, the genesis of Lendroid coincided with an inflection point in the crypto industry as a whole. I’m not just talking corrections in valuation. Evolving regulation, a shift in perception, and even a reality check in terms of the direction, speed and viability of technology. For us, it was a cue to reorient ourselves in order to become a protocol that -  Exploits the best available tech anywhere in the ecosystem Remains relevant no matter how the tide changes Towards achieving this, we’ve changed the way we look, think and do. As a visible starting point, I present to you a new logo and aesthetic scheme that reflects who we are.  We are serious people, but with a sense of adventure. We are dreamers, we are doers. With this new logo and brand scheme, we are more comfortable in our skin. A special holler to Paul Martens — Experience Designer and Brand Advisor, for translating a shared vision into something visible and beautiful. You will find the new aesthetic reflected on the website and across all our online profiles. The website will see regular enhancements over the next few weeks, with new pages and added elements.  Here’s the brand guideline, for when you want to engage with the brand at any level. Do let us know what you think.  I also believe that the aesthetic reflects the kind of work we do.  We are committed to be serving the underestimated and the misunderstood area, of credit. With credit, you’re basically borrowing from your future self. In the traditional industry, credit has been available for a very long time and the whole industry and infrastructure is quite mature. But in terms of the crypto industry, we are just starting.  Just because you have a digital asset does not mean you have to sell in order to gain some  Liquidity. We intend to provide liquidity to people who hold these digital assets. In the future, we want to expand this (infrastructure) into the area of credit scoring and credit history, with various partners in the industry.  We are keen on building things that people will love to use, immediately.",False

They’ve been the perfect melting pots for every aspect of the ethereum ecosystem. The sheer spread and depth of projects that these events attract is staggering and they’re probably the only times serious devs feel at home in a crowd.  This year, we were at ETH Denver and then at ETH Buenos Aires, where a welcome announcement of further ETH Global events was made. Denver happened right in the middle of our Token Generation Event, and BA was a curtain raiser for Reloanr (I know it’s been a while. Something came up. We’re almost done).  ETH India is close to our hearts. For a lot of us, the crypto dream began in India, and opened doors to new perspectives, ideologies and socio-economic structures. To be able to sponsor this event and participate in it fells like a journey come full circle. Okay, enough mush.  So what will we talk about at Bangalore? We, are currently very interested in scalability. The trigger for this is the exorbitant cost of transactions when deploying a lending operation. Now, although Reloanr uses recyclable loan contracts to reduce as much as 3M gas cost to facilitate lending on the blockchain, we think state channels will take it a step further and provide an added layer of secured trust-independent transactions amongst the players (wrangler, borrower, and lender). Which is why Vii is looking at state channels with a scary amount of nerdy enthusiasm.  For those of you who came in late, Lendroid is working on the underestimated and misunderstood area of credit. We are engaged in enabling credit on the blockchain, and the myriad real world use cases that depend on it — from a secondary market for DAI loans, all the way to Margin Trading. We’ve employed a modular and non-linear approach to the project, building components that will add up to enable margin. We’re looking to work with brilliant and likeminded developers to take this journey forward.  So swing by the tropics, zero in on Bangalore, and talk to us at ETH India Bagalore. It’s India, so we can start the conversation with weather and the food. Blockchain is only a couple of degrees of separation from there.",False

Not on Lendroid. #LendroidExplains the auction process, an antidote to unimaginative liquidation.  Margin Trading is risky business, and there’s usually only one way in which a centralized system deals with risky business — by assuming unilateral control of the account. And when the account dips below a certain pre-determined level, it is liquidated. The trader doesn’t have a say in these proceedings. Besides, in a conventional, centralized system, the balance of liquidity is rather delicate and sudden liquidation of a number of accounts can trigger what is known as a flash crash.  But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. For those who came in late, here’s a quick (and light) look at what Margin Trading is, and what it could mean for the blockchain.  On Lendroid, the margin account is monitored by incentivised, off-chain entities called Wranglers. When they identify accounts that are dropping, they get to earn a bounty. This bounty is baked into the smart contract when the Margin Trader borrows funds. Here’s a look at how the decentralized lending process works. Once the loan is availed, the trader calibrates positions in his margin account. He has no direct access to the funds, not without repaying the loan. But the positions and levels are completely transparent and under his control.  For a trader, his margin account is his canvas. Carefully calibrated positions, in anticipation of or in response to, market movement. Multiple assets pitted against each other in a volatile contest. Win or lose, it’s still a work of art, and certainly not for instant, unimaginative liquidation.",False

Some mysteries are simply not meant to be. Besides, lenders hate surprises. They prefer low risk, low friction transactions, guaranteed returns and completely protected custody of their funds, preferably decentralized custody. They love smart contracts.  If you are one such lender, welcome to Lendroid. You’re going to love it here.  Lendroid’s Lending Origins  Before we zeroed in on Margin Trading as the ideal use case, Lendroid was already a full-fledged, decentralized, trust-independent lending platform.  For those who know what this means and possess a streak of scepticism, here’s a neat demo of Lendroid ENS loans on Kovan. Right?  On Lendroid the non-custodian margin trading protocol, the lender is the primary participant. How good or effective the protocol is depends on what kind of an experience the lender has on it.  Rules and fail safes have been put in place to not let down the Lender’s basic expectations — of protecting capital and earning risk-free interest in a low-friction manner. If the experience is low on risk and friction, and if it is invariably profitable, then he’ll come back. If it isn’t, he won’t.  Broadly, the process was designed thus:  1. The lender defines specific terms for the loan — amount, interest rate, loan period, loan to value (LTV) — set in a smart contract.  2. A borrower pledges digital assets into an escrow account, and If the lender’s and borrower’s terms match, the smart contract is executed, locking in the collateral and releasing the funds to the borrower.  3. If the borrower satisfies the loan obligations, his collateral is unlocked automatically.  4. If the borrower defaults or the collateral drops below the agreed LTV, the collateral is liquidated.  Try the demo. You know you want to.  A Lender’s Journey on Lendroid While this journey is described in full in the whitepaper, here’s a quick stroll through a short cut. I trust you will appreciate the trust-independent nature of his experience.  To begin with, like the ‘Maker’ from 0x, the lender broadcasts a loan-offer to all decentralized exchanges. This is an off-chain action. A Funding Account is made available to the lenders to deposit funds into and offer loans from.  Each loan offer is a data packet called the ‘offer object’, containing the terms of the loan, offer parameters, and an associated ECDSA signature.  Jargon alert: The loan terms and parameters are concatenated and hashed to produce a 32 byte-long Keccak SHA3 signature called the offer-hash. The lender signs this offer-hash with their private key to produce the ECDSA signature.  As discussed earlier, it is important that the interests of the Lender — who contributes to the shared liquidity pool — are protected. This is enabled by empowering the Lender to define key parameters within the offer object.  https://blog.lendroid.com/a-lender-in-decentralized-wonderland-239f9ec1aef6",False

One of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges of the world came under attack over the past couple of weeks. The attack vectors are two-pronged. The primary attack was a DDoS, which got subsequently worse, said Bitfinex. The second attack vector is just as damning, and it poured in from the media, and community itself. ‘Slammed to the mat by DDoS attacks’, ‘Traders frustrated’, ‘Stole My Deposit’ and on and on went the tirade. The headlines have been loud, the trading forums chaotic. https://blog.lendroid.com/bitfinex-and-the-whipping-boys-of-crypto-fe75c1483313",False
