These are the Commission’s first cases imposing civil penalties solely for ICO securities offering registration violations.  Both companies have agreed to return funds to harmed investors, register the tokens as securities, file periodic reports with the Commission, and pay penalties.  According to the SEC’s orders, both CarrierEQ Inc. (Airfox) and Paragon Coin Inc. conducted ICOs in 2017 after the Commission warned that ICOs can be securities offerings in its DAO Report of Investigation.  Airfox, a Boston-based startup, raised approximately $15 million worth of digital assets to finance its development of a token-denominated “ecosystem” starting with a mobile application that would allow users in emerging markets to earn tokens and exchange them for data by interacting with advertisements.  Paragon, an online entity, raised approximately $12 million worth of digital assets to develop and implement its business plan to add blockchain technology to the cannabis industry and work toward legalization of cannabis. Neither Airfox nor Paragon registered their ICOs pursuant to the federal securities laws, nor did they qualify for an exemption to the registration requirements.  “We have made it clear that companies that issue securities through ICOs are required to comply with existing statutes and rules governing the registration of securities,” said Stephanie Avakian, Co-Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division.  “These cases tell those who are considering taking similar actions that we continue to be on the lookout for violations of the federal securities laws with respect to digital assets.”  “By providing investors who purchased securities in these ICOs with the opportunity to be reimbursed and having the issuers register their tokens with the SEC, these orders provide a model for companies that have issued tokens in ICOs and seek to comply with the federal securities laws,” said Steven Peikin, Co-Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division.  Today’s cases follow the Commission’s first non-fraud ICO registration case, Munchee, Inc.  The Commission did not impose a penalty or include undertakings from Munchee, which stopped its offering before delivering any tokens and promptly returned proceeds to investors.  The orders impose $250,000 penalties against each company and include undertakings to compensate harmed investors who purchased tokens in the illegal offerings.  The companies also will register their tokens as securities pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and file periodic reports with the Commission for at least one year.  Airfox and Paragon consented to the orders without admitting or denying the findings.  The investigation into Paragon was conducted by Pamela Sawhney of the Enforcement Division’s Cyber Unit and was supervised by Robert A. Cohen, Chief of the Cyber Unit.  The investigation into AirFox was conducted by Colin D. Forbes, Emily R. Holness, and Michael J. Vito and supervised by Celia D. Moore, Amy S. Gwiazda, and John T. Dugan of the Boston Regional Office.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Massachusetts Securities Division.",False

Why would people go through the hassle of it all? The whole supply chain transparency nonsense does nothing...literally nothing. The only way to EVER be certain of quality/purity is to do it yourself or know the person who does it for you. Millions upon millions of people still buy 'illegally' in legal states, or they buy off individuals in small amounts. Sure the dispensary scene has made a lot of money but who really knows how much is being purchased the old fashioned way. If those people could EASILY get it from a dispensary but prefer to buy it on the street, why would they exchange their cash for PRG just to likely pay a premium for the final product? All the while risking the chance that their cash=>PRG devalues in the process.  Not to mention the obvious I guess that blockchain is unnecessary for cannabis in general, unless it pertains to like sophisticated ownership and transfers of the RIGHTS to large, LARGE amounts of marijuana. Why the hell do I need blockchain to 'verify' where the pot came from when most people in legal states have a good idea where it's coming from anyway, if they're informed consumers. And to repeat, even if you know where it's coming from you have no way whatsoever of knowing what they grow it with... some people won't even grow gardens to eat OR smoke with certain products even organic products like bone meals because of disagreements regarding safety of final product. I'm not one of those people, but just saying for the person who even gives a crap about that kind of stuff, this whole 'trace back to the source with blockchain' is a moot point anyway. Most people don't care either way they'll smoke what looks good to them, and the remainder who do care have no real guarantee anyway. Hell, even testing facilities argue over each other's testing accuracy/methods.  God I'm so sick of these effers getting rich on crypto enthusiasts and noobs-looking-to-get-rich-quick alike. This isn't the only project to prey on people...but it's arguably one of the most annoying because they're trying to exploit both crypto hype and cannabis hype... Oh and they're trying to be like a silicon valley incubator type thing for cannabis start ups?...  Jfc people the next time you see this hit your initial entry point, gtfo while you can and don't kick yourself if it goes a bit higher before dying. I'm not really sure if any projects yet in crypto have straight crapped out but there have been a couple that puttered out and are now vapor coins. Kept alive by crazy forum dwellers hoping that one day, one of them will be rich enough to drive a huge pump and they can all exit with profit. I could really see this 'project' being one of the first to set that precedent. After all it's only been a short time since the ridiculous bubbly market that saw all these ICO's being randomly popped up (and of course NOOOOOONE of those ICO's were/are get rich quick schemes   ) and it could be years before we see the real destinies of all these vapor projects.  It's like if 99% of these recent projects were actually feasible, why hadn't people worked on it before hand?... ICO's turned into the kickstarters of crypto. The REAL projects in the past were often created with relatively little money and mostly driven through passion.... today projects apparently need upwards of 50 million dollars to do absolutely nothing compared to the passion driven projects that moved in leaps and bounds.   Not to mention pre-mining or whatever is now the norm for many projects wtf xD   Quote from: kraterion on June 24, 2018, 05:57:49 PM Quote from: rabbitkenith on June 24, 2018, 01:53:04 AM Review on Paragon Coin, pretty harsh but so far its been correct: https://medium.com/@Demien/3-reasons-to-stay-away-from-paragon-coin-1c5d7bf13d80  Their market cap is 4.9 million and yet they raised way more than 10 million.

There are disputes between testing facilities as to the efficacy of their competitors tests... which still doesn't have any need to be on the block chain. Patient ID will be a moot point in the next 5-10 years as I bet you it will be recreational across the US. Do you wonder why liquor stores havn't integrated blockchain to track buyers and quality tests of batches?.... I don't. It seems if something isn't broken and actually works completely fine, then dont fix it. Sure there is the fact that they're not strictly targeting the US but come on...they're targeting the US... I highly, highly, highly doubt that they were going to let this stupid 'shared' (lol) space end up anywhere but the US. These biatches be money hungry af and the US is set to be the biggest consumer/producer of cannabis in the next years. And if their reddit history is any indication, these f'ers would've plugged their stupid pay-to-vote bs to make sure it ended up wherever they needed it to.   Didn't some people pay like $2 or something per coin at the end of sale? Not positive as I've almost erased this useless crap from my memory without even trying, but I'm fairly certain I remember $2 or maybe even $2.50....  Is it at like $0.08 right now?...  Iirc and it was over $2...my god. I'm so sorry you guys. I lost like $50 in value in MAID back in the day (aka like 5 years ago lol) and felt so stupid for huffing hopium...I at least think coins in the beginning all generally had good intentions. I can't say the same about this one, and fairly certain most of you lost more than $50.... I'm 100% serious I feel for you, and if you never get your money back from this one use it as a lesson for the future. You wont likely get rich off crypto in even a year or 2. But if you pick the right one with the right fundamentals and wait for some (semi)natural adoption, your wait, although difficult, will be totally worth it.

Where i am living it is more popular to legalize gay marriage. Politicians fighting for their own interests..  I still wonder how those people manage to make babies. Or gay babies. Or whatever. One of their missions is to create workspaces so that various trades such as lawyers, traders, scientists can advance on projects in order to end the ban and thus allow the medical and recreational use of cannabis for consumers.  Not needed and no one asked for it. Those same people have been working hard towards these ends (and sadly usually with the 'elites' making stupid bank while the plebs get jack all) have been doing it for decades anyway, and honestly nothing they end up coming up with will likely do anything. The wheel's already in motion so it's an irrelevant proposition at least for the US. Since when did people have to go sit down at a starbucks (but getting stoned and buying stupid merch) to create change?... MAYBE it's viable for other countries but I highly doubt some russian cyber-weirdo and his wanna-be-crypto-enthusiast girlfriend are going to be the reason countries other than the US choose to legalize marijuana. Many countries already have such lax laws it's a don't ask don't tell thing, and countless others are already on the way to making weed legal as the benefits outweigh any old school social stigmas.  Please wake up or stop shilling. This project is literally doing worse than any other project I've seen or had the pleasure of throwing $200 into  Quote from: German Klimenko on January 23, 2018, 04:07:53 PM Quote from: CryptikEnigma on January 20, 2018, 04:28:22 PM As Cannabis legalizes in Canada, 28 states of US, Australia and few European countries, the business will really boom. Paragon Coin is the superior coins while others being Pot Coin, hemp and Cann coin are there, but PRG stands out...That being said, this coin has a dark image before but thats cleared up. Now we’ve seen better volumes and prices for the coin  But if cannabis will legalized anywhere - it will be simple to buy as a cigarettes. What the value od cryptocurrency for legal products when it more safe, faster and cheaper to buy for fiat money?   Thank god. Logic in this thread. I know there are lots of logical people here but it seems to be they're just focusing on what the team has(n't) done yet when if you looked at it from the beginning, it was obvious there's no real use-case for this shit vapor coin.  Many people bought in on the off chance some hype would pump the price up. Those who bought because of the hype and literally think it ""just has to succeed because, crypto is hyped, and weed is hyped....how can we fail?!?!?""  Well, those people are royally screwed.

You would need such strong influence or successfully launched product to actually get growers, labs, etc to take part in this. <=== This is what all the hopeys failed to see through $$$ lenses. For this to even be remotely successful it will require diligent adoption by all the folks along the supply chain, OR dedicated centers that investigate blah blah blah and who wants to go through that process just to be a part of some amateurs pipe dream?...  I have no doubt the coin itself will have some artificial pumps along the way maybe even back up to a dollar but as it stands this project has about as much chance succeeding as the big hitters like btc and eth have of failing. I'm sure the weirdo hipsters and shills will still support it but how long can it handle being supported by weak foundation? These people on the reddit are talking about how cool it was to buy merch at their event or some shit... So people are excited to have paid upwards of $1.50 for a token only to have it drop to like 10 cents at the time and use said tokens to buy merch?... Or did they offer direct purchase at the event and give a miniscule discount for using PRG (I'm pretty sure you can only use PRG there...be cool if the coin wasn't vapor).  Now it's 2 cents. People don't like to think negatively when that thought means they've lost a crap load of money but 2 cents might be HIGH for this token. There's no way of knowing. I won't rule out that the team could suck it up and do the REAL work and get a network of participants going, but I feel like they'd need HUNDREDS of growers and at least close to that number of dispensaries to participate for it to mean anything for the project. Let alone probably like 10+ labs to participate. And then how does one know without some special machinery connected to the ledger that these participants are even being honest with what they add to the supply chain data?  Not well thought out. Which is obvious if you looked at all the things working against them. Buterin may not be a sexy woman (Jess isn't that hot either, maybe stereotypically but her features are weird looking to me) but even if he were I doubt he's the kind of person who would do a lewd video like that lame one she did. Every time she speaks she shows how little she understands about any of this including cannabis...And it's obvious from the look on her face that she knows it too. Shes like a cake seller who all of a sudden wants to revolutionize the cake world. It would make more sense if a long time baker took that task head on. All she does is deal the final product. She knows jack all about cultivation or blockchain. She wants to waste ledger technology on data like whether the weed was hung to dry or put in drying baskets...  Who tf cares? Not 99.99/100 consumers you'll ever meet. Who cares what the ph of the soil was unless you're trying to gather massive amounts of data for comparison and lab results of final product etc. Like what she's trying to 'sell' us has very limited value if any to the cannabis world or the crypto world...but they and their shills are talking like this is exactly what the weed industry has been missing...unlikely.",False

(“Paragon” or the “Company”).  From August 15, 2017 to October 16, 2017, the Company ran the Paragon Initial Coin Offering (“ICO”). The Company raised an estimated $70 million by selling ParagonCoins (“PRG Tokens”) at a starting price of between $0.75 and $0.90 per Token, before eventually increasing the price to over $1 per Token.  Since the ICO, however, the price of PRG Tokens has decreased significantly, causing harm to investors.

The Paragon Space, which is located at 1452 Tamarind Avenue is being funded by Paragon, which calls itself the “leading blockchain technology platform for the cannabis industry.” In fact, the building is being fully paid for using Paragon’s cryptocurrency, PRG Coin.  The Paragon Space will be one of the more exclusive coworking spaces in the Hollywood area, as amenities like desks and offices will only be accessible to PRG Coin holders. Members of the greater cannabis community will have access to public spaces, meeting rooms, and a communal area that includes a cafe (although it looks like you’ll have to use their cryptocurrency to pay for food and drink).  One of the benefits of such a space, according to Paragon, is that it may be difficult for cannabis companies to access office space from traditional developers or property owners. “We know how hard it is for those in the cannabis industry to rent office or desk space,” it says on Paragon’s website, “so we are providing you a helping hand.”  There’s also an interesting crowdsourcing element to the coworking space’s location. Paragon put the call out to its coin holders to choose where the space should be, and created a voting system where community members used PRG Coin to vote.  Paragon is working with designers at PITCH Concepts to build out the space, which should be open by July of 2018.

Anyway just came back to check up with my favorite useless token of all time...PARAGON <3. I was watching DataDash yesterday and he briefly mentioned Paragon in the sentence of scam/useless tokens and google's ban on advertising, that's why I got reminded to check up.  So how has it been going so far? Have they already explained what value the token has next to buying snacks and drinks? And how about the implementation of blockchain vs a good old server? Oh and the IOTA partnership? Oh or the terrible Reddit AMA? Mom, I am investor!  How are all those exchanges doing? And that massive trading volume? When Bittrex? Although Bittrex does list meme tokens, so I wouldn't even be suprised.  I went through their Fb, Twitter and Reddit. It's extremely active, weird that this forum is not active at all, but I guess we ask to many questions. Rather market to Fb audience.  Has anyone here already asked how it is they have >200K likes on Fb, which is probably 10x more than any other ICO projects (guess how many likes ETH has)? Oh yeah that brings me to the ICO. So I see the attitude has somewhat changed over here. People are now calling this a long term investment. Do you have ANY idea what the point of a pre-sale/ICO is? Honest question. I'll answer it for you:  The point is to obtain a (first) round of investments, setting up a base/prototype, communicating everything to these kind people that gave you their money and make damn sure to create a positive return for your stakeholders.  How is Paragon doing on that? Even the pre-sale ""investors"" got dumped on because they did a firesale on the last day of the ICO for an extreme discount  !, ""YEAH BUT IT'S A LONG TERM HOLD!"". Really? Is it? Because you know what the problem is: it was clear (especially after the ICO) that the ICO was simply being used to buy real estate since they ""couldn't rent it"". How fast do you think that project would set up? Would it make sense to buy tokens with extremely questionable worth, with a large inflation during ICO and with zero value for a long period after the ICO? Instead of just buying after the ICO?  Have they already made public who all the members of the team are? Or the developers? How is The Game doing? Have they already made clear what his ""advisory"" roll is going to be?   Btw I went through their Reddit yesterday, this is just my opinion but goddamn it looks like a bunch of fake accounts are just making post after post. It strikes me that THEY are very active on twitter, Facebook, insta etc. Yet they get barely any replies. How then is Reddit so extremely active? You tell me? Might be wise to check their Fb likes, you investor you.  Anyone here that isn't part of Paragon's Bangladesh shilling team (cmon do a fb like checker) that has anything useful to say why this token is not utterly pointless and why this project belongs in the gutter? How is that lawsuit doing btw?  And last but bot least: A female model with zero background in tech that is now the CEO of a 100M dollar block chain implementing weed company with a questionable husband, a rapper adviser and unknown developers. WELL...if it isn't the dreamteam.",False

And by the way this is not wrong at all becuase if you need to use cannabis for health related reasons you should want to know what you're taking like you want to know what you're eating everyday.

You can't judge a project by it's price...this is one of the issues of so many newbs getting into crypto for quick money...  The fact is, there is a lot of questionable behavior and crap being brought up that just makes the team sound a bit sketchy. I just don't see Paragon doing anything for cannabis.  One, the blockchain will not ensure honesty which is the whole point of the information chain on what it was grown in, what it's lineage is whatever. Every person who lives in a legal state should grow their own anyway and really find which works for them. Everyone is different and the legal mj industry is dumb as hell. They say different strains do specific things but there's no way they can actually know what it does for each individual.  Not to mention smoking pot itself isn't 'the cure' it's the concentrates which are being sold with little consideration to the newb user bases.  Weed will eventually be legal because damn alcohol and cigarettes are. But paragon is not going to stop farmers from using chemicals and lying about it...it's not going to change the fact that many of these 'testing' laboratories can't even agree on standards and argue whose is more accurate...  I'm honestly not trying to be a douche I've just made and 'lost' (you can never really lose til you sell at a loss) so much money now off of crypto and seen it grow into this flood of newbs with cash in hand who want some of the easy money. I've been sold on hopium before, and I'm seeing a lot of that in this project. Stop thinking any one project will do anything at all....doubt them at every corner and let them prove they're willing to do something that changes the space they're in.  I've already learned my lessons and still have many to go...I'm not saying paragon won't be $100 and stores in every country whatever. I'm saying the chances are super slim, and they need to earn your trust with working product. You should all freaking doubt them until the days they actually have property. Not say ""everything is mentioned in the white paper. grow up trolls"" or whatever.  Golem has more potential, and has been around longer now, and has a stable, low price...and has few vocal updates or anything...not much hype built. Just a team working.

The project is indeed in the first young stages of its existence but already a lot of people are talking bullshit about it only because they feel like they got scammed since the price dropped after ICO ended. Based on my experience I can say it is NOT unusual for token price to drop in the post-ICO period. This however doesn't necessarily mean EVERY token price must drop in the same way in that lapse of time!     This is exactly what I mean. It offers a solution for a problem lots of governments have today and it has the potential to grow way past this moment of weakness (again, this doesn't mean it will, but that it could).  My opinion here is that the reasons for the price drop are multiple and accountable to different factors. This is still a very young project based on a difficult market (cannabis) and got the attention of a lot of people who invested in it in the early days just to find themselves with a money loss after a month.

Correct me if I am wrong.  First of all, I fully agree with constantly calling someone a liar is not the best course of action if you want to proof that person is a liar, however in this case there was a ton of evidence. If a project is called a scam (like what happens all the time) and there is nothing to back this up then obviously someone is fudding. In Paragon's case however, everything that was said had backing behind it, visual proof.  Secondly, buying and using marketing material is something entirely else than buying FB likes. In the first case you are simply marketing in the second case you are committing fraud, not in a legal sense but more in an ethical sense. This is not a good thing for the team's credibility which was discussed everywhere.  Thirdly, yes ICOs are risky. Lost a ton of money already, but again this is completely off topic. Calling ICOs risky in general has nothing to do with all the red flags mentioned above.  Fourthly, see this is what I completely do not understand. You've probably read all the threads/articles discussing Paragon and firmly stating ""STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE"". The price completely collapsed (as was expected), they completely fucked over their ICO investors and yet you keep believing in this project.  Now that I think about it I actually don't really know what to make of your comment.

I thought PRG was like 1.50 not too long ago.  I understand the undervalued asset argument, but it seems that every time an ICO overvalued it's initial tokens, and then the price drops, the only advice is to buy more.  Whereas tokens like ODN havnt fallen to ICO once and currently sits almost 4x.  Not all projects are equal of course but come on one of the main arguments is that bitcoin is hurting the alt coin market. While true to an extent it hasn't led to every alt coin crashing like we've seen with many ICOs lately",False

Price of the token. It is uncommon to see extreme volatility shortly after a token is listed on exchanges. A lot of the time, various parties attempt to make money through trading these tokens - but with a catch. Trading bots will often place sequential sell orders below the market price in order to drive the price perception down - resulting in fear and panic selling. The same party can then acquire tokens for a much lesser amount in order to sell these later. If you will take closer look to the daily trading volume between 3 exchanges that currently listed PRG is just around 3 BTC. Over 50,000 people backed this crowdsale, with tens of millions of tokens distributed. Very few tokens are currently being traded. We can’t know all the of the reasons for sure, but some people are scared of trolls and FUD, some have personal reasons, some got tokens for the work they did if they value their work to a lesser extent, then it’s their right. Volume and spread affect the market prices directly. The more volume an exchange traded item has, the lower the spread will generally be. The spread is simply the difference between the sell price and the buying price. If, for example, there are 10 buyers who put an item up for sale on an exchange, and one of them drop their selling price to a significantly lower amount than the rest - the price on the exchange will go down as a result. When volumes increase, the spread generally decreases - but more importantly, more volume results in less opportunity for price manipulation by a small group.  2. Voting. Right now we have a basic version of the online platform. You can vote, check out a database of cannabis doctors, pre-order Paragon swag. While we understand that we're not a Louis Vuitton to create enough demand for our t-shirts to drive the demand for PRG tokens up, we encourage everyone to vote on the first location of our Paragon coworking space. I can’t stress enough how important it is for our community to vote on the pivotal decisions for Paragons future growth and development. Bringing the first Paragon Space to your city will mean:  1. New jobs created 2. More money to your city’s economy 3. One of the first cities to have cannabis-specific co-working spaces 4. The first city to have a crypto-only co-working spaces 5. Support cannabis industry and young entrepreneurs/startups in this space  We don't make money from those votes. The tokens used for voting are burned. So Paragon does NOT profit from voting.   3. Scam allegations. ParagonCoin successfully finished the crowdsale nearly a month ago and yet we are still here, assisting each client to set up to wallet and get their tokens, launched MVP, burned unsold tokens, got listed on 3 exchanges and running the voting for the first ParagonSpace city we are ahead of schedule on our promises. When people say ""ponzi scheme"" I wonder if they know what actually ""ponzi scheme"" is. So just for the reference https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme Paragon Team, website, whitepaper never suggested any get rich fast schemes, immediate price increase and/or quick profit.

If they're serious as they claim, they need to develop a protocol that can tell when you send a PRG, it gets sent back and tallied based on the weight of PRG on that address sent from...but it needs to refund the PRG initially anyway as people already feel duped.  Here's the issue, and these shitty ICO developers left and right can deny it, but they're pricing the ICO tokens arbitrarily... when a token is listed for sale at .05 per token people are like...shit only 5 cents? And they won't even think about it.  When people see a price of $2 they're expecting a little something, and then when that price obviously cannot be sustained in teh current market, they don't want to now have to SPEND their devalued crap on voting where the owners of this shit show can get their new property.  Because unless I missed something, no one holding PRG owns any of these locations correct?...you can just rent the booth for 30 minutes LOL  Again, for the record, I thought of all of this crap before investing, but you should always invest a modest amount in even the craziest ideas, on the chance that the public disagrees with your opinions on which projects are crappy.

Remember those tokens that were going to be burned? Well - they have been melted down and removed from circulation forever. We would like to thank everybody who participated and supported us throughout this project! We are looking forward to realizing the goals we have set for both you and Paragon.    What was burned and why?    We have burned around ~35 Million PRG Tokens!    That sounds like a lot - and it is - but this is an important part of how our model was planned to work. As stated in our white paper, all unsold tokens are burned - removing them from circulating forever. This decreases our PRG supply even further, resulting in less supply even when demand goes up. Remember that PRG will be the only form of payment for solutions such as our Paragon Spaces!    You can review the burn in more technical detail here: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2cb23ea46ec2486d14a151ed1a5947eff475f2e0f09e801659ab6acb7f3f678c         So where does that leave us?    Of the 100 Million PRG available for pre-sale and crowd-sale - ~65 Million was allocated. There are a few reasons that we did not sell more tokens than that. The most prominent one is due to large (and institutional) investors not having followed through with agreements and payments, resulting in a partial burn of PRG that was initially allocated to the presale.    So what did we raise during crowd-sale?    ~ 533 BTC Escrow BTC - 1JuScKMcWKYf89FdWwb1TxaYBk8boSnNbn ~ 8092 ETH Escrow ETH - 0xa06cDcb65aA680559808D0b18323Bfd11cAbD956    The above does not include the amounts raised during our presale phase. The presale figures will remain private due to various NDA’s and agreements with participating parties.                 Exciting events and votes!    Next week on the 7th of November, Paragon is hosting an event in San Francisco! Two of our partners will also be attending: ChronoBank and Velton-Zegelman Firm! Some great drinks, tasty snacks and most importantly, an awesome ambience will be present! Tickets and details will be available shortly in the Paragon store - so be sure to login and get a ticket before it's gone!

This is a project with a real life infrastructure that needs to take shape, which will need a while. I don't know if it will suceed or not, but but there's no way to tell at this early stage.

Quote Notably absent from toleration of drugs is its production, particularly the cultivation of weed. This has led to a seemingly paradoxical system where coffee shops are allowed to buy and sell soft drugs but where production is nearly always punished.[7] Because coffee shops have to get their goods from somewhere, criticism has been raised over the years against continued prosecution of soft drug producers. It was first challenged in court in 2014 when a judge found two people guilty of producing weed in large quantities but refused to punish them.[8][9] A breakthrough occurred in early 2017, when a slight majority in the House of Representatives allowed for a law to pass that would partly legalize production of weed.[10] In late 2017, the newly formed coalition announced that they would seek to implement an experimental new system in certain cities where coffee shops could legally acquire weed from a state-appointed producer.   ps. this 'project' is an obvious scam, dunno why people even continue to post here",False

What the hell does rented office space have to do with helping cannabis startups get off the ground in states where is/will be legal? This is an entirely fragmented idea without any form of legitimate plan for capitalization.  What the industry needs that you should consider:  1. Banking services - federal banks are not permitted to accept funds from dispensaries as it is still federally illegal. It would be simple to create a wallet client that allows users to pay employees, expenses, and send/receive invoices.  2. Funding - it is speculated that the cost for licensing in the state of Michigan will soon be as high as $100,000 USD. The same wallet client mentioned above may be utilized as a conduit to provide business owners with a P2P network (similar in nature to that of NEO or NXT) where smart contracts can be created that will facilitate the funding of up-and-coming cannabis ventures; effectively providing a secure lending platform through which interest may be earned on investments similar to the way in which interest would be earned from USD sitting in a bank account.  3. Secure medium of exchange - being that the industry is virtually all cash based due to the aforementioned banking restrictions, a hostile and sometimes dangerous environment is created as vendors are forced to hold as much as $100,000 or more [in cash] at a time. By providing the industry with a secure currency through which B2B and B2C transactions may be facilitated, the problem will be effectively mitigated in theory.  PS: I didn't mean to come off as sounding rude at the beginning of this post. This is simply something about which I am very passionate and it pains me to watch blockchain startups flounder as they attempt to create a solution. Trust me, if I had the resources at my disposal, I would not be typing this out to you right now. I would be executing the plan I just laid out.  Best of luck",False

Los Angeles Will Become The Marijuana Capital Move over Denver, Adam Bierman Chief Executive Officer of cannabis investment firm MedMen Capital believes that the City of Angels will steal the spotlight from the Mile High City. Bierman said that by some estimates, Los Angeles's medical marijuana market alone is already close to $1 billion, easily overshadowing Colorado’s entire market. The city is expected to pass an ordinance in 2017 that will clear the path for a proper licensing program and open up the recreational market. Bierman said that capital is flowing into the area for local ventures as investors begin to smell money in the emerging market. 2. A Sports League Will Green Light Marijuana Bierman believes that in 2017 a major sports league will approve the use of cannabis for medical purposes. Many professional athletes have turned to using cannabis to treat pain and head injuries and are rejecting prescribed opiates. With medical marijuana legal in 29 states, the players are pushing to be treated just like other patients. 3. A Primetime Network Show With A Marijuana Theme With many polls showing that most Americans approve of legalizing marijuana, it won't be long before a major network will use marijuana as a backdrop. It's been over a decade since Showtime had a hit with Weeds. That series focused on a suburban mom that sold pot to make ends meet. It was considered ground breaking at the time with its taboo topic. Now HBO has High Maintenance and MTV's got Mary + Jane. Adam Scott from Parks and Recreation got a green light from NBC to develop a show called Buds about a dispensary in Denver. There isn't any timeline yet as to when the comedy could hit the air waves. 4. An Increase In Interest For Synthetic CBD With the Hemp Industries Association and the DEA battling over the legality of cannabis extracts like cannabinoids or CBD, there is an expectation for increased interest in synthetic cannabinoids. Seth Yakatan, the chief executive officer of biotech company Kalytera, said, “With AG Sessions and the DEA's clarification that plant derived CBD isn't legal federally, there will likely be interest in synthetic forms of CBD, which is what Kalytera has been testing the efficacy of for a few years.” Aside from the debate over whether CBD is legal or not, Yakatan is right that synthetic products do not have the legal limitations of other products. However, the synthetic products are not believed to be as effective as the natural products according to some patients. Fear over legal issues could create more demand for the synthetics. 5. The Growth of Craft Marijuana Sasha Kadey, Chief Marketing Officer of vaporizer distributor Greenlane, said he expects that as market supplies grow, prices will fall, causing a commoditizing effect. “This is leading to premiumization,"" he said. ""Much like the alcohol industry experienced during its maturation, with producers now seeking to differentiate with premium packaging, brand building, so called “seed to sale” storytelling, and other value adds.” Other growers will stress their organic features, while some will push celebrity endorsements. It will be the year of the craft bud. 6. Recycling Marijuana Failures The Cannabis Business Alliance is hoping to work with lawmakers to create options for marijuana that fails pesticide testing. Currently marijuana producers have to destroy crops that fail testing. The CBA is working towards a new rule to allow for these harvests to be turned into solvent-based concentrates that would be considered safe.",False

In the United States in particular, the war on drugs, racism and police violence have often been intertwined. Freeman never escaped this connection. In fact, he has often been a critical voice of the US drug war and its racial impact. Freeman was bravely involved in this debate and made numerous media reports about police violence. However, especially since the turn of the century, Freeman has become a defender of legalization.  What about personal consumption? Freeman has been using this drug since a serious car accident in 1997, and has long been a supporter of the legalization of cannabis.  Although very busy with an enviable career, Freeman lends his name to the cause. In recent times, his well-known baritone voice is being used for the cause. He tells during special shows, and by giving interviews why he thinks that cannabis should be legal at the federal level and available to all.  His voice counts particularly. Why ? He is an exemplary African-American who has succeeded financially and professionally while being a person who ""also consumes drugs"". In addition, he does so in a way that promotes his health but also his career. He is a hard worker and an artist that we should thank for his contribution to legalization. Come on Morgan  !",False

ParagonOnline is by design a “community-based” online space, where tasks, functions, goals, and priorities are defined and re-defined in real-time, by the community. At inception, we envision the main tasks of the community to be as follows:  ParagonOnline will serve as the reservation and clearinghouse system for ParagonSpace. Community members will be offered space based on their standing in the community on the basis of upvotes and downvotes (each costing 0.01 PRG) received from their contributions to ParagonBoard. ParagonBoard will be the central station for exchange and development of ideas and knowledge that further our priority goals. At inception, we will have the following sections: Current Legal Issues, Political Legalization Effort, Technical Development, New Business Ideas, New Priorities. This is primarily where community members will earn UpVotes.""   This is straight off of Paragons Website, Research for yourself",False

That seems fucked. The justification behind price manipulation in the whitepaper was the boogeyman pump and dump. If investors didn't want volatility, they'd put their money in Walmart, Facebook, etc... Also, guess who capitalizes on selling Paragon tokens when the market turns up? It's the Paragon Company.

Via IOTA we can build an entire end-to-end verifiable audit trail of all the data and information pertaining to the cannabis produce for free at a fine granular level in real time, ensuring full transparency of provenance and meta information such as whether the cannabis is organi - cally grown, exact amounts of pesticides/herbicides used, eco friendly certifications, THC/ CBD ratio etc. Having a complete data audit trail with cryptographically ensured integrity of every aspect from production to consumption will be a game changer in enabling a thriv - ing and sensible cannabis industry.In the future ParagonCoin will also explore utilizing the unique approach that the IOTA platform takes to ‘oracles’, identity and other parts of its development roadmap.",False

And ""Every active principle in every pharmaceutical medicines is poisonous"" is not even slightly overlaid, its totally absurd. Pharmaceutical medicines are saving thousands of lives every day!  The thing to be called is that way to much people are getting the wrong medicines. They get medicines for their sufferings that don't help them but rather destroy/kill them. And often those people would have been the one who really had profited of a treatment with cannabis. Therefore I really admire the United States for having legalized it.  Quote from: bitsurfer2014 on September 09, 2017, 02:14:15 PM #But the problem is that Paragon is only going to be implemented in the countries where it is legal to do.  It is completely logical that they it is only implemented in countries where cannabis is already legalized. The use of PARAGON should be that it stores all the information regarding a patient in an immutable database, a Blockchain. (Doctor Certification, Doctor Prescription, ...) That makes only sense in a country where it is already legal and people can go to a doctor to get there verification that cannabis would help their illness.   Quote from: bitsurfer2014 on September 09, 2017, 02:14:15 PM I would suggest them to try out for other countries too where it is actually needed for medicinal purpose and talk with the governments.  What do you think, Paragon sends an email to all governments in the EU ask them to legalize weed? I could imagine that if PARAGON works really great and saves the government a lot of money and cannabis continues his exciting public development. Then it could be possible that other governments in the world will legalize it too. And if PARAGON establishes it self well they will not hesitate to get implemented in other countries in the world as well.",False

I'm not speaking of shops though, just a few of the suppliers. See, I am familiar with the industry from the days when....(digression: We need a cool word similar to ""prohibition"" of alcohol but for pot) growing pot was considered criminal activity. A few of the acquaintances I made continued on to make businesses out of Legally growing and selling to medical dispensaries across three states. I can't say the waste disposal practices of a few determine how they all operate and yes, many growers do press the plants or gas them to extract the oils before throwing them out. But they are less than thorough and throw away dozens of pounds of barely pressed plants. Some don't care for the process of extraction at all and are just trying to grow showroom quality buds. So after they get the lab results back, if they are not happy with the numbers they toss it.",False

You are renting office space and a printer and some vending machines is all I hear when I read this. I've asked a few specific questions that I would need to be answered before I am comfortable referring this to more investors. What operations will be handled inside these facilities? You hint at research space and product testing but I haven't seen a detailed description. Basically, the purpose of these buildings is whatever anyone wants to do as long as they are paying in PRG? If there is research being done here what levels of security are going to be in place to protect the equipment and products. Waste disposal is also a huge problem here in Las Vegas. Strains that are considered inferior are disposed of in mass quantities and it is expensive to dispose of them within the guidelines of state regulation. So as a way to save a buck, a lot of the facilities that are currently in operation are illegally dumping in the dumpsters of apartment complexes and behind businesses.

Paragon would only work on the foundation of ethereum , utilizing the ERC20 token standard. The paragon startup is about creating an entire economy, and ecosystem, based upon legal cannabis, and it various uses.    The white paper states that Paragon has plans to establish brick, and mortar paragon spaces whithin every state /country, where marijuana is legalized. What this means is, using ethereum as a a platform,  Paragon will create a transparent ledger, that networks everything that is marijuana related, from medical doctors, and dispensaries, to legal offices, and focus groups, all within Paragon's framework, which is transparently, and conveniently stored on the blockchain. Any and everything related to legal marijuana use, will be connected to the blockchain, and easily auditable, in order to comply with laws, and regulations. The token is the center piece of financial tech that will help build the company from the ground up.        Example: In the U.S, when you buy packaged food from the grocery store, their is usually a label with nutritional facts, and information located on either the side, or back of the package. The same will be for marijuana related products.  Let's say you would like to purchase some legal pot to smoke, but want to know the exact type of high you will experience (indica, or sativa), the duration of its effects, how bad you'll get the munchies, possible side effects, how much thc per gram, whether or not gmo's were used in it's life cycle, etc, and it all would be eaily verifiable on the ethereum blockchain, from when the seed of the plant was sown, to the day it's buds finish curing. That's just one small aspect of Paragon's envisioned economy, soley focused on the sale, and consumption of the cannabis. Now imagine all the other fields associated with cannabis, and its many uses, and their you have it. Paragon in a nutshell!  Sorry for the wall of text!",False

Alzheimer’s Marijuana may be able to slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, according to research by the Scripps Research Institute published in “Molecular Pharmaceutics.” 2. Anxiety Harvard Medical School found that marijuana may have anti-anxiety effects. Of course, keep in mind that high doses may increase anxiety and paranoia. 3. Arthritis Marijuana can alleviate pain and inflammation linked to arthritis. 4. Cancer Research published in the journal “Molecular Cancer Therapeutics” suggests that cannabidiol, a chemical compound found in marijuana, turns off the “ID-1″ gene, which cancer cells use to spread. 5. Epilepsy Studies conducted by researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University indicate that marijuana may stop seizures. 6. Glaucoma Researchers are working to develop new cannabis-based drugs to treat glaucoma pain after determining marijuana’s effectiveness for treating the condition. Glaucoma is a condition that increases pressure inside the eyeball and can lead to vision loss. 7. Lung health Research in the “Journal of the American Medical Association“ found that marijuana can increase lung capacity – not decrease it, as many people have long believed. 8. Multiple sclerosis A study published in the “Canadian Medical Association Journal” found that cannabinoids significantly reduced multiple sclerosis pain. 9. Nausea Marijuana contains a minimum of 60 cannabinoids. THC is the primary chemical associated with its mind-altering effects. THC has been used in the treatment of nausea, including drug- or chemotherapy-induced nausea. 10. Parkinson’s Disease Research published in “MedPage Today” found that marijuana use eased tremors and improved fine motor skills in patients with Parkinson’s disease.

Too bad people's mentality towards cannabis is all hostility and not possibilities. I have known 3 people personally that have healed by cannabis, one is from soriasis, he was really ashamed to go out because of the scaling in his hands but a friend of his told him to try weed and he tried with all fear and trembling because he was really desperate. And it actually worked! After just few puffs in a series of weeks his soriasis disappeared. Too bad he can't continue because people selling and using it in our country are being hunted down like dogs, and some of them were even killed, many were locked in prison. I have another friend who has asthma who was healed by cannabis too. And another one with chronic pain, his mom is experiencing so much pain. And after taking cannabis, the pain dissappeared. But after few weeks of not taking it again of course it will go back.

He hunted down bootleggers when it was still illegal. Then when booze became legal, they have to find another enemy. And because yippees were using them, and they were associated with other illegal substances like cocaine and heroine therefore they concluded that marijuana is bad. Then the media also rode in with this tale with I think with the backing of big pharmaceutical companies to make this plant illegal. So erasing the bad reputation of cannabis will be really really hard to do.

Apparently one Egor Lavrov has established a tattoo contest in which he accepts donations as votes for logos, and after the polls close, he has agreed to give 25% of the money raised to charity and 25% to the person who submitted the winning tattoo idea. Oh, and he's going to get the most highly ranked image inked on his arm. We'd be dubious about paying to cast a vote (read: we'd refrain entirely), but what's up with our model being on steroids, anyway?
