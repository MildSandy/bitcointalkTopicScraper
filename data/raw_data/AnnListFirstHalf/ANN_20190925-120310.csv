The minimum purchase amount is £5000GBP but you will receive £15,000 worth of ANN tokens (600,000 ANN) for your money.  Our main token sale starts on 1st March 2018.  We are the only company with the plan to build on the blockchain and remove estate agents from the property transaction process, and we will use smart contracts at a later stage to also remove solicitors and conveyors from the process which will save time and money. Currently the removal of solicitors and conveyors isn't legal so we are concentrating currently on removing the estate agent from the process. The UK HM Land Registry is moving to the blockchain by 2022 which will then allow smart contracts to carry our the solicitor and conveyancing work which we will implement at that stage.

The ICR can only send tokens to the TLSC.  The TLSC (Time Locked Smart Contract) is where any ANN tokens that are spent on the platform go. All tokens that are spent on the platform are sent to this account which will be setup to only be able to receive tokens not send them. The reason is the same as for the ICR account, it takes away any control of the tokens by our company so that the community can be assured that we cannot send those tokens anywhere or dump them on an exchange. Once the TLSC accumulates 90% of all ANN tokens in existence  then it will allow us to run another token sale at that point with the price per token being the price at that time.  The reason there are two separate accounts with limited functionality is because the ICR is the tokens we as a company are selling through our internal marketplace whilst the TLSC is where all ANN tokens end up.   We have no control over ANN tokens, the price of ANN tokens will depend on public demand just like any other cryptocurrency, the above was designed to assure our community that we have no intention to dump any tokens which the smart contract will prove. No need to take our word and trust our words, the smart contract takes away any control we might have which we have done as a sign that we don't want to control and can't control the ANN tokens we hold or accumulate.",False

Our grand vision is to build a peer to peer property platform built on blockchain where you can buy, sell and rent property directly without the need for estate agents, solicitors or conveyors and utilize AI and machine learning to improve the efficiency of sales on our platform and further improve our product and concept. We will work towards achieving this vision in phases across the next 5 years.    Roadmap     We believe our property platform will revolutionise the entire property industry and it will provide choice to individuals with how they wish to transact property. It will make the property transactions faster, cheaper and more efficient, whilst the use of blockchain technology will reduce the risk of fraud and smart contracts will reduce human error and used with escrow to decrease the failure rate of property transactions and failure rate in the chain. We will also provide real time tracking of the property transaction process.   The UK HM Land Registry have released a business strategy document to have their own blockchain built for land registry by 2022 with the mission “To become the world’s leading land registry for speed, simplicity and an open approach to data”. Once completed, we will look to implement our blockchain platform with the government blockchain to complete the land registry.  Agent Not Needed will first be available to the UK allowing individuals to buy and sell property with the plan to later expand into other English speaking countries such as the US, Canada and Australia, adding our property rental solution to the platform and then to expand to other global non English speaking countries around the world.

Ok basically right now in the UK the government doesn't allow for property sales to be completed on the blockchain though they are in discussion to change that legislation and are looking to work with private companies in that area to help create that solution (Source).  The token sale is to help us raise the funds to complete our property portal as we planned to use tokens on the platform anyway as platform credits. We are 90% complete with our beta version but for the full version we need further funding. Once the UK Government have changed legislation to allow property transactions to be completed using the blockchain, we will make a decision on whether to build on the blockchain or use hyperledger based on the need of the industry. We are creating an ERC20 token which can be used on the platform to sell or rent property on the platform, advertise on the platform or sell to other users on the platform.  Petros",False
