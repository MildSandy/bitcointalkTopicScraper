As Artificial Intelligence (A.I) is getting better and better, that is also something that could be used in the future on the platform for this purpose.  I already have a question! Where will this vacancy be placed? On large portals or will it be necessary to send it to project managers? The vacancy and the bounty will be placed on the HireMatch platform. Once done, the agents will be able to use any methods/networks (e.g.: Social Networks) to find the right candidate(s)  Well, it’s clear now. It’s a transparent mechanism of HireMatch. What are other advantages of using blockchain? As Dayas said, the Smart Contract that will distribute the bounty automatically is one of them, another being that it will be decentralized. Spacegt, you have a lot of good questions, you should join the next session of AMA. Join us on our telegram channel: https://t.me/Hirematchico  Hi everybody! Listen, can anybody explain how the total number of coins in the system will be regulated? What about avoiding inflation or deflation? After all, the regulatory mechanism should exist. There will only be a maximum supply of 100 000 000 HIRE tokens. If we see that inflation/deflation is an issue, we will adapt the rules that control the tokens use.  Hi everybody! I've heard that availability of the coins to the customers after the ICO may depend on their total number... How many tokens will the project issue? So far most of the investors already received their tokens. As said above there will be a max. supply of 100 millions tokens.",False

Here is another batch of answers:  Hello. All candidates will have to provide personal data. Will they be stored on dedicated servers, or on public servers? Hi there! As explained  during the AMA session (https://youtu.be/bk3zs8If_Ek?t=926, please check it out there are a lot of useful information on the project) the candidates will be outside this platform at least at the beginning. It will be more focused on the agents (the people/interface) that represent the candidates and the companies that want to hire them. The agents will be able to use the regular channels to find the rights candidates (referrals, friends, social circles, databases, online profiles ...). In the future, it is not excluded that candidates and their profiles might also become part of the platform  Good afternoon. What technology do you use to ensure security? Encryption, double authentication, or something else? Hi! One of the Cofounder, Armando who is the Lead Software Engineer at HireMatch is also an I.T Security Expert so I believe that the data will be safe. I do not have all the details on the technical aspect, but if you want more details and potentially directly be able to ask Armando, join us on telegram https://t.me/hirematchico where we will try to have regular AMA sessions for these kind of questions.  Hello. Can I pay a reward to agents in other crypto-currencies, or are the tokens of your platform the only option? Hi! HIRE tokens were designed to be the central currency of the platform, which will also drive its value. The bounty (that will be distributed between the agents that helped find candidates) issued by the company that wish to hire a employee will be in HIRE tokens. Companies will be able to acquire HIRE tokens with other crypto-currencies on the platform or on regular exchanges.  Hello. How many tokens will be available on the sale? All that have been released, or only a part? Hi! 78 000 000 HIRE tokens are available for the ICO (sale), the unsold token will be burnt and the total supply of the tokens is 100 000 000 (which means that there will never be more than 100 000 000 tokens in circulation. Part of the tokens have already been released to investors that bought them  Let's say you know that the agent has a candidate suitable for you, and you want to entice him. What is the reward for this agent? The reward for the agents will be the bounty issued by the company looking to hire. You will not have to directly entice the agent(s) as it will be in their interest to promote their best candidates for this position in order to get part of the bounty. As a reminder, a BOUNTY is the amount in (HIRE) tokens that a company places into the smart contract to be distributed upon successful execution of the contract. Here is how a successful bounty share could work (exact percentages are still under development and are subject to change) : -35% to the agent who placed applicant -25% to the agent(s) who got an interview for the applicants -15% to the agent(s) who recommended candidate(s) (weighted by final ranking) -25% back to the company who created the county  Good afternoon. I was intrigued by the main idea of your platform, so I'm interested - in order to become an agent do I need to have a diploma in HR Manager? And do you want every freelancer, that take your order, provide you with a specialist diploma in a certain field? This would slow down the development of the platform, and significantly reduced the target audience. Any user from the platform will be able to refer candidates for a specific job. If they are doing a bad job, it will impact their reputation and there will be a vetting process to avoid/limit abuses of the system. Somebody submitting excessive amounts of candidates is likely to get flagged for",False

While there are no concerns for the HireMatch team specifically regarding either the Bitcoin situation nor the SEC ruling, we want to use this additional time to build a robust community around our offering while leveraging some of the best talent in the industry.

This concept is COMPLETELY different. The key is our smart contract that will be generated EVERY TIME a job post is created. This gives the system the power of crowdsourcing to find job applicants. Each contract will divide a ""bounty"" among participants that all contribute to a successful hire.  Lets look at the average hiring process:  1. Job Post is put out 2. Candidates are submitted 3. Candidates are narrowed down to most suitable for post 4. Interviews take place 5. Candidate or Candidates are hired.   Each step takes time and money from an organization, especially 3 and 4. Our system will incentivize not only submitting candidates but also incentivize users to help Hiring managers narrow down recruits. Instead of being overwhelmed with 100's or candidates the Hiring manager will only have a small amount or HIGHLY qualified candidates from whom which to conduct interviews.  Once the new employee is hired, the smart contract is executed and every user that had a part in the steps that led to the hire will receive a portion of the bounty.
