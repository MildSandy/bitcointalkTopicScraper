Your success of coin comes from the idea that a coin has to grow in price in order to be successful(in most cases thats the case but not here). You totally trow out the fact from your post here, that it's been almost 2 years long bear market in alts and even then appcoins had a massive run ups where, if you are trader you could earn high returns. Same happened in 2013-2015. Most of the allt's were going down, just to reverse in end of 2015 and never go back to previous times. Now I'm not saying that every alt will grow, but the thing your missing out here is, that this project is not focused on price, but it's utility, that is far more Superior than just hyping price. You can see their adaption going up day by day and project is fundamentally growing stronger and stronger. You are used to the idea that every coin needs to compete with btc, but the truth is, that next alt market will be utility market and that is completely separate market from btc(crypto money) market, like dow or s&p's are to gold. Projects that can prove their endurance in bear market, will rise again as their success and survival is not dependant on token price but it's demand created from utility. I see why price goes down, as team has stated countless time, that they don't hype it. They focuses on fundamentals and adaption.",False

Although those items are perceived to be bought inside the App, the items are bought through the app store. The need for the transactions to go through the app store were introduced as mandatory by Apple App Store and then by Google Play. The conditions for the developer’s app to be distributed is that all the financial transactions have to be managed by the app store. The app store adds some value to this flow: 1) it may know the customer already and have their payment data, thus easing the entrance hurdles for the user and providing a better user experience, 2) it has the trust of the user when the developer may not have it yet and 3) it develops the necessary technology, allowing the developer to focus on the app development. Although IAB represents a market with a huge volume of transactions processed by Google Play and Apple, there are still two big challenges. The number of users with a credit card loaded in the store is still a minority. Only small part of the world population has access to credit card. Alternative methods like pre-paid cards are an approach but they are physical and depend on points of sale, therefore do not scale well. On the other hand, some of other payment methods like carrier billing have prohibitive margins that compromise the revenue share of 70% for the developer. In some markets, the margin of the telecom operator varies between from 35% to 60% of the cost of the transaction. The reasons given by the telecom operators are: 1) high risk of fraud that has to be compensated and 2) the users may cannibalise the telecommunications balance so the margin has to pay that possibility. Providing the user has a proper payment method, there are still some risks that have to be mitigated",False

Smart contracts: Yes  Middleman being cut out: Revenue shares are redistributed away from unnecessary intermediaries to end-users and developers; to enforce payments between the developer and the other parties, which are the user, the app store and the OEM, the entirety of the funds that the developer wants to put available for the campaign is locked in a different wallet, which is where the smart contract for the campaign will be running.  Decentralization: The process of judging developers will be decentralized to allow users to punish dishonest developers who deliver apps with malware.  Transparency: Being an open protocol implemented as open source software, it gives the trust back to the industry and provides guarantees of data transparency to users.  Scalability:  Raiden Network will be used whereby users deposit their valuables (preferably Ether) with the store in a payment channel using smart contracts. The same happens for developers. And from this moment on they can utilize the micro-payments within the App Infrastructure. Compared to blockchain, not all the transactions have to be stored but only the latest receipts, i.e. the latest balance for both users, must be stored instead of all transactions. This solves the problem of storing huge amounts of old transactional data that is inherent in blockchain.  Lower costs: The only fees are for opening and closing the payment channel on the blockchain. For payments over the payment channel there are no extra fees. Once it is established micro transactions are possible without further limitations.  Speed: By using direct peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, transactions can be exchanged as fast as the underlying network between the two parties will enable it.  Database: Transactions are registered in the blockchain ledger to reflect the trustworthiness and reputation of a developer; the proof-of-attention (PoA) is stored in the blockchain.

The value invested by the developer in CPAt is then used to award the user with AppCoin tokens for their attention. These AppCoin tokens are stored in user’s wallets. In App Purchase transactions will grow because users can make purchases directly, using their earned AppCoins or by purchasing them through various payment methods. Financial transactions are registered in the blockchain and later used to detect double spending and to guarantee user authenticity.

Centralization also stifles competition and innovation. Apps are commonly censored if they compete with the app store owner’s economic interests.[1] Risk of fake person which consists of the impression of the ad and later installation being presented to a non-real person (bot…) with the purpose of deluding the advertiser. Risk of double attribution whereby there is a possibility of the same user to count twice as a conversion, leading the developer to pay two times what was due. Risk of no attention which consists in the user installing the app that is being advertised but paying no attention to it. Risk of data leak which consists in the information regarding the user being leaked to third-parties for advertising purposes. Risk of default which consists in the developer creating a campaign but not having enough funds to pay the conversions that are generated in that campaign, leading to him not paying the due amount. Risk of repudiation which happens when the developer does not recognize the installation, failing to attribute the conversion to the publisher. The attribution is generally monitored by tracking platforms like AppsFlyer, Adjust or Rodin that have multiple variables that can be changed by the developer to define what it considers a real attribution. The number of users with a credit card loaded in the store is still a minority. Risk of digital goods lost may happen when a user buys a digital good inside the game or app but it is not delivered. Often, the user does not have a way to recover the payment or claim the digital good. Risk of double payment occurs when the user pays twice for the same in-app item purchase. Also in this case, the user may not have a proof that they paid twice. Risk of digital items cloning when the user is able to duplicate and transfer the digital good to another user, leading to losses for the developer that charge once for a digital good that is used twice. Risk of malware is the possibility of an app or game submitted to the app store being infected with a virus or malware that steals data or damages the user’s device. [2] Risk of censorship when an app store blocks the publishing of an app or game based on political, religious or social factors that are subjective and totally unrelated with technical aspects.",False

Our whitepaper (https://appcoins.io/pdf/appcoins_whitepaper.pdf) on page 13 suggests a number of possible solutions:  • Thresholds: The app store sets a lower limit, e.g. one install a day and three per week for unknown users. As the user has more transactions in the blockchain, the level of trust increases and the threshold is slightly raised. The user would never be able to do more than two installations per day in any case. • Cash out: As mentioned before, the user is not able to cash out tokens. He has to use the AppCoin tokens for in-app purchases. A fraudulent user could try to register as a developer and buy items inside his own app, but 15% of the transaction volume would be lost (app store and OEM margin) and it would be easier to detect a fraudulent pattern for that user. • User Fingerprint: The fingerprint of the user (a unique identification to detect double attribution) is not done only at the smartphone level but, more importantly, at networking level. The IP of the user smartphone, as well as routing information, is used in the fingerprint. • Shared information: The existent transactions with the fingerprint information will persist in the blockchain, allowing the different app stores to access and avoid cross-store fraud. The partial anonymity of the user is accomplished by using hash functions (like SHA256) in the fingerprint. • Targeting: It is the store that sends the Ads for the user, trying to do an intelligent matching between the user and the running campaigns. The client cannot try to install an advertised app that was not targeted to him. As mentioned before, it is impossible to totally eradicate fraud since the smartphone is an untrusted environment. The goal is to create enough difficulties for the attacker beyond the point that the effort and resources needed to explore the attack vector do not compensate the benefits extracted from that attack.",False

To prevent fraud by (fake) users several mechanisms will be used such as setting a lower limit, e.g. one install a day and three per week for unknown users, preventing cashing out of tokens. I.e. the user has to use the AppCoin tokens for in-app purchases. To deal with the risk of attention, a client-side method, running in the smartphone’s untrusted environment, will be used to register that a user is paying attention to an app (installed from an app store) for a certain amount of time.

There is a wallet that contains the budget of the created campaign, which is meant to lock the budget, addressing the risk of default by the developer. To address the same risk, there is also a wallet that will temporarily store the value of the impression, to make sure that if the attribution occurs within a certain time, i.e. the user installs and opens the app within a certain time interval, there are funds available to pay for the conversion. To prevent leakage of user data, the protocol does not expose any sensitive user information at any time and interaction with app stores. The only information that can be seen by others are the wallet addresses when a transaction occurs. To avoid the risk of malware, the protocol attributes a reputation level to the developers as “Trusted”, “Unknown” or “Critical” according to their track record of transactions in the blockchain. This is then extended to all their apps and across different app stores.",False

The Aptoide model is based on its social features. Any user can upload APKs to their own ""profile"" (their own store). And they can share those APKs with other users. This is similar to what Youtube does. Users can share videos. Of course, many videos are not made by the users themselves and may be copyrighted. That's why they have a DMCA compliant process where copyrighted content is removed on the request of the intellectual property owners. Aptoide follows the same process. Now you may ask, why would users want to upload and share APKs? The logic is somewhat similar to Spotify. You can make lists of apps by theme or your own selection. But also, it allows you to use Aptoide as a way to Backup the apps that you have in your phone, since as we all know, our phones have limited space, and Aptoide provides a kind of storage for that as well. This is why the model has been successful because it ensures that developers get recognized as the owners of the intellectual property, but also gives users the flexibility to help distribute and backup their apps. Additionally, as a quality assurance process, every app is filtered for malware, and fake apps are removed automatically. A seal of approval appears in the apps (Trusted badge) that signals to the community that the app can be downloaded. Parallel to this automated system, the community can also vote and mark content as malware, fake, etc...  So Aptoide ensures that a decentralized content distribution model works for everyone involved: user, developer and OEM (since they can currently make money off Aptoide based white-label app store solutions).  Now, what does this have to do with AppCoins? Aptoide is supporting the development of AppCoins as an open protocol for all app stores. To be clear about this, the larger part of the team working on AppCoins is part of Aptoide, for now. In 2018 when the foundation is established, the management of the project will shift to this foundation, and Aptoide will no longer control it. Just think of Apache Software Foundation for instance. One of the reasons why Aptoide is involved with AppCoins is that decentralization, transparency, and openness are already part of Aptoide's DNA. Blockchain helps Aptoide (and in the future other app stores) to take a further step into decentralization and transparency, by decentralizing the advertising, in-app purchase, and app reputation processes and proposing a protocol that makes these processes universal.",False

There are some countries where Google Play has a small presence or isn’t even available and in those were are growing at a fast pace allowing you to reach users you would rather not have the option too. Two things can be different than this traditional model when an open blockchain network is employed. (1) Developers get paid differently. Instead of raising money from investors, developers can use a blockchain to keep track of a scarce token, sometimes called an “appcoin” (short for application coin). Developers can sell or give away that token to people who want to use the storage service or those who want to support its development. The sale of these tokens can finance the development or maintenance of the service, and that sale can happen before, during, or after the development of the service. (2) The service is peer-to-peer. The users of the cloud storage service, themselves, comprise the infrastructure that powers the service (there is no server farm) and individual users can be rewarded for their contributions to that infrastructure (e.g. the spare space on their individual Internet-connected hard drives) with the token.",False

So the more they use a certain app, the more token they can gain. This will also in term feedback to the developers on usage patterns of their respective user. This whole process is term 'Proof-of-Attention', and you can see it as the user 'mining'+playing the game at the same time.  One key thing to take note is that the token issued to the user is locked (in another words, they can transferred or use it) until they spent a certain amount.  Quote from: okspam on November 14, 2017, 07:33:34 PM    I'm also curious about this. I've never heard of it, but I could see it being very useful in a wide variety of applications.  Definitely it can be applied in a wide range of area. Appcoins is built as an protocol so any company or system can apply appcoins protocol to be part of their ecosystem.",False

So, basically, the app stores will track who will install and use a certain sponsored app for at least 2 minutes, and that will trigger a conversion. This is the advertising model that we've called CPAt (for Cost per Attention). That 2 minute time is based on Aptoide's past experience as an app store (it seems to be the minimum attention time beyond which users are retained).

The blockchain doesn't replace all those intermediaries but it creates trust between Developer-App Store-User that makes some of them no needed anymore. Without those intermediaries, and with more competition among app stores and OEMs, it's possible to have a different margins model, where the user receives 85% of the AppCoins investment in Advertising. Because the developer has to pay the advertising in AppCoins. The user earns coins to install advertised Apps. As the user cannot cash out and must use those App Coins in In-App Purchases inside the games, the developer gets back the largest part of the Advertising investment.  2) Each non-Google app store (Aptoide, Amazon, Yandex, Opera, CaffeeBazzar) has a different API / SDK which makes difficult for the developer to integrate with so many different technologies. On the other hand, he has to collect the money from different backoffices and sources. With AppCoins, he only has to integrate once and it works with every app store that supports AppCoins. On the other hand, it receives directly from the user, and doesn't have to trust his money to the app store.  Answered you question ?",False
