In addition, from 2016, its price grows from $3 to $ 664, more than 200 times. Many people know Dash in very early phase, but do not buy or hold, just missed the chance. Now, One has the option to invest in Dash Masternode which Becoming part of the ‘infrastructure’ of a particular coin. You help secure the network & in return, you get some coins , On the Other Hand The option to invest in Cajutel ICO and became part of the ‘Infrastructure’ of a real world 4G LTE telecom. Telecom a largest growing sector your Investment speculated on worth of telecom asset and dividend as per EBITDA. Cajutel and Dash Masternode has emerged as one of the best Passive Income crypto currencies in the crypto space and the battle between these coins is heating up. Both Cajutel and Dash Masternode were designed with the purpose of helping people across the globe and to make the best Investment and earning opportunity for Investors, but both use different methods to achieve this task. Lets understand the strategies of Dash and Cajutel. CAJUTEL -:  High-speed Internet provider, Cajutel based on the Real-World Project for resolving real world Problem, Cajutel has grasped the Blockchain and ICO procedure of raising capital, in other to open up open doors for venture to small investors. This has turned out to be important because of the current trouble in getting colossal investors and financial speculators to grasp the undertaking utilizing existing conventional procedures. Cajutel ICO is not the same as most other token sales because in Cajutel’s case, company shares are exchanged for cryptocurrencies. Unlike other ICOs where tokens bought by investors exist afterwards as independent entities in the cryptocurrencies marketplace, Cajutel’s tokens are tied directly to the project as shares. This infers that investors are offered the opportunity for long haul Investment benefits, as obtaining such shares naturally qualifies an Investor as a shareholder of the organization. The company pays out 60% of the EBITA as dividend, then the earnings per share in year 4: would be 13$, in year 5: 16$, in year 6: 23$. So someone buying a token in the beginning would earn in 6 years 52$. Depending on in which phase he invests, this can be a increase of value of 1.86x up to 5.31x. The interesting is the following years as you can expect dividends far above the 20$ per share, every year as the capital expenditure to build up new infrastructure drastically decreases. Besides the dividend, the token itself represents a value as it is creating money for the investor. Should Investor sell such a token on the free market, then it can be sold at prices of 8x — 20x EBITA. DASH MASTERNODE -:  Masternodes are a form of a super-delegate on a blockchain with voting rights. One who collateralised a larger interest of shares with the intent for long-term best interest of that blockchain and cryptocurrency. A masternode is a piece of the DASH network that has 1000 DASH held as guarantee and runs a node 24 hours every day. Masternodes are paid 45% of the mining rewards from excavators in the framework. This is spread among most of the Active masternodes in the framework. As showed by the math on DashMasterNode.org, that would yield each hub with to some degree under 10% APR come back from the mining payouts. That is not a horrendous return by most normal measures, in spite of the way that it is almost certainly going to go bring down later on (unless gathering drops, which would similarly be dreadful news bears for DASH holders). Which one does it better? Dash can be costly, particularly as more individuals are getting to be plainly mindful of the potential. For instance, running a DASH hub requires 1000 DASH (at current cost of $.664 per DASH, which is $664,000!) .whereas in Cajutel Passive income plan you can contribute the amount you are comfortable in, the best part is the more you invest and the more profit you can make out of it, Hazard that the coin you back is a crap coin and it bites the dust. Thinking pessimistically: You contribute a couple of $K and lose the part. You cannot lose more than you put in, however there is the thing that speculators call the ‘open door cost’. For instance: You put your $5,000 in a masternode in a system that kicks the bucket, which implies you could not contribute that $5,000 anywhere else. In Cajutel, someone buying a token in the beginning would earn in 6 years 52$. Depending on in which phase he invests, this can be an increase of value of 1.86x up to 5.31x. The interesting is the following years as you can expect dividends far above the 20$ per share every year. Masternode is going to pay 2 Dash per week, So yearly Investor will get only 104 Dash, whereas in Cajutel if you have invested in phase 1 per Token cost $15 on which cajutel will give a yearly dividend of $52 after the third year which is more than 3 times, But in Dash Masternode they are only paying 1/10 dividend yearly, and in Cajutel you will yearly get a dividend of more than 30% of your Investment. These are the advantages give Cajutel a sizeable lead over Dash Masternode which is why I feel Cajutel is the Best Passive Investment Plan and will become most successful crypto coin in the future.",False

The business plan calculates on a more linear growth of towers and thus also reachable customer base. The more towers we build, the more customers we earn, the more profits we get. The more money we raise, the faster we can build. Once we have covered Guinea-Bissau, we start building towers in Guinea. So the Phase 5 is not a hard barrier in the plan. If we get less money we still might do Guinea, if the revenues are bigger than planned. When we declare Guinea-Bissau complete and its time to go into Guinea is a question of the market at that time. The first 2 years we pretty much will be busy with building up Guinea-Bissau as fast as the cashflow allows. If we then get enough cash to go into Guinea at that time and if the market still is interesting to do so is then decided. In other words, if we reach Phase 5 in funding would allow us financially to be capable to buildup Guinea as well if the growth is according to the plan. If we only reach Phase 4 in the funding, we probably won't have enough cash to do Guinea as well. But if we make exceptionally good returns in the first 2 years it might still be a possibility.",False

Answer:  Of course this is a lot of guesswork. But in comparison to lots of ICO companies who have a totally new idea and hope to become the next Google or Facebook, things in our area are a bit more realistically predictable because we have a prooven business case. There are many telcos out there today who serve customers with Internet. All over the world. So we can check out how they are valuated today on the stockmarket.  For telecom companies, the EBITA value is the key value to look at. (see also http://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/09/analyzing-telecom-stocks.asp)  For example I take AT&T USA.  AT&T trades at 37.37$ per share currently and has 6.140 billion shares . So the stockmarket basically says AT&T's value is roughtly 229 Billion dollars. Their EBITA figure on the last annual report is 28.9B$. This means AT&T is valued at a factor of roughly 8x EBITA. Other telecom companies have similar values up to 20x EBITA. EBITA is a good figure to compare companies in a well established market.  There is however more than just the EBITA. Key other factors are:  • Can the company grow or has it reached a saturatio point?    In a market where everybody has a computer and a fiber to the home, its much much    harder to connect new customers as it basically means taking a customer away from    a competitor. Its a hell of a lot easier to get a new customer who never had internet    ever before and unless you screw up, he will be resistant to go to your competitor    unless he has very good arguments. Saving 10% wont do the hassle of changing ISP.  • Can the company make revenue from these customers?    If you provide everything for free, this is a good question. If you look at totally    overvaluated companies such as Facebook, you can ask yourself that question. having    a lot of customers is nice but unless you can turn this into real money, its just a    burden.     In the case of AT&T and other telcos in the US, its obvious that they are simply competing against each other. Everybody in the country more or less has access to the internet. So in total you can not sell more internet subscriptions than the population of the country. This means if ISP A gains a customer, ISP B looses one. And to not have this happening, ISP B will do whatever he can to keep the customer. This means lowering the price, give other insentives to stay, offer more services. These are advertizement costs in some sense and are a high expense.  If you now go to the market where we are operating in, we pick up brand new customers. Customers who have never seen the internet ever before. You don't have to convince them that your offer is better than the competitors offer. You have to convince them that the internet is something useful. And this is much much easier because their friend who discover the internet will be excited and do the advertizement for you.  Now coming back full circle to what is the value of a Cajutel token/share in 5 years, we all can only guess. It depends on the buyer who at the end buys your share on how he values the company. If we tak the conservative 8x EBITA figure from AT&T, we end up with 550M$ or 309$ per share. The businessplan presumes we have a 10% market share by then which is quite a pessimistic estimate due to the fact that it took GSM to go from 0%(2003) to 100%(2013) of market about 10 years. What happens if we reach 20% of market share?, the value of the company would more or less be double. Now the additional points in the valuation both play in our favour. The company is not in a saturated market which means its much easier to gro and we make direct revenues from customers on day one and have the potential to sell other services lateron to the same customers as well (IPTV for example). This could mean that investors could work with a 15x-20x EBITA figure evaluationg Cajutel which doul mean the company could climb to 2.7 billion or 1'500$ per share. Compared to the initial investment this is a factor of 100x!  The other side of the coin. What if things go wrong? Lets assume we build this stuff and fail to get customers. Well the company still owns a lot of equipment. Towwers, fibers etc. This is value which is not destroyed when the company would close. It would be assets sold to the next buyer. This is a 151M$ in the books in year 5. So even if it sells for 60% of its book value, there's still 100M$ to share amongst the shareholders. Thats 56$ per share.  So one could say a 15$ investment of today could end up in a value of around 56$ to 1500$ within 5 years. Only time will tell. And of course while you are holding the token you get dividend. Year after year after year.  Andreas Fink CEO & Founder Cajutel",False

Most others start way below 1$ in value  Answer: the price has always be compared to the value you get. You can not compare the price of a sixpack of Pepsi with the price of a single bottle of Coke. In our case, we only have a limited supply of shares (1'780'000). If we would have 1'780'000'000 shares instead, the price would be 1000 times smaller. We decided to put the number of shares in a easy handable size. As the ICO is a increase of shares of the company, we didn't wanted to increase twice to get to ridiculously high numbers. And if the price per share becomes too high, you can simply buy & sell fractions of shares (which is impossible with paper based shares)  So when you buy a token, you own a piece of the company who now has your money and will use your money to buy assets which then belong to the company (which you partially own through holding the token which is your share). So your investment has not vanished yet. more than 2/3 of the investment goes straight into building up infrastructure and represent assets in the book of the company. So your token investment value is preserved to some extent and coverted to asset and futur revenues of which you also have a part through the dividende.",False

Answer: They are the same. 100% of the shareholders have decided that shares are issued in an electronic form of a token. This means your token is your electronic share certificate. The smart contract makes sure that when we pay dividend, all owners of a token get paid per share their part.  Question: How is this in light of the recent SEC rulings about ICOs?  Answer: The security and exchanges commission (SEC) opinion is not binding for us as we are not a US company. However their statements basically said that if you are selling tokens which are somewhat directly or indirectly tied to the companies profit, you are selling some kind of share of your company and thus they will look at you as having sold shares and the corresponding rules would apply. If you are US-Citizens, you might have to declare your shareholding in Cajutel in some way in your tax report and if you sell tokens and make a profit you probably have to pay capital gain taxes. In our case we explicitly declare that the cajutel tokes are in fact shares and we follow the rules about shareholders in our company. So for important decisions, the shareholders will be asked to vote upon etc. All existing shares (which never existed in any physical form) have been issued as tokens as well during the instantiation of the  smart contract.",False

It is a traditional business case to set up an ISP in a almost virgin market which is quite rare. The business plan defines in detail the potential revenues and is highly profitable but capital intensive due to the fact that all infrastructure has to be built from scratch. Thats why we turned to ICO to raise the needed capital. We have to build power, fiber, radio towers everything ourselves which is a pain (initial costs) and a gain (independence, low cost of operation).  The platform used is Ethereum smart contracts. You buy a token by sending ethers to the smart contract address listed on https://www.cajutel.io.  The team members consist of:     Andreas Fink, CEO (myself, Swiss), 25 years of experience in telecommunications. In 1992 I had started up an internet provider named Ping Net GmbH in Switzerland, in the very early days of the internet. Ping Net GmbH was the first ISP focusing on individuals in the country. It became 1998 a full featured telecommunications company before it was sold to World Online International a pan European internet service provider which went IPO shortly after. I then worked for Cisco Systems in the area of SS7 signaling and telco switching until in 2001 I started Global Networks Switzerland AG (now SMSRelay AG) which develops and builds GSM infrastructure for mobile operators and provides messaging services. Global Networks Switzerland AG also have established a GSM network in Antarctica. In 2003 I launched BebbiCell AG, a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) initiative with combined GSM/ VoIP services offerings which was successfully sold a couple of years later. In 2007 I aquired a GSM License in Iceland and built a network there. In 2010 purchased the failing e-max network in Iceland to converge it into mobile high speed network for the country. e-max has been sold in September 2013 to 365 ehf, the new 4G LTE license holder in Iceland and will serve as the base of their network rollout. The e-max network had over 500 base stations covering a big portion of the population, especially in the rural areas.

The distribution of tokens is 1'780'000 tokens in total out of which 60'000 are reserved for marketing activities and bounties and 720'000 have been issued for the ICO and 1'000'000 is held by existing, pre ICO investors. The 720'000 tokens sold are split into 5 phases as stated earlier in this thread. Tokens can not be mined.

Investment Return Estimates.  The company will be profitable in year one and in year 3 the return of Investment is reached. This means the company can pay dividends. The exact dividend values will depends on the operating profit and need for reserves for further expansion. If the company pays out 60% of the EBITA as dividend, then the earnings per share in year 4: would be 13$, in year 5: 16$, in year 6: 23$.  So someone buying a token in the beginning would earn in 6 years 52$. Depending on in which phase he invests, this can be a increase of value of 1.86x up to 5.31x. The interesting is the following years as you can expect dividends far above the 20$ per share every year as the capital expenditure to build up new infrastructure drastically decreases.  Besides the dividend, the token itself represents a value as it is creating money for the investor. Should he sell such a token on the free market, then it can be sold at prices of 8x - 20x EBITA. These are the factors which are seen on publicly traded stock market companies in this business area. This means an investor investing into one token today could potentially earn 52$ in 6 years and then sell it for 300$ to 772$ range.  All those figures are pure guesstimates as it depends on the buyers view of course but these values are based on how other telecom companies such as AT&T are currently valued at the stock exchanges.  So an investor investing into one token, holds 6 years and then sells the token, could earn up to 824$. Given it took GSM 10 years to get to 100% market in this area, our 14% market penetration after 6 years is a very pessimistic estimation. It could be easily be that we reach a lot more which makes the returns and the value of the token a lot higher even, way over the 1000$ mark.",False
