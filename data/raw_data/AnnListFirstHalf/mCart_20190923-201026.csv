Using these smart contracts, marketers and influencers will be able to transparently and verifiably collaborate while giving each participant the right financial incentives to participate in the ecosystem.  mCart Protocol Blockchain technology has been revolutionary by allowing anyone to own and transfer assets across an open financial network without the need for a trusted third party. With the advent of smart contracts on these networks, we can now go beyond financial assets. Building on these characteristics of blockchain, the mCart smart contracts have the opportunity to address the lack of transparency and trust in the retail marketing value chain as well as the undue burden of managing and dispensing value in many small financial transactions and un-leash significant amount of value generation for everybody involved, including the shoppers.  This vision is being achieved by leveraging a series of smart contracts for decentralized influencer marketing attribution on the Ethereum blockchain. Using these smart contracts, marketers and influencers will be able to transparently and verifiably collaborate while giving each participant the right financial incentives to participate in the ecosystem.  The Modern Shopping Journey The path to purchase from discovery to fulfillment is long-winded, with many distractions in between — to the extent that the modern shopper’s journey rarely starts from stores, websites or even mobile apps anymore. Today even marketplaces have a hard time establishing themselves as a destination.  A given shopper has to open multiple windows, make multiple trips and use numerous applications across devices to make a simple shopping decision. The modern shopper’s discovery starts with content, such as social media, magazine articles, movies, videos, and real world events and places — where they should be able to directly shop from. They should be able to buy online, pick up offline, or see offline and buy online. They need to locate products near them and communicate with sales people real-time. They should have fun with social shopping. They should see where the products have been featured, real-time deals & coupons, look-alikes and a 360 degree view of the products, wherever they are, in ONE window. Influence marketing has been effective in delivering on this expectation by providing shoppers reasons to buy from the sources they trust. At a time when monetizing content has proven challenging for many individuals and organizations with significant influence on culture, leveraging native, authentic, and relevant advertising as a source of revenue can be a life-saver for content producers.  mCarts revolutionize shopping, sales and advertising, especially with an innovative consumer-centric approach to referral or affiliate marketing. The engine processes & optimizes high volumes of data to shorten shoppers’ journey from discovery to transaction in your platform.  mCart Token Crowdsale The mCart token will be deployed to the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token with a fixed supply of 100 million tokens. The token symbol will be mCart. Mavatar will hold a crowdsale process for launch and introduction of the mCart token. Of the 100 million total token supply, 40% will be made available for purchase through the crowdsale process to launch contributors.  The crowdsale will occur in two phases: pre-sale which is set to start on Oct 27, 2017. It will be followed by a public sale, which will commence on Jan 8, 2018 and is expected to end on Feb 15th, 2018 unless terminated earlier pursuant to the terms and conditions of the crowdsale. During the public crowdsale, tokens will only be sold for Ethereum (ETH) and we will issue [•] mCart tokens for each ETH.
