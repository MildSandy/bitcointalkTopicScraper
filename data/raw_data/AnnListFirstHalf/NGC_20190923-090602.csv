Thank you for joining us today! Could you please give us a brief introduction to your company?  NAGA is a long-term project aimed at unlocking the hitherto untapped potential of today’s modern technology to create a world of abundance. We have created the first Blockchain-based ecosystem for decentralized trading, investing and education in financial markets, virtual goods, and cryptocurrencies. All of them make up the largest markets in the world, and our ecosystem unifies these asset classes while users benefit from a comfortable “Single Sign-On” (SSO) solution. The ultimate goal of this undertaking is to allow people to turn their passion into wealth — no matter for which of these three components. Our fintech solutions will pave the way towards financial freedom, total inclusion and wealth democratization.      Tell us about your accomplishments so far, and tell us what you are most proud of having accomplished in the history of the project.  Well, first of all, NAGA is a relatively young fintech company that came into being in 2015. However, only 12 months after our incorporation we performed Germany´s most successful IPO 2017. Currently, we are valued $100 million on the Frankfurt Exchange Stock. Just a few months after our debut as publicly listed company, we generated the world’s second largest Token Sale investor base with more than 63,000 subscribers in the NAGA Token Sale (In cooperation with a partner we raised more than 50m USD). In this regard, we are the first company that did both. That certainly makes us feel proud, but responsible towards our clients.      What is the most noticeable thing about your project? Perhaps it can be something you developed or something you achieved.  It’s actually quite hard to pick out one particular thing. But in this case, it would be the NAGA Coin (NGC), which is based on the same modern development standard as Ethereum. It resembles the heart of our ecosystem and a token that unifies all components of our ecosystem. In fact, the NAGA Coin establishes the world’s first crypto-gateway to trade any sort of financial instrument, and virtual good in a secure and transparent way. The NAGA token already has one major advantage in comparison to others: it is accepted as a means of payment (we use it as a unit of account) in the rapidly growing NAGA ecosystem. No one has to wait for acceptance because it already exists. The integration into such an ecosystem represents an important basis while at the same time limiting the availability of a cryptocurrency because in this way a positive value development is also possible in the medium and long-term.      Give us a quick rundown of the future of the project. What are you trying to create going forth, and what will it mean for the overall project?  Since 2 November, the NAGA Exchange has been available to existing NAGA customers in a “closed beta” version under the domain www.nagax.com. It supports classic fiat currencies as well as well-known crypto-pairings, including our NAGA Coin. With NAGA Crypto Beam, all the usual crypto-pairings (i.e. the exchange rate between two cryptocurrencies) can be exchanged in real time for the best market prices with a single push of a button. The swift and user-friendly transaction is carried out in the background via the NAGA Exchange. All NAGA products are fully connected to the NAGA Wallet via a “single sign-on” (SSO) access — and thus to the entire NAGA Ecosystem in a PayPal-like manner. The NAGA Exchange is one of the fastest in the world and can process more than 10 million transactions per second. We will perform the beta test until our team and users are satisfied. So, we integrate users in this evaluation process. Once functionally and user experience is optimal, the NAGA Exchange will officially be launched.      Tell us a bit about your team. Who are the people behind the screens?  NAGA’s team of over 150 employees combines deep know-how in trading, banking, and blockchain technology with the right mixture of start-up spirit and corporate professionalism to bring enthusiastic innovation and measurable results to its clients’ business processes. The team is spread over several offices across Europe. Employees speak natively many different languages, including German, Bosnian, Russian, English, Spanish, Italian and French.      What partnerships have you formed so far, and which ones are the biggest?  We have already formed many partnerships with well-established fintech companies, including MyBucks, Ontology, and Easyfolio. With all of them we cooperate on different fields, but always in the belief of mutual benefit.

As a wallet for securely storing NGC and any other cryptocurrency, we, of course, recommend our own NAGA Wallet, which has a direct synchronization to NAGA Exchange.

From advanced technological achievements, to improved ‘ease of doing business’ in many of the regions where we proudly operate, to the continued breakout of smartphone access across the continent of Africa, to the furthering of our mission for global financial inclusion in serving the unbanked and underbanked alike, it has truly been a stellar 2018.  We also look back on exciting milestone from our Team at MyBucks, including the continued deployment of mobile lending app ‘Haraka’ (or ‘Swiftly’ in Swahili), our work in Malawi within the 40,000-strong Dzaleka Refugee Camp in collaboration with UNHCR, the bold new partnerships that we’ve forged; together, these have ensured we, as one of Africa’s first Financial Technology enterprises, remain in pole position and at the cutting edge of financial transactions.  Brand benchmarks certainly to be celebrated, however we are forever looking forward. As such, there are several exciting, new trends that we forecast on the horizon for 2019 within the industry of Financial Technology, trends MyBucks will no doubt play a lead role in pioneering.  At the highest level, the vision for our Frankfurt Exchange-listed MyBucks has always been to grow our market share continually while reaching more and more customers through our advanced technology offering – whether based in urban city centres or remote rural locations alike. Expansion on both fronts in 2019 is assured; MyBucks-branded banking services, e-insurance and mobile loans are presently available in over 13 African countries, a number which is expected to increase with the dramatic amount of smartphone users ‘unlocking’ across the continent (with 362 million smartphone users presently in Africa, expected to double by the year 2020), coupled with a dedicated drive by our Team to collaborate with new partners in Europe and across Asia-Pacific, as examples.  We predict that over the course of the next year, boons within artificial intelligence (AI)-driven financial technology will help us reach more customers and serve them with greater efficacy and rapidity, in any language. One such AI program already in use is our Haraka App, which offers clients nano-loans in real-time by using AI-based algorithms to predict an applicant’s credit risk. This tech allows clients to secure loans without ever having held a bank account or host previous credit histories while cutting through excessive paperwork in the application process.  The Haraka App was initially launched in Kenya, and was successful enough to subsequently be implemented in Tanzania, Uganda, Zimbabwe, and Swaziland. We expect in 2019 and beyond, great expansion here as well; financial institutions from countries as diverse as Argentina, India, the Philippines and Australia have taken note of our innovative scoring platform and have requested the model be applied to their respective markets, leveraging our technologies to strategically bridge the gap between their formal and informal economies.  We’ve even applied our AI to MyBucks.com. We encourage your readers to ‘speak with’ the ‘TESS’ proprietary Chabot on our corporate website, a model pioneered by MyBucks, geared to revolutionize how visitors navigate, engage and interact and one surely to be replicated elsewhere on the world-wide-web in the year ahead.  Artificial Intelligence advances are not the only development in store for 2019, however. We predict that the strategic partnerships forged in 2018 and the use of the technologies which they employ, will lead to terrific MyBucks FinTech adoption and growth, with last year having created a more conducive climate for global financial technology industry collaborations than ever before.  One such partnership, announced in November 2018, was forged with the UK-based FinTech company Bibimoney Global. The joint venture is strategically aimed at increasing reach and competitiveness within the micro loan market through SIM-Skins technology.  A SIM-skin is an innovative piece of hardware, exclusively developed and owned by Bibimoney. It consists of a thin plastic membrane that can be attached to the SIM card of any mobile phone. Once attached, the skin enables the Bibimoney application to function on the mobile device of choice, giving the user access to an interoperable mobile wallet. Once the user has access to the wallet, they can then receive and send funds, pay bills electronically, cash-out, and also apply for, obtain, and re-pay micro loans.  Additionally, said SIM-skin user will have access to the full suite of MyBucks products from any mobile phone, on any mobile network, in every country.  Key industry experts have predicted that there will be a steep rise in cryptocurrency payments in 2019, as more customers get educated on the advantages of leveraging digital currency, which include however are not limited to, drastically lower transaction costs. Foreseeing this, we were pleased in 2018 to partner with Naga Group, pairing Naga’s cryptocurrency technology and its groundbreaking ‘cryptocurrency wallet’ with our company’s banking applications tailored for the African market, indeed applicable to our over 1.5 million clients on the continent, beyond in Australia and in other key markets. Naga’s wallet enables users to send and receive cryptocurrency payments via email and convert those payments into cash. The technology can also be used for stock trading and financial investments.  Peer to peer payments will continue to grow in 2019, driven by the widespread adoption of smartphones and convenience offered by ‘P2P’ apps. Venmo, for example, reported that it “…processed over $35 billion USD worth of transactions in 2017, resulting in a 95% increase in growth of payment volume against the previous year”.  Throughout the realisation of this year’s forecasts, we pledge to never lose sight of the inherent social impact found within our Financial Technology. In Dzaleka, within Malawi, for example, the United Nations’ World Food Programme, as reported by American Banker, “…provided food for families in the camp upon entry, but hosts a budget shortage, so the food only lasts for 21 days. For the remaining 10 days, refugees have to come up with their own resources to survive”. Loans like ours not only help sustain families but help fortify communities. The community dynamic in fact, creates unprecedented accountability from our loan applicants.  Within Dzaleka, we have seen awe inspiring growth in fintech adoption, with no accounts in arrears.  With these milestones in 2018’s ‘rear-view’, the MyBucks team looks forward to a future filled with shared potential and substantial growth, accomplished by the continued leveraging of smart technologies, unbridled ‘access’ unlocked for our growing target market and greater collaborations forged in the name of financial inclusion. It is our goal that, in the near future, not having access to a brick and mortar banking institution will no longer be an issue for those who have been historically underserved.  In short, our predictions for the FinTech industry in 2019 are exceedingly positive, empowering and exciting.    https://corporate.mybucks.com/articles/mybucks-issues-their-2019-fintech-forecast/4l4sKU1pPgtMzbIodPOPBH   GetBucks: https://getbucks.nagawallet.com  Go NAGA Go 🚀🚀🚀  _______________ Benjamin Bilski, On Forbes Lists 30 Under 30 - Europe - Technology https://www.forbes.com/profile/benjamin-bilski/?list=30under30-europe-technolog  * * * I am investor of the first hour and Mr. NAGA fan & very proud of the Boy!

We have seen a lot of ups and downs and a lot of developments around the NAGA Coin Ecosystem. Within this crypto craze we have also seen that professional and hard working projects are constantly undervalued and often under attack. We want to distance ourselves from price manipulation, coin pumps or wasting investors money on senseless market making for the purpose of i.e. personal benefit or “price manoeuvres”.  We have been asked a lot why we have been “so silent” and why we slowed down our update cycle. The main reasons are: focus, marketing and sales and re-organisation.

It thoroughly analyses each crypto-asset and provides users with risk scores, liquidity information and information on conspicuous market activities  - All NAGA products are fully connected to the NAGA Wallet via a ""single sign-on"" (SSO) access - and thus to the entire NAGA Ecosystem   Hamburg, Monday, 12 November 2018  The Hamburg-based THE NAGA GROUP AG (NAGA) - a publicly listed financial company and FinTech with a focus on trading, transactions, virtual goods commerce and cryptocurrencies - is putting forward another product offensive: thus, since 2 November, the NAGA Exchange has been available to existing NAGA customers in a ""closed beta"" version under the domain www.nagax.com. In addition, the Cypriot regulatory authority CySEC last week approved NAGA Markets Ltd's ownership control procedure: Shares belonging to Yasin Sebastian Qureshi have now been transferred to The NAGA Group AG. Further innovations and updates are also on the market for NAGA customers as of now.  Yasin Sebastian Qureshi, Executive Director of NAGA, commented on the NAGA Exchange: ""We always offer our customers the best deal. Our first-class service is however also possible first and foremost due to the excellent quality of the technology behind it. The NAGA Exchange is one of the fastest in the world and can process more than ten million transactions per second. The front end and its corresponding IT landscape are state-of-the-art. Everything is scalable on a multi-regional level and has proven successful over the last two years in processing billions of transactions under maximum load.""  Benjamin Bilski, also Executive Director of NAGA, adds: ""In addition, the NAGA Exchange will have its own API (Application Programming Interface) for automated trading and will be an integral part of the NAGA Crypto.SDK. SDK stands for Software Development Kit, which will enable all financial services companies in the world to make their own business blockchain-enabled with little effort. In this way, for example, a payment service provider can become a partner to us and help its customers exchange funds for cryptocurrencies with one click - without having to build a complex blockchain backend themselves.""  Fees for the later official version are based on the so-called ""Tier 1-8 Model"", where fees can be reduced through trading volumes and certain supplies of NAGA Coins. Trading in fiat currencies (""official"" currencies such as Euro or US-Dollar) is only permitted if users have an approved live account with NAGA Markets or NAGA Capital, subsidiary respectively partner company of The NAGA Group AG. NAGA will perform the beta test until the team and users are satisfied. Once functionality and user experience are optimal, the NAGA Exchange will officially be launched.  In addition to the NAGA Exchange, NAGA is bringing further innovations to the market: As a result, it is henceforth no longer necessary to visit various websites of relevant cryptocurrencies if one wishes to get a price overview. Now there is NAGA Guard. It thoroughly analyses each crypto-asset and provides users with risk assessments, liquidity information and information on conspicuous market activities. NAGA Guard is connected to various interfaces and has at its disposal first-hand data. Within the NAGA Exchange, users can easily check the details of each asset by tapping the ""NAGA Guard"" button. NAGA Guard is directly accessible at www.naga-guard.com. Further widgets and improvements are in the planning, giving NAGA customers even more transparent insight into crypto-markets.  Qureshi continues: ""Our current NAGA innovation offensive is rounded off by a further innovation: With NAGA Crypto Beam, all the usual crypto-pairings (i.e. the exchange rate between two cryptocurrencies) can be exchanged in real time for the best market prices with a single push of a button. The swift and user-friendly transaction is carried out in the background via the NAGA Exchange.""  Improvements have also been made to the NAGA Wallet. ""The update offers, among other things, a leaner and slicker design and improved process for purchasing NAGA Coins (NGC) in just a few steps - and all this without overpriced fees,"" Bilski concluded.

Investors should consider actual use cases of altcoins in real-world scenarios, market cap, the reputation of the team behind it and historic trends.

NAGA Coin (NGC) backed by The NAGA Group AG, a publicly traded company, is the preferred currency of the entire NAGA Ecosystem which provides a suite of products and services for the community. NAGA Coin works seamlessly with the predominant fiat ecosystem by enabling users to access funds in three different currencies via USD, GBP, and EUR. NAGA Wallet handles multiple fiat and cryptocurrencies, acts as one application to manage a user’s entire finances within the NAGA Ecosystem.  And then there is NAGA Trader – a platform to trade a wide range of instruments including commodities, futures, cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks etc., while NAGA Virtual – provides the necessary trading and marketplace infrastructure for traders, gaming enthusiasts and even game studios to list, sell, purchase and trade virtual products. However, XLM tops the charts with a market cap of over $5.5 billion, followed by LSK at $362 million and NAGA at $17 million. And finally, when the price trend of all the three altcoins over the past few months is considered, NAGA has shown great stability even at times of distress in the market, which certainly works in its favor.

Passion is also our guide, making Sky the ideal partner. We increase the awareness of our company nationwide, while the TV commercials tell the NAGA story in compressed form.""  Qureshi continues: ""Our commitment to Sky is an excellent complement to our other activities in the Bundesliga, as at the start of this season we also formalised a collaboration with our home-town team, Hamburger SV, which makes us exclusive partners and trading partners. Both of these football-related ventures will significantly increase NAGA's profile. Our target group is the young and young at heart; modern, enthusiastic and sporty.

Management expects to double trading volumes in 2018. However, the business is still in its early stages, and future profitability will depend on the number and activity of brokerage clients, the success of recently launched products, as well as the sentiment towards cryptocurrencies in the aftermath of the recent market crash.  Positive EBITDA reported in FY17  NAGA EBITDA of €2.9m in FY17, following a surge in revenues (excluding activated programming services) to €12.8m (H117: €3.7m). This was driven by the growing customer base and higher trading volumes (€42bn in FY17) in the brokerage business, as well as advisory fees in initial coin offerings (ICOs). Sales growth continued in the first two months of FY18, driving the best monthly results in the company’s short history. The issuance (15 December 2017) of NAGA Coin raised US$50m, exceeding the initial goal of US$30m. The proceeds from the offering are earmarked mainly for marketing, platform growth and tech development projects. The NAGA Coin has already been introduced across the whole NAGA Ecosystem, although for now the adoption level is limited outside NAGA Trader.

Imagine you predicted naga in the middle of april with value of 25$ and in reality it is 55-60 cents.  2. Your saying that I'm pushing people to sell but in reality I'm advising them to hold and not to sell their coins in this low price. You know who really the manipulator. Who will be happy when impatient people sell their holdings?  3. Are you a ICO investor? Are you not insulted when the project owners buy their coins in a lower price than ICO price. They insulted ico investor by:  ""You bought our coin for 1$ per coin and we bought it for 50cents"". Why they buy it when it is 50cents, why not buy it when naga coin is 2$,3$ and 4$ if they really believe in their project.  4. We know that the problem is lack of good exchanges but they just make some excuses like they building their products, no time for application on exchanges. The question is? is it impossible for them to apply on exchanges and work on the products at the same time? How much time will needed to fill application forms of good exchanges? Naga team: Months to Year ---  In Reality: Hours only.  5. 50% will go for marketing. But there are rare marketing happens. They letting naga coin to dump.  6. Most of disappointed investor has been blocked in facebook and twitter by negative comments even comments are real and fact.  7. Here is the result after 6 months of hard works. We are now going to 6k satoshi and moving to drop and drop and drop until every one sell.",True

You know how easy is to change the value of a coin at Exchange? If Naga Trader values his NGC at his Exchange at, I dont know, 2$, the value will readjust in the other markets as well, because people can buy from one to sell on the other - Who will loose the money? The people who sells at the actual price.  I understand your point that a normal project make moon in 3 months, and all of you guys are rich by that time, but, this is the time to be patient - They raised a looooot of money from the ICO and have the tools to release a really useful product, and Im pretty sure they will reward the people who trust them at long term.

All I want is a healthy graph for the NGC price.

I apologies for spreading some negative news but we really need to voice out our concern to the NAGA Team before 90% of ico investor sell their holdings.  Honestly, I have 100% ngc on my holdings and pray everyday that there will be a pump when I open coinmarketcap. I bought mine for 0.00016btc per ngc.  NGC is a long term? Maybe correct, maybe not.

We made small pump from 8k satoshi to 10k satoshi and it is now droping below 9k satoshi. This pump made by huge announcement of release of naga debit card.  Why we need binance and bittrex? Example of ico who prioritize binance and bittrex and never went below ico price.  SALT Ico price: 0.89$/coin. Current price: 4.46$. Lowest price: 2.2$ and highest price: 17.6$   So we can conclude that having those two exchange made strong impact to the price of token.

Like now what happen after huge announcement it made small pump and already droping below ico price.  Imagine if we have bittrex and binance and ngc announce the release of debit card, maybe we are now on the top 50 coin or maybe on the top 30. That is realistic. Ngc price would be 8$ to 15$. And it will still increase because like I said before, ngc has no problem in releasing their products. Mostly release ahead of time.  I hope you get my point and help me convince NAGA team to prioritize binance and bittrex listing. This is for the good of NGC community. Thanks.",True

Sometimes some currencies are not available for withdrawal because of maintenance. In that case, HitBTC inform you upfront and if you insist on withdrawaling you get a temporary transaction number which is not found on the Ether network (normal, transaction not sent). When the platform is up they send the transaction and give you the right transaction hash (in the history).  Everything works just fine.

Having raised 12.5 million euros from China's Fosun International in early 2017, the startup went public on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and raised $3.1 million, then another $50 million in an ICO. The former professional swimmer previously cofounded a fashion startup, eBay-search engine and P2P-Forex trading app. NAGA has 150 full-time employees and a most recent valuation of $280 million.  https://www.forbes.com/profile/benjamin-bilski/?list=30under30-europe-technology Do you have an expectation of the price by the end of the year?

But we could do with some good news, been too quiet since listing on HitBTC and price has been slipping as a result (still over double list price which is nice). As with all new projects, marketing is key esp in the beginning to stabilise things when investors having doubts. It could also do with listing on a bigger exchange like Binance.  By the way, its out of subject but I did my research and I am invested in another project (I am extremely choosy with ICO's). I am sure it will pay off big, so a little tip for all my fellow NAGA fans here. Its Envion AG, Mobile Mining Units using cheap renewable energy (tried and tested by them using state of the art technology/equipment). Great thing about this one is not just price of of coin increase but also sharing 75% of the profits (in Ether), the other 25% is re-invested in more MMU's so keeps growing. Can't go wrong. You have until 14th Jan to invest (best using Ether so get coins instantly). It will also list on the HitBTC exchange initially after ICO closes. Use your own judgement by reading whitepaper etc.  Please use my link below if you are thinking of investing as I have already (I will get 5% of your investment). They will surely list at a premium to the ICO price of $1 so dont worry that you have missed the discounts. I also invested in NAGA same stage (for $1). And price should go up a lot as holding tokens gives the pay-outs. And lots of countries cant invest until listing.  Link to invest: http://envion.icoref.link/click?pid=1022&offer_id=1",True

The final distribution date is on January 7th. https://www.nagaico.com/#faq  #please read this https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/ngc/overview/USD ...  Byteme 1 day ago  For those of you who have issues with HITBTC and withdrawals as well as how to move coins to your wallet. 1- Do not invest in things you do not understand. 2- The company put out a video (not many ICO do that) showing you step by step on how to move your Coins in to your wallet. 3- The Roadmap clearly shows they will have a NAGA wallet and exchange within their own platform in 2018. If you read the whitepages you would see HitBTC was for people who want to buy more or whoever wanted to sell before realizing potential. 4- Your issues with HitBTC have nothing to do with NAGA.  If you have issues with stock trading company (say scottrade) you dont go to federal reserve or your bank to complain do you?  I lost my pass phrase on a wallet which had a lot of coins in it, do I go sue inventor of bitcoin? I also have a lot of coins in an asian exchange that wont reply to my emails and I lost my 2fa code. Do you think any of the coins are going to help me with the exchange? It is now 2 months I have yet to hear back from them.  You bought an ICO, if you bought a bigger coin say BTC (bitcoin) you could have gotten it from coinbase, now support there replies in what 3 to 7 days now days right? But they only list the 3 or 4 big names. You bought in to a new coin. Do you understand this?  That all said, realize that community can help you with your problems if you ask nicely. As far as hitbtc goes, they are slow on withdrawals and for example on some new coins like b2x they have not even setup a wallet yet. Nor has anyone else. The slow transfer maybe another issue if you are using BTC there have been slow transfer times. This is due to blockchain backlog  PLEASE PLEASE read carefully and understand what you are investing in. Do not blame the ICO for your lack of knowledge.

Seems legit, devs hold 85% of the supply and sell off 15% (30million tokens roughly) AND generate 30million USD in ICO funds. Holy shit! The greediest nastiest ICO I've ever seen. Not only did they false market to you retards by claiming they are only keeping 45% of the supply, but it turns out they always planned on keeping at least 80-85% of the total supply! This makes the premine hold larger than any airdrop ever created on BTT, or any airdrop that's even ongoing, and that's on airdrop territory.  And FYI, this is discounting the extra 5% for the referrals, which they have no mention on what they are going to do with those extras. Despite all that, just look at those fucking numbers above. I thought ICO was supposed to take care of all those expenses, when did ICO's start triple fucking dipping into profits? What the fuck has these forums come to?  I can't reasonably explain how pathetic that is. If they kept like fucking 10% of the total supply, we would of have a dynamite coin here.  This is the only thing i dislike about this coin, how hungry and selfish these motherfuckers are. Truly, we've never witnessed something on this magnitude.    Edit:  Did something go horribly wrong with my math, because i can't believe what i'm seeing right now. Or are you all just mindless fucking retards... the more likely scenario is that this is a thread of puppets creating the illusion that there are investments into this garbage.

We don´t need to raise a certain amount to make our products run, we are already live and our development is funded by the capital markets and investors like the multi-billion-dollar Chinese Fosun Group. We use the capital raised in the token sale predominantly to scale up the token economy. To make sure the number of users and hence the demand of tokens as well as the token price grows. As the scalability in our segment is huge we didn´t want to limit ourselves. Instead we set the hard cap at an amount at which we can still reasonably scale up. We have real data on customer acquisitions costs, revenues etc. As an investor in an ICO you usually take a) the development risk and b) the adoption risk by users (which both in our case have proof of concept). And after that it comes c), the main risk as a token holder: will users buy the token and will the value of the token grow? This requires investments in marketing. We focus on the token economy and its growth – which requires consistent scaling - and scaling requires capital. The hard cap does not represent the required capital to make NAGA fly (we have already taken off) but simply represents a reasonable limit for capital deployed to scale up the token economy.",True

We have experienced quite a dire need for an independent platform which consolidates the current black-markets for virtual goods into one legal and open market. According to several market analysis the virtual goods market was worth over $50 billion in 2016, other estimates conclude at least a high double digit number. We think that virtual goods as seen and used in games are assets of value, in which the gamers invest, spend their time for and put their trust in those. Switex fully focuses on virtual goods and thus want to establish easy to use market comparable to a hybrid of eBay & Amazon for virtual goods.",True

Unlike other ITSs, the funds raised by NAGA will be used to scale an already well-established business model aiming to achieve a unique position in the market. Just a fraction will go towards operational and platform expenses and development. The major part of the funds will go to direct revenue generating activities. Unfortunately, Business Actions are always very costly. And that’s why we see a sense behind raising funds for development, scale and platform growth. We set the hard cap at the same level as our market cap on the stock exchange. We don´t need to raise a certain amount to make our products run, we are already live and our development is funded by the capital markets and investors like the multi-billion-dollar Chinese Fosun Group. We use the capital raised in the token sale predominantly to scale up the token economy. To make sure the number of users and hence the demand of tokens as well as the token price grows. So the Hard cap is based on the market cap, we have big projects, we started to put them in place and we want to be consistent with that, and not only compare our Hard cap with other ICOs or ""ideas"" that do not have any product or a functioning business model.",True

The company IPOed 5 months ago on July 10th in Germany in the lightly regulated “Scale segment”. Initially, its aim was to specialize in “disruptive Trading technologies”.  The disruptive technology is an App which is the “Tinder of Stock trading”. The product is a “social trading business platform” called Swipestox, trying to earn most of its money with advertising. I have looked up the App on the Google play store and it has been downloaded a 100.000 times which is OK, but not great. Interestingly the newest comment/rating is from beginning of September, so I am not sure how actively this App is used.   The company boasts 2 prominent pre IPO  investors: Hauck and Aufhäuser, a well-known German private bank and Fosun, the conglomerate from China whose founder went “missing” some months ago, but then  reappeared , Oh, and Fosun actually bought Hauck and Aufhäuser last year.

The ICO itself is by far not the core challenge for most companies. The value of any token depends on the micro and macro token economy within which the token is used. Prior to this, an ICO´ing company faces the following challenges:  a)    product development b)    b) user adoption c)    c) the ability to attract users to buy tokens - not only once but on an ongoing basis.  And here comes the difficult part: it is a misconception that the ICO stops after the “Initial” part. The offering is rather just the start of an ongoing exercise by the company to attract funds to buy tokens to fuel their token economy.  And here is the problem: because most ICO´d companies invest the majority of their raised funds into the tech development there is only a little amount left for business execution (and user adoption), and, in most cases, hardly any money left to invest into marketing the growth and attractiveness of their token economy. Any ICO´d company needs to constantly fuel the demand for their tokens – not only during their ICO. The company should ideally have proof of concept on the ability to attract users and generate revenues with their product. This, however, requires the tech development and business execution to work. if you are running a country you need to make it attractive for tourists and investors to constantly visit and use your currency (your token is a kind of currency -think of “Winter Wonderland” in Hyde Park, London, they have to constantly invest to make and keep it attractive otherwise people will stop buying “tokens” for their GBP). If you build the infrastructure (tech dev, ICO) and then don’t tell anyone about it, the chances are that your economy is very unlikely to flourish. And it is only if your (token-) economy flourishes that the value of your token will grow. Any ICO´d company should hence have a marketing centred strategy to grow the value of their token. A perfect example of a great performance in “making one’s ecosystem attractive” is UBER… with billions spent in marketing to ensure user growth, market penetration and share, branding etc. A token economy (and hence the token value) depend even more on sustainable and strong marketing.",True

The token sale allows us to be backed by investors from all over the world and the created NGC token will be used as a base currency in all current and upcoming NAGA platforms. Unlike other ITSs, the funds raised by NAGA will be used to scale an already well-established business model aiming to achieve a unique position in the market. Just a fraction will go towards operational and platform expenses and development. The major part of the funds will go to direct revenue generating activities. Unfortunately, Business Actions are always very costly. And that’s why we see a sense behind raising funds for development, scale and platform growth.",True

Quote from: _ko33TPas on November 04, 2017, 01:38:21 PM On which countries are you targeting in the first place?  We are trying to target as many countries as possible. Obviously, we cant target every country due to specific regulations or rules in those countries.

Quote from: Gamelander on November 04, 2017, 02:20:49 PM In what cryptocurrencies can i buy your tokens?  We accept Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Dash. Other than that, you have the option to purchase NGC via FIAT ($/€) currencies also. FIAT currency payment can be made via Major Credit Cards or Bank Transfer.   Quote from: ggcript on November 04, 2017, 02:24:08 PM Who are the potential auditory in your project?  Given the fact that the financial service sector is still inaccessible (it still unnecessarily requires banks) for over 2 billion people and heavily complex, with non-transparent cost structures and that there is no central solution to these problems, NAGA’s mission is to open up the world of trading financial and virtual goods to everyone in a unified platform. Therefore we do not have a main target group, but rather a bright mass of people who are either excluded from other financial instruments, want to invest, or will be using the NAGA ecosystem for trading stocks or virtual goods. There is a variety of possible uses and potential auditorys for NGC.  Quote from: AIRDROPSQUAD on November 04, 2017, 02:31:42 PM To much supply I think. The price will slowly increase if your supply get low demand. Anyway, I will keep on eye with this project. Good luck sir.  The NGC is the base currency for all our platforms, already trading billions every month. With every new user the demand for NGC grows. As more and more users join, and will fund the NAGA Wallet in fiat or cryptocurrencies, NAGA has to keep buying NGC at the exchanges to satisfy this growing demand or the users will buy NGC directly at the exchanges - and growing demand means a growing NGC price! The supply for NGC is limited, and the demand - well there are 2 billion potential users out there. Thank you, sir!    Quote from: romfish on November 04, 2017, 02:36:32 PM Do you have bonuses for large investors?  We do offer a 30% bonus during the pre-sale phase. Other than that, there is a referral system which can be used to obtain free NGC tokens.   Quote from: specialAU on November 04, 2017, 02:40:08 PM When on exchange?  We expect NAGA Coin to become universally accepted outside of NAGA`s ecosystem, as the community grows and new FinTechs are integrated. Currently, I simply can't guarantee anything.
