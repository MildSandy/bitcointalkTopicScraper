Thanks for giving me the chance to make my pitch  Gimli is the first truly decentralized eSports betting platform. On the tech side, all bets done through Gimli are executed by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, so neither the players nor Gimli can modify payouts. You can test out the contracts on testnet here: http://demo.gimli.io  On the business side, Gimli is truly decentralized by delegating the bet creation process to the eSports community, through streamers. Streamers set up bets and declare winners, which allows Gimli to grow exponentially by reaching the community through these streamers. We already have a dozen streamers on board with over 3 million combined followers.  This business model is truly unique, and places Gimli within the massively growing eSports community rather than as an outsider. Streamers are strongly encouraged to promote Gimli as they decide what cut to receive from the bets.  So now that I've convinced you, make sure to sign up here  https://gimli.io",False

Do you have any plans for that scenario?  This coin does seem interesting.    We're using the power of Ethereum to build the betting contracts, which is one of the main advantages of Gimli versus a ""normal"" bookmaker. The streamer/bet initiator will have full power over the betting, and technological fraud will be reduced to zero. I don't even know where so start with the drawbacks of creating a new blockchain but not reinventing the wheel and moving forward on top of other technological breakthrough is what we believe in. Ethereum is going through some phases and get some people overly anxious about the future, just keep in mind that we are all building that future at the moment.

Also it gives people a chance to place wagers on the different gamers which sounds like a win-win scenario to me. With live betting and interacting activities in between, the app provides a holistic experience for all users and it is my major reason why I am so excited about Gimli.   For those seeing the short ICO period as too short, I think you are looking at this in a single dimension. The short duration is good for enthusiasts as we can buy the tokens before the word gets out there and everyone's rushing for a piece of the action.   For a start, i think this platform is amazing and it will go a long way in bridging that gap of the average yearly revenue per fan in esports. The streaming audience is too large to be generating an average of 2$ while traditional sports generate 52$. I am expecting the industry to evolve rapidly in a few years and I hope Gimli will be the main player driving that transformation.",False

The concept: Gimli is a decentralized platform for eSport streamers and viewers. Streamers can turn viewers into engaged supporters by organizing bets, votes, asking for donations, and creating prize pools for tournaments using the ERC20 Ethereum token GIM. Interact with our betting and voting smart contracts here. Gimli is provably fair, all functionalities are Ethereum smart contracts tailor made for streamers and stream viewers. Gimli empowers streamers by enabling them to connect directly with their audience, increase and control novel revenue opportunities.   The team: 20+ people strong, including - Pro gamers: Luffy - street fighter IV world champion , Stefano - Starcraft 2 foreigner world champion - Streamers: Thud - CEO ASUS ROG school, Skyyart, Aypierre, Sean Gares, and many more - Partnership with Mockit! https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KUWdQQA-TlUAH9QVeNivmQ.jpeg  - Blockchain experts: Eddy Travia, CEO of Coinsilium, Dr Moe Levin, CEO of Keynote, Mike Costache, from the Blockchain Investors Consortium, and more! - Technology: Ouziel Slama, former lead developer of Counterparty, Joseph Fiscella who co-founded the Alexandria project, and our CEO Julien, who did the Consensys program - Legal: Joseph Borg, Senior Advisor to WH Partners, practicing mainly in the areas of Gaming, Blockchain, Esports, and more, and lectures Gaming Law at the University of Malta. - Business: cool and experienced team (some Columbia, Harvard, Polytechnique), and real eSports fans   Created by industry insiders and world top professional gamers, Gimli is developing a strong public image in the streamers and gamers community.   Why is Gimli relevant: Streamers have massive audience in the hundreds of millions globally. Yet, streamers monetization of their viewers is low. - Ads-blockers are widespread, limiting advertising revenue. - Subscription fees are low compared with traditional sports, with streaming platforms taking a considerable share. - Sponsorships are few in a developing industry. - Viewership drops dramatically after each game ends, with volatile audience going to other channels with ongoing entertainment.  Gimli fits in alongside current monetization methods. With Gimli, streamers can create entertainments and functionalities with GIM embedded commissions. From the substantial source of direct GIM revenues, to better engagement, higher number of minutes watched and increased donations, Gimliâs promise is to give control back to streamers.   Partners and adoption: Existing streaming partners with more than one million twitter followers. Streamers set up functionalities and GIM they want to receive when their audience use Gimli on their stream. Thanks to those partnerships and active backing by renowned streamers, Gimli will be promoted to millions of viewers and prospective users worldwide, with the goal of viral and exponential adoption.   The GIM Token: GIM tokens are required to run all functionalities including donations, votes, bets and custom contracts. Each functionality is a run by a trustless Ethereum smart contracts tailor-made for streamers. No token creation will happen after the initial sale ends. The total supply of GIM is fixed at 150 million tokens. Tokens are ERC20 compliant and will be transferable and listed on exchanges once the initial sale is completed.

An interesting statistic is: in traditional sports, in the US, the average yearly revenue per fan is $52 in eSports, it's $2. This will change of course as the industry evolves but monetization is definitely low. One issue is ads-blockers, another is fierce competition between streaming channels: as soon as a game is over many viewers will leave to watch another channel. So to answer your question, streamers (several of whom are part of the team btw) need a way to entertain their audience between games, make it more sticky. Gimli will help them do just that. They will also get the GIM commissions they set up for each functionality on their channel. In terms of potential revenues this opens up a whole new monetization vertical  Quote from: revenant2017 on July 11, 2017, 10:10:03 PM I've been a fan of eSports specially in Dota 2. But i am confused. Your ANN states that project will be a Decentralized live stream, but on the whitepaper, it says a Decentralized Betting System. So this is Twitch + E-Gaming Bets combined? Will there be any escrow for this?  Quote Unsold tokens: Should the sale end without selling the full 90 million GIM, any remaining tokens will be transferred to Gimli reserve fund. If there is unsold 70m GIM, how can we make sure you guys regulate these? Isn't burning a good option? Or a fix amount/percentage? Because if there are few sold tokens, i will be worried because you hold over 70% of the total supply.  We are an stream interaction platform, we do not plan on hosting streams. The escrow for betting will be handled by smart contracts.  That's a point that's currently heavily debated internally and will be updated shortly. We will not end up like BAT Burning is definitely a good option, but it will also give the team a disproportionate amount of tokens. Distributing all the tokens to the fraction of everyone's contribution would be the answer but we want to prevent whales as much as we can to enhance distribution of the sale.",False
