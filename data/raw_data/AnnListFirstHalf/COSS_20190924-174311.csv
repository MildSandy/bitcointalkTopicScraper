It looks strange to me that if you have thousands of coss the weekly amount in cft is not worth the distribution fee. at the actual price cft/eth= 0.000175 distribution fee is 5/6 cft (is always 0.001 eth for the smart contract); so it means that if you must distribute to your wallet 500 cft (that is an amount reliable if you have thousands of coss) you pay in fee around 1% and i think that's  ok.",False

Ayways eterscan.io shows: Holders:    3447 addresses https://etherscan.io/token/0x9e96604445ec19ffed9a5e8dd7b50a29c899a10c#balances  Ethplorer.io shows: Holders    3397 https://ethplorer.io/address/0x9e96604445ec19ffed9a5e8dd7b50a29c899a10c#pageSize=25&tab=tab-holders  In the same moment. So from come thats difference number holders too ?  EDIT: Its insane but after half hour tracking my coss transactions on etherscan.io site between my wallets/exchanges just after one back to my adress balance on Eterscan.io THEY SHOW UP         Its crazy I dont know someone ""repair"" something on eterscan or dont know where but they show up. I see them already. After few days stress what with my coss because I not saw them few days in my balance they back. OMG ! I no have idea whats happen ...",False

An API engine is being considered for integration into our exchange. We are looking at how we can manage the API to prevent malicious usage and increase the security of our platform.We are not able to commit to a timeline but we will update when progress is made on the API.  The road to rolling out APIs draws nearer.  New hires.  Six new developers are in the process of being confirmed. They will be coming on board in June.  Their roles are as follows:  -Dev-ops Engineer -Network Engineer -Two Front-end Developers -Backend Developer -Application Operation Software Engineer -with more coming…  Now, we want to manage your expectations here. We are as excited as you are, in knowing that there is new manpower coming. But they will need time to review the infrastructure, on-boarding, etc. Once they are settled in, you can look forward to a more stable exchange and a better experience with us.  The new UI is coming along great. All pages have been completed, and we are in the last stages of squashing little bugs in them. We are in the home stretch! If the final tests runs smooth we should be very close to unveiling the new look of our site.  A security company has been engaged to conduct penetration testing. For security purposes, the name of the company will not be revealed. However, we can disclose that the company is an approved member of CREST. This means that the company is regulated, and has a proven track record in processes and procedures in the technical information security industry. Do check out the CREST website for more information on this organization.  Speaking of security, our three developers in KL have also been working on improving our current security features. Work of this nature is mostly behind the scenes, so it will not be something visible to the public, but we want to give you greater peace of mind when using our exchange.  To add on : you would also be pleased to know that they are working on additional payment channels for FIAT deposit/withdrawals which would provide more options for you.  Stay tuned for more updates in the near future.  We would like to give a shoutout to Dassman, a member of our community.

The day we have all been waiting for is here. Our new KYC procedures and FIAT trading for our USD pairs goes live on COSS.io TODAY, 30th of April, 2018.  Now, before we release the guides, we want to sort of set the community's expectations.  1) These guides are rather detailed, so take your time to go through them 2) The guides will be released one after the other throughout the day, with some time interval in-between, to let everyone ""ease"" into it. 3) KYC applications will be processed continuously and bank transfers take time, so please be patient.  We should expect to see the first deposits and trades coming in over the next few days.  We do hope that the guides are detailed enough for everyone to go through. and if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us through support@coss.io  See you over at the other end of the process!  yours,  COSS.io team",False

So almost 2 x number tokens in circulating supply from 64 mln to 118 mln its ""just correct"" by coinmarketcap ? You joking. I heard about many coss tokens not sold in ICO and frozen. But sold tokens and dev team tokens was both in circulating supply (sold in ico) and total supply (sold in ico +dev team part tokens). It was 98 000 000 coss if I remember correct exactly number or maybe 104 000 000 coss. Now Frozen not sold in ICO coss tokens are add to total supply and circulationg x 2 Why not sold tokens in ICO are NOT burn like in other ICO after end ?? If number in circulating twice so price should drop -50% because tokens are 2 x more. Or why the numbers are changed? Team sold already frozen tokens not solded in ICO time ? WTF ? They add fiat gateway and meantime they sell ""frozen"" not solded coss tokens from ICO times covered this event by hype about fiat gate Correct me if I am wrong. Tokens already 2 x more in circulating supply but I lost part my tokens ~30 k tokens because I keep them on etherdelta_2 nor directrly on Nano ledger but nobody care about it but make x 2 in circulating supply it was not problem for them ?

If this company can succeed in running profitable then the future is going to be good. Yeah sure there are issues that have to be solved, which takes time. If you are patient enough you will be rewarded. If you look at Bittrex it took a while for them to become where they are today, but once it goes there will be a chain reaction and it will be quick.  Just take profit here and there, stop with buying high, selling low.. you're here to make money right? Then stop what you are doing. You are trading with emotions and react to the temporarily fluctuations of the market. Just look at the numbers if you're going to trade or use bots.

Even if COSS generates a small percentage of the market's volume, you may be able to earn a wage off ~10,000 COSS one day. There's roughly $10B going though crypto per day now, we could easily do 100-500x this one day. A couple thousand dollar bet now could possibly set you up for a long time. I personally think its a pretty calculated bet (If you're expecting crypto to succeed). They may begin building a DEX soon too, who knows! So your investment could be future-proofed. We need that FIAT on ramp for now though.  If you buy now you are definitely buying the dip, which is always nice.",False

COSS doesn't have the best of teams (but it's gotten a lot better)... and it used to be far, far worse before. Every step of the way there has been major doubt about whether COSS can do what it says. I was there when the DAO was not established yet for the fee-split and everyone bitched (by the hour) FUDDING that it would never be established. When the FIRST snapshot occurred on a Sunday, everyone yelled FUD like crazy because the actual distribution came on a Tuesday so you had 3 more days of FUD. Right now, there's 100 users lurking here now... before there was only a fraction and no sense of ""community"" whatsoever AT ALL... zero supportive people, unlike now, which is nice that there are some sane people.  I was there before the exchange even had a WORKING HOME PAGE, let alone a working exchange. I've seen Rune constantly badgered for delivering late, but one thing he always does is... he does deliver eventually. (not always without bugs, but before, he didn't even have beta testers to help him out, I have no idea how he slept in the months of September and October, to be frank.)      Now, let me share with you this video by Andreas Antonopolous.      Andreas says that cryptocurrency is SO MUCH IN ITS INFANCY that every country needs 3-4 exchanges with a fiat-entry to have a healthy dose of competition, proper liquidity and activity and for the economy to be self sustaining which means we need around 800 exchanges worldwide.      So right now... you have only a handful of exchanges such as Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, Square/Cash, Robinhood, Alba, and a few more I'm forgetting that have fiat entry possibilities (and it's not worldwide). That's not even 10 exchanges. So do you think COSS is going to be useful when fiat entry becomes possible for not only the US Dollar but also the Singaporean dollar and other fiat-onramp/off-ramps coming into existence on COSS? Yes, very much so.      Will COSS have issues along the way? Absolutely. I'll say they'll have problems along every single fucking step. Does COSS have the best team ever? Nah. Are they getting better though? Yes. Are they trying their hardest to become better? Absolutely. As long as they avoid some major fucking hack and keep fixing bugs, they're going to be fine. God, I can't believe I wrote all that. Happy Easter I guess.",False

But as volume slowly grows, those payouts become greater and greater. The genius behind the payouts is when volume becomes slightly greater, those payouts will be used for trading.  Example. You get about 20 bucks worth of a coin that you yourself do not really believe in...but someone else does. Instead of letting the dust collect you decide to sell it for ETH or another coin in hopes that that coin does better. The general idea behind this is that eventually we will be trading with our ""profits"" that COSS provides to us. This can mean a measly 1 million users could all trade something as simple as 20 bucks a week to bring in 20 million extra in volume for that week.  Granted this won't all be done the same day...the general idea is that users will essentially have their trades spread out throughout the week as they decide to sell what they want and buy up others. But the genius is still there.  Say we sit on 100m volume daily one day, we can easily push higher as we trade our profits. This in turn will increase our volume and future payouts for both us and COSS. It's pretty friggin smart when you think about it...or i'm pretty smoked right now...either way.  TL;DR COSS 50% payouts will in and of itself bring more volume to the exchange as users trade with their payouts, thus increasing everyones payouts due to volume and bringing more money to COSS.

I don't care if COSS will land in the top 10 exchanges. As long as they have 1bil 24h volume, I will be happy.  And it is in COSS teams interest to make the exchange as successful as possible. I'm pretty sure the team members all own a sizeable amount of COSS tokens. With 1bil volume (half of Binance) 100.000 COSS tokens would give $31.000/month. That's a shitload of money and I'm pretty sure they own a lot more tokens than that. 100.000 COSS tokens is about $25.000.

In this industry it is not always easy to make predictions, and especially not about the future. Right now our main focus is to deliver FIAT trading. In order to get there we first have to finalize the implementation of the new KYC system. This has resulted in a larger than predicted UI job, and hence the focus had to shift. There is also a UI job to do in regards to the FIAT trading, deposit and withdrawal also. As you might already have guessed and seen this have forced the team to relocate resources from the planned UI upgrade. The upgrade of the COSS token and the DAO also resulted in some pushbacks from the backend team. The backend team is also working hard on implementing smart contract wallets for all the erc20 tokens which is aimed for end of March. Deadlines are not always easy to keep, but we are trying as hard as we can. The process is now moving forward and it is looking good. Mong’s team have now confirmed a new and much needed Devops Engineer and we are in negotiations with several new additions to the dev team here in Singapore. As always there are notice periods involved but we are very much looking forward to getting a strong devops engineer onboard to focus on the entire architecture of our system.  The various teams have been settling well in and going forward we win to have much clearer updates from the various departments instead of only general updates from me. IT will cover IT, Compliance will cover compliance etc. I will focus more on the business side of things by conducting meeting with a variety of companies for listings, promo’s, strategic partnerships etc. we haven’t been the best on delegating roles and responsibilities but at least we have more good people in-house which makes that part a lot easier. A lot can happen in a week, both predicted and unpredicted and whenever we estimate timelines, it is just that: estimates. If anything comes in between sometimes timelines need to be pushed. We have experienced what rushing can do before and we try our best to avoid that in the future and therefore we will take the time needed to ensure we deliver quality over quantity.  We have seen red markets all over he crypto sphere but being on the road attending multiple conferences I must say that there is a lot of positivity in the industry. Many good projects in the making and many solid tokens to hit the market. The interest of being added on coss for trading is increasing and the amount of meeting requests is piling up. We prefer to meet the teams, look into the projects and evaluate to the best of our capabilities before proceeding in this process. Last week it was the d10e conference in South Korea, next week it is money 20/20 conference in Singapore. I will also be speaking at a combined Lalaworld, stellar, Monaco, Coss presentation here in Singapore during next week. All these meeting has created a little backlog also for me and that has resulted in me being late with some promised updates, but better late than never and although this update won’t be very long and detailed we felt it was important to let you know where we are at the moment and what is coming soon. So while the general UI update has been pushed back, the UI work for the new KYC system and the FIAT is moving along nicely. Praveena’s team is working hard with concluding all necessary work to be ready with FIAT trading. There are challenges but they are all overcome-able and we WILL soon have FIAT trading on Coss.io . Don’t shoot at the team if it will be last week of March or first week of April, it will be launched when it is fully ready and tested. We are moving into an area that has far more regulations and implications than just trading crypto to crypto and we are here for the long run. This of course results in more thorough due diligence and compliance work for every step we take.  We will come back with more updates next week as we are getting closer and closer.  https://medium.com/@runeevensen/coss-update-february-10th-2018-384461fb25c2",False

So let me spell it out to you:  A spam in crypto refers to a situation when people want to fraudulently extract money from others without delivering anything of value in return.  COSS is a traded coin. You buy from other holders. Any purchase is on the free market and does not directly flow into the project as it's the case at time of an ICO COSS has a working product, and delivers regular dividends. There is more fundamental value in COSS than can be found in the largest majority of coins  If you are unhappy with the project or some of it's characterstics, then state so. But no matter how often or how loud you shout ""scam"", that does not make this project and the team behind it a scam.",False

This is the reason why Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, moved to Singapore Singapore being tax-free means that they most likely won't give a damn about DEX operations.  Even Sweden doesn't care much about crypto. In their own words ""our currency is stable, we don't feel threatened by crypto"". However Sweden is way too capitalistic and they slap taxes on taxes on taxes, so it's no surprise they were quick to slap taxes on crypto. Most governments with a stable currency will not be threatened by crypto, while those who have unstable currency like China will never fully accept it, however because of the very same reason - unstable currency, its people will try to get into crypto, meaning DEX in another country (especially an Asian country like Singapore) will become very popular.

You can't just change a law over a course of a few months. But I'm pretty sure they will be a lot harder this year.

There is a warning that you have to pay a fee to transfer tokens (conversion from non-ERC20 equivalent to Ether is free but transfer tokens will be a cost), so I have not transferred the token until I accumulate a substantial amount.  Solutions:  - 1. Get more COSS, if you have tens of thousands of COSS, you would feel pretty good to receive them - 2. Wait for the exchange vol to go higher. Either Bittrex or Binance each has a daily vol of $2-3 billion about X1000 vol of COSS  - Did you know that COSS needs at least $4 million in daily vol to break even on the operating costs.

First of all on this very last day of 2017 I want to wish you all a very happy new year. It has been a turbulent year for all of us, both in the market in general but also for coss as a company.  Secondly and with regrets I would like to apologies to all our users as we now see based on the ongoing testing, that we will not be able to go live with the new UI in 2017. On behalf of the dev team, the UI team and us here at COSS HQ, we are very sorry for this. We started testing 3 days before Christmas, but to many issues appeared while connecting the UI to the current engine, and with the amount of bugs discovered it makes no sense to rush it just to keep a deadline. We need to make sure the new version is stabile and functional before we go live. I will come with a new update on January 2nd, and while waiting for that, I wish you all a prosperous 2018.

We are still working on a schedule. As explained, most of our raised funds were indefinitely frozen in Parity multi sigs and there’s barely enough to conduct any activity. A total of more than $500 million worth of ETH of all projects around the world was affected. In comparison, Polkadot project lost almost $100 million. Likewise, DropDeck.io was financially paralyzed and rendered unable to make any refunding ourselves. This is a Crypto Natural Disaster. Normally, this is equivalent to a bankruptcy as everyone, including us, lost almost everything we worked very hard for. Actually, we could have refunded what is LEFT, which is very little and results in a loss for all investors, which means not a 100% refund but only a small percentage of refund, for example, 10%. Since we don’t want you to incur many losses, we had to reach out to strong projects such as PIN with enough resources to somehow save your investment. We are doing our best to somehow save your investment which is already lost due to a Crypto Natural Disaster. There is not enough cryptocurrency to refund now as DropDeck and PIN are trying to consolidate resources to make it happen. An exchange from DDD to PIN is a profitable opportunity we genuinely presented to you as our dear believers - you either take it or leave it - instead of us taking advantage of you. The bottom line is resources are still being consolidated to make exchange/refund happen, so you need to be patient. I repeat, participating in any token sale contains inherent risks and is an action you are responsible for. Everyone is simply doing our best to save what we all unfortunately lost. Beware that even if the DDD Crowdsale went as planned, tokens would take at least another month to be liquid so the exchange/refund would not be likely to be possible yet within this month. I believe you are reasonable and rational investors who can understand what is possible and what is not. What is possible will be done but it takes time. A schedule, though, will be announced this week to give everyone a heads-up and we’ll be working around the clock afterward to realize it.""  https://www.facebook.com/cosscrypto/posts/1772588479713609",False

Im a COSS holder. Another one is binance and i'm a BNB holder too. I have been holding them for almost 3 months now so im quite familiar with bnb and the team and everything.They are doing really good.  BUT  I believe in COSS exchange and token even more than i did in BNB when i bought it.  Why?  1- COSS exchange will be used for whatever Binance is, and MORE. Issuing Credit cards. Connecting Merchants. This will lead to more rapid and healthy mass adoption of COSS token as the base currency (gas) on COSS exchange  2- i have found COSS dev and team very transparrent in what they are doing and going to do. I Don't find this in binance team.  Apart from these, dev are honost and active, the price is still very low at the moment and other reasons mentioned in earlier posts. Think of a time which is not very far away when COSS/alts pairs are on COSS exchange (3-5 months or maybe sooner) and also  credit cards issued in cooperation with one of COSS strategic partners, Blue Card Company and  more and more online merchants and shops connected to the COSS exchange. Very Excited to see that. Also check out the very detailed COSS whitepaper  https://coss.io/documents/coss-whitepaper-v3.pdf   What we are in with COSS now is just the very begining but at a rapid growth. See you in 2018!!",False

Well all projects are long term since the whole crypto currency thing is a new born and a very few percentage of the people around the world are even aware of its existance.  So for a project to grow organiclly and to develope real life use cases and to attract masses of people to use it for meeting a daily life need, it takes time, long time. Varies in different cases though. The volatility you see in prices in altcoins are for the hype and excitement around them once some news come out. Not healthy adoption. For this one they all need a long time. A year or two.  Now if a project starts with a ready product it takes less time to grow. Also the application is very important. Exchanges are like gas stations. No matter how many types of cars are out there they all need gas. Coins pumped or dumped, they need exchanges. Now if its a multi-purpose one, like COSS, even better.  If you mean the price though, then I think you should look at the current price and market cap. Anything below 50 million is low market cap. If you buy something at ATH or near that then you should wait long term to make some profit out of it. But coss is now in a very low price and marketcap. What I experienced with binance will also happen to coss with out a doubt.",False

Im not a member of the COSS team, i just hold a modest amount of COSS tokens and i feel good about it too.   Security is the number one most important thing for coss to succeed. While they have revealed some details on their whitepaper, It is a fact that more explicit details would only have a negative impact on real world security. At this moment COSS is not the juiciest target out there for such attack and by the time they are rocking 100 million plus in revenue i hope they will have invested hardening their defense to the point of overkill.  Compliance with current and future regulation is the second most important thing. The team composition, tone and content of their announcements, and the layman observations i have been able to make indicate to me they understand this. Their jurisdiction is in singapore where the state of fintech legislation appears to be forward thinking. And in anticipation of the influential United States SEC regulations, business logic related to revenue sharing has been isolated onto the DAO, a decentralized separate entity that exists on the ethereum network. This places the system out of COSS' immediate control and into a regulatory category shared with other decentralized autonomous policy enforcing entities such as the Bitcoin protocol.

After that point it is their goal to reduce this percentage until 15%. but they have referral system that grants additional fees. its a very aggressive front loaded strategy, but they are just an exchange.  Coss is pretty different. the 50% fees policy is not subject to change, and the coss holders are rewarded for fees on additional coss projects like the point of sale service. Coss tokens are alot less expensive than Kucoin and holders dont have to dick around with building up a referral pyramid either.  While Coss uses an erc20 dao for revenue distribution logic Kucoin has their own blockchain but does it have miners?  masternodes? is there even a consensus algorithm? It seems a bit reckless to be running the code on their own servers instead of a decentralized entity considering the current regulatory environment.  Kucoin webpage currently not accessible. i cant download the whitepaper.  Anyway just cause kucoin got alot of money on their ico and is moving really fast on their plans doesnt have a whole lot to do with unique concepts. A cryptocurrency forms an incentivized ecosystem that allows some form of decentralized human organized behavior to emerge. Coss concept is effective and manages to be a good bit less annoying than that of Kucoin.

At the moment i believe that hiring more personnel is the top priority item. Its more challenging to hire good people but you better believe its important.  The ICO was very low hyped and did not raise as much investment as had been hoped. but we have seen all too many cases where a glut of investment did not lead to the most efficient business decisions despite plenty of funding. I think that a lean budget is a good thing. it gives the team a clear and powerful incentive to succeed.

The second thing Poloniex just got lazy and cheap and didnt prepare for growth the way they should have imo. You may be right it may be too much too fast but I would make it a priority if I was in their shoes. I'll eventually throw it in the slack channel when I'm not feeling so lazy.

Make sure you send it to the correct wallet for coss token.  Or you can leave coss in MyEtherWallet and still receive revenue share. You will have to register your ether address with the coss revenue share by creating a transaction with the smart contract https://etherscan.io/address/0x65292eeadf1426cd2df1c4793a3d7519f253913b using the activateRevenueShareIdentifier function. You will send 0 ether for this transaction but it will cost a large amount of gas so you need to set a high gas allowance.

Thats not too hard to do but will get old the more coins added as times goes on. Another elephant in the room that no one wants to talk about is what happens when the government takes in interest in the legal aspect of this project? Surely paying out dividends on shares is considered a security to most governments and thats on top of offering ICO's on the platform as well in the coming months. I wouldn't be nearly as concerned if it was on a decentralized exchange platform if all this was happening on its very exciting to see and collect passive income but I'm sure the government is eventually going to have some questions for them.

(All ETH or BTC vs a mix)  - Dividens are paid by ""stocks"" , Distributions are paid by COSS.  - Its a safe bet that COSS does 50M in volume in 6months , so you can multiple your current earnings by 50x  - I hold 204,300 and some odd COSS and my total value of the payout for the 2 blocks (added up all the total values) is currently $61.33  - No, the ROI isnt huge right now, BUT there will be 3 very near,  tipping points.

See most ICO investors wait years till anything becomes of their investment. Many ICOs even list on markets after alteast 6 months to 1 year. What is the current state of thousands of ICOs that happened the last year? MONETHA, SONM, EOS, BANCOR, etc what are they doing, they dont even have any product yet, all these coins are just trading on hype. After the IOTA ico it took over 1 year for the coin to list and start trading. With many ICO you gotta wait at least 3 months till you even get the coins and a long time till any mainframe launches    The exact opposite is COSS. This project is literally on steroids    As a change I got into COSS in September barely a month ago in the ICO, and its already listed and trading, the exchange platform is working, POS payments coming in, snapshot has been taken for fair share payouts, that is 80% of the promise delivered within 1 month (rest 20% ofcourse is the payout itself...)  what more could you even ask for?  So many in here are making a fuss about nothing.  There is no comparison with Coss and Kucoin. COSS will make you infinite passive income once the DAO is ready. Its completely decentralised and literally no other coin is building a fair and technically correct system like what COSS is doing. Kucoin already doubled down on their payout structure, some say its much less that 15% from 6 months onwards. Kucoin the payout is distributed manually.   Just wait for the payouts, and the changes  on the exchange they will come. In barely a month you have so much development around this project.

I've been extremely impressed with their responses and encourage anyone who has questions to go visit them.  https://cosstokenswap.slack.com is the link.  Regarding the VEROS scam accusations: From talking with the dev, here is the deal: Some of the dev team for COSS (Not the entire team. It is NOT the same company) worked with a cryptocurrency called VEROS earlier this year. VEROS was an ERC-20 currency token that ran on the etherium blockchain.  To encourage users of the currency to bring in more people to the community, most of the currency was locked up at the start, and that as more people were brought to the platform, it would be unlocked. It was neither an MLM nor a scam, it was used in a number of stores, there were ATMs that accepted it, and it did okay for itself.  But it had a fatal flaw: under the system, the VEROS company would have to pay the gwei for gas transactions.  This worked fine when ETH was 10$, but as ETH grew to 20$, then 50$, then 100$...  The gas transactions became so expensive that the business model was unsustainable and the business had to close down.  There's an important lesson there about the future of the Etherium blockchain, but that's off topic.  VEROS also got involved with an affiliate called Excallit, which was a pure MLM scheme.  If you google ""veros scam"" most of what you see relates to Excallit.  Veros's team wrote the marketing plan as a consulting job.  This was a mistake, and the community representative has owned up to it.  He was neither defensive nor evasive about it.  I was very impressed with his openness and willingness to talk to people.  If this was at ICO stage, I wouldn't touch it.  MLMs are sleazy stuff and even the slightest hint of association with one would turn me off.  But we are not at ICO stage.  The exchange is up, running, and working beautifully for a new product: It did 500,000$ of business today, according to coinmarketcpa, and handled it all without a hitch.  It's better looking and more pleasant to use than both coinexchange.io and liqui.io, and I personally prefer the design to bittrex. I've spoken with both their community representatives and their support team and I've been happy with them both.    This product is a beauty, and I'm glad I bought a giant stack of the coins.  Since COSS shares the fees, it means that I'll be getting paid in whatever the most popular coin is.  My first payment comes out in Sunday.  Exchange volume is still small, so I won't be getting much, but I should be getting some SUB, ARK, BTC, and of course, even more COSS.  It's like proof of stake, except instead of being paid in more COSS I get paid in whatever most people are trading.  ",False

And all COSS token holders can participate by either holding their tokens on coss.io or on MEW (but for MEW you need to add an identifier code that you will find on your COSS dashboard)  We have seen the listing of many new tokens on the exchange such as: KNC (KYBER) SUB (SubStraum) IND (Indorse) PIX (Pixlar) And of course COSS Token.  There are currently 40+ trading pairs and many new tokens will be listed in the very near future. The first upcoming once on our schedule is: KIN LINK TEU HGT ENJ + more.......  The team is growing and has also gone through some minor changes. We are also bringing more inhouse IT to Singapore with both back end and front end developers.  Thank you for your attention. As said, I am not very often in here, but feel free to contact us at support@coss.io",False

But if this is a scam then what is the scam? The exchange is up and running.  It works.  It's listing coins.  You can buy things on it and sell them, and transfer them to your MEW.  I've done it, so have tons of people. They have strict KYC procedures (You can't trade over 2k a day without providing some ID) and a responsive support team that I've emailed with.  Why would they put in strict KYC procedures for their exchange if this is a fly by night operation?  They're costing themselves serious money by restricting their exchange volume in this way.  You'd only do that if you were planning on staying open for a while.  It can't be a ""take the money and run"" thing, because they took the money to build an exchange, and built a working exchange. They can't be planning on not doing the payouts, because the formula for the amount of money you should be getting is easily calculable, the order books are all public, and the CEO's name is attached to the project. If he tried to defraud investors like that he'd go to jail.  Why risk that when the exchange is up and working and making money?

The last couple of months preparing for the ICO and actually launching it taught us many useful lessons, and with this knowledge, we are now adjusting the strategic planning for next few years. Importantly, we now have a much better idea of the community's needs thanks to our communication via Slack.    Long before the token sale was over we started to receive questions and the feedback from the Token Swap contributors concerning the unsold tokens and various other aspects of the beta version of the Crypto One-Stop Solution platform. Many great ideas were proposed and taken into consideration by the COSS Team. We know that all of you have been waiting for the updates following the ICO, and we appreciate your patience. Finalizing the results of COSS Token Swap (ICO) took us a while, however, we didn't want to rush with important decision-making. The voting system is set in place and will become available to you in just a few hours.    Tomorrow, September 10 at 9 am Singapore time (GMT +8) the voting will start. It will last for 48 hours ending at 9 am (GMT +8) on September 12. The voting will take place on your Dashboard at coss.io, so please make sure to log in to your account in order to participate. During these 48 hours, the voting options will be posted on the Dashboard and you will be able to tick the preferred one. We will screen the results and will announce them soon after via email and social media. The more COSS tokens you hold the more voting power you have. This information will be available on your Dashboard after logging in. The COSS Token that you have purchased will be released and distributed to the holders' wallets on September 20 and will become tradeable on COSS exchange the same day. The token will generate revenues independently of any control. The revenues will be then paid-out to token holders directly. You can anticipate the first revenue-share pay-outs in the beginning of October, and then regularly on a weekly basis.  Don't miss the possibility to use the voting power of your COSS tokens starting from 9 am (GMT +8) tomorrow.    In case you have any questions or concerns please contact us via Slack.

Press 'SUBMIT' (see the attached picture);  4) You will see a UNIQUE ETH ADDRESS displayed. You can send any amount of ETH to this address (minimum 0.001 ETH). The system will automatically calculate the amount of COSS Tokens that you are entitled to based on the amount of ETH you swapped.   The minimum amount of ether that one can swap for COSS tokens is 0.001 ETH, the maximum is unlimited.   What's next? Once you have swapped, wait until September 20 when the tokens will be distributed (you'll find them in your e-wallet on COSS or elsewhere) and will become available for exchange and trading.

This decission a day earlier and I probably would wait a little more to invest.  That said, I don´t want to send critical comments, but lets think about an other idea, which - for us/investors - could be: ""We decided to raise the allocated amount of COSS token by 50% to all investors."" (as TenX did days before the ICO)   Why? You say 600 COSS/ETH was set when ETH was at 200$ and I understand it is hard to predict the right price for ""now in X weeks/months"" (so probably you already rose the $/COSS-price in your advantage already to make it safer)  That said you were calculating with 200$/600COSS = 0,33 $/COSS Till now the ETH-price rose 50% what makes the COSS and the company-value 50% higher (300$/600COSS = 0,50$/COSS) And in my humble opinion the ETH-price will raise further in the upcoming months, what will make our investment even more expensive, but this is another story all investors should be aware of before...

Eventually once the market is more aware of COSS and have built some trust then you can ICO second phase in which you will sell all unsold token from phase one with a higher base price thus giving more stability to project in long term. 3. Equal distribution among existing investors: As intial investors already showed faith in COSS and participated in ICO to support the project, the unsold coins can be distributed among all the participants as part of goodwill gesture. Thus providing some comfort against the rising price of ETH  at end of ICO compared to price at start.",False

Today you are entitled to 15% bonus for participation. The bonus will be diminishing soon, so hurry up. The swap rate is 1 ETH = 600 COSS.  To send funds from your wallet on COSS.IO follow these steps: 1) Go to https://www.coss.io ; 2) Click 'Contribute now'; 3) Login to your dashboard; 4) Enter the amount of ETH to contribute; 5) Click 'SWAP'; 6) Accept terms and conditions; 7) Send ETH to the displayed DEPOSIT address; If you already deposited ETH to COSS, use the address in step 4 and ask for a withdrawal from your coss wallet.

The original plan was to set it aside, to lock it, and to give the proceeds from revenue share to charity. However, IF too many tokens are unsold at the end of the Token Swap, a big percentage of the revenue-share will go to charity, and not to the investors. After some internal discussions, we have come up with a proposal that will put that decision in YOUR hands (the ""investors""). After the token sale is over, we will evaluate the amount of the unsold tokens, set up a voting mechanism for the token holders so that you can vote on how much should be set aside for charity and how much would be burned.  Do have in mind that the result of the token sale only defines the speed and the scale of the platform and of course the time, it will not define the existence of COSS. We have an operational platform, and we will continue to build it regardless. What do you all think?

The confirmed ratio throughout the entire ICO period that ends on September 6 (unless all the tokens are sold out earlier) is 600/1 or 1ETH = 600 COSS (+ any bonuses you are entitled to based on the time, when you entered the Token Swap). The minimum buy-in of the Token Swap is 0.001 ETH. A unique address will be generated for you in your COSS dashboard. COSS is an ERC20-token, therefore you are required to use an Ethereum-based wallet such as Mist and MyEtherem Wallet, for example. We will not accept any cryptocurrency other than ether (ETH). The tokens that you’ve purchased during the ICO will be released on/before September 20, 2017 and will be available for trading no earlier than that.   Why is it worth investing in COSS?

The Token Sale includes 130M Coss at a rate of 1 ETH=600 COSS, so that would mean a total cap of 216k eth, at current rate that's 67M, the rate was decided when ETH was 200$ so that is why dollar value has increased so much.  As to the unsold tokens, this is what happens to them:  All the remaining tokens that haven’t been sold after the ICO, will be paced into a vetted/audited Smart Contract serving as the COSS Charity Foundation. COSS currently partners with the biggest Charity Foundation in Romania named “Mereu Aproape” managed by one of the biggest Media Trusts in the country and supports a Malaysian entrepreneur David Wu collecting money to help the children with cancer. The “Mereu Aproape” Foundation and David have registered their accounts on COSS in order to collect charity donations in cryptocurrencies supported on the platform. In the nearest future COSS will contribute to more charities by dropping its unsold Tokens left after the Token Swap. The unsold COSS Tokens will be placed into a Smart Contract Pool, accumulating revenues in various crypto as per the FAIR SHARE program. Every 6 months this wallet will release all the gains to help a specific charity case (or foundation) that will be announced publicly. All the funds will be transparent due to their placement on the Ethereum blockchain, and will be donated to a charity vetted by the Board of Directors of COSS. The Smart Contract Codes and the Audit will be released after the Token Swap.",False

Certain components of COSS are centralized because this is what the technology provides right now. As you know, decentralized exchanges have big difficulties operating large volumes at high speed, and they cannot trade with FIAT money as we intend.  The presentation of the wallet system is to present our users that we are taking into consideration all mechanisms to protect their funds.  All funds stored in COSS are fully auditable and we can provide an irrefutable evidence that we don't spend any of these funds.",False

It means that charity will get twice as much money from the dividends as all your ICO contributors combined. That's very generous of you, but that's not exactly good news for investors. You should put a cap on how much the will be given to charity, like 1 million COSS maximum. And then burn all other unsold tokens. Only then would it make sense to invest in your company.

We have done some internal discussions and came up with the following proposal: After the token sale is over we will create a voting mechanism, so the investors can vote how much of the unsold should be set aside for charity and how much should be burned.  Regardless of how many tokens we raise in the token sale, the platform is and will remain operational. Please note that we already have a working business, that is generating revenue.

The confirmed ratio throughout the entire ICO period that ends on September 6 (unless all the tokens are sold out earlier) is 600/1 or 1ETH = 600 COSS (+ any bonuses you are entitled to based on the time, when you entered the Token Swap). The minimum buy-in of the Token Swap is 0.001 ETH. A unique address will be generated for you in your COSS dashboard. COSS is an ERC20-token, therefore you are required to use an Ethereum-based wallet such as Mist and MyEtherem Wallet, for example. We will not accept any cryptocurrency other than ether (ETH). The tokens that you’ve purchased during the ICO will be released on/before September 20, 2017 and will be available for trading no earlier than that.   Why is it worth investing in COSS?  COSS Token will earn you revenues in ALL cryptocurrencies that generate transaction/trading fees on COSS.IO on a weekly basis.

Alright, so regarding your first question about the SEC. COSS is incorporated in Singapore, a country where ICO's and Cryptocurrencies are treated as goods and as such do not get affected by the SEC ruling, since they are still unregulated. The COSS Team is also paying close attention to the current developments in USA regarding ICO's.  There has been a Pre-ICO called ""Fire Swap"", 1300 ETH was raised during that round, and if you will register as a user on COSS you can see all of this information. The Fire Swap was held for Strategic Partners and Community Supporters but at the end, the COSS team has decieded to open up contributions to the public with a minimum of 50 ETH contribution. The remaining unsold tokens from the Pre-ICO will be included in the Token Swap Pool(ICO).",False
