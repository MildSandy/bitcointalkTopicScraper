We do not recommend that any player takes undue risks and we are committed to work with local bookmakers to build a robust and fair gambling system.  The LetBet architecture allows users (players) to directly connect to the LBT chain and play. Better still, they can set up their own nodes of our blockchain on their computers. This means that we do not and cannot limit any player from any territory or country from participating.  Quote Yes, I agree. I've looked their web-wallet and it looks so fresh and responsive designs. However, it is an ERC20 token? Or you have your own address? Anyway, I hope this project will be successful as soon as possible. Quote I check their website as well as their web-wallet. I think it wont be ERC20 token since when you try logging in in their website there is another tab where you will generate you own wallet address. Check it out again.   You right, we build a new chain which provide zero-fee transaction and fast and support smartcontract.  Gambling is just one of our product for this chain. We are think about some event-based application like voting where user don't have to pay fee to vote.
