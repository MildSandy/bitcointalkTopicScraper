Rather than seeing crypto as an investment vehicle, or something to be held, we are creating a new model in which crypto is something to be used as much and as frequently as possible. That means rethinking how the digital world is built — which is why creating the right blockchain strategy is so important to achieving our goals.

Our focus in 2018 is going to be on 3 efforts: Kin Ecosystem, Kin Standalone App and Kin Blockchain. In this post I will try to shed light on the Kin Standalone App.  The Motivation Kin standalone app’s main motivation is to be the gateway to the Kin ecosystem —a decentralized economy in which everyone can easily earn cryptocurrency and spend it on digital services for daily life. With that in mind, we are aiming to achieve the following goals during 2018:  A standalone Kin experience Easily earn and spend KIN and quickly learn how cryptocurrency can become useful for daily life. The app is open to all, anyone who wants to learn about Kin is welcome!  The simplest and most secure place to hold KIN Using crypto today is unbelievably complex. With Kin, this can be changed. However, simplifying the crypto experience is only one part of the equation. Since everyone can potentially become KIN holders, we should provide them with the best place to manage it. Things like sharing KIN balances from the digital services, tracking transactions, and easy to use backup tools are a must and will be very intuitive and clear.  A discovery point Educate KIN holders and newbies about Kin ecosystem by exposing them to new earning opportunities and spending offers both within the app and on other apps / digital services.

Without their voices, conversations would never be sparked, ideas would not come to life, and Kin’s uniqueness would never shine. So, now is time to shed some light on one of our biggest voices in the community: Dillon. He is a constant source of fresh air. Whether he is sticking up for Kin in our Telegram channels, creating new content on our subreddit, or sharing his thoughtful opinion on Medium, he is always around and the community feels his presence.  Dillon is one in a million. This blockchain enthusiast has been an advocate for Kin from the very beginning. We first discovered him when he selflessly wrote a killer FAQ for our subscribers on Reddit. “The Kin community was growing rapidly around the turn of the new year, so I wrote the FAQ, hoping it would be the first place every new or prospective member would look and have all their basic questions answered.” From that moment on, Dillon has been a sort of celebrity here at the Kin Community Team.  After his successful FAQ on Reddit, he decided to write “The Magic of Kin” as his next step. Definitely check that one out…“I had given everyone the What, When, Where, and How. But there were, and still are, a lot of folks out there that haven’t wrapped their heads around the Why. And I get it- when I first found Kin, I didn’t realize what actually set it apart from potential competitors. At first glance, the KRE doesn’t really hit you. Then you put yourself in the shoes of a big-time mobile app that’s failing to monetize, and the incentives model suddenly clicks. The Medium article is an attempt to bring everyone to that ‘eureka!’ moment.”  And he’s remarkably humble too, “I’m just a regular guy that designs fire sprinkler systems when I’m not spending too much time on the Kin subreddit or playing PUBG.”  You can follow Dillon on Reddit and Medium  So you see, our community is the reason we are moving forward. You, yes you the one who’s reading this, are part of the revolution. Kin is becoming more than just a project, but a whole new world just waiting to be discovered by the masses.

We are building a decentralized economy in which everyone can easily earn KIN and spend it inside digital services that can be useful for daily life.  Kin initial launch taught us a lot about our users. We saw that Kik’s users loved to earn KIN. Poll completion rate was around ~98.9%! We were also very excited to see great success with spending — all KIN featured sticker packs were purchased by Kik users. Our data analysis showed that Kin is progressing nicely and data supports many of our assumptions.  For Kin to grow and succeed, we must have a robust and scalable foundation for a large number of users and a large number of transactions.

The Kin Ecosystem will compensate developers and app users for the value of their time, attention, and ideas — ultimately creating new ways to monetize digital services or pay people for their expertise.  Fulfilling our vision to its fullest will take years. Research estimates the total number of active cryptocurrency users in 2017 to be just under 6 million. This number is humbling, as it shows how much further the industry has to grow before cryptocurrencies are in widespread use.  There are dozens of challenges to overcome when working toward this goal: from scalability issues to governance; dealing with regulatory uncertainty like tax implications of earning tokens; safeguarding user privacy while allowing regulators to audit for anti-money laundering (AML); user experience and productizing the process in a way that not only the tech savvy will be able to operate a cryptocurrency wallet; and many others.  Blockchain infrastructure plays an essential role in this vision. It is one of the technological foundations cryptocurrencies like Kin are built upon. When planning the long term Kin roadmap, we must prepare a multi-year strategy that will carry us through the challenges ahead.  As the industry matures, we’ve grown to understand that this vision will be built on more than one blockchain. Complex decentralized applications like Kin will eventually span multiple technology infrastructures. As different types of blockchains specialize in solving different aspects of the problem, it becomes clear that no single blockchain will just “win” on all accounts.  We’ve seen this with the Kin launch on Ethereum. We’ve realized that while the Ethereum blockchain is a great platform for fundraising, trading and exchange, it fails to meet our requirements regarding scale — long confirmation times, low transaction throughput and high fees prevent us from bringing Kin to millions of users inside digital services.  This does not mean that Kin will stop using Ethereum. The ERC20 standard for tokens has been wildly successful in creating an ecosystem around Ethereum-based tokens. With a streamlined integration to all tokens implementing this standard, powerful tools emerged such as third-party wallets for the management of ERC20 tokens, hardware wallets for secure cold storage of high value assets and out-of-the box integration to a multitude of exchanges and trade platforms. These tools are essential for asset management by professionals in the Kin ecosystem, such as developers of digital services earning large amounts of KIN from the KRE.  To deal with the next phase of our pressing scale requirements within the bounds of digital services, we are planning to expand in parallel to another blockchain infrastructure. We are working closely with Stellar for this purpose.  The Stellar blockchain resolves digital services’ basic needs for scale, quicker confirmation times, and lower transaction fees. Other critical benefits of Stellar are its years long stability in production — which we view as the best production environment today — and their team, who has been great to work with throughout this whole process. While emerging blockchains may show promise, we prefer to avoid unproven solutions for the next critical growth period in Kin, as it becomes integrated inside digital services other than Kik.  Looking further into the future, we foresee several complex problems that off the shelf solutions will not be able to accommodate. Blockchain solutions like Ethereum or Stellar were not designed specifically for the Kin use case. As such, we will reach challenges that they were not built to overcome.  To handle those, we plan to invest efforts in customizing a blockchain solution for our needs. We are doing this via a long term collaboration with Orbs. By collaborating with the Orbs blockchain and co-locating our engineering team with the Orbs team, we will help design a blockchain from scratch that will accommodate our future needs as they evolve.  Enabling a new digital sharing economy is an ambitious goal. As we progress with the Kin roadmap, we will gradually expand the Kin Ecosystem to rely on all three blockchains: Ethereum for general liquidity, and Stellar and Orbs for digital services. We believe that only a combination of the unique value proposition of each solution will help us realize our vision.",False
