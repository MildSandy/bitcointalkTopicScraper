The blockchain is tackling problems big and small, and Edgecoin is taking on one of the most significant issues in the world over through the course of history: Education. Edgecoin is a streamlined and simplified data validation and documentation service for educational stakeholders.It allows the certification and approval process for academics and business to integrate seamlessly.  After a complete overhaul and lot of work over the last weeks, we are proud and excited to show you our updated Whitepaper! After long and fruitful talks with educators and stakeholders we have changed our business approach since the release of our initial Whitepaper back in the summer of 2017, so it was necessary to update it by now.  You will now find much more information about our products, our partnerships, and our ever-growing team. Since we want to disrupt education, it was only right to do something else in the design as well. So instead of a boring PDF, you will now find a lot of infographics that make our business goals easy to understand for everybody. This unique approach that resembles more of a presentation than a paper also aligns with our new website design.  On top of this, we added a technical part that answers most questions by investors.  “By implementing a technical part in our Whitepaper, we not only meet the new standards for projects of this magnitude but also show our possibilities for the future.

You describe school grades are going to be recorded in the blockchain and the result can be shared world-wide.  When a school class work/grade is to be transferred to another school either the department needs to go over the class material and decide whether to accept the credit or not.  This decision becomes more troublesome when crossing the country border.  How will such a situation be handled?  You also describe work experience to be recorded in the blockchain and that would be shared to others.  I guess this would be like a resume on blockchain.  But when a resume is sent to a company, the candidate can customize the resume to high light the relevant information and minimize or even remove irrelevant information to prevent a resume being too long for the HR to scan through for a match.  How will such a situation be handled?",False

Future education will face major issues that can easily solved by implementing the blockchain. Being not only a safe, but also a fast and cost-efficient way to store data such as college degrees, e-learning courses and more, the blockchain has the chance to disrupt education. Expensive translations that need to be verified by notaries are no longer necessary while possible frauds that occurred before can be completely prevented. Blockchain education will also be the safest way to store personal data that can only be accessed by the owner and seen by whoever the owner chooses. By combining colleges, e-learning platforms, public and private schools, academies and universities into one simple key or QR-code applying for jobs or looking for the perfect employee becomes truly borderless, extremely fast and totally secure. Edgecoin is building the missing piece to finally hack education and completely disrupt the academic world like the internet changed our daily lives in the last two decades. Not only students looking for jobs or universities will profit from this, but also companies or colleges looking for qualified personnel. Edgecoin will start this dramatic change with e-learning platforms, that are getting more popular by the day all around the globe. The ever-growing, multibillion dollar industry is a main factor that people finish academic courses next to their job, learn new languages, coding and much more. While the courses get more advanced in time, the payments and the degrees unfortunately do not change. All popular platforms around the globe accept fiat (USD, EUR, KRW, CNY, …) as the only payment solution. Bitcoin and the blockchain itself already showed that classic currencies are flawed and limited. By bringing cryptocurrencies and the blockchain to the world of e-learning, Edge (subsequent: Edge, Edgecoin or EST), an ERC20 Token, aims to build a bridge between those two ever growing markets.   2.0: VISION – FOR STARTERS The vision is the groundbreaking disruption of the old education industry and all of its branches. The following points are initial use cases which Edgecoin can provide right after the mercury phase.  Users pay with Edgecoins on every major e-learning platform for courses and other content they have passed or consumed. Users obtain valid, encrypted and unique certificates via Edgecoins smart contracts in just one process. Students can see and manage their academic development or the whole career in their Edgecoin based smart contract (online and/or stored on a secure device) that was provided by their university at the beginning of their studies. Institutions can get rid of their old and heavy documented certification process by having it all digitalized, organized, governed and issued by the Edgecoin technology.   In the long term, Edgecoins aims to fundamentally change the world of education. One can imagine a world where no one receives their grades on a paper. A paper, that may get lost or damaged, so the student has to pay again to receive a copy. A paper, that has to be translated into several languages and confirmed by notaries, which will cost money again. Instead the student simply receives an private key that gives her/him complete control of the public key that shows all of her/his academic accomplishments. While this may seem only like a small improvement, a closer look shows us how powerful this will be. By bringing education to the blockchain, we completely tear down borders and shred bureaucracy. Instead of sending papers, mails or other files when one only sends the public key that has all the information stored on it. Imagine finishing your school in Russia and applying for a job in the United States. You no longer need to translate your academic grades, work experience or anything else. Even further we do not apply for jobs at all anymore. Edgecoin will provide a service where you simply access your academic information with a public key that is only known by you at this stage, but can also be shared with others who cannot alter any information that is stored on that very smart contract. All employers and employees will be listed here and you can decide who will see your profile. Now our unique system matches job offers with qualifications! This will not only help find your dream job, but also help companies find the workers who perfectly fit their need.    3.0: EDUCATION MARKET ANALYSIS In 2015 the e-learning market had the size of around $165 billion. Since then, the industry is constantly growing and will reach around $250 billion by the 2023.  Especially in countries like India, China and Malaysia the growth rate of the market is exceptionally big with roughly 50% per year. Surprisingly for many, big companies play a major role in this market as they are responsible for roughly one third of all transactions for e-learning services. While these numbers may seem big, they are just a fraction of the endowment of the best universities in the world. Harvard, Yale and Stanford account for more than $70 billion alone with an average annual tuition per undergraduate student at around $45.000 and an average salary of a full professor of roughly $200.000. The top 100 universities in the world have a total endowment of over $433 billion. The annual research budget of the John Hopkins University in Baltimore is currently at $2,3 billion, with many other universities spending more than $1 billion per year.   4.0: PROBLEMS IN EDUCATION TODAY  4.1 E-LEARNING While e-learning becomes more and more popular, the certification remains an issue as there is no guideline that is accepted by all companies, countries and institutions. Finishing a course on a platform currently gives you a certificate for said topic, but does not provide any value outside the website. Missing translations, varying topics and many other issues play a huge factor in this. Especially in aspects that do not need a specific language, this remains an ongoing issue. Coding, graphic designs and many more jobs in the world wide web do not rely on a specific language and are therefore internationally usable. Not having the right certification to show said skills will result skilled but jobless people that have all the right tools to push companies further.  4.2 TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS Currently students most often receive their degree in the language of the school, college or university. While this may be a suitable solution if graduates plan to apply for jobs in their own country, they face huge problems when looking for job offers outside of their borders. Especially students outside of English speaking countries need to translate their degrees, which will cost additional money from notaries or similar institutions. Not only students, but also companies face major problems in today’s world, as fraud is almost impossible to prevent at the current status. False degrees and fake CVs are quite frankly not uncommon. Companies who hire fraudsters often end up paying a lot of money in the process while also losing valuable time as they need to evaluate the next group of candidates.   5.0: EDGECOIN - OUR SOLUTIONS By bringing education on the blockchain, we aim to erase all the outlaid issues in the chapter before. With Edgecoin and the advanced smart-contract-technology behind it you can save your CV in a code that will be accepted worldwide. Finishing a course now at any partner website will be stored as a smart contract within the blockchain, so you can apply for any job with just a public key of your smart contract or the same stored on a plug and play ready hardware wallet or smartcard. The company you are applying for will see exactly what you have done in online courses, which eliminates all misunderstandings. This will benefit in better jobs for you and more suitable employees for the company. This will not only save the job candidate money and time in the process, but also eliminate most of the risks for employers. Fraud will be completely prevented as the code in the smart contract cannot be altered. By finding the perfect candidate within a matter of seconds in our planned network, both sides also save a tremendous amount of time in the process.    6.0: MONETARIZATION For this level of validity and transparency that eliminates negative influence of third parties, translators, and notaries users (employers, employees and institutions) are more likely to use Edgecoin than any other currency. As it is with other crypto currencies such as Bitcoin the value rises with the use cases. Partnerships with e-learning platforms in the present and universities in the future will further validate the value of Edgecoin.   ------  7.0: TEAM  Name:   Kambiz Djafari Position:   CEO & Co-Founder Bio:      Early stages Investor in blockchain.

These tokens will be held in escrow and released to founders after the Beta release of the Edgecoin Smart Services.  INCENTIVE POOL: 35% Thirty-five percent of the total Edgecoins funds will go towards our first-year user-acquisition initiative. This initiative is aimed at universities, colleges and e-learning platforms. We estimate this user-acquisition initiative will help to boost the popularity and frequency of using Edgecoin as the primarily used token for storage of academic records worldwide.  TOKEN SALE: 50% Fifty percent of coins will be directly sold to investors during several fundraisers starting from November 2017 until the end of 2018. Once the hidden hard cap of fifty percent coins is reached, no more coins will be for sale, and no more will ever be created.    9.0:Pre ICO Details  The Pre ICO has had a hard cap of 10.000.000 EST and therefore 1000 ETH. By joining our first of two rounds of token distributions received an 100% bonus of tokens. Investments in such early stage come with huge risks as investors will not get paid back in case the hidden soft cap does not get reached.  EDGECOIN Pre ICO SALE Pre ICO Sale start: 20:00 UTC November 6, 2017 Pre ICO Sale end: 20:00 UTC December 6, 2017 1 ETH = 10.000 EST Minimum contribution = 1 ETH (Investments smaller than 1 ETH were not accepted at this stage and got sent back to the sending address.)   10.0 ICO Details The ICO has a hard cap of 50.000.000 EST including the sold tokens in the pre ICO. In this stage an invest of a minimum of only 0.1 ETH is required and the investor can claim the token back manually in case the soft cap will not be reached.  EDGECOIN TOKEN SALE ICO start: January 6th 2018 ICO end: April 6th 2018 Hard cap: 10,000 ETH Min Cap: 1,000 ETH Limited Supply: YES Price: 1 ETH = 5.000 EST   ICO STRUCTURE Edge will issue a total of 100.000.000 Edgecoins, 50% of which will be put on sale during the different phases of the ICO. 50% will be sold during the fund raiser that started November 6th 2017 and used for research, marketing and development. The remaining 50% will be used for as mentioned before in 8.0.  ACCEPTED CRYPTOCURRENCIES Only Ethereum will be accepted during this fundraiser. The Edgecoins that are created by these contributions will be aggregated into one Ethereum account controlled by Edgecoin.  REMAINING COINS REMAINING COINS If our hard cap is not reached during the coin sale (highly unlikely) the remaining Edgecoins will be temporarily held back for a later date. The Edgecoin fundraiser is a limited coin issuance event. It begins at the Ethereum block minted soonest after TBA (January 6th of 2018). As soon as the hidden hard cap is reached or April 6th of 2018 passes, the receiving contract will be finished and will reject Ethereum from that time on by calling a “throw” function. There will never be more EST minted. Remaining coins may be used for further fundraisers in the future.  PRICES The prices are fixed in Ethereum only. Please be advised, that the price of US Dollars may change during the ICO which results in different ratios between USD and Edgecoin, but never in any change in ETH. (As of early January, and with Ethereum prices around $1250,00, one EST would be worth roughly $0.25. ($1250/5000=$0.25])  WALLET ADDRESSES For further information and our Ethereum address, please visit https://www.edgecoin.io/ico NOTE: When donating ETH make sure the spelling of our donation address is correct or else Ethereum donation will be invalid and you will not receive any EST. Please also make sure to set the gas limit on your transactions to 220.000.  11.0 INTENDED USE OF REVENUE  OPERATIONS: 20% Twenty percent of revenue raised from the fundraiser will go towards operating the Edgecoin Smart Solutions and all properties linked to it. To ensure amenable business practice is occurring, our team of accountants will be expanded to provide authorization of resources and to improve transparency, improving company longevity. A business consultant will foster the adoption of new ideas and practices from industry experts. Further, game strategists, business strategists, Blockchain technicians, and communications experts will keep Edgecoin on track toward its worldwide goal.  DEVELOPMENT: 30% Thirty percent of funds raised will go towards the overall development of the EDGE token infrastructure. Our goal is to form partnerships with many different e-learning platforms around the globe to accept EDGE as the primarily used ERC-20 token and the smart token infrastructure. We will stay on the cutting edge in the e-learning industry and constantly evolve as a whole. Our future goals include: * Building partnerships with e-learning platforms around the globe. * Building partnerships with universities world to create specific courses for different academic goals. * Set a new standard in not only E-learning, but also academic grades around the globe. * Ultimately creating a system that allows students to study wherever and whenever they want while still completing classes that have academic value which is accepted worldwide.  MARKETING: 30% Thirty percent of funds raised will go towards the continuation of our advertising efforts to encourage worldwide adoption and usage of Edgecoin. We will expand the popularity of Edgecoin to make it the standard in an ever-changing world of academics. Due to our background in marketing, we strongly believe that worldwide adoption can only be achieved through a sophisticated and comprehensive marketing approach that can generate a significant reach and awareness within a short period time. This is crucial for the further development of the project.  LEGAL: 20% Twenty percent of funds raised will go towards legal efforts to assist with navigating regulations when needed. Due to the desired outreach of our services (worldwide), we will need a legal team to handle the imminent efforts of sports betting companies trying to obstruct our goals. Our legal teams focus will be advocacy and lobbying to promote total access worldwide.    12.0 HOW TO TRADE EDGECOIN  After the ICO, Edgecoin can be traded on many different major exchanges. This list of exchanges will naturally expand over time.  SECONDARY EXCHANGES One of Edge’s first goals after completion of the fundraiser will be getting Edgecoin onto the secondary exchange platforms. Once they are on the platforms, this will bring increased visibility to EST.   After the successful ICO sale partnerships following exchanges will start listing the Edgecoin:  HITBTC   HitBTC is the most advanced Bitcoin exchange and is built on the best technology and lets you trade effortlessly any currency pair on HitBTC.  C-CEX   C-Cex.com Bitcoin & Altcoin Exchange: Fast, secure, innovative and trader focused. And with lots of currency pairs.  CRYPTOPIA   Cryptopia your one stop crypto shop! The Cryptopia exchange is a quick easy way to convert your crypto and exchange on the marketplace.  EtherDelta   EtherDelta is a decentralized Ethereum token exchange, brought to you by Etherboost. Here, users can trade most Ethereum-based tokens.   13.0 PLANETARY ROADMAP MERCURY PHASE (Q4 2017-Q1 2018) Named after the first planet in solar system: The mercury phase is the beginning of the Edgecoin. In this phase, we will see a pre ICO sale and the main initial coin offering (ICO), the acceptance of major exchanges and the further development of Edgecoin. After the initial fund raiser, we will build partnerships with various institutions such as e-learning platforms, schools, universities and much more. As this is the very beginning of Edgecoin we are open to changes and we will adapt to the ever-changing surroundings. All alternations will be made public for investors to see in our GitHub.  VENUS PHASE (Q2-Q3 2018) Named after the second planet in solar system: In the Venus phase, we aim to bring crypto currency through Edgecoin to users that are not familiar with its concepts yet. We will further build partnerships on the way to make Edgecoin the new standard for e-learning while we are constantly in the works to bring Edgecoin to colleges and schools in the real world- Therefore, we are aiming to soon accept fiat currency.  As soon as those changes will be implemented, we will run a PR campaign to promote Edgecoin outside of the crypto currency world as well, as our target audience is the whole word. It is our plan to expand the source code of Edgecoin and not only build it on Ethereum, but also on Aragon, which is scheduled to happen in the Venus phase.  MARS PHASE (Q4 2018 and beyond) Named after the third planet in solar system: The mars phase will be an exciting step flooded with different achievements. In this phase, we will extend our developer and business development team in order to consolidate business in a short time. It is all about momentum. Since the idea of Edgecoin and the disruption of education is new and brings a value to the everyday-world, there will be others who will be copying Edgecoin. Therefore, it is of huge importance to stay on the fast track and keep the pace high. Edgecoin must be held far ahead of the competition in order to obtain the best partnerships. Our Goal is to build the best and most used token for education on the blockchain.  Other Planetary phases will follow soon…    14.0 SUMMARY E-learning in itself is growing faster than ever with rates of over 50% in important countries such as China and India, with the first also being heavily involved in building blockchains and pushing cryptocurrencies to a variety of different markets. While the world becomes more and more international and the internet erased boundaries between countries and states, the language differences remain. In the important aspect of education this results in a struggle like pointed out before that Edgecoin will solve. In the end, it is our goal to build worldwide standards that are accepted by universities and colleges around the globe. We will start by pushing the Edgecoin to the biggest e-learning platforms but will not stop there, as we aim to bring Edgecoin to schools all over the planet and replace the traditional grading system that has to be changed.
