By diversifying the types of revenues from customers portfolio and customer risk profiles are improved. For example by cross selling a trade finance facility to a borrowing customer will improve the risk profile as the revenue type is diversified to include fees apart from interest income.  In most cases the information for such opportunities are not easily available to lenders unless the clients discuss the same. Even when known it is likely that other banks/lenders are already owners of the opportunity or are providing the service.  When these information sources are widened to include business associates such as suppliers, dealers, distributors and service providers who are aware of the client’s business methods this enhances the opportunity for lenders/investors to diversify into their client’s eco space. In this way they also are able to monitor and track the exposure and potentially drive new outcomes for all.  This will mean higher lifetime value for the financier. This will also open up opportunities to enter new customer businesses by considering upstream and downstream industry chains.  Dropdeck offers the opportunity to lenders/investors to identify such situations where they can choose which eco system to enter on account of diversified risk.  Dropdeck not only incentivises stakeholders in the investment/lending supply chain but also widens the choices for the seeker. From an investor/lender POV it diversifies their portfolios and helps gauge new types of risk by bringing in cross border opportunities. Subject to legal regulations and tax regimes this can be a very useful new source for SMEs looking to seize business opportunities and also go global.",False

He said that most of the raised funds were indefinitely frozen in Parity multisigs. ""DropDeck.io was financially paralyzed and rendered unable to make any refunding ourselves. This is a Crypto Natural Disaster,"" he said.  He said: ""Normally, this is equivalent to a bankcrupcy because everyone, including us, lost almost everything we worked very hard for. Actually we could have refunded what is LEFT, which is very little and results in a loss for all investors, which means not an 100% refund but only a small percentage of refund, for example 10%. Since we don’t want you to incur much losses, we had to reach out to strong projects such as PIN with enough resources to somehow save your investment. We are doing our best to somehow save your investment which is already lost due to a Crypto Natural Disaster. There is not enough cryptocurrency to refund now as DropDeck and PIN are trying to consolidate resources to make it happen. An exchange from DDD to PIN is a profitable opportunity we genuinely presented to you as our dear believers - you either take it or leave it - instead of us taking advantage of you. The bottomline is resources are still being consolidated to make exchange/refund happen, so you need to be patient. I repeat, participating in any token sale contains inherent risks and is an action you are responsible for. Everyone is simply doing our best to save what we all unfortunately lost. Beware that even if the DDD Crowdsale went as planned, tokens would take at least another month to be liquid, so the exchange/refund would not be likely to be possible yet within this month. I believe you are reasonable and rational investors who can understand what is possible and what is not. What is possible will be done but it takes time. A schedule, though, will be announced this week to give everyone a heads-up and we’ll be working around the clock afterward to realize it.""",False

It will offer both royalty financing, in which investors have the opportunity to contribute to a business in return for a share in the profits from its success, and also debt financing, in which investors may lend capital to the company and earn interest with the repayments.  Businesses seeking funding are exhaustively scored and ranked, with information and research presented in a streamlined three level interface. This whole process makes use of a token-incentivized mechanism for evaluation and funding, and a smart contract based blockchain foundation.

DropDeck wants to remove the barriers that keep average funders away from the greatest opportunities,” said the CEO Alon Vo, “There are a lot of existing platforms for you to do that, but we want to build your favorite one. DropDeck is the one-stop shop that changes the way people fund companies worldwide.”  More and more companies are running ICOs, mostly operating overseas. Doing due diligence and verifying sources can be challenging. Some platforms rate and rank ICOs, but how the ratings are made, what they are based on, and by whom are often a blackbox. DropDeck seeks to fix this problem..  DropDeck prioritizes inclusion and decentralizes the funding process to the extreme. Anyone can participate in funding, searching for promising companies, evaluating people, performing due diligence, and enforcing repayment. A.I. algorithms are utilized to rate and rank all participants. The consensus mechanism makes sure only the best performing ones are eligible for participation and reward. Token rewards and smart contracts incentivize all participants to do their best to fund companies and reward funders. In the IBM Watson AI XPRIZE competition, DropDeck earned recognition and support from world-class AI experts, and made findings in complementing AI applications with blockchain features.  The market for funding ICOs, startups, and SMEs is over $300 billion. As capital flows into the DropDeck economy, the token value will increase exponentially. Up to half of the revenue in tokens will be burned, increasing the token value by depleting the total supply. Also the team and advisors have been working with 15 exchanges to guarantee token liquidity.  After substantial interest, DropDeck quickly sold out the private sales with no marketing, raising 3,300 ETH.  https://blog.coinspectator.com/2017/11/09/dropdeck-io-the-future-of-funding-is-ai-driven-decentralized-and-incentivized/?utm_content=buffer26c6d&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer",False

Starting from today (Dec 1, 2017) for the last 20 days of the Crowdsale, tokens will no longer be airdropped daily. Instead, the first 100 people to link their wallet address each day will all be automatically entered into our Grand Prize drawing for 300,000 DDD tokens by the end of the Crowdsale!  That means only one more winner will receive 300,000 DDD. That’s an amazing 30 ETH worth of DDD tokens to our Grand Prize winner. All 100 wallet addresses each day will still receive an extra bonus on their DDD purchases (e.g. a 19% bonus for all winners on Dec 1–19 days before the Crowdsale ends, 18% bonus for all winners on Dec 2, and so on).  The selection of the winner will be random. We will use the following process to select our grand prize winner: The wallet address of the first winner on Dec 1, 2018 and that of the last winner on Dec 20 will be combined tail-to-head and encoded to hex. The first pair of digits that fall into the [1, 20] range will be chosen as the date. The first set of 3 digits that fall into the [1, 100] range will be chosen as the position of the wallet address of the Grand Prize winner among the lucky winners on that date.  Note 1: all of our 3,000 DDD winners will be receiving their DDD tokens by Dec 5, 2017 according to the following list: http://bit.ly/DDDAirDrop  Note 2: It is important that you use your MyEtherWallet.

The participation of our community is crucial for the A.I. applications and Blockchain technology to achieve maximum utility. This community can be substantiated by centering the actions of everybody around a cryptocurrency token; this will be the standard by which collaboration and transaction can participate on the same field.  The unifying force at DropDeck is the Decentralized DropDeck (DDD) Token. Through all of the various users and processes like the participants for lending, participants for contributions, and the entirety of the funding process.  To realize how the DDD Token bridges the actions taken by all user roles, consider that there are only two methods of participation: Contributing, and Lending. We will assign user roles based on the two methods of participation and make sure each user role has self-sufficient mechanisms to guide its quality. The only thing missing is a token of currency by which users can exchange the services that guide the quality. Participants get rewarded by more tokens when the services they provide meet or exceed the expectations of the community.  The primary difference between Contributing DDD Tokens and Lending DDD Tokens is the reason why the company is seeking funds. If the company is seeking funds for a specific purpose, needs the money quickly, is seeking larger amounts, or is desiring a loan-structure for repayment, then they will be likely Lending DDD Tokens.

Please direct any questions to DropDeck.Team                    DropDeck Platform A Cross-border Business Funding Platform DropDeck is a royalty and debt financing platform for fast growing businesses with a pure smart-contract and token-incentivized mechanism to evaluate and fund businesses worldwide  FUND STARTUPS AND SMEs 1) Fundraising companies are exhaustively scored and ranked so that funders can put their money to the fastest growing companies, around the world. 2) Funders can ""contribute"" (royalty financing) or ""lend"" (debt financing) tokens to fundraising companies in a fast, reliable and secured way. 3) All participants in the funding ecosystem are financially incentivized to help funders get rewarded, so that funders can keep funding and attract more funders to join.    SCREEN COMPANIES FASTER   FUNNEL DESIGN Information is arranged in order of importance, into 3 layers of increasing details - Home, Deck, and Claim, so that funders can screen very fast based on what matters the most first before deciding to spend time on more details or not.   TRUST CIRCLE If you can add trustworthy people you know to your Trust Circle and rate their trustworthiness accurately, you can see more and more accurate evaluation results and rankings of companies fundraising on DropDeck.  FURTHER MINIMIZE RISK   LIBERAL SCORING Trust scores and Potential scores are based less on consciously inputted data and more on incentive-guided behavior and immutable information unconsciously scattered across the platform and the internet, uncovering telltale hidden patterns.   SCORE VERIFICATION You can pay to see hidden details behind a score - all kinds of data and metadata the score is based on, contributed by whom, and from which sources. The users who have contributed to the pay-to-see details are rewarded instantly.
