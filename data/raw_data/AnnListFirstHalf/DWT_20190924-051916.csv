A DeepWater neural network will analyze the datasets and identify sunken ships, deposits of mineral resources, underwater anomalies, etc     Geographical coordinates of the discovered underwater resources, including sunken ships with valuable cargo, will be recorded in blockchain and available for sale at the ""DeepWater Market"" online auction platform. After three years of development, the technology is ready for initial use and we need to build the largest fleet of autonomous gliders in the world to start the exploration. To crowdfund the glider assembly line, we are doing token sale in Q1 2018.     We are also looking to engage with experts more closely so if you are interested in contributing to the project in the advisory capacity, feel free to reach out to me directly.
