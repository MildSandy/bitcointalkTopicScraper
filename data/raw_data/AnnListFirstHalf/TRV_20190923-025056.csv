AFAIK none of the major travel services accept crypto-currency so even an intermediary/middleman crypto-currency + friendly site with a 1% fee would have a market.  As others have said the elements don't really come together on this though, maybe a little more time and particularly  1/2 members with high level experience at a major travel service provider would have made it more appealing.

ICO NOW LIVE,"   It's somewhat unclear what Travelcoin is going to be. Will it cut the middleman? Will it be a loyalty program? How does it avoid double booking?   Major travel outlet sites like Expedia/hotels.com/Trivago/Travelocity etc charge a minimum of 7.5% fee for booking through their website. Travelcoin will offer the lowest fee of any other travel sites while offering a platform that incorporates all forms of travel and many improvements to today’s major travel sites.  First of all Expedia, Hotels.com and trivago are all the same company. One could argue that trivago is public - but Expedia owns a majority stake in it. The 7.5% fee is also somewhat pulled out of thin air. OTA fees typically reach from 10-25% and Trivago isn't even an OTA it's a CPC meta-search platform.   Travelcoin (TRV) is a blockchain protocol that is customized for the travel industry using smart contract technology. The Travelcoin protocol and its Decentralized Applications (DAPPs) targets key travel benefits and allows for instant bookings, spendable rewards points, from anywhere in the world at the lowest fees. The Travelcoin smart contracts ecosystem makes this possible by handling the sale (contract) of the ticket between the ticket holder and the traveler through the Travelcoin ecosystem. Travelcoin (TRV) tokens are required to run the Travelcoin ecosystem through the ether network as ‘fuel’. While initially you can use the TRV tokens as currency on the Ethereum network, however in the long run it is meant to keep the Travelcoin blockchain running.  ""by handling the sale (contract) of the ticket between the ticket holder and the traveler"" somewhat unclear whether it allows you to buy already issued tickets from ticker holders or actually source tickets from suppliers. The distribution ecosystem in travel is highly complex - would be interesting to hear what you do exactly, how you circumvent GDS, OTA, TAs, create a standard and have suppliers integrate into the platform.   Lowest Fee’s: Travelcoin will offer a 1% fee. That’s significantly lower than any other booking website!  A decentralized service which charges a booking fee? Why even use blockchain?   No double booking: Using Travelcoin’s smart contract system and the speed of the blockchain you’ll never have to worry about double booking again.  How?   Spendable Rewards Anytime: A rewards program with a set dollar figure involved for each point and spendable anytime is long overdue in the travel industry. That’s why Travelcoin will be implementing a rewards program to users that allows them to earn cash back with purchases.  How?   Reseller Services: Ever booked a trip and then tried to cancel? Not the easiest thing to do unless it’s for a medical emergency and they usually charge a hefty fee for a cancellation. At Travelcoin you’ll be able to sell previously booked vacations/tours/trips to another traveler.  How can I sell a hotel booking or airline ticket to another person as both of those bookings are in my name?   As for the rest, all numbers seem to be pulled out of thin air. No actual sources. ""In the News"" section of your website links to 3 random articles about blockchain which have absolutely nothing to do with you. The services you're looking to provide are absolutely impossible to integrate into today's travel distribution system. Although your whitepaper and site is very unclear about what you're actually looking to book - why do you charge a 1% fee booking? Isn't it meant to be decentralized and free?  Would be happy to read your answers and hear about some of your industry partners.

Travel is a major area in need of a proper blockchain application, but it's also highly political at the moment due to the duopolies which have formed around it over the years. They also seem to want to do everything, from paying for your bus ticket to space travel. Travel is a vast industry and bus ticketing infrastructure is vastly complex - check out the TfL - and moreover has nothing to do with hotel and flight bookings.

ICO NOW LIVE,"TravelCoin ICO – July 5th 2017 For a prettier look check out our website https://www.travelcoins.io/   Whether you’re commuting to work or travelling overseas for a vacation, travel is a part of most people’s everyday life. The industry alone for vacations is valued at over $1 trillion dollars a year (US) and the travel industry as a whole makes up for 10% of world spending at over $7.6 trillion. Travelcoin is the first of its kind specifically designed to connect the block chain and travel. If you’re an avid traveler, investor, trader, or speculator it’s tough to ignore the potential of the block chain in the travel industry.  Travelcoin dives into a worldwide travel industry for the everyday commute as well as the vacation get away. Say goodbye to paying hidden fees, double booking seats, points you can’t spend, and say hello to real time booking and the lowest fee’s in the market.  Major travel outlet sites like Expedia/hotels.com/Trivago/Travelocity etc charge a minimum of 7.5% fee for booking through their website. Travelcoin will offer the lowest fee of any other travel sites while offering a platform that incorporates all forms of travel and many improvements to today’s major travel sites.  We are in the biggest currency shift in human history and Travelcoin is going to be the biggest travel smart contract system in the world. Travelcoin smart tokens will be used in the travel industry and bring all travel ecosystems together with a public travel blockchain. The future will be space flights, air travel, drones and self-driving cars. To meet future demands Team Travelcoin has positioned itself to meet the future travel needs of humanity.  Travelcoin (TRV) is a blockchain protocol that is customized for the travel industry using smart contract technology. The Travelcoin protocol and its Decentralized Applications (DAPPs) targets key travel benefits and allows for instant bookings, spendable rewards points, from anywhere in the world at the lowest fees. The Travelcoin smart contracts ecosystem makes this possible by handling the sale (contract) of the ticket between the ticket holder and the traveler through the Travelcoin ecosystem. Travelcoin (TRV) tokens are required to run the Travelcoin ecosystem through the ether network as ‘fuel’. While initially you can use the TRV tokens as currency on the Ethereum network, however in the long run it is meant to keep the Travelcoin blockchain running.  When you buy Travelcoins (TRV) in the ICO crowd-sale (initial coin offering), you are capturing a piece of the Travelcoin protocol that will run the future Travelcoin DAPPs. 1 TRV can be divisible to 16 decimal places... therefore you are actually obtaining 1.000000000000000 TRV. To back our early supporters, Travelcoin will also sustain its momentum by charging a re seller fee of 0.000005 TRV to post a ticket on our platform... It might be a fraction of a penny but it allows ticket holders to have the best travel commerce platform in the world with virtually 24/7 uptime. As the Travel ecosystem grows, so will the value of your TRV tokens. You will be able to hold your TRV funds, exchange it with other ether based tokens instantly or use it in the Travelcoin ecosystem to make ticket purchases.  Through an experienced team, we are dedicated in ensuring that we constantly create value in the TRV travel hub thereby delivering value increase to the early TRV token and token holders.  Why should someone buy Travelcoin?  Travelcoin is a self-sufficient blockchain and fuels itself by the fee it generates on each transaction. This means over time the more transactions being done the more Travelcoin will be burned creating a shortage of coins which will increase the value of the coin. Travelcoin blockchain will be the future of travel transactions because, it is customized to handle travel ticketing systems as our DAPPs have customized fields to integrate with current travel systems where ticket holders and rewards programs can integrate on one platform and make travel commerce convenient for the end user.  As more vendors and more users come onto the Travelcoin platform, the more demand for the Travelcoin ecosystem will be and therefore raising the value of the coin itself.  Why is Travelcoin better than other Cryptocurrencies?  We have a huge industry to work with; we have a fantastic team with real contacts in the industry. With no other coin structured for the Travel industry, Travelcoin has captured the biggest industry in the cryptocurrency market. With our specific integration into developing the best coin to be used in the travel industry this will allow for adaptation into the real world markets to be as painless as possible and that’s a huge advantage Travelcoin can bring over any other coins in the world today.  Features of the Travelcoin   Lowest Fee’s: Travelcoin will offer a 1% fee. That’s significantly lower than any other booking website!  No double booking: Using Travelcoin’s smart contract system and the speed of the blockchain you’ll never have to worry about double booking again.  Spendable Rewards Anytime: A rewards program with a set dollar figure involved for each point and spendable anytime is long overdue in the travel industry. That’s why Travelcoin will be implementing a rewards program to users that allows them to earn cash back with purchases.  Trip Planner: With the integration of all major travel medians this will allow for Travelcoin to offer the best trip planner ever seen, with travel from point “A” to point “B” at the best rate.  Real Time Booking: Using Travelcoins smart contracts and the blockchain users will have bookings confirmed in real time.  Reseller Services: Ever booked a trip and then tried to cancel? Not the easiest thing to do unless it’s for a medical emergency and they usually charge a hefty fee for a cancellation. At Travelcoin you’ll be able to sell previously booked vacations/tours/trips to another traveler.  Integration with daily Travel: Travelcoin will offer solutions for the everyday traveler, bus, taxi, or just carpooling to be a few of the solutions offered.   Create your own travel destination for others: Travelcoin will allow users to create their own destinations for others whether it’s a cottage, beach house, or simply carpooling downtown. Travelcoin will offer many ways users can offer their services in exchange for Travelcoin.  Travel Trends   The travel sector makes up for 4% of total worldwide employment with over 120 million people working in the industry  $800 Billion is invested annually into the industry yearly  Travel sites make an average 7.5% commission per booking  The time share industry is valued at 130 billion and growing at 8% annually  The average person in North America stays 15.7 nights overnight a year spending on average 65$ a night (Over 300 Billion a year in the US alone)  -   7 times more than automotive manufacturing -   5 times more than the global chemicals industry -   4 times more than the global banking industry -   4 times more than global mining industry -   2 times more than the financial services industry  Growing up in a period of rapid technological as well as cultural change has shaped the youngest generation, the Millennials. The craving for exploring unique cultures as well as the desire for unique experience often drives Millennials’ travel. They desire authenticity, whether via utilizing public transportation or even through eating typical local cookeries.  Travel statistics reveal that 90% of the millennials book travel online, with 87% of these utilizing digital tools in order to compare options. Often, the millennials are highly influenced by their social networks, depending on recommendation as well as images posted by others to choose their destinations. Travel to global destinations provides them with exciting images to post on their feeds.  Providing transparent, self-serve booking experiences meet the millennials’ need for autonomy. Since this generation is extremely conversant with technology and relies a lot on the internet, Travelcoin can make travel easier for them in general. It can offer them the option to pay using digital currency, implying that they will not need to worry about currency conversion and exchange rates while traveling abroad. It can also give them the self-serve booking experience they desire since a lot of them own smartphones.   Additional Travelcoin Values  Overall, the Travel industry continues to grow by 4% annually and plays a major role in creating jobs and entrepreneurship opportunities globally. Countries gain important revenue as well as exposure to their culture and heritage.  Due to the different systems and the large size of the network, there exist some inefficiencies or pain points in the travel industry that require improvement in process and communication. This would ensure that things are made easier for the traveler or even businesses associated within this sector.  One of these pain problems is the currency conversion dilemma. By offering cryptocurrency, Travelcoin will ensure that travelers avoid the currency conversion charges. Another major benefit of this is that carrying a lot of cash will be needless, which is extremely convenient when travelers are traveling in foreign countries.  Travelcoin also makes travel easier by helping travelers avoid bank fees associated with withdrawing money from an ATM or even utilizing credit cards in foreign countries. Additionally, a big problem experienced by tourists is the unavailability of ATMs that support their cards. Travelcoin helps avoid this problem. When paying using debit cards or even credit cards, an individual is forced to share their information with merchants. At times, these merchants cannot be trusted with our banking information. There’s a high risk of such information being leaked either deliberately or unintentionally. This big security threat by itself should be enough to convince people to utilize our digital currency since it is relatively safer.   Areas of Integration  Here at Travelcoin we’re invested into creating a travel platform like no other, with integration of all major sites and travel medians combined onto one platform.  Travelcoin will invest heavily into end user compatibility and liquidity. We have great partners and are working with more big-name travel agency brands to participate in Travelcoin’s ecosystem and provide integration systems.  The dot-com era allowed for advancements of online ticket buying systems and allowed for more convenience and flexibility however these systems are silos and each has its own database. Travelcion will connect these siloed systems to a single world travelcoin smart contract cryptocurrency.  Travelcoin provides a digital currency that can be universally acceptable in all travel systems including buses, bike rentals, cars, taxis, rideshare services, plane, delivery, and space systems. Therefore, it makes it convenient to use one integrated public blockchain travel system and save companies and consumers money.

Having it uncapped will allow both to happen, allows bigger players to still acquire whatever share they choose but also allows everyone else to obtain one as well. 2 members of the team are very largely involved in the tourism industry, one marketing wise and one on the tech side.
