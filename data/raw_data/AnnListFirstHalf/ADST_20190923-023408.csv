If you want to go be in a project with hourly updates that sells itself post ico... and claims to be the 'no.1 coffee in america' go do that. But as stated this project will give updates when they have something to update on -- which will be every few weeks to a couple of months.. and those updates will be big. We have gone from a Token subjected to Gas hikes when Ethereum bottlenecks and it always does; to an entirely fresh chain with a coin in its own right; lower fees and no longer subjected to another coins value fluctuations and issues.  The token shat itself down to rank 533, because PEBCAC users don't know what a swap is and get scared at the idea they have to do something. Well rest assured you don't... because when people start selling adsTOKEN for 50% less than someone can get buying it all up and swapping to ads (coin)... then the market will make sure you can sell your adsT at anytime for a price relative to how weak other people's hands are on a constant basis, or how stupid people can be persistently. Which should get old pretty quick when people go back to seeing the intrinsic value of a use based coin/project...  In a market full of 'we will be global currency/the new bitcoin'... promises that defy logic? I mean how can there be more than one 'we will replace entire earths money' coins in the future if what they promise happens? And those coins are plethora and fill up 300 ranks above this project which has a real use and targeting an industry that owns more than half the world. Because it can turn whitepaper speak, into blahblah baby talk... consumers like you can understand with your patrick from spongebob ""I want to buy 2 thousand money with my 2 hundred money please thank you!"" then *angry face* ""why won't you give me 2 thousand money for my tears!!! this project sucks!!! math confuses meee!! GRRR"".  No they are not saying they don't care about investors, they are saying -- uh guys... we have built up quite a bit so far, and now we are working on the project. If you don't like the project... maybe invest in something else entirely and drop your heavy bags of shitcoins... or more sensibly... hedge yourself... by grabbing other use-based coins like Powr, Opus, Musiconomi... then have a second take when you realize all of those are riding on Ethereum and don't even have their own chain! But still on the dlow, still good grabs and holds.  The market will stop being speculative at some point... and then it will be all about the function of that coin. 90% don't have a function beyond speculation... be happy you're in the 10 percentile maybe idk. Or keep throwing a tantrum over nothing -- w/e works for you I guess.  If everyone thinks it is so easy to develop what needs to be developed and to form the client base that needs to be formed -- then brooch your obvious expertise to the team and see if you can get a job at Adshares. Then you'll be the one working for our profit (the ones who know/think/find all of that too hard -- thus are investors). And if you want to contribute absolute 0 to the project, OR the community -- why fill up the forum with cry-spam? When it is the antonym of paying you, to do so.  But my point here is: You're misrepresenting the community whilst knowingly pulling the value by being a troll.",False

Cheers!    I suspect that adshare will rise dramatically in 2018 and there is many reasons for my believes on this. The hype has always been very low on this token. People find out by themselves. When you take a look at how the volume has changed the last weeks from almost nothing to over 300.000 usd every day. This is huge! That the value of the token is rising together with a rise in volume, and this is a prove that the demand for Adshare is growing. More and more People has discoverd this Jewel. I think at one point the price of token will explode. In my opinion it has potencial to rise With several hundred procent in just a few days. It's an explosive token because it's so underestimated  I have no idea how the Mcap of Adshares will develop over time. However, there is no doubt that Adshare has a better and more flexible technology than the ""competitor"" AdEx (ADX) which has a Mcap of 178 mill usd, with a total supply of no more than 100 million tokens. I used to have a lot of AdEx but when Adshares apperard I spend time to compare. I started to sell a lot of AdEx and bought much ""cheaper"" Adshare. Today I have 80% in Adshare and only 20% in Adex. (I will soon change this to 90/10 With the time).  Adshares , on the other hand, has a Mcap today of ""only"" 18.7 million USD and a sirculation supply of less than 20 million tokens at the moment.  I dont know the total supply of tokens for Adshares, but I really hope it will be less than the tokens of AdEx. Could someone tell me how many Adshare tokens that will be the Maximum? Does anyone know? Mcap: 178 mill / 17.7 = 10.05 I and many other mean Adshare should have a higher Mcap than AdEx, due to a much better technology, so I think we can expect to come up to AdEx Level. Today there is a huge gap in the Mcap between them, and it doesen`t make any sence. I think some of you felt the strenght in Adshare and how ""explosive"" it can be. It just goes up and up. Today it brokes 1 usd barrier. 10 usd is a fair price for this token, but as I said earlier, this token has more advsances than AdEx and should have a higer Mcap. I think people will jump change AdEx for Adshare and this can make Adshare to one of top 10 best investment in 2018. I am heavely invested in Adshere and I have a long horisont for my investment. Maybe a fair token price of Adshare should be around 200 usd? Because of this I believe the ADST will Reach 10 - 12 usd in the new year or in the coming years. I am especially interesting to hear other opinions about this both from those of you that are agree but also disagree about my comparison between AdEx and Adshare, and my predictions. Or comparision of other tokens than AdEx. I would love to hear other opinions about this.",False

Don`t you think Adshare need to prove they deserve that? It would be amazing if we cut the amount of tokens to 20 million, or no more than we have today!

Right now Adshare has a Mcap of 40,2 mill usd (With a token price of 2.08). My Mcap predictions for Adshare is 9.5 usd/token. Yesterday we reached 1 usd.

On the other hand, if ADST tokens will trade on $5.50 we will select 1 ADST = 10 ADS rate, so 1 ADS will be valued at $0.55.

I have a few questions: 1) So if I hold for example 1% of the token supply I will recieve 1% of your total income from fees? The whitepaper does not clarify this as far as I can see. Would be nice if that was the case though! 2) According to coinmarketcap the token supply is around 13 million. That would imply a current ico price of about $0.13 if I have understood the ico mechanism correctly. But then why is the token trading at $0.37 on Cryptopia? 3) I recall reading that ADST tokens will later be converted to ADS tokens on the ESC chain. Will ADST token holders have to actively approve or make some kind of transfer in order to convert to ADS tokens, or will it be done automatically by a smart contract?  Overall, looks like a great project!",False

I'm glad you like our project! 1) This is generally correct, but transaction validators need funding, so it is not 100% of fees, but 84%. 16% goes to nodes involved in the transaction and the rest goes to coin holders. 2) ICO started when ETH was around $250. Prices are fixed in ETH, so you get almost 300% increase from just ether appreciation. Add 30% on top of it and you get prices from Cryptopia. 3) Smart contract can only operate within ethereum blockchain. ESC blockchain has different account system than ethereum so ADST token holders will need to make transaction in order to give information which ADS account is under their control. Only then balance will be converted.",False

Just look at the risk profile. If at this very moment everybody would decide to literally sell every single ADST token in circulation then what would be the average price received? About 0.0004 ETH =~ $0.15. Initial ICO price was $0.10.  Does any other token give you such liquidity and backing? Does other ico's give you implicit exposure to ETH price appreciation? Now look at other ICOs - if everyone would want to sell other ico's tokens at once price would crash to $0.,False

It can still grow or shrink. It grows if new coins are bought from contract. That causes price to rise. Ether gathered in contract is used to do buybacks. It someone sell to contract supply shrink and price fall (to the floor of 0.0004 ETH). All emitted tokens are circulating.

Since this doesnt seem to have been mentioned or adressed by Adshares.net at all, it occurs a little shady to me and creates a lack of trust in the practices the ""company"" pursues. Thus I deducted my ADST until clarification. I liked the way the ICO was rolled out, very serious afai can tell, and deducting the funds also worked fine.

Website owners pay up over 50% of the money they earn to adnetworks like FB and Google to find them ads to display. This project will make it go as low as 1%. 2. Normal ads are easily blocked by adblockers because they all come from same sources (domains), Adshares ads will come from the website itself so they will not be blocked easy. 4. Small websites owners can get paid very small amounts, they don't need to wait until they earn minimum 100$ for example. 4. This ICO has a buyback possibility, so you can sell anytime and get your money back if you think the project this not developing fast enough.
