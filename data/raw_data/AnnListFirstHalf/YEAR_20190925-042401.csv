And thats a pleasure to give an answer. Personal in a team very much depends on a business model. Business models are quite different even in one sphere of biotech. When people talk about biotech startup, we always imagine scientists and doctors. Because they are The Opinion makers. If business model is ""we discovered an injection which helps to stop caries"" - team leader must be an ideologist of vaccine and leading scientist and probably no one practicing doctors, right. If business model is ""client oriented high class clinic"" - team will be represented with few well know doctors and no one scientist... what for? ""A platform"" business model in any sphere of business is more about tech, analytic and marketing members, obviously. For example AMAZON's team doest consist of the best sales mans. Theirs key competence is user friendly interface (tech) and wide coverage (marketers). Telemedicine platform the same.  Obviously we can't do anything without doctors and scientists. Thats why your question is so good and relevant. We've got scientists and doctors support as advisers, please check our list, its updating with new well known persons all the time. They are pretty happy with the idea, of course they understand the importance for science firsthand and importance for the population. The idea of our platform is something in the air. But important to be done as a next step in biotech science.  So the answer is: we have 3 eager science analysts, who research pubmed backwards and forwards and other sources. (Two of them are also do trials on model animals.) That gives us an opportunity to be up to date and do triple check. They do an algorithm, test it and control. Also team of tech professionals, AI specialisation is very important to a project. Thats why we have experienced team members and leading AI experts in our advisory board. Marketers and project managers is a must-have set now in any business model. Have i answered your question?",False

That's sounds both funny and smart.  I had the same question as you do. But few geroprotectors already exist, they can prolong your life till 120 years, no more. They are known and pretty safe. Like aspirin, metformin, rapamicyn. The problem is they never was tested for life span reasons in clinic. Also each one prolongs life in particular conditions, it's not universal. They still need to be tested. I am testing now metformin but for myself only. It is very well known (30+ years) and has a very high safety level. So I am ready to participate in a clinical trial. The same as B12 vitamin for brain, special diet etc. It is safe.

It's not exactly that, at least it's not a license, it's an ethics committee approval, for instance. Also a Hospital. To mention some things. And we have those. The point is, you can initiate clinical trials, being a patients' organization. If there will be any blocks for that, we'll find the solution. But for the first trials, we're ready.  BTW, in Russia you can buy antiviral drugs in any Pharmacy without a prescription. So it's different in different countries.",False

One of the most pleasant things in life is good questions that make us think harder. Whats is the conversion rate? I wish in ten years its going to be 1:1. How is that possible: science and progress are now developing so rapidly that over the course of a year today we are getting results like 10 years earlier.  but let's count the current rate on an example. If you did a blood test (markers) and figure out that you have a 85% probability of stroke in 4 years (you must have 5 specific markers which are really bad). You do an additional examination, surgery and live another 15-20 years. How much did you pay for the analyzes and our interpretation in the Years? $150 analysis + 10$ interpretation. At the rate of pre ICO it is 208,000 Years which saved you 15 years of life. The rate of 1 year = 38 minutes of life. At the ICO rate you will receive 24.5 minutes.   if you are young enough and healthy then monitoring and using scientific achievements will prolong your life for a longer period. Therefore, the Year rate for years of life for you personally depends on the current level of old age.  Now ask me, please, how to move from this rate to 1Y = 1 Year of life!",False
