The way the WTT token works is that it provides fifty (50) years of hosting for a cryptocurrency miner, where each token represents one watt of power that the mining machine consumes. For example, if I wanted to host an Antminer S9 (the most popular Bitcoin mining machine), I would need 1,455 WTT tokens because that's how much power the machine uses (plus some extra buffer room for variance).

We are currently working on options to see if we can move the switchgear in once piece or if we will have to disassemble it before the move to the requested position.  We are also going to need to change the conduit that the current cabling are in from 6” to 3” and each line will need it’s own conduit, this change is to bring the substation into line with DCPUD safety requirements and it should make maintenance easier once the substation is up.

Since our plans have changed for the location of our switchgear we will have to move back and replace the concrete pad that it sits on as well as rewire it all and retest it.  That will entail removing all connections, pulling the switchgear apart, moving it and reassembling it in its new position.  Scheduling, preparing and finalizing our site for the coming weeks of changes and finishing up to get these last pieces resolved was paramount in our progress going forward. Looking ahead to next week we will begin digging a new trench for the switchgear, cut the concrete for the conduit to be ran and have most of the excavating and backfilling done.

In this meeting L&I expressed that they needed more time to create the regulations as they have not let a private company ever run and operate a substation over 600 Volts in the state of Washington.  The PUD said that they possibly would be willing to operate the substation as long as L&I would approve and sign off on it.

If you are referring to the S9s on Giga-Watts miner purchase site: https://www.gigawatt.sg/shop/bitcoin-miner/antminer-s9-14-0-th-s-psu-included-batch-7-june/  Then at current prices and difficulty it would take between 220 days and 226 days to ROI at Giga-Watt, assuming you do not have to rent WTT.  That's a relatively long time to ROI, and given that the difficulty usually goes up, and with the behavior of BTC prices lately, it's not really a good deal, unless you have a sizable investment in BTC miners already and need to keep it going.  Then if you add in the usual Giga-Watt delays, it gets even worse.  I purchased WTT in batch 1 and bought a L3+ for mid-September 2017 delivery. The miner arrived on time, but due to the delays at the Giga-Watt facility, it didn't come online until 22-December. It was more than 3 months late coming online. When I figured the ROI in September it looked like between 60 and 75 days (LTC price was moving around a bit and difficulty was climbing). That miner still has not reached ROI, and probably will not for a few more months, depending primarily on the price of LTC since network difficulty is rising.

The power consumption is 1275W.  First question, how many tokens do I need for 1,275W? If I remember correctly, I'd need just over 1,400 tokens, but I'm not positive on that so just curious.  Second, I see the same Antminer D3 Dash Miners on Amazon, brand new, for less than $500. Here's one example: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07573ZJ3D/ref=ox_sc_mini_detail?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=ATYD8270939LY  Is there any difference between the two?

It would seem to be a LOT cheaper than the current $1,800 price. I'm not criticizing Giga Watt because I'm probably wrong, and I realize selling miners is probably their main long-term business strategy, just curious why there's such a steep price difference.",False

Our expansion allows us to solidify our existing services and offer value service that remains unrivaled. If you have been following the news then you would agree, that securing cheap electric as a mining farm/company isn’t easy. This creates for higher demand for electricity in the mining world thus bringing further value to Giga-Watt facilities existing electrical service contracts. As we continue to expand so does our appreciation for our token holders. In order to share our success with our token holders, we are implementing new hosting tariffs with a 20% increase for Non-WTT miners, renting increase that passes on to WTT token holders. The breakdown of increases is as follows:  Up to 9 miners – 11.70 cents per Kw/h 10-49 miners – 10.80 cents per Kw/h 50-99 miners – 9.90 cents per Kw/h 100+ miners – 9 cents per Kw/h We hope that this step shows our dedication to our token holders and further identifies the value of using tokens for the duration of hosting your miners with us.

Starts today!,"   Uhhh, what you are referring to as a ""$150 miner"" is just the power supply. Not a miner. The power supply can be used for the Alpha Miner. The power supply can provide up to 1600 watts of power.  Currently available miners are: Antminer D3 Dash miner (for $1,800) Gigawatt Alpha 200 (GPU miner, $4,499)  For what it's worth, at current (1-March-2018/22:40 US East Coast time) network hash rates, difficulty, and exchange rates, the D3 earns ~$1.78/day assuming that you have sufficient WTT tokens to cover the power usage (1200 watts + 10% = 1320 WTT needed).  At current (1-March-2018/22:40 US East Coast time) network hash rates, difficulty, and exchange rates, the Alpha 200 which has 9 RX570 GPUs earns:  ETH: ~$16.96/day ZEC: ~$10.01/day ETC: ~$14.54 SC: dunno, can't find a decent profit calculator  assuming that you have sufficient WTT tokens to cover the power usage (1500 watts + 10% = 1650 WTT needed).  At today's rates (which are pretty much guaranteed to change for the worse), the D3 would take over 1,000 days (2.77 years) to ROI, and the Alpha 200 would take ~265 days (ETH), ~450 days (ZEC), ~309 days (ETC) to ROI. Assuming that ETH is still planning to switch from POW (Proof of Work) to POS (Proof of Stake), but because we don't know when, maybe 260 days is OK, or maybe not.

Starts today!,"I took this from the white paper:   Each   Giga Watt   Project Token (WTT) represents the right to   use the Giga Watt processing center's capacity, rent-free for 50 years, to accommodate 1 Watt's   worth of mining equipment power consumption. So to provision and use your mining equipment rent-free, you will need to purchase the number of tokens equal to your equipment's power consumption: Token owners can use this capacity   to accommodate their   own miners or to rent   it out to other users. Essentially, this   is access to professional mining – with an extraordinarily low   13 134834324.1 entrance threshold. In fact, it could be compared to membership in an elite private   mining club. Giga Watt's hosting fee typically consists of effective electricity cost, maintenance fee and rental fee. Token owners pay zero rent, which drastically reduces their ongoing   costs: their hosting fee is comprised only of effective electricity cost and maintenance fee.   -----------------  I have questions about this token explanation (above) in order to value the token properly.  1. How much more am I making per month with one miner plus having all the needed tokens compared to someone else who has the same miner at Giga-Watt but does not have any tokens?  If the difference in profit is significant over time, then the tokens have good value. If we can get a number cruncher on here to help out with the answer it would be appreciated. At what point in time do the tokens pay for themselves?  I hope not after fifty years.....  2. I thought the hosting fee would be eliminated if you have the token, but apparently I was wrong. Please comment on this also.  Thanks,  G.P.",False

Starts today!,"      I have the same questions. Before the ICO was over, a calculator on the GigaWatt website answered your first question very efficiently. I think all us would appreciate having access to that calculator again, or maybe someone can replicate it. An additional question related to this, I think, is what the calculator indicated in May/June/July of 2017 when the price of BTC was about a fifth of what it is now; I'm pretty sure the cost of electricity has not increased proportionately. It would be a good idea to just verify that the returns we're getting are in line with what the calculator showed, and that the 15% fee is what's being deducted from the right amount. The more our miners and tokens earn, they more the company earns. So it's hardwired for win/win. And I trust they calculated a high-enough fee to make business sense. If all goes well, and I'm very confident it will, the price of tokens will increase and GigaWatt and token owners will all do well. I hope we can crunch some numbers through a GigaWatt calculator again.  Second question... It was my understanding as well that if you had more tokens than the equivalent power consumption of the miners you host at GigaWatt, then the cost of hosting would be completely covered. I do have more tokens than miner-power-use, but I am being charged small fees for hosting. Would appreciate an answer about this if anybody out there knows.  A third concern for me is about the possibility of the miners we purchased months ago going obsolete before they're deployed, and whether or not they'll be able to keep up with the speeds of more recent machines once they finally are deployed.  Sorry I can't answer your questions. But maybe some people who can answer, will. ",False

This assumes WTT was at 1.70, and all crypto prices were calculated on 11-24-2017. But the math is still valid to show you a general idea of the benefits of buying WTT. Also, you are still being charged the discounted rate of $0.033 per kw/h while using WTT (instead of the standard ~$0.09 per kw/h) and this is factored into the monthly profit.

Generally, mining turnover is comprised of three components: (i) electricity cost; (ii) mining hosting cost; and (iii) mining net profits. Net profits on mining equipment, while costs are constant and predictable and consume the lion’s share of the potential profits.                         This infographic is an example based on the calculations from April 28, 2017. The numbers may vary significantly due to the rate fluctuations, mining difficulty increase, and other factors. Under the existing partnership arrangements between Giga Watt and its Partner, the Partner is offered access to Giga Watt's facility at an unprecedentedly low hosting rate, which significantly increases mining rewards. Now, through the tokenization process, this low hosting rate can be passed to all token holders.  Each Giga Watt Project Token (WTT) represents the right to use the Giga Watt processing center's capacity, rent-free for 50 years, to accommodate 1 Watt's worth of mining equipment power consumption. So to provision and use your mining equipment rent-free, you will need to purchase the number of tokens equal to your equipment's power consumption:    Token owners can use this capacity to accommodate their own miners or to rent it out to other users. Essentially, this is access to professional mining – with an extraordinarily low entrance threshold. In fact, it could be compared to membership in an elite private mining club.    Giga Watt's hosting fee typically consists of effective electricity cost, maintenance fee and rental fee. Token owners pay zero rent, which drastically reduces their ongoing costs: their hosting fee is comprised only of effective electricity cost and maintenance fee.      To be used, tokens should be deposited in the token holder’s account with Partner placed on Giga Watt’s website",False

WTT tokens are fairly stable in value, and the majority of miners are still not installed even though we were promised installation in September (and then Oct, then Nov, then Dec, then Jan, and now May). Picking some WTT up now and buying a rig for is much 'cheaper' now than doing so in July.  Eth was at about $200 when a lot of us bought in.

Concerning the B3 Pandas: some clients seem to have the September batch deployed already long time ago. So it's obvious that some Pandas were left over and in sum they were too few to fill up a whole pod. Because of different heights GW also may not put them next to S9 and L3. So when the big batches S9 and L3 came in, GW deployed them first. Then came the Neuromation deal and no free pods were over. So B3 Pandas were again postponed to the new facility Ephrata and now George. So we may see the September Pandas deployed togther with the December Alpha's hopefully now in George.

Then you got the oportunity of getting a very low price of elektricity, of course, if you will not sell tokens, and Giga watt got money for build the construction what will allow you to cheap mining. At this stage, every miner got his cheap tokens. constructions have been built and already exist. if you keep and never sell your token, you will save a lot of money on energy. however, if you will sell, then giga watt will earn more money.  you can ask: Why would the token be expensive?

I know this isn't paycoin or any scam near that level but I've seen enough to know that when something doens't look right it usually turns out to be a scam. They are selling miners for Jan and Feb Deployment but they haven't deployed older orders and won't be able to deploy those. Taking money from people and not being straight with them on the timeline for deployment is shady. On the other hand a scam wouldn't have delays, because it's a scam they would just pump and dump. So it's really not fair to call them a scam, however they aren't being upfront with customers so I do worry about financial problems. For now I'm taking their word for it, having dealt with UL in the past it's not a fast process to put it nicely, and I don't know Washington State but it took me 5 months to get a permit to build a deck on my house in PA lol. So it's not time to call it a scam but it is time for more transparency from Giga Watt. And people speculating on prices going to $100 are crazy, this isn't a pump and dump. It's the only utility token with an actual purpose and value but that value is capped. It's also real so even during selloffs WTT has real value behind it and it won't go down nearly as much and will payout more coins if renting and chase out miners with higher electricity costs lowering difficulty for those mining. So there's a limit to the upside but also to the downside of the price of WTT which makes it the only stable investment in cryptoland I know of, as long as they aren't having financial problems and blaming Underwriter Labs and local permits.

The January ones are even slightly cheaper than I paid for which was supposed to be deployed in October and they told me by March when I contacted them. They aren't a scam but, anyone else accepting money from customers promising delivery in January with no possible way to deliver it in that time frame, or delivering to them while earlier customers wait, would be a huge red flag to the point you really can't defend it. Problems and delays, okay shit happens, but stop selling miners with deployments in January and taking money from people if you know you can't deliver in January. And if they can why screw over earlier customers still waiting for deployment. This is such a promising project, and I understand delays, but I don't like seeing them accepting money from customers for miners promising a January deployment when I've been waiting since October. I was told end of December, now late Feb early March, for what was supposed to be October deployment. I can live with that not happily but shit happens.

Every day that passes, the rest value of the token diminishes a little bit more. It's opportunity costs you need to use for calculation.  Sure idiots might trade them but at some point, driving the price up.   30.000.000 watts(token=watt) are 1500 antminre (more or less)  they safe you 18.000.000m Dollars per year (30k k/W x 50Dollar x 12 month)  for hosting fees  (this is the max amount you can save from hosting)  over 50 years that makes  900.000.000 dollars worth.    That means the token Value is 30 Dollar BUT only if you use them for 50 years straight. AND considering that you do not profit from paying exactly the value you would need to pay for hosting (if you had no coins at all) you will see lower prices for token (getting less every year)   That's why I say 1000 bucks for a token is unlikely.  Besides, to get even a glimpse of the Real Lofe Value of the token, they would need to actually operate your miners    The reason the price is increasing is due to the fact that mining locations are not available everywhere and most people do not want S9 in their basement because they did not expect the heat or noise.

The customers who bought the coins in pre-sell  paid for the construction, this is the reason why  they got a cheap electricity as a gift. From the giga watt point of view, the token can be very expensive because it will make more customers without tokens and they will pay more for use of giga watt services.  When all the mainers will installed and they locate their tokens in the giga watt, there will be small amount coins in circulation and the demand will soon increase the price of the token. giga watt will become an easy tool for speculation because the number of coins in circulation will be very small  In my opinion it is last time for buy becouse around april/may  price will rise up  Btw I have question. On the coinmarketcap I see two exchanges available for giga watt tokens. EtherDelta and HitBTC. Why is so big difrent in price? on the first one 1.6$ and second one 3$ on both of them you can sell and buy WTT without a problem?  P.S. i hope it is clear becouse english is my third language",False

Starts today!,"            My miners started to hashing today - Batch 3 tokens with hardware delivery in September 2017. I can also confirm that miners have been using my tokens (They were rented out earlier).  I do understand that it is a bit frustrating to wait when BTC/ETH/LTC coin prices were shot up in the past two months and we couldn't ride the wave. However, I would like to point out one of earlier posts -  ""When virtual world meets real world these kinds of delays do happen"".  We are spoiled with the speed of getting many online items immediately and started to expect that the same from this project, but it took many years and huge effort to establish e-commerce businesses which we don't realize. So this kind of delay is not uncommon in terms of real-world work, please note that I am not defending giga-watt, just stating facts related to project scope and related risks.              For example, to build a mobile tower from purchasing or leasing land to make it operational requires clearance from 33 different govt departments(dealing with govt departments are always process oriented and time-consuming). So I believe giga-watt encountered an issue with one of the regulatory approval processes, hence the project has been delayed.               One more -  Dave is also coming from tech background stepping into the business world now(Software developer to CEO) and I believe he is learning tricks of the trade - Managing expectation.  Techie guys are not natural business people due to different personality types -  I hope he will manage that expectation area well next time.    So, please put this is an early adopter experience and move on. I hope that your miners and tokens will show up on your account soon!  Good luck to everyone!",False

As for ordering PSUs, well, I guess if you are ordering a dozen or so, yes, may you can. However if you need to order hundreds you don't go to amazon or newegg or your favorite online retailer. You go to a reliable and reputable manufacturer and order them. This being the USA that typically means China or Taiwan. Since Giga-Watt is just another customer to those guys, and probably not a particularly big customer, they had to wait for their order to be processed. Once they purchased the PSUs they had to get them shipped to the USA, that's usually in a container since air freight is prohibitively expensive for big and heavy items. And then let's not forget customs. That depends a lot on what is being shipped and how the customs agents feel that day.

Also remember that the PSUs are different depending on what miner was purchased. I would also imagine that Giga-Watt also purchased some additional PSUs to have on hand for repairs should any in use decide that they want to let out all their magic smoke and stop making the right voltages.",False

Still ZERO communication on what is causing this delays. In the meantime Dave Carlson has sent a bullish*t email praising the future of Giga-Watt, no mention of when people are actually going to get what they paid for...   The truth? As we are left in the dark by this conman, we can only guess.  Many theories have arrised because of their lack of communication and incompetent email support. Have tons of emails with lies as proof. The first theory, was always on the table, is that they were using our miners to earn crypto for themselves, this exaggerated theory would mean they are just plain criminals. I hope they are not.  Second theory, IMO very plausible: They are not getting the power they need from Washington State, and in worst case they have to pay more for power in the future (you know who will have to pay for that), or even get shut down on the long run. This shortage of power is causing the delays. Yes, Dave Carlson is so incompetent that he not only never managed to work out the issue with permits (PSU´s) before raising millions of dollars from investors, but he also totally miscalculated the importance of a healthy relationship not only with customers but also the government  Dark clouds hanging over Giga-Watt...

I'm guessing if other similar mining ICOs like Giga-Watt end up failing or if the USA is a favored mining location. Or if some new miners come out that are very profitable then a higher price of WTT could be afforded. Or if Giga-watt hosts GPU miners for decentrailzed computing which is ""suppose"" to be more profitible that mining in the future. Looks like they will be doing that already with PlayKey (an ICO for video-games). Miners will be hosted at Gigawatt for decentralized gaming GPU power.

I don't think the price of the tokens will go up that much because:  If you buy to tokens to rent: You should receive about $0.35 per year per token as a rental fee. Buying during the ICO when price was $1.00 - $1.20 gives you a nice steady passive income of around 35% annually. If you buy the token on the secondary market for $2.50 your going to make the same rental fee but now will have to wait twice as long to break even. I don't think the price will go up too much because of that reason. Same thing if your buying them to put your own miner on giga-watt. If the tokens are too expensive your not going to get your money back from mining.  For this type of project I don't think its a buy low sell high type deal. Its more of a buy low and put your mining equipment online or buy low are rent your token. Personally I'd love to see these tokens go down to 50 cents!!  The highest I think it could go is maybe $3 or $4. But I nobody knows.,False

An easier option is to buy LTC on a credit card through coinbase and pay with LTC. If you pay with a bank-wire do not do it online. I originally used B of A online wire transfer and didn't have a proper receipt for them. I had to wait about 10 days for the bank to mail me a copy. It was the first time sending a bank wire and I didn't enjoy the process. It took 2-3 weeks for them to verify they received the money. Of coarse the money left my account the same day! So I was left in Limbo for weeks stressing out. If you do a wire transfer go inside the bank and get a copy of the receipt. You should receive 2 or 3 pages.  Next time I'm sending LTC !

For example, I'm guessing that their timeline schedule that they have recently started has the dates listed on them.  I understand the dates to be the completion date.  They may be looking at the dates as when they start a task.  They seem to be a good company but with poor communication. Worst case, perhaps a little of their bonus tokens should be taken away for not doing a good job as in any standard company would do. I don't even know if it is possible.  Bottom line is that we are just investing in a new thing and risks are alway there. It would be nice to be able to help them somehow. -------------------------   Help them? Lol!!  Dear readers, I suggest you go read what is in their Telegram 'support ' group! Those are real customers describing their problems... Beware also in this forum I have noticed trolls supporting GW. Common messages "" they are good, they had bad luck, it is the fault of the US government 😂 Etc. "" I also have been discredited, but I will keep spreading the truth! None of these trolls brings answers to my questions or good arguments  Facts: 1. GW has not in the past or present given reliable dates for release of miners and tokens. Delays to 3 Months!! 2. D3 miner at gigawatt brings you revenue of 1$ a day since the last 3 days 3. this week GW deducted power costs of 2 weeks power ina few hours without warning. This was for mining cost because they had D3 running but they were not on the dashboard of owners 3. so they admit they were minimg for 2 weeks already... they paid the rewards to owners BUT didn't communicate they were mining. They could have spared D3 owners 2 weeks of stress 4. people with batch 1 s9 or L3+ miners are still NOT DEPLOYED. Gigawatt installed the D3 first although S9 were set to be deployed before d3 ( according to batch date) . Reason? Probably because D3 has 1200W and L3 800W so GIgawatt has better revenue, they can charge more for electricity/miner 5. they charge in crypto, they deduct from mining revenues (I would rather pay inUSD). so you could say, they are mining too and we paid for the miners which will be worthless soon ( D3 was over 3000$!)  So why help them? It is just a matter of time until someone takes action and kills this project.   Gigs-Fail is gonna get myspaced and they brought it on them selves. But their CEO is going to drive his Lambo home tonight [/quote]   Yep it has gone out of hand completely. To add insult to injury s9 and d3 miner dashboards don’t display actual hashrate and power consumption. It’s like a play dashboard to fool you. GW claims it’s the s9 and d3 miner software that’s faulty (some professionals they are), while it’s their faulty API. So D3 are dialed in static for 15gh and 1250+10% consumption. So much for having your own miners if basically your miners are turned on and off without your knowledge with statistic false stats....it’s like cloud mining. Support doesn’t even want to hear it, the answer is “do you want us to stop deploying to address this issue” and then the miners are blamed for being negative and complaining to the extent of support rep saying he doesn’t want to be here. Makes sense all they want to do is plug your miner in so they collect the wrong fee, they don’t care what the miner does.  So they don’t have time to address a huge issue of not delivering services and properly charging clients but Dave Carlson has time to show off demo pod to local news in Grand opening ceremony. It seems the closer GW gets to completing more pods the less they care for people who helped build those pods. It’s time the same local news gets info on the foundation of GW business.",False

Dear readers, I suggest you go read what is in their Telegram 'support ' group! Those are real customers describing their problems... Beware also in this forum I have noticed trolls supporting GW. Common messages "" they are good, they had bad luck, it is the fault of the US government 😂 Etc. "" I also have been discredited, but I will keep spreading the truth! None of these trolls brings answers to my questions or good arguments  Facts: 1. GW has not in the past or present given reliable dates for release of miners and tokens. Delays to 3 Months!! 2. D3 miner at gigawatt brings you revenue of 1$ a day since the last 3 days 3. this week GW deducted power costs of 2 weeks power ina few hours without warning. This was for mining cost because they had D3 running but they were not on the dashboard of owners 3. so they admit they were minimg for 2 weeks already... they paid the rewards to owners BUT didn't communicate they were mining. They could have spared D3 owners 2 weeks of stress 4. people with batch 1 s9 or L3+ miners are still NOT DEPLOYED. Gigawatt installed the D3 first although S9 were set to be deployed before d3 ( according to batch date) . Reason? Probably because D3 has 1200W and L3 800W so GIgawatt has better revenue, they can charge more for electricity/miner 5. they charge in crypto, they deduct from mining revenues (I would rather pay inUSD). so you could say, they are mining too and we paid for the miners which will be worthless soon ( D3 was over 3000$!)  So why help them? It is just a matter of time until someone takes action and kills this project.   Gigs-Fail is gonna get myspaced and they brought it on them selves. But their CEO is going to drive his Lambo home tonight",False

It's gotta be tough for a snowflake like you to get over never being quite sure if the tart taste in the tea you just ordered is actually lemon.   In the business world, people trying to do new things are taking risks, and risk means that there is a chance of failure. But what it means even more is that if successful, it can be wildly successful and wildly profitable. Investors know this.  In that business world financing comes from multiple places. When the entrepreneur uses up all of their money they go to the three ""F""s: Family, Friends, and Fools. Every investor in those three categories knows full well that their investment may disappear tomorrow, just like these crypto currencies we all so love. What they also do is go into these investments knowing what they are doing. If they have done their research and due diligence. They also do not risk their entire life savings. NEVER invest more than you can afford to lose on any investment. If you are betting the money you need to pay the bills this month on a high risk investment, or any investment for that matter, that's a problem, but not for me. That's your problem, and unless it directly affects me, well, I just can't be bothered.  I've invested what I can reasonably afford to lose in Giga-Watt. If it all goes to zero, well, that'll suck for me, but it won't be the end of the day for me, either. So far there have been delays, yes, but given the nature of the enterprise that Giga-Watt is setting up, they are not completely unexpected. I am earning a return now by renting my WTT tokens, and to date I have earned 5.26% on my investment (comprised of tokens and one miner that is yet to be installed). That would be 6.31%, but the price BTC has dropped significantly, which impacts the value of my earnings directly as token rental is paid in the coin the miner ""using"" the token mines. Token rental to BTC miners makes up the lion's share of my rental income. I am receiving hourly payouts in BTC, ETH, LTC, and DASH. There is the possibility to receive ZEC, but to date I have not been paid any ZEC.",False

The challenge here is that Giga-Watt doesn't seem to be updating the timeline on their website all that often. But maybe the dates have not changed because they are not being told that the dates have changed, i.e.: the inspections were due, but were delayed and not rescheduled; the paperwork for the occupancy permits was not delivered, etc.  The real world can be a funny place, and it works on it's own timeline which only occasionally lines up with your desired timeline.",False

In Giga-Watt's case local government inspectors needed more education/time, then certifying agency inspectors (UL) wanted different power supplies. In both cases Giga-Watt did what was necessary to keep moving.  The problem is that there are a lot of people that think that everything crypto moves at internet speed. Well, when crypto meets real world, things slow down. Kinda like when miner hardware companies promise to deliver your miners, but don't deliver for many, many months, if ever in some cases.  If your investment thesis demands that everything be perfectly on time, you will be disappointed. If you have a long(ish) time horizon, you can be patient.  Investor sentiment is for wankers and snowflakes. The wankers and snowflakes that get upset bail out and sell out, making it easier for more patient investors to pick up the investment at lower prices.

Miners implementation are delayed until March-April based on issues that could have been solved prior to token sale by having inspectors go over all the details. 4. Reselling miners for you for profit on their website(they take a cut of the sale).  No refunds on tokens. 5. Internal issues were not sorted out before starting and collecting 18m in a token sale.

Starts today!,"   IS GIGA WATT A SCAM? Kind of like MLM.... If you listen to just some people on here that haven’t kept a close eye on the project they will throw general terms at you like “construction delays” or blaming US authorities for laws, saying to contact devs and support. In reality there is a group of people, wtt token holders and non in telegram that follow this closely and believe me these people that ask about their miners and tokens aren’t FUDing, these people are the ones whose money is building these pods while they get screwed. If anyone would ask me if I recommend GW for mining hosting service I definitely wouldn’t and here are the same reasons people complain: The issue of overselling miners through GW site for exclusive GW hosting. GW continues to sell miners while there isn’t one token holder I’m aware of that is mining at GW. Support always avoids this question and never answers why would people pay premium on exclusive delivery and then be left with overpriced miner in hand seeking to mine/sell on own. It’s a simple x miners to y space and power and yet not a single GW employee has been able to confirm if number of miners sold through GW and their corresponding delivery would fit into pods. FYI GW doesn’t take any responsibility for this, they still take the profit of miner mark up and only help you with shipping if you choose to sell your miner from them (so it doesn’t collect Giga dust). the issue of timelines that make no sense. So the timelines on the site for pod builds aren’t realistic, they are more of a general timeline with deadlines extending 2-3 weeks easily (usually after displaying past due date for 3-4 days). So ok construction delays, inspection delays...but now pods 1-2 are done, but guess what? 1 week since notification of completion and nobody is mining, furthermore support stated 7-28 day range for deployment. Yes, 1+ month to deploy miners in a pod. Question of competence, priorities and real use of those pods comes up. so with next few pods under way of course people are interested who goes in those next...too bad you can’t get that info. Again from my first comment about hosting capacity this would be easy but it’s avoided with general answer of “basically we will deal with it when your miners get here”, in other words we will tell you it’s your problem in a month and you figure it out then. No proactive steps taken. We are given however the most complicated priority of deployment system (interesting enough nobody mining still); the system is ever changing from stating hardware purchase date to now wtt token holder and purchase date and then D3 go in first...oh and it will take 4 weeks. There is very little transparency and someone visiting GW recently only saw one pod and was told there isn’t enough time to see others...I’m not even mentioning “existing” buildings that were speculated to host some miners temporarily, no such option has ever been presented. So based on these events it seems that GW as a service to non WTT token holders right now is non-existent and those people basically gave extra funds for miner date delivery to GW for nothing, essentially fraud as none of those people are even aware of any delays or issues ahead. Wtt tokens have it slightly better as they lost money on their miner purchases but their wtt token will be worth something, if GW won’t be tarnished by this lack of service and competition rises. Is it a scam? No, but it’s a business model that put early investors and customers at a loss to pay for company mistakes while they still make a profit.",False

You are scamming people with mark up for miners that will Never be deployed on date promised. They paid money for service they never received and company didn’t offer them refunds. Most of those miners were sold 1000$ per price, what was that fee collected for? Free money? It almost seems like GW is the customer and token holders and people buying miners are the ones servicing them. at The end of the day delays, losses are written off as a learning experience without a single drop of remorse. The fact that miners are being sold for dec batch knownglugly shows that. If GW truly cares for customers they would focus on that, as opposed to focusing on sucking the most money out of people and shrugging shoulders along the way. They messed up bad but they know even if they lose every single customer now, the demand is there to have new ones. I only hope there is more competition out there now that will push them out as I don’t believe they deserve to be successful by being fraudulent while pretending everything is fine. Again wouldn’t recommend anyone to do business with this company unless you can get a written contract ensuring advertised deployment (with a reasonable delay if 2-3 weeks not 2-3 months) and corresponding financial compensation for non-delivery of contract agreement.... Funny thing is if GW would be run on blockchain, they would never be able to break all these smart contracts. As for escrow for token holders. Well cryptonomos deals with tokens while GW deals with company. So cryptonomos says we just issue tokens as we are told and we are holding them because pods aren’t ready, well ok since there are delays where is the escrow? Oh well that’s not cryptonomos person escrow...well ok then we are past deadlines of pods operating but you guys deployed first batches of tokens? Well Pods are functional...how are they functional if no one is mining? Well, we go by a certain definition of pod construction being complete....  This goes on daily while now I hear of a new project which cryptonomos is launching ICO for and guess who is one of the advisors? Dave Carlson, ceo of GW.

I purchase tokens back in June with the expectations that we would be mining but the token launch just stopped.  I'm anticipating that It will be 7 months of time before I can mine.  4 miners X 7 months = ? $.  I can understand that they had some troubles but we are losing lots of money while they are working on their project.  As I've said in the past, people that are losing should be compensated for the losses they are enduring. Why don't they release all of the tokens? Why can't people buy tokens on the open market and mine since they are part of the early batches?  Something sounds a bit fishy. Are they able to sell their tokens that they received from purchasers? I'm guessing that hardware is better purchased early so when the pods are ready they will be available. I still believe in the program or I would have sold my miners.  I just wish they would have been more forthright and making us lose so much money. I'm happy to see their progress charts/pies. Sorry for the rant     ",False

Maybe instead of waiting multiple week's, a batch 3 & 4 token buyer could also purchase the amount of needed tokens from etherdelta.com in order to mine.  Assuming: 1. the supply of tokens on the etherdelta must come from batch 1 & 2, because no other tokens seem to be issued 2. Pods for first & second batch holders are running (which they currently are not) 3. token holders can always mine (this is what GW said mutiple times)  The batch 3 & 4 token buyer would then double his spending on tokens but wouldn't need to wait so long. He should actually then be able to mine in the pods for the first and second batch token holders. And once the batch 3 & 4 tokens are issued he then can sell his excess tokens back to etherdelta.  I am a first batch token holder waiting to mine, so I do not know whether this works or not and I did not ask GW.  Maybe my thinking is flawed therefore any comments are appreciated.",False

This only applies to your hardware that has already arrived at the Giga Watt facility.  You can choose to sell your miner(s) with PSU on your own at verified online marketplaces such as www.ebay.com or www.amazon.com, or alternative classified sites such as www.craigslist.com, www.oodle.com or www.gumtree.com. You can also choose to have it sold on consignment for you at sites such as www.coinminer.com where they will facilitate the sale and pay the consignor a percentage of sold price.  If you choose to sell them direct to a customer, we will require you to provide your customer’s name, email, and ship-to address information. Please note that alternative classified sites do not have refund protection such as verified marketplace sites or consignment sales sites, and are to be used  at your own discretion. We will provide free domestic ground shipping, and a tracking number within 24 hours. Also please be aware that equipment prices do vary, you will want to do some market research to list your equipment at competitive pricing.  Thanks again for your patience and let us know if you have any further questions about your selling options.  They tell you to be cautious about the lack of refund protection of ""alternative classified sites"" but nothing about ebay and the people using your miner and sending it back within 10 days...",False

Starts today!,"For disclosure - I am a pre-sale token holder. As I said I have been mining with them for over a month now. Plus, I have received non-stop rental income from tokens which I am unable to use right now to pay for mining. I have been watching the token price go from as high as $20 to settle in around $2.50 currently based on swings in sentiment.  For the past month I have used Telegram to chat with other miners. I have been candid there and even pointed out many problems as GigaWatt started operations. I also posted screen shots of my earnings to the group to help satisfy the curiosity of those who have been delayed. I honestly think the token delay is a calculated way to make things fair for everyone due to the inspection approval delays. Yes, I am mining but I believe it is because I got my orders into Bitmain early and prepared GigaWatt for my delivery every step of the way. By mining now, Dave has allowed me to tell others about the opportunity which are ahead. I am one small mining individual so there is no need to be angry and think that everyone is able to mine except you. They did not have enough space to host all of my miners but I am at least mining at 3.3 cents per kWH! Which beats the price of my other hosting company by a large amount. My biggest gripe so far is how cautious Dave is with the hiring - though maybe it is hard to find people (cost-effective) in that particular out-of-the-way business location.  Hosting is not going to get cheaper unless crypto prices begin to dive which does not seem likely with Goldman Sachs talking about entering the market. People are a bit spoiled by the fast ROIs today. There will come a day when a 5-year ROI on crypto equipment is considered a great deal. Relative to future potential, prices are still cheap and the equipment returns are amazing even if it takes 6 months to mine 1 bitcoin.  When Dave is able to get permit approval for all of the GigaWatt pods you are going to see the flood gates open! Not only will demand for miners go up but you will see people pay top dollar for the tokens. Then you have a catalyst for the tokens when they hit the exchanges. There are many good things getting ready to happen at GigaWatt. While the problems perceived by many exist, the tokens will remain an absolute steal. Risk vs reward is much smaller now than it was a month or even a day ago.  Continued success to our Crypto community!  Regards",False

Starts today!,"I just received two mails from Giga Watt :     I guess that all customers who bought a miner that's not already mining received a e-mail like this with the status of their D3, L3+, S9...  And then comes the second one :     Now that you have received pertinent information regarding your miners, your WTT tokens, and your deployment timeline let's look at options available for moving forward. Internally, the Giga Watt team has been working around the clock, seven days a week, to come up with solutions that will give our customers the best outcomes given the circumstances. We feel that the following options all have their pros and cons, but all will provide a way to move forward.  Knowing your deployment timeline you should now have the information required to make the best decision for your situation.  We have three possible options for moving forward:  Option 1: Wait it Out   Understand and accept the situation for what it is and hold out until your miners are deployed. The risk with this option is that there are still contingent delays related to UL issues being finalized which keep the Pods from being powered up and mining.  However, with this option you have a probable timeline and an understanding of where your hardware sits in the deployment schedule. The downside of this option is that your hardware is sitting doing nothing while difficulty invariably increases while you wait.  Option 2: Ship Miners home or to another location   Have the miners shipped to your home or to another location you authorize us to send to. Giga Watt will cover the cost of all domestic US shipping, international shipping costs will be determined on an individual basis. If you have only a few miners, available space, and power at home, this is a good temporary option.  As we northerners like to say, “winter is coming” and the reality, good or bad, is that these things make great heaters. To use this option please email shipminer@giga-watt.com to set up your shipment.  Option 3: Sell Your Miners at a Premium   There is a good market for miners that are in hand and ship today and the retail price is often over what you paid. Although Giga Watt does not directly facilitate the sale of your hardware we can offer to ship your miners anywhere a buying customer is located. If you are interested in selling your miners to another party or through a third-party service please email sellminer@giga-watt.com; the sales team will get you started and suggest best practices and trusted sources.    We want to personally take this opportunity to offer our apologies for not meeting the originally proposed deployment schedule. All of us on the Giga Watt team really do feel a great desire to do whatever we can to assist you – we want to ensure we have the best relationship with our loyal customers.  The reality is we are all in this together, blazing trails and inevitably stepping on the hidden thorns along the way. There are no maps for where we’re going – this has not been done before. The combined experience of the team at Giga Watt should give you comfort in knowing that we can navigate these speed bumps and complete this project. You have the support of a company with the highest integrity and always strives to put its customers first. Giga Watt will continue to push to be the best we can and bring to market the awesome opportunity that we have all taken part in.  10 to 12 weeks is a long time for a miner to be doing nothing...

Aynway, next batch was supposed to be launched in September. OK, we have waited and waited. And guess what? Now we´ve got October 2017 and we have not seen a single nickel back from our investment (yes almost after half a year).

Starts today!,"Message recieved from  giga watt right now.. batch 3 in 2 weeks... excellent!  Giga Watt Greetings to the Giga Watt Community,  Giga Watt has continued to make steady progress on construction despite delaying factors out of our control. I want to thank those of you sending supportive messages and acknowledge the frustrations felt by some of you sending us not-so-supportive messages.  The process of building a Giga Pod involves a number of discrete steps, from initial site planning to final inspection. Many of these steps involve reviews, approvals and inspections by the local government agencies in charge of development, safety and standards. Some of these critical steps are taking longer than planned. They cannot be “pushed” or expedited in any way other than our persistent daily communication with agency heads and bureaucrats in charge of these processes. There is simply no accurate way to estimate a finishing date for the project, as delays are neither consistent nor predictable. When able, we aim to provide best estimate of time schedules, always subject to delays as encountered.  Giga Watt’s project represents a very large new step in scaling our emerging industry of Blockchain Computing. The scale and uniqueness of this project is unprecedented and alien to local authorities in rural counties of Washington state. As we advance this technological frontier, we must also comply with existing and antiquated regulatory standards until new standards can be developed. Giga Watt is working hard to define those new standards to pave a smoother path for future build outs.  We published a construction timeline at https://giga-watt.com/promo/timeline. Please refer to it if you want to follow along with progress.  Construction Schedule Update: Batch 3 & 4  We have completed the first Giga Pod associated with Batch 3. When this pod receives final electrical inspection approval, Giga Watt will issue the first 1.2M WTT tokens to Batch 3 holders. This should happen within two weeks.  We have just received the first of two building permits for our next six pod developments, which provides the rest of the power capacity to Batch 3 and most of the power for Batch 4 WTT holders. Permit in hand, We estimate the build time for this next phase to be 8-10 weeks.  What happened upon final L&I Inspection for Pod One?  After several visits to inspect the pod during construction, and on the morning of final approval for occupancy, Washington State Labor & Industries notified us of a requirement that the equipment we run inside the pod shall be UL Listed. To date, in over four years of building projects and running this very same equipment, this has never been required.  Underwriters Laboratories  Underwriters Laboratories (UL) is a nationally recognized, independent product safety certification organization. UL is also affiliated with the Underwriters' Laboratories of Canada (CUL). With public safety the heart of UL’s mission, UL acts as a safety resource and advocate. UL works closely with customers, regulators, insurers, retailers, consumers and others on research, technology, safety and education initiatives.  UL listing is oriented towards public and consumer safety standards for electronics. Obviously our GigaPods are not public spaces and only operated by trained personnel. Confoundingly, our inspectors still applied this standard.  What does the UL listing requirement mean to Giga Watt?  The blockchain processing units made by all manufacturers are not yet UL Listed. This is a market-maturity benchmark and we will see these manufacturers increase their product certifications over time. I have personally notified BitMain of this requirement and they assured me that they will begin the process immediately, though it takes months to complete.  This means Giga Watt has to find a replacement for all non UL power supplies, which include the power supplies our customers purchased with their mining units. That process has been underway since we were informed of this requirement, and I expect to have substitute power supplies in hand before we need them for the next pod. UL has also indicated that fans used on the mining units themselves may not be UL compatible. Giga Watt is assisting with document discovery related to those components as well, in order to either document or replace fans as needed to be compliant.  Additional inspection related items  A few additional final inspection related items “popped up” on these recent visits. We addressed and resolved these issues immediately upon being informed of the “new” requirements. There are no current outstanding inspection issues other than the UL Listed power supply and fan requirement.  Testing  Giga Watt is taking advantage of a short term opportunity to run some equipment under test. For a few weeks following final inspections, provided that there are no code violation or compliance issues, we will operate equipment under a Testing Period guideline.  Questions and concerns will still linger, so I continue to personally discuss the project on official Giga Watt support chat channels in order to answer questions. I do appreciate your continued patience and support.  Best Regards Dave Carlson, CEO Giga Watt, Inc.",False

I have transferred 1 wtt token to Gigawatt hosting wallet (get tokens+ and ETH wallet) but I don't see that 1 wtt token I have transferred. Is this the right way of doing this wtt token transfer? And also if I have transferred all 118 wtt tokens to Gigawatt am I allowed to rent tokens for all my miners until the Batch 4 release? I will have about 11 L3+ total by end of September. Gigawatt support told me I can't rent the tokens because currently I am not a token holder.

Starts today!,"   Giga Watt sent out the email below on 09/01/17.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Hello one and all.  First I want to thank everyone for the positivity we've been experiencing both via online channels as well as at the open house events! I've also received a TON of really supportive energy from the community and I can't thank you enough... it really keeps us all going when there's huge amounts of hard work to do.  Unfortunately, I have to announce a delay in construction which will block us from issuing Batch 3 tokens on time. We've been working tirelessly to bring pods out of the ground, but several conditions related to the construction and planning process have introduced additional delays that are now clearly keeping us from turning up as many pods as planned for Sept and October. The process of building the pods and deploying equipment is going as expected. The real time-impact has to do with permitting, planning and inspections. Our GigaPods were virtually the first purpose-built blockchain processing facilities these people had ever seen, and it has caused small delays at every turn.  The good news is that we are through most of that. We have educated the stakeholders in two counties about our GigaPod construction processes and how the finished product looks and works. I expect these types of delays to become less and less now that it has become familiar to them.  Our construction crews and electricians are getting pod construction down to a science. We will continue to run day and night crews to bring up as much power capacity as possible, as soon as possible.  On the topic of hardware arriving in September: there's significantly less equipment arriving in September than the amount of power we are building, so it becomes a little easier to see through to getting it all running. I expect to have much of the September hardware running soon after it comes in. Because the construction process is not a perfect science, its hard to know exactly when backed up gear will be put into service. To mitigate the situation, GW is seeking any and all alternative solutions to get gear running as soon as possible so that it won't just sit on the warehouse shelves. As a miner myself, I know just how important that is to our customers.  I'm sure that questions and concerns will still linger, so I am planning to make myself personally available on chat channels in order to answer questions whether to the group or to me personally. I do appreciate your continued patience and support. I want you to know that the whole GW team is directly focused on getting tokens issued and miners running as fast as humanly possible.  It’s always hard to maintain communications and transparency during the chaotic startup phase, but we are committed to improving on this front. We are improving our support to clients slower than we and everyone wanted but are progressing on that. Within the next 3 to 4 business days I will begin releasing weekly updates to help everyone track progress along the new timelines. I aim to improve confidence in Giga Watt and significantly reduce concerns you may have going forward.

You CAN'T withdrow from Hitbtc, because it's futures they are selling.   They will allow to withdraw only after WTT will start trading on exchanges, and there will be blockchain for it.  This won't happen till 2018 I assume.   Another thing is that you can't 100% trust hitbtc, because it has no transperent owners.  If they disappear some day, you will loose all tokens.  It's much safer to rent.  September 15: HitBTC still doesn't allow withdrawal of WTT tokens... No communication. No ETA. Nothing. At this point I recommend to not trust them.

I am going to copy and paste what was posted yesterday by davidellison for those who do not have access to Giga Watt slack channel. BTW, you must email Giga Watt support and ask for an invitation to be able to join their slack channel.   1.  The delays as you can see from the timeline have mainly come from the codes inspectors.  GW is pulling in enough power for a small town and so they are scrutinizing everything.  2.  The GW team has been working very hard to address their concerns even though they may be small or petty.   3.  The latest controversy is over the PSUs from Bitmain.  Their PSUs don't have any formal agency stamp of approval and as a result will not allow GW to use them.  The ironic part is that Megabigpower (Dave Carlson's preceding company) has been successfully using them for many months.  4.  So to address ""PSU gate"" (as it's being referred to), GW is going to use another power supply available to them to get the first mining rigs up and going.  5.  It appears that the first Pod (or two - not sure) have received approval to commence mining once the PSU issue is resolved.  6.  So, GW is looking to get the first mining rigs up and running by the middle of this week (Wednesday).  Thankfully the GW team is willing to substitute their PSUs (as many as they have available) to get things rolling.  7.  GW is working with Bitmain to return the uncertified PSUs for credit (over $1M credit) and then pursue finding an alternate PSU.  GW has experience with other PSUs and is well aware of which units are preferred from a reliability and efficiency standpoint.  The challenge now, I believe is to find these alternate PSU’s quickly and at a reasonable cost.  I’m probably leaving out some info but I believe I’ve covered the main points of what’s been communicated.  Also, don’t be surprised if my understanding isn’t 100% completely accurate.  Hope this helps….if you have any questions, I’ll attempt to answer as best I can.  8.  Oh yeah….the other challenge with using another PSU is the connectors.  Fortunately, GW has experience with making connectors to interface with the Bitmain miners.",False

Disclaimer: there is other mining farm like hashflare -- pool run buy Hashcoins - developers of mining and cryptographic hardware.   thus, I would assume that They definitely know heart of the matte better than home miners.  I have purchased WTT-token from ICO and they are currently trading at 1.8 USD on Ether-delta. https://etherdelta.github.io/#WTT-ETH I have bought  Miners directly through Giga-Watt.  Most of my friend do not count on Giga-Watt, because the location of faraway and out of sight. Many of my friends in Florida and Finland want to home mine. I can deal that noise with five seconds.  Especially after the knowledge that Giga-Watt guys use so cheap hydro electricity that even with the full hosting price  why the heck I should pay by home mining in Florida.  I have got the rationale , that people want control and keep things on sight. I am opposite. I do only home mine for short term pilot projects and once my small team has developed perhaps custom made mining rig (if we do not use ASIC) we transport the rigs somewhere elsewhere. I maximize time and convenient corrected return. Time and convenience are very valuable.   Thirdly, even though I would not use GIGA-WATT tokens, I could rent them out and get 50% annual rental income for 50 years . I reckoned the forthcoming cashflow by using third party calculator and I got Net present Value more than 5x current spot price (or more than 10x lowest ICO price) I used 4% inflation rate in my calculation and not compounding income to get conservative estimate.  https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/financial/present-value-cash-flows-calculator.php  I hope that I will get different opinion and comments of HIDDEN risks. My opinions are just mine. What are  the risk?  based on my rationale.  Discrepancy between the price of electricity will remain between Florida and Washington. People have to use and produce their electricity locally .  Also miners own their machinery so if mining turn to be obsolete there is possible to use other computer devices that use electricity. Calculation needs will be remain, if not for PoW but for Artificial intelligence.  the the end: Comparison I have found other mining projects (cloud mining) . the team raised funds one months ago and current market price is 60 (sixty times higher than ) ICO price. Such kind of spot price is overpriced. lol.",False

First I want to thank everyone for the positivity we've been experiencing both via online channels as well as at the open house events! I've also received a TON of really supportive energy from the community and I can't thank you enough... it really keeps us all going when there's huge amounts of hard work to do.  Unfortunately, I have to announce a delay in construction which will block us from issuing Batch 3 tokens on time. We've been working tirelessly to bring pods out of the ground, but several conditions related to the construction and planning process have introduced additional delays that are now clearly keeping us from turning up as many pods as planned for Sept and October. The process of building the pods and deploying equipment is going as expected. The real time-impact has to do with permitting, planning and inspections. Our GigaPods were virtually the first purpose-built blockchain processing facilities these people had ever seen, and it has caused small delays at every turn.  The good news is that we are through most of that. We have educated the stakeholders in two counties about our GigaPod construction processes and how the finished product looks and works. I expect these types of delays to become less and less now that it has become familiar to them.  Our construction crews and electricians are getting pod construction down to a science. We will continue to run day and night crews to bring up as much power capacity as possible, as soon as possible.  On the topic of hardware arriving in September: there's significantly less equipment arriving in September than the amount of power we are building, so it becomes a little easier to see through to getting it all running. I expect to have much of the September hardware running soon after it comes in. Because the construction process is not a perfect science, its hard to know exactly when backed up gear will be put into service. To mitigate the situation, GW is seeking any and all alternative solutions to get gear running as soon as possible so that it won't just sit on the warehouse shelves. As a miner myself, I know just how important that is to our customers.  I'm sure that questions and concerns will still linger, so I am planning to make myself personally available on chat channels in order to answer questions whether to the group or to me personally. I do appreciate your continued patience and support. I want you to know that the whole GW team is directly focused on getting tokens issued and miners running as fast as humanly possible.  It’s always hard to maintain communications and transparency during the chaotic startup phase, but we are committed to improving on this front. We are improving our support to clients slower than we and everyone wanted but are progressing on that. Within the next 3 to 4 business days I will begin releasing weekly updates to help everyone track progress along the new timelines. I aim to improve confidence in Giga Watt and significantly reduce concerns you may have going forward.  Best Regards Dave Carlson, CEO Giga Watt, Inc.""",False

Even if you decide Giga Watt not for you I'd suggest avoiding cloud mining, most are ponzi scams no mining rest are just gonna lose you money. And if you go through forum do search for cloud mining you'll see vast majority turned into scams or were scams from the start. I hate even mentioning the name but Genesis mining is legit, but they won't sell you mining contracts at prices that you will profit from unless the coin goes up. You'll see a lot of ads and shit on youtube pushing them because they pay high affiliate commissions which is a red flag they are a scam, but I do believe they actually have the hash power they sell. However they won't sell it to you at profitable prices, they can make more mining for themselves, so unless you willing to pay more than it's worth so they can lock in their profits and hope the coin goes up in value then it's a dumb investment. You'd be better off buying GPU or ASIC miners and mining at home than using cloud miners, at least you can sell your miners when you're done unlike a contract which just ends. And yes Giga Watt is your best bet I just didn't want to come off like a shill, and seriously don't want see anymore people scammed by ponzi cloud miners or waste money on the one or two legit ones that just prey on ignorant newbies and slick advertising campaigns to make you think you'll get rich. Giga Watt just a hosting company, you can get your miner shipped back to you, it's your property. I guess startup costs are higher than cloud mining, in which case you should wait till WTT are sold on the open market and start investing that way and use profits to buy miners. You at least turn a profit even if you have to wait a few months for the tokens to be available. If you insist on cloud mining do your homework, if it sounds too good to be true it is, nobody is going to setup mining operation and sell you contracts make you rich they'd just keep it for themselves.",False

Starts today!,"   ""virtual currency is not the legal tender of any particular country"" - says Professor of Law at Louisiana State University: https://www.bna.com/taxation-virtual-currency-n73014449855/  Here are a few paragraphs from IRS  FAQs:  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS Q-1: How is virtual currency treated for federal tax purposes? A-1: For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.  Q-2. Is virtual currency treated as currency for purposes of determining whether a transaction results in foreign currency gain or loss under U.S. federal tax laws? A-2: No. Under currently applicable law, virtual currency is not treated as currency that could generate foreign currency gain or loss for U.S. federal tax purposes.  Q-6: Does a taxpayer have gain or loss upon an exchange of virtual currency for other property? A-6: Yes. If the fair market value of property received in exchange for virtual currency exceeds the taxpayer’s adjusted basis of the virtual currency, the taxpayer has taxable gain. The taxpayer has a loss if the fair market value of the property received is less than the adjusted basis of the virtual currency.  Q-7: What type of gain or loss does a taxpayer realize on the sale or exchange of virtual currency? A-7: The character of the gain or loss generally depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. A taxpayer generally realizes capital gain or loss on the sale or exchange of virtual currency that is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. For example, stocks, bonds, and other investment property are generally capital assets. A taxpayer generally realizes ordinary gain or loss on the sale or exchange of virtual currency that is not a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. Inventory and other property held mainly for sale to customers in a trade or business are examples of property that is not a capital asset.  Q-8: Does a taxpayer who “mines” virtual currency (for example, uses computer resources to validate Bitcoin transactions and maintain the public Bitcoin transaction ledger) realize gross income upon receipt of the virtual currency resulting from those activities? A-8: Yes, when a taxpayer successfully “mines” virtual currency, the fair market value of the virtual currency as of the date of receipt is includible in gross income.  Q-9: Is an individual who “mines” virtual currency as a trade or business subject to self-employment tax on the income derived from those activities? A-9: If a taxpayer’s “mining” of virtual currency constitutes a trade or business, and the “mining” activity is not undertaken by the taxpayer as an employee, the net earnings from self-employment (generally, gross income derived from carrying on a trade or business less allowable deductions) resulting from those activities constitute selfemployment income and are subject to the self-employment tax.  https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf",False

I am a tax lawyer; not in America but thats why I contacted and hired advisors from one of the big four.  So I kinda know what I am talking about and can more easily see where potential problems might occur.   However, I am kinda sick and tired and will not reply after this post.  No-one here is reading the white paper where Giga states they will exchange informations with the IRS and that every customer is responsible for his tax and legal setup. It makes it just hard to know what to look for when GIGA can't even outline what their model is...   By operating the miners, setting the pools, doing maintenance and being able to take out the daily maintenance fee, does that leave little room to argue that you are the operator from those miners.    So you are basically giving them a credit, they buy stuff with it and pay you. This could already be seen as a dividend and therefore would fall under a completely different business model than operating your own ""farm"".    The most worrying part is that they are paying out money for token holder. They don't know who that token holder is, yet they pay again basically dividends to them.   I payed my money, I had hours of conversation with my colleagues in america and multiple other countries to find the right place and this project here is just way to risky.  I am not saying they will scam anyone, but if they don't watch out they can be held accountable for the actions of their customers. And if they get fined, they might have to close and everyone who invested or conducted business looses.

Can GigaWatt officialy clear out this issue for all forner miners.  Thanks       Well yeah based on current tax law, it would be considered a permanent place of production and therefore you already fall under US tax law.  Genesis does not operate your personal miner. They sell you their personal hash. They are paying taxes on their income and they deduct your payments as dividend payments in their system.  Again, if Giga would say you can rent a miner it would be less of a problem. Still you would need to pay tax on your income  Regarding double taxation, you need to contact a tax advisor in your country and ask him for double taxation agreements between your country and the USA. Most big industrial states got these kinds of agreements to prevent double taxation.   This will give you a good pointer. Next step would be to contact a tax firm in the USA, I can give you some contacts from PWC or E&Y if you need. They can check everything on the american tax side.    Maybe you are lucky and in your case its not a big problem, but for me personally it would, I have more than 500 miners in total in our company structure right now.         For everyone else:   Please keep in mind, that every business is going to be audited. Maybe not this year nor next year, but in 5 years maybe. And if they find out who you are and that you mined with the intention of profit (and we all do that) they will check if you are registered or declared the gains in your tax. If you did not its called tax evasion and you might face painful penalties.      And for everyone doubting what I say, contact giga and ask them about miner setup and control, contact lawyers and tax advisors.

Starts today!,"     Ok just for the fun.   1)    If they know you were mining. e.x. they know its your miner (your american) they will google how much the hash rate is, look up the info since when the miner is active and they can simply calculate it. The IRS person who is responsible for your account is getting paid to do exactly that.  Second they can just ask GIGA since they manage your miner and will have (or should have) every payment of every miner.  And believing that you can hide your crypto is naive since we see Silk Road vendors getting busted because of money trails years after the takedown....  2)  Crypto is considered legal tender in multiple countries. If you blindly spread informations stating its not considered money, people without knowledge will read that and get tanked....  So please try to at least structure it in a way ppl see you are talking about america.  3)  It is considered profit when you exchange it. This might be the case in america right now, won't stay like this a lot longer.  The simple fact that you can buy with BTC is enough to say the newly generated coins are equal to legal tender that can be used to buy products and services in RL   After that argumentation you would not need to pay any taxes on anything you earn as long as you are payed in BTC.  You are selling/renting hashing power to the network and get payed for it. Your input is electricity. Output BTC.   Thats profit.   4)  Your gold example is basically right. You need to pay taxes on increase of value.  You might have a rule in america like we have, that every gain is tax free as long as between buy and sell is 1 year or more.   And this goes for gold only since it is considered a capital asset.  I don't know that, but as long as it would be under 1 year yes you need to pay taxes on it.  When you buy a painting and it increases in value you got to pay tax on the sale also.  This is not a capital asset, therefore it would be normal sales tax.   Regarding your game token, they will not come after you for 10 bucks. We are talking about more than 10 bucks here.  People will be able to pull thousands of dollars out of their miners. And yes if they can collect tax, they will.     If you are not residing inside the US, they might put you on a list to pull you out of immigration check on your next holiday.  But that is not my concern. Its that GIGA gets fined because they don't make sure they are safe and in the end go belly up and everyone looses their shit.    BTC-e had good people trading their and now look what happened. Money gone, Site gone   the IRS and FBI are partying hard and don't give a shit that thousands of people lost money.

Starts today!,"TL;DR:  WTT good.  Save money.  My estimate: $2 to $2.50 each when listed on exchanges.      It isn't like they minted 30,000,000 physical WTT tokens, put them in a warehouse, then tried to sell them.  The tokens are electronic assets created on demand as they're purchased.  The offering constraints were 1) A maximum number of WTT to be sold and 2) A deadline after which WTT would no longer be sold.  They weren't required to sell a certain number of WTT; rather, the number of WTT sold determines how much hosting capacity they'll build and the timing and degree to which their post-buildout plans can be executed.  Think of it this way: Would you be disappointed if you wrote an Apple and Android app and sold only 22,000,000 copies rather than 30,000,000?  Would your company fold for the lack of an additional 8,000,000 units sold, units with an infinitesimal marginal cost of production?  Of course not.  It may limit how many more people you can hire to write and market your next great app, but it wouldn't be a failure.    In hindsight it was good not to invest as there is way more supply than demand for now  Supply of what?  No physical WTT tokens were created, the only supply constraint was the self-imposed 30,000,000 unit limit.  The supply of WTT exactly matches the demand; that's what happens with non-physical assets with a near-zero marginal cost of production.  What is the supply of the theoretical app mentioned above?  You don't have any physical inventory, copies are sold as they're paid for, and the quantity supplied exactly matches the quantity demanded.  If I was going to be critical of anything with the WTT offering I would say they could have done a better job promoting it to a wider audience and explaining the benefits.  I think they did a great job selling a new concept in a relatively young market with so much hype, fraud, and uncertainty.  In other words, they didn't generate enough demand, but for a project spanning continents, and with dozens of people from half a dozen companies working on it, I think the offering was quite successful.  There were a lot of things that happened during the offering that were beyond their control, like BIP 91, Bitcoin Cash, SEC DAO announcement, multiple wallet and ICO hacks, AlphaBay shutdown, and much more.  So, hair-on-fire earthquake alien invasion moon exploding tightrope chainsaw juggling with Satan's ex-wife complaining about her 2/3 caff double ristretto affogato venti mango 2% protein double blended with whip caramel drizzle salted caramel topping vanilla bean frappuccino.    not sure why anybody would pay 1.20 USD/WTT under these circumstances.  WTT owners will save between $350 and $537 per kWh per year depending on the size of their operation, assuming 95% uptime for their mining rigs.  One kWH requires 1,000 WTT, or $1,200 at $1.20 per WTT.  Savings exceed WTT cost after 2.23 to 3.43 years under these assumptions.  I'm not sure why a miner wouldn't pay $1.20 per WTT under these circumstances.  Assuming a 4% discount rate, a miner planning for a five-year WTT useful life would pay between $1.56 and $2.39 per WTT, or $2.84 to $4.36 with a ten-year useful life.  WTT give miners the right to access extremely inexpensive electricity and managed hosting for 50 years, so the longer you think mining will be economical, the higher the WTT net present value.    They will dump the remaining WTT soon as facilities will be in operation in November.  No one from Giga Watt or Cryptonomos has said as much.  They've been consistent in their messaging on the topic: No more WTT will be issued.  Again, WTT not stockpiled in a warehouse, purely digital asset, created only when purchased, and offering ended 31 July 2017.  Granted, there is nothing preventing them from doing another token offering, but I don't think they would do so until they've built out enough hosting capacity to accommodate all WTT holders and ran the operation at capacity for at least six months.  They need to spend $20+ million, build 22 MW of hosting capacity, get thousands of mining rigs set up, operationalize their hosting, billing, mining pool, customer service, and equipment repair processes, and complete a thousand other tasks major and minor, none of which can be overlooked without negatively impacting their customers and reputation.  I doubt new tokens would go for less than $1.20 if they were offered again.  Closer to $2.50.  And $2 to $2.50 once they're listed on exchanges.",False

Starts today!,"I've just learned about Giga Watt in the last few days, and I'm very interested, but I have a few questions!  Have been looking things over here, but I'm still unsure of a few things.  I understand that by purchasing WTT Tokens now, I can host miners at Giga Watt ""rent free"" for 50 years.  I understand if I want to actually MINE, I would need WTT Tokens AND Miners.  I understand that miners are incredibly hard to come by right now whether purchasing directly from Giga Watt or elsewhere.  I understand that if I purchase WTT Tokens, but cannot get any miners of my own, I can ""rent"" out my WTT Tokens to people with miners, but no tokens.  I hope ""my understanding"" is correct on all the above points.  My DESIRE would be to purchase 1,760 WTT Tokens, (2) Antminer L3+ miners, and host them ""rent free"" at Giga Watt and mine Litecoin for the next 50 years. I presume this would be a very optimal setup, is that correct?  THE PROBLEM is finding and purchasing (2) Antminer L3+ miners.  Questions:  If I purchase 1,760 WTT Tokens in the ICO, can I ""rent"" them out UNTIL I can secure (2) Antminer L3+ miners? (I'm really NOT INTERESTED in merely renting out my WTT Tokens as I don't like the ROI time by renting only.  I am also concerned with some of the things I've read here about having any demand from miners to even rent WTT tokens!  If that were the case, I'd be sitting with 1,760 WTT Tokens that only have speculative value.)  Speaking of speculative value, it appears that WTT Tokens WILL appear on crypto exchanges - IS THAT CORRECT?  If so, has it been announced which crypto exchanges WTT Tokens will appear on?  If someone has miners, but no WTT Tokens, I see that they could either rent WTT Tokens or wait to purchase their own WTT Tokens when they appear on an exchange - IS THAT CORRECT?  Is there any commitments required when renting in regards to length of time/duration?  If I'm renting WTT Tokens, I may at some point acquire miners, and not want to rent my WTT Tokens out anymore - am I locked into a time commitment?

Starts today!,"   There is the charge for electricity and maintenance, as a holder of WTT tokens you are guaranteed space in the facility for your miners.    THE PROBLEM is finding and purchasing (2) Antminer L3+ miners.  They are indeed in demand. Keep an eye on the Giga Watt web to see when they become available. Also, send an email to Giga Watt sales/support and tell them that you want two L3+ miners. Before you do that, at least buy the WTT tokens and make sure that you have enough to pay for the miners.  When I ordered my L3+ a while back I had purchased WTT tokens (hopefully in batch 1), and had bitcoin ready to pay for the miner. I understand that things have changed since then. Giga Watt can tell you the new requirements if you contact them.    Questions: Speaking of speculative value, it appears that WTT Tokens WILL appear on crypto exchanges - IS THAT CORRECT?  That's what has been communicated.   If so, has it been announced which crypto exchanges WTT Tokens will appear on?  No. That will come sometime after the ICO has completed. I seem to recall seeing an estimated date earlier in this thread.   Ideally, it would appear my best bet would be to wait until I can secure a couple of Antminer L3+ miners, and at that time hope I can pick up some WTT Tokens off an exchange, or just pay rent to a WTT Token Holder to host my miners - IS THAT CORRECT?  WHY would I purchase 1,760 WTT Tokens in advance if I DON'T have any miners yet, and I'm NOT interested in renting out WTT Tokens (because I don't like the ROI time)?  If you know you want to have Giga Watt host your miners, buy the WTT now during the ICO. Worst case is that you hold the WTT until you can order miners from Giga Watt or somehow secure your own miners that you can then send to Giga Watt.   Is there any speculation of whether WTT Tokens will go up/down once they get listed on a crypto exchange?  If the speculation is that they would hold value or even go UP in value, then purchasing 1,760 WTT Tokens during the ICO would make sense.  If the speculation is that they will go DOWN in value once they list on an exchange, it would make most sense to WAIT and just acquire WTT Tokens at a lower price from an exchange when I can acquire a couple Antminer L3+ miners.  Well, it is speculation. Prices could move higher or lower, depending on demand and supply of WTT on the exchange(s). If you buy in now you know the price you will be paying. If you wait until they are trading on an exchange, your guess is as good as anyone's as to what price you will pay at that time.  The value proposition for me, personally, is the availability of inexpensive electricity. Giga Watt's electricity plus maintenance cost is roughly 33% of what I pay now for electricity, and that doesn't include my cooling costs.    Will Giga Watt allow me to host my miners rent free with them if I purchase my WTT Tokens at a later date from an exchange versus buying them now during the ICO?  Try reading older messages in this thread. I believe that this question was already answered. You could also contact Giga Watt directly and ask.",False

But I thought you had good questions and I wanted to provide the answers for you.     Yes, it is.   I presume this would be a very optimal setup, is that correct? ""very"" is a relative term. It might be more optimal to have 20 L3's and 18000 token. Who knows? But two L3's with 1760 tokens will work great.   THE PROBLEM is finding and purchasing (2) Antminer L3+ miners. I pre ordered a couple of them a few months ago, and recently sold them on ebay. There are more available on ebay, but for a serious premium.   If I purchase 1,760 WTT Tokens in the ICO, can I ""rent"" them out UNTIL I can secure (2) Antminer L3+ miners? Yes.   Speaking of speculative value, it appears that WTT Tokens WILL appear on crypto exchanges - IS THAT CORRECT? This is what we have been told, but detail have been scarce.   If so, has it been announced which crypto exchanges WTT Tokens will appear on? Not that I know of.   If someone has miners, but no WTT Tokens, I see that they could either rent WTT Tokens or wait to purchase their own WTT Tokens when they appear on an exchange - IS THAT CORRECT? This is my understanding.   Is there any commitments required when renting in regards to length of time/duration?  If I'm renting WTT Tokens, I may at some point acquire miners, and not want to rent my WTT Tokens out anymore - am I locked into a time commitment? For those that start out with miners, and renting WTT Tokens, what if they want to later purchase WTT Tokens off an exchange, are they in a time commitment with their initial rental agreement of WTT Tokens? I have not seen this be clarified.   Is it true you need to be a WTT TOKEN HOLDER to even purchase miners directly from Giga Watt? Yes. (This did not used to be the case, but it is now.)   Ideally, it would appear my best bet would be to wait until I can secure a couple of Antminer L3+ miners, and at that time hope I can pick up some WTT Tokens off an exchange, or just pay rent to a WTT Token Holder to host my miners - IS THAT CORRECT? That is a matter of opinion and psychic powers. It depends how much you are able to buy the token for on the exchanges and their availability. And it assumes that renting out the tokens is a bad thing to do in the interim.   WHY would I purchase 1,760 WTT Tokens in advance if I DON'T have any miners yet, and I'm NOT interested in renting out WTT Tokens (because I don't like the ROI time)? Maybe you think the ICO price is a good (low) price. Or maybe you're concerned about available supply on the open market post ico.   Is there any speculation of whether WTT Tokens will go up/down once they get listed on a crypto exchange? We're all speculating, to some extent. But I have not seen any super thorough analysis form anyone.   If the speculation is that they would hold value or even go UP in value, then purchasing 1,760 WTT Tokens during the ICO would make sense.  If the speculation is that they will go DOWN in value once they list on an exchange, it would make most sense to WAIT and just acquire WTT Tokens at a lower price from an exchange when I can acquire a couple Antminer L3+ miners. Answering your own questions now   Will Giga Watt allow me to host my miners rent free with them if I purchase my WTT Tokens at a later date from an exchange versus buying them now during the ICO?

Giga Watt and Cryptonomos didn't push any crazy hype, or at least what I saw wasn't crazy hype. They promoted what it was that they have for sale, and that's access to a managed hosting site with cheap hydro-power and an experienced team.  The WTT tokens I bought and the L3+ miner I ordered are a small percentage of my overall portfolio, and something that if it goes to zero, will not radically impact me. I'll not be thrilled if the investment does go to zero, of course, but this is a rational way to build on a new type of asset class (crypto currencies) that seems to have significant upside. In the short term we'll have to put up with the huge volatility, but that's life on the edge.  In fact the output of the L3+ will be used to buy more mining HW until I have purchased enough to consume all the WTT I have without having to rent WTT. At that point I will use the output of the miner to buy WTT, assuming I can buy more WTT, until such time as I have enough WTT for the next chunk of mining hardware. Once I have enough WTT for the next miner the output of the miners will be pooled to buy the next miner.

Starts today!,"   Welcome to the wonderful world of crypto-currency mining. I think you are probably correct in your assessment of the increase in difficulty.  Just think, when your three miners arrive you will be contributing to the difficulty rise.   I see rising difficulty as necessary, in that if the difficulty to mine a coin is not rising, then the coin is not likely in demand, and likely not especially valuable to the broader market. Look at Bitcoin and Ethereum as two examples. Their difficulty is shooting to the moon as is their coin's value. The demand for the coins and their increasing value is driving more miners (HW and people like us) to mine them. As more miners are entering the game they are driving up the difficulty which is necessary to keep the block generation rate within the desired range.  As long as the coin's value rises at or above the same rate as the difficulty to mine the coin rises, then mining is profitable and the equipment purchased to mine eventually will return that investment (ROI). If you want ROI in a very short time, then you have to take a big risk as a very early adopter (like the April buyers of the L3+) on an untested device. Buying in now has a far reduced risk, but at the cost of a longer time to ROI. You also have to buy a sufficiently powerful miner. For example, my Gekko Science Compac USB stick miner will never achieve ROI, unless it finds a block, which is why I have it pointed at ck's solo pool. My S7LN with sidehack's power mod has returned my investment because the amount of Bitcoin it has found when converted to fiat is more than what I paid for it in fiat, but it has taken about a year.",False

Don't forget that the price quoted on the Giga Watt site includes the miner, the power supply and power cord, shipping, and import duties/fees. I would also expect that there is some profit built-in to the price since Giga Watt is not doing this because they are nice, i.e.: working for free.   4. A time horizon of 50 years? Come on guys, who knows what will happen in 50 years. Even traditional public companies stay away from outlooks over such an extended period. For all we know we will all be dead in 50 years.  Each WTT token guarantees access to a facility and eliminates the usual hosting fee for 1 watt of consumed power. To host a miner that is rated at 800 W +/- 10%, you would need 800 WTT + 80 WTT (the + 10%) = 880 WTT tokens.  The way I explain WTT to other folks is like a long-term corporate bond. It's not exactly the same, but close enough to make the point.  As long as you hold the bond and the company has not defaulted or closed, you have a claim on the company which is the face value of the bond. In addition to the face value of the bond, the company pays you some amount of money, the coupon, as a way of compensating you for loaning them your money.  In the case of WTT, the face value is essentially the current hosting fee, but can vary for you depending how many miners you have hosted at Giga Watt. While there is no ""coupon"" per se, you will be able to ""rent"" your unused WTT tokens to another mining operator that needs tokens. Currently there are four possible rental rates (4.20, 4.95, 5.70, and 6.45 US Cents/kW/H)  that correspond to the rental fees for the four sizes of mining operators (X-Large, Large, Medium, Small) at Giga Watt.  Once the ICO has completed the intent is to list the WTT token on one or more exchanges so they can be traded.  Yes, 50 years is a long time, but there are many companies that have been in existence for longer than 50 years, too.   Good luck with the enterprise - but I am out.

What about Network bandwidth? How much is provided with each 1W of power? Is there an option to buy more bandwidth? Giga Watt is responsible for the network. Clients don't pay for the network, nor have an option to buy more. We are using independent fiber-optic Internet connection.  Quote 4. What are the moisute levels in the area of the Giga-Watt pods? What is the effect on equipment from your experience? Is there rust after 1-2 years of operation? Humidity level averages between 10%-54% (Summer) and 65%-80% (Winter) in Wenatchee, WA. The lesser the Humidity in summer, the better it is for mining rigs. In the winter, at very low temperatures, Humidity doesn't matter (anything below 10°C). Theoretically, the ideal conditions would be: 5°C-100% Humidity, 20°C-50% Humidity, and 40°C-0% Humidity before rust can happen.  There is another factor which is Dew Point. At any given time, if Dew Point is less than Temperature, there will be no rust. However, in winter, Dew Point becomes higher than Temperature, which may cause rust, but the heating from mining rigs will keep the Temperature higher. At this point, mining rigs might rust after 10 years or less.   Quote 5. You say you can meet customers custom demands. Why are you not providing your co-location customers the ability for remote access to their equipment hosted at your facilities? Quote from: cryptonomos on May 13, 2017, 03:52:50 PM Quote from: roomservice on May 13, 2017, 02:11:41 PM Are your customers able to manage their hosted mining hardware themselves and have full control of it? The equipment is managed by professionals with years of experience in mining. They understand what is profitable to mine now, which pool is more profitable, etc. They can quickly repair equipment. We are in the same boat, the more profitable for you, the more profitable for Giga Watt. So your technicians will decide what is profitable to mine on behalf of your customers and on their equipment? What is this?? You say repeatedly throughout the thread that customers can choose what coins they mine. Then you say exactly the opposite. Giga Watt provides ALL of its clients remote access to their mining equipment. Mining equipment owners can monitor their mining rigs' performance and update it at any time.  Clients WILL determine which coin to mine, technicians WILL determine the coins which will be listed for clients to choose from (coins that are compatible with the mining equipment hosted at Giga Watt's facility). For instance, some low coins may seem good for a client to mine, but due to calculations (that the client may not be aware of), it is not profitable to mine that coin, and might cause them losses.  Quote 6. On the below comment you state there are not set up fees. But later in this thread you stated there is one time setup fee of $20 for aciscs and $40 for GPU rigs. Are there any other Hidden fees? Quote from: cryptonomos on May 13, 2017, 03:52:50 PM Quote from: roomservice on May 13, 2017, 02:11:41 PM Otherwise i see no real difference to cloud mining. First and foremost it is our transparency. Giga Watt's facility is a real-life tangible project which you can tour if you attend our Open House, which we hold twice a month. Giga Watt's customers own the specific equipment: They know their serial numbers and can see them on the shelves in the unit. Another advantage is that Giga Watt's customers purchase their equipment at cost, without any markup, pay zero setup fees and extremely low effective electricity and maintenance fees: just 2.8c и 0.5c per kW/h respectively. There are no setup fees for the mining equipment purchased from Giga Watt Ltd. (Giga Watt's Partner). The mentioned fees are for the mining equipment that the owner already bought (not from Giga Watt's Partner), and shipped to Giga Watt's facility in order to be hosted. There are no hidden fees — Transparency is Giga Watt's first rule.    Quote 7. Who are ""retail customers""? Customers who buy full turnkey mining or WTT token holders? From https://cryptonomos.com/wtt/faq ""Does Giga Watt only mine bitcoins? Giga Watt mines all scalable cryptocurrencies: BTC, LTC, ETH/MONERO/ZCASH/DASH. The decision of what currency to mine is made by the customers who own the mining equipment. But at this stage it is technically impossible to offer all of these options to retail customers. Giga Watt is working on the solution, and hopefully in the future this option will be offered. At this point retail customers can mine only BTC, ETH, and LTC."" Retail customers are clients who have very small number of mining equipment (1-9 mining equipment). They can only mine the most famous coins such as BTC, ETH, and LTC for now, with the intention to expand this list in the future.  Quote 8. If you don't provide your customers with remote access to their equipment. How can your customers be sure you are not overclocking their equipment for  for 10-15% to your advantage (especially GPU setups) in expense of the lifetime of the equipment? Answered at number 5.  Quote 9. Cryptonomos. Who are you? What is your name? Would be nice to know who are we talking to. Are you a Cryptonomos or Giga-Watt employee? I you rather prefer to remain anonymous. Please ask Dave Carlson to answer these questions from his account here on BitcoinTalk. Join our Slack, or Telegram, and you will be able to speak with all of our team members with their real identities. Cryptonomos is the one responsible of this announcement thread as they will launch the token crowdsale. With all due respect, no CEO will come to a random forum to respond to a random potential client.  Quote 10. What exactly is included in $0.5 cents maintenance fee? Which kind of work/procedures? Labor costs, the hours required to run the company’s operations, and maintaining the projected number of facilities and the clients' equipment.  Quote  11. If I decide to power off my miners for a period of time. Will there be any charges? Since I paid for the rent for 50 year ahead can I store my miners there even if they are offline as how much as I need? No, there will be no additional charges other than the hosting fees. Yes, you can store them but to an extent. Giga Watt reserves the right to dismiss any mining equipment at any given time.",False

Under the new guidelines, ""a user of virtual currency is not a Money Services Businesses (MSB) under FinCEN's regulations and therefore is not subject to MSB registration, reporting, and record keeping regulations."" Miners, when mining bitcoins for their own personal use, aren't required to register as a MSB or Money Transmitter.  In general, there are a number of currencies in existence that are not official government-backed currencies. A currency is, after all, nothing more than a convenient unit of account. While national laws may vary from country to country, and you should certainly check the laws of your jurisdiction, in general trading in any commodity, including digital currency like Bitcoin, BerkShares, game currencies like WoW gold, or Linden dollars, is not illegal.

That you do not need a Money Transmitter License as a miner is right, but you still use your own hardware to produce a good. Even if it is not considered legal tender. See it as a chair. If you are a woodsman and you use your tools and wood to create a chair, this is a finished product worth X.  And therefore you need to pay Tax on the amount of X which will be Y.    If someone does not do that (and mining is nothing else) they will evade taxable income and GIGA is helping with that.   Look at Mossack Fonseca. They were charged in Panama with helping others to do tax evasion. Why would the IRS stop before GIGA. They still need to make sure they can identify all their customers equipment. If they can't do this simple thing, they are in trouble. Worst case the get shut down or sued such a high amount they need to and your shit is offline and gone for so long that by the time you will get it back (maybe) its not profitable.     I am kinda worried that everyone here, wants to mine, but has no idea what tax problems they might getting into if not done correctly. And GIGA did not make a lot of effort to clarify how they will conduct business in such a case. Everybody can have tokens they are anonymous and everyone can use false credentials or offshore companies or something else they might need to check. How do they do it, what are their measurements to prevent a lawsuit with some foreign entity?

Starts today!,"      Yes you do. It does not matter if they are registered. Every company needs to make sure that every business partner can be identified. To do that, they need to dox every customer. If said customers are i.e. using an offshore company, they can be sued by the IRS or every other national group for the support of money laundering, tax evasion or similar.  The fact that they are a registered business also means, that the IRS is regularly checking not only the book, but also contracts between customers and Giga.  Mining in the USA is classified as a business as soon as you are doing it for profit and in a long term mater (the time frame does not really mater that much, but as long as you do it for profit you operate a business and you can't deny you do it for profit). Hence every customer needs to register their business activity with the authorities. You don't do it, Tax Fraud/Tax evasion. And therefore Giga is supporting it, resulting in possible law suits.   If they accept foreign nationals, its even more difficult and easy to fall into some tax problems....     Its one thing to have a miner in your garage, but a whole other thing if you run a business or in that case need a datacenter where your mining is on record for IRS.  And it does not mater, where you live. EVERY COUNTRY got this rule of operating a business.   So the second you place your miner in another country you need to check if the placing of hardware alone is enough to classify as a permeant place of production....     And like it or not, they have no clue about any of these issues. Collecting money is one thing, making sure you are able to stay belly up another. This might have all been easy for them when they were operating only personal miners, now that they offer it to others, the legal base is a lot different....",False

From what I can tell by reading the info available in the WTT white paper and the web sites, Giga-Watt pays out daily. Given that you know the hash rate for your miner(s) and the network difficulty, any decent mining calculator (or your own calculator or spreadsheet for that matter) can tell you the expected output. Deduct the daily fee for your miner(s) and you should be able to calculate the deposit to your account.

So rather than deducting fees as earned and playing ""big brother"" to all customer accounts, why not just switch to a prepay model. It's easy to know what your equipment will incur in fees for the next 30 days. For example at $0.033 kWh, it will cost $34.58 per month. This would also alleviate the limitation on pools and mining coins other than BTC, LTC and ETH.

Due to overwhelming demand for Giga Watt’s equipment hosting services the Giga Watt project is discontinuing, for an indefinite period of time, the option of buying and hosting mining equipment for clients who do not own WTT tokens.  From now on, the orders to buy and host mining equipment are accepted only from the clients who, at the time of their equipment or hosting service order, already own WTT tokens, and the number of their WTT tokens is ample to cover the energy consumption of all the equipment or hosting service they are ordering.  Our preliminary estimates indicate that the number of orders already placed is sufficient to secure token renters for current token holders who are not interested in engaging in mining in the near future. We are currently preparing a token holder survey to conduct a more thorough evaluation. As soon as we see demand for more token renters, Giga Watt project will renew their sales of equipment and hosting services to clients who do not own WTT tokens.  This is very good news for all WTT token holders: your tokens will be hard at work whether you do your own mining or rent your tokens out to others.  If you are interested in buying new equipment from Giga Watt, here's some information about the current for sale offers, based on availability:  L3+: LTC payment only S9: payment in BTC, LTC, and USD T9: payment in BTC, LTC, and USD Panda Miner B3 Plus: USD payment only  The availability is regularly updated on Giga Watt's website at https://giga-watt.com/ and in our Telegram channel at https://t.me/cryptonomos  If you intend to purchase mining equipment with cryptocurrencies, please secure your payment funds in advance. If you are paying with USD, please note that wire transfers take time, equipment sells out fast, and it may not be available by the time your USD payment is received. We also recommend to purchase WTT tokens in advance if you do not have enough tokens now so yet as the process of purchase of tokens takes some time too and it has to be completed before you can buy your mining equipment.

I am not a rocket scientist in the blockchain tech, but I noticed that miners have a big deal is voting power for new software updates in a blockchain from a coin.  Like the discussion of BTC hardfork (example https://1august.org)  I think miners have voting power because they choose the miningpools and they manage / install there support of software update. This is there (miners) part beside the wallet providers, exchanges and users hardwallet/paperwallet.  If this is correct, then can GigaWatt give there vision how they manage the voting part by a software update to prevent a hardfork or support it?

With my small post count, it should have been more than easy to find the few posts I made in this thread.  But to safe you time my questions are about taxation, if there is the need to open up a legal entity if i want to conduct business with Giga based on the different type of options (renting out the space or operating my own miner), all under the premises of NOT being a US citizen nor green card holder.     I can operate my management and HQ in germany, place my miners in holland or sweden and oh shit, I need to open a legal entity in sweden or holland as well and not just in germany. Even though I just rent/buy some electricity/space. The miners would count as a production place and therefore the colocation (I placed the miners in) needs to make sure I am registered, otherwise they would support illegal activities in their halls.....    My questions are far deeper than the infos provided in some stupid white paper, where they explain how they will build the pods, rent out token, what value the tokens will have, where to buy and sell them or whatever general infos you can think off.    Every business should know what its customers shall be, and also check for their own security, if they allow or under what premises they conduct business with each customer.  There is a reason most banks stopped business relation with US citizen even though ""it could be up to the client"" to make sure everything is legal according to their laws.   If I conduct business with someone, I need to know if it can fall back on me because of some foreign laws... If you do not check that first before you start collecting money, its not just risky for the client (he can check that its legal according to the own laws) but also for the business and ALL shareholders.    If they get bankrupt because of lawsuits you wouldn't be happy to see your money gone because they conducted business with people they should simply not have done business with.... ",False

Cost reduction for the starter tariff is 9,75 – 3,3 c/kWh = 6,45 c/kWh multiplied with 24/1000*100 = 0,001548 $/day multiplied with 365 = 0,57 $/year (which is not 100% in line with calculator: 0,59 $/year). For further simplification we assume that this cost reduction is perpetual since 50 years in the crypto space is sort of everlasting. I then take an insane high discount rate of 50% (I really don‘t know better) which leaves me with a NPV for the token = 0,57/0,5 = 1,14 $. All factors and assumptions arguable.   Price to the upside: let‘s assume all tokens are sold and all token holders are mining and I have a left over miner at Giga Watt. How much would I be willing to pay to a token holder? I then would be willing to pay the net present value of the complete cost reduction when mining at Giga Watt in comparison to mining at home. At home with noise and neighbours ignored I then would pay 27 c/kWh which is the residential price for electricity at my home town (in Germany) with a rental fee of zero and maintenance fee also at zero. The cost reduction would be 27 c/kWh (at home) – 3,3 c/kWh (at GW for WTT holders) = 23,7 c/kWh when mining at GW. 23,7 c/kWh *24/1000*100 = 0,005688 $/day * 365 = 2,08 $/year. I again take the same high discount rate of 50% which leaves me with a NPV of the cost reduction when mining at GW instead if mining at home = 2,08 /0,5 = 4,16 $ which I am willing to pay for a token. If the price is higher I mine at home, if it is lower I buy the token and mine at GW. All factors and assumptions again arguable. Especially the assumtion that at 27 c/kWh mining at home is profitabel. Since I have no numbers I really don‘t know. Maybe I just would be better off selling the miner.",False

Starts today!,"   I had the same thought.  Disclaimer: I am new to all of this. By being attached to the 50 year 1 watt of power, it might put a fairly hard ceiling on the value of the token. If people can become convinced that the value of the token is based on the value of 50 years of 1 watt rental at Gigawatt, and the rental fee has a fixed amount (as it appears to have), then you can literally calculate the exact value of the coin (obviously this assumes nothing changes over the next 50 years, which is ridiculous.  But you get my point.)  According to the cryptonomos calculator which is available here: https://cryptonomos.com/?r=1lv0eNDlOmhWNTu18ev35yyLJ You can rent the tokens out for a max of $0.56502 per token per year. Multiply that by 50 years, and you get a lifetime value of $28.25 per token.  Of course this assumes the tokens are being rented out.  But a similar formula could be used, based on the savings in rental fees, if the tokens were being used to cover miner rental feesL Again, according to the cryptonomos calculator which is available here: https://cryptonomos.com/?r=1lv0eNDlOmhWNTu18ev35yyLJ You will save $0.5913 per token per year. Multiply that by 50 years, and you get a lifetime value of $29.565 per token.  So, based on this simple concept, we would assume that the value of one token should be at the very most $29.565, which is awesome for investors if it actually went this high.  Of course people will guess about what the value of mining/electricity will be over the next 50 years and apply that to the possible future value the token brings.  That's where things get interesting, I suppose.  Again I am totally new at this and I realize this is simple logic that only works in a vacuum.  But I thought it might be worthwhile to consider.",False

In other words, the speculative value of this token might have a limit to it due to being tied to an actual asset with measurable value. So, my proposition is that the backing of the token by the rental/infrastructure both gives it real value (as opposed to purely speculative value) as well as real limits (as opposed to a lot of these coins/tokens that are backed by nothing but are able to grow endlessly).  Of course, as I mentioned, I concede completely that this value varies based on current demand and predicted future demand. I bought wtt so I obviously don't doubt its potential. But I wonder if it has a self-imposed value limit that other tokens don't necessarily have?  I am curious to hear from smarter people than myself, because I am basically pulling this out of my butt.

So you'd have to factor in cost benefit analysis stuff to decide if a WTT token worth $5 would be worth it or not (Open exchange potential price used)  Quote from: No coNnecT on June 22, 2017, 09:58:11 AM At what price BTC cost for purchase of tokens of Giga Watt is calculated? For example: Today I want to buy Giga Watt tokens for the sum of 1 BTC. 1 BTC = $2667 is meant by I will receive 2667/1.05 = 2540 WTT tokens? If tomorrow 1 BTC costs $3150 and I will buy tomorrow I mean I will receive 3150/1.05 = 3000 WTT tokens? Explain how this happens? The price is converted instantly, so yes if you buy today and btc price goes way up to $10,000 each you did lose out on a lot of potential tokens. However if the btc price drops to $150 tomorrow then you got way more tokens than you would get.  Timing is everything.

Cheers,  GPU mining rigs can be set up there, they have a $40 set up charge if you use your own; or if you buy a pandaminer through them (it could eventually be directed to other mining sources)   @redrockmining, no I figure I'd wait a little and just google earth it.

Starts today!,"Hello Everyone,  I want to try and simplify the ICO for Giga Watt. I have purchased Giga Watt Tokens (WTT) so I am going to stick to dot points and attempt to keep it neutral so everyone can make their own informed decision.  1 WTT = 1 Watt of entitled power consumption.  ICO started 2 Jun 17 Pacific Daylight Time 1200 (24hr), Ends 31 Jul 17 1200.                    - 1 WTT = $1.00 Weeks 1-2                     Current price - 1 WTT = $1.05 Weeks 3-4                                       - 1 WTT = $1.10 Weeks 5-6                                   - 1 WTT = $1.15 Weeks 7-8                   - 1 WTT = $1.20 Week 9  Unsure exactly how the weeks are worked out. If 1 Week = 7 days, this only leaves 3 days for week 9. Maybe someone can answer.  At the moment if you wanted to use Giga Watt's facility to mine it would cost: 9 Miners or less 9.75c kW/hour  (the more miners the cheaper it is, I will use 9 miners or less for this exmaple)  Price Broken down Electricity    - 2.8c Maintenance - 0.5c Facility Rent - 6.45c  Purchasing WTT saves you the rent and guarantees you power usage equivalent to the amount of WTT's you have purchased for 50 years (who knows what will be happening in 50 years, maybe house drones will be cruising around). You still have to pay for electricity and maintenance. If you do not want to use your WTT's for you own mining you can rent them out for 4.2c kW/h, if the demand is there.  You will be able to sell the WTT's on an exchange/s once all WTT's have been issued and they become listed.  For every 100 WTT's sold an additional 15 are issued to team, partners and advisors - due to this straight away investment is decreased by 15% (happens with all ICO's, some more some less), but I am sure it will increase well more than this.  You are not investing into speculation, you are purchasing the ability to use Giga Watt's facility to mine.  Giga Watt have open days so you can go and check out the facility. Wish I could go but due to being almost 12 000km (7450miles) away it is not possible.  Download and read the whitepaper  I hope this have given a simply overview of the ICO and I haven't confused anyone too much. Remember do your own research and gather as much info as possible to give you the best informed decision whether to invest or not.  Thanks",False

Starts today!,"Dave, Cryptonomos Hello,  I am interested in buying tens to hundreds of thousands of WTT. At first I was quite excited with your idea but after careful examination I'm not so sure and I have some serious questions about your business model.  1. If space requirement for mining equipment doubles per 1W of power due to Moore's law in semiconductor manufacturing advances. Power consumption of chips drops down significantly with each generation. I have the following question. For Example: Currently some Mining GPU setup is taking 60x60x60 cm of space and consumes 1Kw/h of electricity. In two years if equipment is upgraded to latest models that will require TWO GPU setups of 60x60x60 cm for the same 1Kw/h of electricity.  To meet your obligations to WTT token holders, Will Giga-Watt build new Giga-pods on a constant basis and allocate the additional space required for equipment upgrades on demand every couple of years for 50 years ?!?  2. Will Giga-Watt provide some storage to customers for spare parts for mining equipment that will wear out? 3. What about Network bandwidth? How much is provided with each 1W of power? Is there an option to buy more bandwidth? 4. What are the moisute levels in the area of the Giga-Watt pods? What is the effect on equipment from your experience? Is there rust after 1-2 years of operation? 5. You say you can meet customers custom demands. Why are you not providing your co-location customers the ability for remote access to their equipment hosted at your facilities?   So your technicians will decide what is profitable to mine on behalf of your customers and on their equipment? What is this?? You say repeatedly throughout the thread that customers can choose what coins they mine. Then you say exactly the opposite.  6. On the below comment you state there are not set up fees. But later in this thread you stated there is one time setup fee of $20 for aciscs and $40 for GPU rigs. Are there any other Hidden fees?  Quote from: roomservice on May 13, 2017, 02:11:41 PM Otherwise i see no real difference to cloud mining. First and foremost it is our transparency. Giga Watt's facility is a real-life tangible project which you can tour if you attend our Open House, which we hold twice a month. Giga Watt's customers own the specific equipment: They know their serial numbers and can see them on the shelves in the unit. Another advantage is that Giga Watt's customers purchase their equipment at cost, without any markup, pay zero setup fees and extremely low effective electricity and maintenance fees: just 2.8c и 0.5c per kW/h respectively.  7. Who are ""retail customers""? Customers who buy full turnkey mining or WTT token holders? From https://cryptonomos.com/wtt/faq ""Does Giga Watt only mine bitcoins? Giga Watt mines all scalable cryptocurrencies: BTC, LTC, ETH/MONERO/ZCASH/DASH. The decision of what currency to mine is made by the customers who own the mining equipment. But at this stage it is technically impossible to offer all of these options to retail customers. Giga Watt is working on the solution, and hopefully in the future this option will be offered. At this point retail customers can mine only BTC, ETH, and LTC.""  8. If you don't provide your customers with remote access to their equipment. How can your customers be sure you are not overclocking their equipment for  for 10-15% to your advantage (especially GPU setups) in expense of the lifetime of the equipment? 9. Cryptonomos. Who are you? What is your name? Would be nice to know who are we talking to. Are you a Cryptonomos or Giga-Watt employee? I you rather prefer to remain anonymous. Please ask Dave Carlson to answer these questions from his account here on BitcoinTalk. 10. What exactly is included in $0.5 cents maintenance fee? Which kind of work/procedures? 11. If I decide to power off my miners for a period of time. Will there be any charges? Since I paid for the rent for 50 year ahead can I store my miners there even if they are offline as how much as I need?  Unless you can provide satisfying answers to the above questions, Especially question 1 and 5. I will unfortunately have to pass on your business proposal.  The ability for me to fully control my hosted hardware via remote access is a ""To be or not to be"" type of issue.  Best Regards.",False

When I place my own miner or a miner I bought over Giga and mine cryptocurrencies, does that count as an production plant where I fall under US Tax Laws?  Are there exception like double taxation agreements? Or even exceptions for crypto mining itself?  2)  Same question, if I rent out my space (basically this is my WATT Token right), does the physical space the miner will be standing on count as property, where I have income from property leasing/rent income?   If yes, do I need to register as a ""landlord"".  3)  How will the payout be conducted?  What currencies? Do you pay me (having full control of all mined coins) or do I get payed by the mining pool?  4)  Why can't I access my miner via remote access? If I want to re-boot or change pools, I need to be able to.  5)  What happens in the case of a malfunction? What kind of service do you offer as a ""One Time Payment""?   Do you repair the miners or send them away to the manufacturer.  6)  When I buy with you and you promise 93% uptime and I have a failure in hardware, do you cover the lost income in case you can't fix the problem?     7)  Could you please post your company credentials, registration infos tax number, that we can verify them?

Curious about that, because at a point when my miners become unprofitable; I would love to have them sent to my address so I may use them. 3. I don't think the bandwidth will necessarily be an issue; as they operate within Gigawatts pool currently. 4. The area its located in isn't super moist, but it does get average levels of rainfall; the fan's should also to some extent help with keeping humidity down. 5. They can choose which coins to mine based off of what they currently offer which is BTC, LTC and ETH; I e-mailed them about the event of ETH going PoS would my antminer be able to be used for ZEC, XMR or ETC - And they did say they are working on getting mining set up for those coins, but do not feel ETH will go PoS terribly soon.  I also asked if I could direct my miners outside of the giga-watt pool, and this was a current no-no but one day it potentially could occur; however they would most likely be unable to charge the electricity fee from the coin you opt'd to mine; meaning a potential fund sending/temp swap during the day. 6. There is no set up fee's for miners they sell, there is if you send your own miners. 7. I think I kind of answered that within #5. 8. I suppose you wouldn't, although I'm assuming if all the miners died in 6 months; they would lose a lot of customers as well as have their name tarnished forever unless they replaced the miners. 9. Cryptonomos is the escrow provider for giga-watt 10. The maintenance fee is usually just upkeep and not technically an every day thing; however if something goes wrong like a GPU fries the maintenance fee acts kind of like an insurance policy - pay the pennies today; save yourself the hundies tomorrow. 11. I can't guess why you would want to turn off the miners, given the general difficulty increases overtime but (In my mind and in theory though you could store them there unplugged.",False

I mean its hard pressed to find a government entity willing to define a price on any crypto asset, since its just magical mystery money; unless you're cashing out but then they're taxing your money. I don't think you need to register with a legal entity, and technically they don't know where you live so maybe you live in the U.S., maybe you don't.  (I am not versed entirely on this section of the law, my skills are elsewhere)  2. As far as I've understood it there will always be a place for you, if you choose to rent your WTT tokens out you're renting them to customers but you can pull them at any moment; and they'll go back to paying full price.  3. Paid by mining pool, however they do control the mining pool.  Also they mine the top 3 currencies currently so if you have a BTC asic it will only mine BTC it would not ever be mining LTC, Eth so on and so forth; so if you have the btc asic you would only be receiving BTC.  4. It's currently not an option because all mining power is directed at their pool, but may become one in the future.  5. I think the malfunction is somewhat inclusive in that 93.5% uptime statement; assuming they would send it back to the manufacturer though if it was unfixable.  6.  Good question, I don't know this one.  7. This is no guarantee, but I don't think gigawatt would have a tax number currently; since they were megabigpower and are kind of a child company now (new)   *Trying to answer some questions to the best of my capabilities, not affiliated with gigawatt. **If these answers have helped in any way, or enough -> my referral link is below",False

Asking because, right now, they're not matched. The only ""proof"" I have right now that I've indeed purchased an L3+ is the mail from gigawatt and the payment done. The miner purchased doesn't appear anywhere yet, so asking if that is working as intended for now.  Also, since on the website it's shown the L3s and S9s are still available, once we purchase them, are we guaranteed that we will get them ?

So given that you have 635 days of pure profit even with the tokens paid for immediately at the start and not taking the long way through it and using only your profit difference to pay for the tokens -- your next set of miners would already have this price reduction in hosting costs, and if you choose to not continue mining well you've paid off your tokens 100% and your miners 100%; you could either rent out your tokens and earn a steady daily income -> calculator on the website, or sell your tokens for at the very least what you paid for them as I don't believe mining will ever truly die to PoS/Masternodes.     (I would be interested in knowing if they buy our miners from us at a point to recycle, or if they would ship them to us for our reselling pleasure)   *Profit without tokens goes up non linearly because if you host a lot of miners you do get a discount hence why the with token profit goes up linearly.",False

Also i asked a few questions, got this reply in about 12 hours for those with other questions:  Your choice of equipment also determines which mining pool you can use. The following three pools are available to Giga Watt’s clients: Slush Pool to mine bitcoins, NanoPool for Ethereum and LitecoinPool for LTC (we are working to integrate support for more pools / coins as well). We do not believe ETH will go PoS that soon (if at all; there will be testing first to see if its viable). But yes! Giga Watt is currently working to add support for XMR, ZEC, and ECL. Your rewards will be distributed to your digital wallet multiple times daily. If the pool you are mining with does not solve a block then no rewards are distributed,.. but this is rare. You will still pay hosting should that ever happen but we expect rewards to outweigh costs. We are working to support more coins, but you will not have the ability to reprogram; however, if and when we do, Giga Watt will be able to make that switch for you.",False

The second issue I have they don't accept debit or credit card as payment for the WTT or the buying the miners. Even thought they state you can pay in USD it has to be wire transfer. Just like coins once you send it it can't be taken back. I think you have 10- 30 minutes after sending a wire transfer to have the bank cancel it. And if you send your BTC or any other coin to them there will be nothing you will be able to do. With wire transfer you are responsible for making sure the money you are sending is to someone you trust or really want to send it to. What if you put 20k or 30 k into this business and something happens which causes you to take your money out or want to cancel for some other reason you probably wouldn't be able to do it.   I contacted them and they told me the reason they don't accept debit or credit card due to security reasons? do the mean that customers can file a complaint with their bank and request a  refund and there is basically nothing they can do if the bank takes the money out of their account and give it back to the client, try doing that with wire transfer or coins.",False

I was thinking about that by myself and I deffinitely agree with these 2 points: - it's understandable they didn't want/need to develop a token - it's understandable they needed someone to take care of the ICO itself, so they can focus on the construction/hardware part. but what's not understandable and it's pretty much the most important thing: - why does cryptonomo have to keep the money IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, when cryptonomo is a way less known entity than Giga Watt. Why exactly would you trust them with, literarly, MILLIONS of $$$, based on the tokens sold so far ( IF THE NUMBERS ARE REAL ) ? Once again, I'm not asking why a company/individual have to use an escrow. I'm asking why a well known company would ever use an entity that's LESS KNOWN, relatively newly created and pretty much nobody ever heard of it and also let them handle an escrow worth of millions $$$  Both on the website and in their White Paper PDF it says ""The funds will be released from escrow in step with the completion of facilities"". Considering cryptonomo have around $7mil in escrow and Giga Watt haven't really build any new Giga Pods ( on July 15th should be the 1st one completed), what exactly stops cryptonomo keep all these millions without releasing any escrow, EVER ? Remember, the first building is supposed to be ready on 15th july, so in more than 1 month, which means cryptonomo will be holding 7mil+ (what they got so far) + all the money people will send till 15th July and ONLY THEN they SHOULD release the first batch from escrow, once the Giga Pod from 15th July is finished.  They could have just hired these guys to take care of the ICO, to manage their website and so on just WITHOUT the escrow part. Waiting an answer from cryptonomo aswell, if possible.",False

Starts today!,"   You have rightly guessed to make difficulty the biggest possibility for not making any money. If you take for example LTC and its increase rate of 3% -4% every time it adjusts, which is about 4 days, you are looking at around 40% per month, so if you pay nothing for electricity you still won't make any money unless the price of the coin goes up alot each month too.  Check out this difficulty calculator. http://www.vnbitcoin.org/litecoincalculator.php  You are paying too much for the miner in the first place. And if you have to wait 1 or 2 or 3 months just to get your miner, good luck. If you buy today, you might get half your money back, if you pay now and wait 30 days, you might get 1/4 of your money back.  Here is a good idea. Buy coins straight out.  You have ask yourself, if the money was so good, why are they selling this idea to somebody else? Think about like this, when is the last time you gave away to the public millions of dollars? If the money is so good, these guys can go and borrow money and mine and make millions. But the problem is the risk is too high. As soon as thousands of Joe Q. public think they can make money they go out and start mining by the thousands. This hunger drives up the mining which drives up the difficulty. This is the same rush in the 1800's for gold.  In 2013, I mined for a short period of time, when BTC went from $110 to over $1000, I was lucky to get out with a profit. It wasn't from great planning. haha. Wish somebody told me that back then.",False

Starts today!,"Hello guys,  I am very new to mining, hence I will ask following questions. They will probably sound noobish. But hey, why not ask greatest community in the world for support.  I have several options to consider and I don't know which one to choose. Recently I started to consider if I should join giga-watt WTT token crowd sale and invest some money in mining. Wtt website appeared conveincing to me and whole return on investment structure seemed to be straight forward(if you see any underwater difficulties let me know). So here are following options:     1.   Buying 880 watt tokens to host miner(880$)  gives you an access to mine at 0.033$ kWh+ ASIC L3+ miner(1550$) from giga watt. Total investment of 2430$. With return of 10,577.89$ a year roughly. As what they advertise.    2.   Buying 1500 watt tokens to host miner(1500$) gives you an access to mine at 0.033$ kWh + ASIC S9 miner(1600$) from giga watt. Total investment of 3100$. With potential return of 4,628.51$. As what they advertise.  I am not 100% sure but I think giga-watt themselves are quite limited in choices of what they can mine i think currently they support mining of BTC, XMR, LTC and ETH. But they don't have Panda miners in stock to mine ETH.  So my main concern is that I can't exactly figure out which one of those methods will be more efficient and what are the risks involved. And of course which method would you choose.  Roll Eyes In this particular moment of time returns are fucking amazing, below are current retes:  Time Frame         LTC Coins                      BTC (LTC/BTC at 0.01076000)                USD (BTC at $2,920.02)                   Power Cost (in USD)          Pool Fees (in USD)            Profit (in USD) Hourly                0.05310134                                     0.00057137                                     $1.67                                               $0.02                             $0.02                       $1.64 Daily                  1.27443215                                     0.01371289                                     $40.04                                             $0.58                             $0.40                        $39.47 Weekly              8.92102505                                        0.09599023                                   $280.29                                           $4.03                             $2.80                       $276.26 Monthly               38.23296452                                   0.41138670                                    $1,201.26                                        $17.28                           $12.01                      $1,183.98 Annually            465.16773496                                    5.00520483                                    $14,615.30                                      $210.24                         $146.1                      $14,405.06   In best possible scenario I can break even in: 62.20 Day(s) Thats of course is magical number, rest of miner lifetime would be profitabe and I would be able to buy more hardware on the go.. and may be invest in more miners and more tokens to host those in giga-watt. So effectively, if everything comes down quite closely to projection, this is an opportunity to build my own little mining income farm in existing giga-watt facilities.. Unless I am counting something wrong in here.  I am seriously considering mining LTC with Antminer L3+ at giga-watt facilities, but lets say I'd be able to start no earlier then October if everything comes down in best possible scenario. Even if we double in difficulty and price of bitcoin goes down to 1k price of LTC would drop accordingly to 0.005btc. I am still going to be able to break even in: 922.79 Day(s)  And thats if we look at worst scenario here. Will this happen? I dont know but risk is worth it i think. Again if lifetime of this miner will last for 2.5 years(some say its around 18 months) as advertised I can consider myself lucky if it holds for 2.5 years.. But if we hit best scenario, with price of litecoin higher then 5$, then I can break even on my investment..  So lets look at potential returns in worst scenario to break even in 922 days on investment of 2430$:  Time Frame           LTC Coins                  BTC (LTC/BTC at 0.00500000)         USD (BTC at $1,000.00)         Power Cost (in USD)       Pool Fees (in USD)            Profit (in USD) Hourly                  0.02619345                                       0.00013097                                  $0.13                                        $0.02                            $0.00                        $0.11 Daily                     0.62864274                                      0.00314321                                  $3.14                                        $0.58                            $0.03                        $2.54 Weekly                  4.40049917                                      0.02200250                                  $22.00                                      $4.03                            $0.22                        $17.75 Monthly                18.85928214                                     0.09429641                                  $94.30                                      $17.28                          $0.94                        $76.07 Annually               229.45459932                                   1.14727300                                  $1,147.27                                  $210.24                        $11.47                      $925.56  So my risks here are: 1. Difficulty 2. Price 3. Lifetime of miner 4. Government policy.  All of these 4 have very high odds and I cant take current price and difficulty as a solid return plan for what I will get back, current figures are based on the miner working at this particular moment of time, and my opportunity will only come around in October. I know that things can go both ways, and LTC can just go higher and returns will be even higher then planned, but I am looking at risks here not profits..

The hashrate kept growing despite the price not growing and other coins being more profitable. it was a bear market for all coins but people would rotate to whatever was turning a profit, yet the hashpower being thrown at x11 always went up even if the coin price dropped. FPGA aren't hard, they sell kits for them. I'm not smart enough to do it but it's not rocket science. Anyway nobody was publicly selling them except for the scam cloud mining guy so no hard proof but there were people on bitcointalk claiming to have seen x11 fpga farms in China. Only two other coins have ASIC, Bitcoin and Litecoin and both of them had FPGA before ASIC so it would actually be odd if X11 didn't have FPGA. The kits are cheap and design is easier than ASIC. It would be pretty odd if nobody did FPGA before jumping to ASIC. One reason FPGA aren't sold publicly is they are easy to copy, so all the work put into design if somebody got their hands on it they could buy a kit and reproduce it easily. I'm not an FPGA expert, just a forum lurker but from what I read there are FPGA that can protect from copying but they are expensive. Those with the skills to program the FPGA make more mining for themselves building up a farm rather than selling a couple and having their deisgn copied and then they have to compete with others, so it makes economic sense to keep FPGA secret. Decred algo was a good algo for FPGA, if the devs were smart they designed some FPGA before releasing the coin so they could mine super efficient. ANd actually I remember Vanilla coin or something similiar to that the dev actually did build FPGA and had videos of it. I wasn't into that coin so not sure if he sold or shared his design or what but I remember seeing it and it wasn't so fast it made GPU unprofitable but it was super efficient using very little power compared to GPU. Anyway they are more common than most think, and if a coin made it all the way to ASIC I'd be willing to bet it had an FPGA along the line.",False

I currently switch back and forth between ETH and ZEC, but can mine any coin that has miner software written to take advantage of my GPU.  GPU mineable coins require a relatively small amount of money and some software smarts to be able to optimize the hashing algorithms to run efficiently on a variety of GPU architectures (there are several different architectures for each of the two big player's GPUs). The end-users will have, or will build, their own mining rigs which can double as gaming machines. The costs to design, build, and sell an FPGA miner at scale (more than just code running on a widely available dev board) are significantly more than GPU rigs, and ASIC miners are significantly more expensive than FPGA rigs.  I like the idea of the PandaMiner machines (custom motherboard with off the shelf GPUs). It was just a matter of time before someone made the effort to do that. Think about it. There are a bunch of people who are building and selling (at a premium) five, six, or seven GPU mining rigs based on consumer motherboards.

However, by the time you actually start to mine (late July or even September for some miners) the difficulty would rise but it's not certain if the coin's price would keep up.  If you are looking at Panda Miners, keep in mind ETH is switching to PoS by the end of 2017 so you'd have to switch coin soon and from what I can see none of the coins have comparable returns with ETH atm. There's still risk involved here, but the risk-reward factor seems high enough.

It's a capital intensive business, so more capital they get the more they can grow. They have access to cheap electricity and talented team to keep miners running, that's their edge in this business and what they are selling. They are also mining for themselves as Gigawatt has been for many years. Seems they are now building out more space and makes more sense to share risks of mining (coin price, difficulty rise ect) while selling us what they do best, keep miners running as cost efficient as possible.

Add funds to your account in BTC, ETH or USD: Go to the corresponding section at the top of your Cryptonomos account   a. If you are adding BTC or ETH, copy the wallet address and pay the desired amount.   b. If you are paying by wire transfer, set the desired deposit amount, fill in the popup form fields, generate an invoice, download it and make a payment. 2. Purchase tokens: log into your account and pay for WTT tokens with the funds on your Cryptonomos account.   Important: Adding funds to your account does not mean that the tokens will be automatically paid for.   Hint: If you want to make sure your BTC/ETH transfer transaction goes quickly, we suggest you set the commission fee 2-3 greater than standard. For instance, for BTC it is 0.001 BTC or more. Otherwise there is risk that your transaction will get stuck in line for hours or even days. Wire transfer transaction will take longer time than BTC or ETH.

Take the L3+ miner example. This mining hardware costs $1400 on Bitmain's site (including power supply) but that doesn't include shipping and customs taxes. GW sells it for $1550 final price. I'm from Romania and I'd have to pay more than $1800 to get the L3+ miner delivered to my place. Also, where I live the price per KWh is 3-4X higher than what GW is asking.

Do I pair the token to my miner (by signing it with my private key) and when I sell it on exchange, the new owner can rent it out or pair it to their miner ?

I thought the power price is always at 2.8 cents/kWh no matter which scenario, which means there is no discount on the power price. The benefits from the WTT token comes in a deduction of the rental fee to zero. If the standard hosting fee without token for one miner is 9.75 cents/kWh then the benefits of the token is 9.75-3.3 =  6.45 cents/kWh, which should mean that it takes even longer to earn back the purchase price of the WTT token.  Where does the 12.8 cents/kWH come from?  Thanks for any clarification.",False

If I own tokens, but I want to rent that space out to other miners, you say I'll be able to select from 4 different rental rates and get matched up with a miner in Giga-Watt's account. Why would I ever select anything but the highest rate (6.45¢ per kWh)? I think the answer is that Giga-Watt only has a limited number of clients hosting hardware at the higher rate, so I might be forced to select a lower rental rate.  Let's say that, hypothetically, Giga-Watt only has one customer hosting mining rigs in the highest fee tier and these mining rigs total 10kW of power. If 2 people both own 10,000 WTT tokens and both want to rent that space out, which of them would rent to this miner for 6.45¢ per kWh and which would be forced to drop down a tier and rent to someone else at a lower rate?

If I dropped my own mining rigs in there, what would the additional cost be for Gigawatt to run and maintain my miners?  Your original post lists a 3.3¢ per kWh hosting fee for token owners. Assuming this includes power, that would imply Gigawatt is charging 0.5¢ per kWh for maintenance?

With WTT tokens, your rental fee drops to 0, and you would only be paying 3.3¢ per kWh, that is correct. Maintenance of 0.5¢ per kWh is already included in 3.3¢ price.  It's not so complicated actually, see for yourself using this calculator. With renting out 10,000 tokens to other miners, you could potentially earn anywhere from $3679.20 of annual rental income (assuming you picked 4.2¢/kW/h rental fee) to $5650.20 (that is with 6.45¢/kW/h rental fee). You decide which rental fee to pick. There will be dashboard, where you would be able to find miners with matching fees in your cabinet in Giga Watt's account.
