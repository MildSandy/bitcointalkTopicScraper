The magazine is famous for regularly publishing a list of the richest people around. The rating was made with the high volatility of digital currency in mind. Forbes published a rating of people who made their wealth on cryptocurrency. It's the first time in the history of the magazine, known for informing the public about various categories of rich people, that they make such a list. In this case, it's merely an approximate measure of their wealth, considering the high volatility of cryptocurrencies' exchange rate. This is what the cover of the new issue looks like.  First place is held by the CEO of Ripple, Chris Larsen ($7.5-8 billion). Second is Joseph Lubin, founder of the blockchain company ConsenSys and co-founder of Ethereum ($1-5 billion). Third, came Changpeng Zhao, CEO of the exchange Binance ($1.1-2 billion). Fourth place is split between the brothers Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, cofounders of Winklevoss Capital and Facebook ($900 million â $1.1 billion each). Fifth place is held by the individual investor Matthew Mellon ($900 million â $1 billion). Sixth place goes to Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase ($900 million â $1 billion). Seventh goes to Matthew Roszak, co-founder of Bloq and founder of Tally Capital ($900 million â $1 billion). In eighth place is Anthony Di Iorio, co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Jaxx and Decentral ($750 million â $1 billion). Ninth in the running is Brock Pierce, chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation and advisor for Block.One ($700 million â $1 billion). Number ten - Michael Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital ($700 million â $1 billion). Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin came in just 17th place. It's worth noting that Buterin's goals have little to do with accumulating personal wealth. Forbes estimates his net worth at $400-500 million. The worth of the people in the list was calculated based on the approximate value of their cryptocurrency assets, profits after tax from trading and their stakes in the field of digital currency as they stood on 19 January 2018.

In the past, advertisers gained information about customers from various disparate sourcesâone might provide their age and gender, another their salary and one more the kind of car they drive or where they like to dine. But using the blockchain, advertisers will now have the ability to build a customer profile directly from the customerâgaining all the information the customer is willing to share in one swoop. This allows for an even greater ability to market to customersâ needsâ companies will have an opportunity for great targeting.  Blockchain technology provides full transparency, which means that buyers can easily check where a product has come fromâwho has handled itâ and whether itâs legit or fake. Everyone knows that the concept of blockchain has the power to disrupt our world on many fronts, but marketing is definitely one of the most exciting.",False

On 6 February, during an open hearing of the US Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) spoke out in favor of bitcoin and proposed an initiative to incorporate digital money into the American financial system. In his speech, CFTC Chair Christopher Giancarlo expressed optimism regarding the future of the cryptocurrency market and the blockchain industry. He feels that the appearance of virtual currency bears witness to the fact that the global financial system is undergoing a tectonic shift that must be taken into account. Giancarlo went on to say that cryptocurrency is significantly enabling the improvement of the global financial system: a transparent system of payment, a decentralized system for the storage of exchange data and the speed of operations are a few of the advantages of cryptocurrency voiced by the Chair. According to the commission, the cryptocurrency market and blockchain industry in the US will play an important role in the flourishing of the American economy and improvement of the lives of Americans. Also present was SEC Chair Jay Clayton, who spoke favorably about the future of the cryptocurrency market. Clayton called digital currency a good alternative to crowdfunding for American businessmen but emphasized the need for regulation in that segment of the world economy. The crypto investor community and various crypto activists reacted positively to the speeches of the SEC and CFTC chairs. On 6 February about 80% of the news on the cryptocurrency subreddits was about the regulator's positive intentions and on how, thanks to them, cryptocurrency exchange rates stopped dropping. It is Finom's opinion that this is a landmark event for the crypto world, as the regulators have once again confirmed that cryptocurrency is not a bubble supported by the expenses of miners and that it has a bright future ahead of it in the world economy. #finom_news",False

""Cryptocurrencies may become an established part of the financial system. But, in our view, gold is very different from cryptocurrencies,"" the WGC said in its statement to investors.  Among the advantages of gold given by the Council are its low volatility, market liquidity, and its well-established regulatory framework.  ""These characteristics underpin gold's role as a mainstream financial asset that will likely continue to resonate in today's digital world,"" the Council added. The WGC stresses gold's historical importance, stating that gold has been a source of income in constant competition with the stock market and has performed well during periods of inflation.  The WGC notes that while cryptocurrency's rise in value has been remarkable, its purpose as an investment is cardinally different from that of gold.  Over the last four decades, gold has demonstrated a rather tame volatility. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has shown a sudden surge in price over the last few years, rising over fifteen times its previous value just in the past year.Unfortunately, bitcoin was forced to pay for its high volatility in the form of a significant price correction, losing 40% of its value in a single month.  Moreover, the WGC clarified that it's not worth comparing bitcoin to gold if only because of their different sources of demand. Gold is owned by central banks and institutional investors, but consumers also own gold in the form of jewellery, representing 50-60% of annual demand. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is intended for use in electronic payment systems.  Due to these and other differences, it's useless to compare bitcoin to gold.

There, attendees participated in an auction of images of Pepe the Frog, a meme that has recently been spread via blockchain.  The auction was significant in that the depictions of Pepe were bought and sold along with tokens, with ownership tracked on a blockchain. Every image is tied to a unique digital token that proves its authenticity. In 2016 developer Joe Looney created Rare Pepe Wallet, which is the main platform for buying and selling this meme,  The bidding started with a set of three Rare Pepes, one of which pays homage to Salvador Dali's The Persistence of Memory, but with melting frogs instead of clocks. The set was sold for 12,000 units of Pepe Cash, the platform's main asset, of which there are 700 million; at the time this was equal to approximately $720. The most expensive piece, Homer Pepe, sold for $38,500.  The New York art community reacted positively to this convergence of art, blockchain and memes. In the future, the organizers plan to carry out events not just for those attending the exhibition, but for art lovers online as well.  It's worth mentioning that the first cryptocurrency meme, Dogecoin, recently reached a capitalization of $2 billion, something that worries its creator, Jackson Palmer.  #finom_news",False

All the privileges of the FIN tokens were described in the white paper.  Utility tokens  The utility tokens are units of services that can be purchased. These tokens can be compared to API keys, which are used to access the service. Utilities are a way to fund projects of shared infrastructure that couldnât be funded before. To enable ecosystems to be built some tokens can be âpre-minedâ in addition to being sold in âcrowd-salesâ during token sales. The upcoming token sale will give users the opportunity to buy UTILITY tokens. NOM tokens allow their owners to buy new services within the Finom Blockchain Ecosystem.  The NOM token sale is more oriented toward users than toward  investors.",False

Results  With your support, we raised more than $41 million. $34 million was invested during the presale stage. In total, more than 7,000 investors took part in the campaign. We already started to design the services declared in the roadmap, so some of them will become available very soon. Beyond that, while working on the project, we realized that the role of tokens in the platform ecosystem contains much more opportunities than we could have imagined at the beginning.  The future of NOM  Exploring NOM applicability (the utility token you received as a bonus when purchasing the FIN security token), we discovered that the more frequently and complete the token works in the business ecosystem, the more services and transactions it serves, the greater profit it brings.  We arrived at a conclusion that our token should be more relevant and valuable, and for this purpose, it has to be enriched with a new meaning. For a highest possible efficiency, it should become a fuel for the whole ecosystem, and serve not only as a discount or a bonus tool for some certain services but also as a full-featured payment method within the platform. To implement this, the following important steps must be taken:  an additional NOM utility tokens emission attracting more private and individual investors from the crypto community, the audience our ecosystem embraces the initial purchase price reduction in order to make the token more usable as a payment tool available even for small transactions. In addition, the development and integration of all services require more investment amount than it was calculated at the projectâs start.  New crowdsale  To implement all these plans, we start a new token distribution campaign dedicated to NOM utility tokens only. It will begin on February 1, 2018, and will last until March 3, 2018.  Before it starts, we will summarize the previous campaign results entirely and negotiate with a number of key crypto exchanges about the tokens placement: the NOM token will be available there no later than on March 15, 2018. In addition, the token economy will be totally revised, as well as the WhitePaper and the platform architecture. We will start a long-expected bounty program and create video content explaining the new ecosystem scheme.  Your bonuses  You have given us a great credence at the very beginning of the project, therefore, we offer you the benefits for a new stage of the token sale. First, in the short term, all first-stage investors will be credited with additional NOM tokens. You will see them soon in your account.  In addition, we offer you the special discounts for NOM tokens to purchase. All the details will be available in an updated whitepaper, which we are going to publish on our website before the second stage start.  We make no doubt that together we will build a more efficient project architecture that will ensure the synergistic and sustainable growth of both tokens prices.  Yours faithfully, FINOM team",False

The group of analysts conducted a study and came to the conclusion that there are several reasons why bitcoin doesnât have any value. There are no interest rates associated with bitcoin rate, which, in the opinion of the analysts, proves that this is not a currency. Unlike gold, bitcoin cannot be used in the electronics or jewelry industry, despite the fact that investors attribute some value to it.  Moreover, the bitcoin payment system has faced problems with scaling and growth of transaction commissions. The daily volume of purchases is only $300 million versus $17 billion in the Visa system.  We in Finom donât share this point of view and here is why:  Cryptocurrency is backed up by such things as computing power, power plants and intellectual resources. That results in a clear comprehension of the real foundation of cryptocurrency.  Realizing this common feature between traditional and cryptocurrencies, the world is on the brink of changing its attitude toward the new financial instrument. For instance, the Japanese government, which legalized virtual currency as a legal tender because it has a basis as traditional currency but no regulatory legislation. After this announcement the price of bitcoin more than doubled. The crypto market reacted positively to this measure.  #finom_opinion on Morgan Stanley's assistants' statement",False

The registration and transfer of property and patents is a bureaucratic process that can drag on for months. But despite the systemâs clumsiness, it remained the only way to guarantee a deal.  However, imagine an âinternet of securitiesâ â an open database of funds and transactions. Any assets, from money to media rights, are exchanged, moved and stored online. Blockchain technology offers you a decentralized system in which the guarantor is a distributed ledger. It is open to all and reproduced on millions of computers, which allows anyone to easily determine what belongs to whom. All transactions take place instantaneously and free of commission, with no confiscation of property or taxation ever possible.  The fresh example of Belarus demonstrates how the incorporation of a decree on the regulation of cryptocurrency and blockchains can turn any country into a genuine paradise for fans of digital money, and attract an array of IT startups from all over the world. A relevant example is the Republic of Georgia, which a year ago abandoned the red tape. Now the country registers land titles using blockchain technology.  #finom_opinion",False

The human genome takes up about 1.5 GB. Letâs add sleeping patterns, medical history, eating patterns and daily activity. The result is a rather large amount of information which cannot possibly be combined into a single convenient register. As a result, hapless patients are forced to go from clinic to clinic, gathering up endless documents and medical records like grains of rice.  But if we put all that human data into a blockchain, weâll get a unique document, a digital medical record with exhaustive information about the state of a personâs health. Since the system retains all the qualities of a blockchain, itâs accessible worldwide, secure and has a unified structure. Also, such a system of electronic medical records will provide a wide scope for research into the causes of illnesses and for new forms of treatment like Appleâs HealthKit.  Such ideas about integrating blockchain into the medical field have already found resonance among developers all over the world. At a hackathon in 2016, the winning group created a blockchain app with the working title of Medicare for tracking data on the state of an individualâs health, to which both doctors and patients have access simultaneously.

In the 2015th the creator of Etherium Vitalik Buterin distinguished three main types of Blockchain:  - fully private blockchains: âwriteâ permissions are kept centralized in one organization, âreadÂ» permissions may be public or restricted to an arbitrary extent.  - blockchain owned by consortium: federated Blockchains operate under the leadership of a group. As opposed to public Blockchains, they donât allow any person with access to the Internet to participate in the process of verifying transactions. Federated Blockchains are faster (higher scalability) and provide more transaction privacy.  - public blockchains: state of the art public Blockchain protocols based on Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithms are open source and not permissioned. Anyone can participate, without permission.  As we can see there are can be many blockchains extisting, and they are of different types. Every type has certain strengths and weaknesses.

Such a rise in donations is attributable to it being âgiving seasonâ as well as to tax advantages. In the United States, cryptoinvestors are required to pay capital gains tax, but making charitable contributions enables them to avoid doing so.  âPeople are getting smarter about donating appreciated assets, and Bitcoin is the epitome of appreciated assets,â stated the senior vice president of donor engagement at Fidelity Charitable.  The organization utilizes payment processing tools to convert cryptocurrency into dollars, with the resulting cash then deposited to the patronsâ âdonor-advised funds.â Ultimately, this rise in donations bears witness to the stable interest in the program and can become a valuable source of support for charities in the future.  #finom_news",False

We have collected some cases of how you can use this technology even today.  1) Payments The most obvious way of using the technology. The biggest promises of blockchain and cryptocurrency that they will replace money someday. One of the benefits of decentralized money is that payments can be transferred directly between peers, without any intermediaries, like banks, slowing down the process. It is the perfect way to adopt blockchain in your business.  2) Recruiting Blockchains can pave the way for faster, cheaper and trustless (where you donât have to trust another human being for authenticity) reference checks. Each person would have a trail of feedback which would be accumulated over the course of their career by past employers.  This feedback will give HR specialists an opportunity to hire the most suitable employees  3) Contracts There is a great number of agreements and contracts signed everyday. Using blockchain technology, many of these contracts can be converted into Smart Contracts. Unlike conventional contracts, smart contracts consist of software code and are executed by the blockchain network. The main advantage of these smart contracts is that they cannot be modified after they are deployed, which ensures neither party in a deal can walk away without doing their part.",False
