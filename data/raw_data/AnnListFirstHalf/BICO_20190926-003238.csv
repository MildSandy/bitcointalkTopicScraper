The price of the ebook will be of 1500 BICO tokens (around 15$). After the crowdsale the book will be available in popular ebook platforms, like Amazon, at approximately 25$.  We believe ICOs are the future of startup funding, and while ICOs are growing in popularity, it‚Äôs still difficult for most entrepreneurs and the general public to get a clear understanding of what ICOs are and how they actually work. Faced with this challenge (and realizing the lack of information about ICOs in particular), we decided to follow the ‚Äúlearning-by-doing‚Äù approach: launching our own ICO, learning in depth how it works and sharing the acquired knowledge with the world. Entrepreneurs don't  want to screw up their startup in the funding phase. That‚Äôs how the idea of the BICO token was conceived.  By succeeding the ICO we would also like to encourage the 'arts' and 'writers' to get funding from ICOs. While sells might be increasing in the ebook industry (cheap pricing pressure from Kindle Unlimited and Amazon), publishers are getting less revenue. The old guard haven‚Äôt innovated since some years. And neither their business models nor their products embrace any digital change.   I hope this answer your questions and you join the BICO community! ",False
