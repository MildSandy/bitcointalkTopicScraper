Setting up an ICO under current circumstances in the cryptocurrency world is almost a mission impossible – investor confidence is low, the crypto market cap is lower than any time in 2018 and everyone is hodling and waiting for the storm to pass.  We knew we were facing an uphill battle when we started this project, and in the end we have to wrap it up a bit short of our goal — with over $5 million contributed, with a large number of small investors participating, and with putting both Avaí FC and SportyCo on the radar of several hundred news outlets all over the world — so a lot of good came from this project, even if the end result is not perfect.  What’s next? For crowdsale contributors: As the soft cap wasn’t reached, all funds contributed will be returned to the contributors. Information on the return process will be sent out to everyone in the next days.  For Avaí FC: Four more games before the end of the season Avaí FC is in a good position to fulfill their season goal – return to the top flight of Brazilian football! Fingers crossed!

And the rest is, as they say, history.  Today, with the cryptocurrency market bleeding and all hodlers in a crunch, revisiting November 2017 seems very distant. The SportyCo project origins began in spring 2017, with the founders putting their ideas and knowledge together and searching for a killer app to revolutionize the sports industry. But November 21 was the date when an idea slowly started to become reality.  In the three weeks of the crowdsale we have achieved a lot: soft cap reached in less than 24 hours, over $5 million contributed, mostly by small investors, and a long list of supporters and endorsers from the sports industry, including legends of their respective sports, like Roberto Carlos, Ronaldinho, Noriaki Kasai, Sava Milošević, and many others.  We also got a lot of traction among prominent crypto enthusiasts and supporters – especially after the ICO, when the idea became a business and our potential advisors have seen that the model is sound. Charlie Shrem, Phillip Nunn, Robby Schwertner and Kevin Harrington — with Kevin becoming an integral part of the SportyCo family — are just some of the names supporting our project.  Where are we a year later? We’ve had a lot of ups, with the platform, released in March, being one of the first projects in the crypto world presenting a working product. There were also some (but not many) downs, some of our own making, and some related to the general bleeding of value in the crypto world, scaring away potential newcomers and making existing cryptocurrency enthusiasts, well, a bit less enthusiastic, harming the adoption of all crypto-related products and requiring a rewrite of the platform to make it much more user friendly.  They say a typical startup needs 3-5 years from initial concept to a working, viable business. We’re in this for the long haul, and our journey has just begun.

I thought there will be a bunch of people who will be willing to invest in athletes, that they will buy SPF tokens just for this. But it seems like everybody just want to speculate. I may not be so different but at least I am not crying because of the prices. It's totally clear what SPF tokens are used to - to buy them and invest in athletes. Not to buy and sell later at a higher price. So those who want to help SPF token price to raise instead of crying, FUDing, demanding new exchanges, partnership... invest in athlete and encourage others to do so, talk about the opportunity we have - we can be first people to invest in the athlete. This is SPF's token utility.  SportyCo has done Chinese translations: https://news.sportyco.io/2018/06/06/sportyco-goes-to-china/ and as Tomer already wrote in Telegram, it's funny how Chinese doesn't comment on this. Not a single comment in a group from them... And 2 weeks ago they were so smart about all the things SportyCo would have to make. Telegram groups are bulls***, real investors don't have time to write there then we have these people who have too much free time and all they can do is criticise.",False

While the SportyCo community was enthusiastic about the platform launch, the acceptance of campaigns is not on the level we expected, even though we believe both campaigns currently running are solid in terms of business/career plans and potential return to participants.  We have identified – through analysis, community feedback, insight we got from our sports advisors, and info from participating clubs and athletes – two main points that we need to take into consideration on why this is so:  Current SPF holders are, with some exceptions (hats off to all of you 🙂 ) not interested in investing into campaigns – but in waiting for others to invest, which will, ideally, raise the token price on exchanges. While this is a completely legitimate action plan on behalf of holders, we have to address it somehow for the platform to succeed. But… the process of investing or donating is complicated – not due to the platform, but because the crypto ecosystem is not user friendly – yet. So getting new people on board is hard: they have to buy coins (i.e. ETH or BTC) with “old-world” money first, then convert it to SPF tokens (on a different exchange, nonetheless), and THEN they can invest into athletes. The majority of people interested to be small investors or supporters are not crypto-savvy – they don’t know how to do this, so they don’t participate. So what will be our next steps?  FIRST: We are currently upgrading our platform to make it easier for first-time investors to participate. This is not a simple task – all investments and potential returns are smart-contract based, and we have to put in several safeguards when including investors who don’t know what the term “smart contract” actually means, and processes which doesn’t involve automatic transactions. Our developers are in full swing, but will take us some time to set up and test properly. We expect to be done in a couple of months.  SECOND: When we have the necessary infrastructure in place to make contributions for less-crypto-savvy participants easier, we will be going much wider in recruiting people to our platform – both by promoting SportyCo as well as enabling athletes and clubs participating to go much wider in acquiring investors and supporters.

We are currently collaborating with the Faculty of Sport at the University of Ljubljana that carries out different measurements and tests to boost our results. Our intention is to prolong and deepen this collaboration because it has already shown huge positive outcomes in the quality of our training. We are therefore raising 610,000 SPF in exchange for 50% cut on future transfer fees of our players for a period of 5 years.  The club can collect fees in 4 ways:  - A player is sold to another Slovenian club: €5,000–10,000 fee - A player is sold to an international club: €10,000–30,000 fee - A player is drafted in the NBA: €1 million fee - A player is loaned to a larger club and Slovan gets 30–70% of that player’s future transfers – if the Slovan's ex-player is drafted to the NBA, Slovan could collect €500,000.  In the past 3 years, we’ve managed to collect €80,000 in transfer fees. Based on the existing track record and improvements, we believe we can collect between €150,000 and €300,000 in the next 5 years. These figures do not consider an NBA event. In this case, the number could increase dramatically.",False

Her thoughts more or less concern about costs for a young tennis player, are fully entitled. Here’s what she says.  Hello Tennis Experts!  I have a niece that is 14, she has been playing tennis for several years now and really seems to enjoy herself. She has been heavily involved a lot in tennis camps and tournaments for several years now. But recently in a conversation with her mother (my sister), she said it is time to cut their losses and will be pulling her out of competitive tennis this year. I have to admit I was a little surprised. When asked why because she always seemed to really be having a good time and seemed to be driven; she said it was costing too much money, time and overall effort for something that has turned into a recreational hobby. I didn’t pursue the issue too much afterward as I’m no expert, but it’s really bothered me as I’d always thought her path was to a university tennis team. Unsure if this was possible but she has talked about this often. Stopping mid-way through a sport just didn’t seem right (to me); considering all the time, effort and expenses already utilized. Later our mother informed me they had already spent about >$50,000 on training, tournaments, leagues, and camps since she was 8 years old! And they just didn’t want to spend another $50k for the next 4-5 years. She’ll still play tennis, but just on the local school team with no more camps, tournaments, clinics, etc.  I have to admit, I only played for about 7 years in junior and high school and only went to a few camps, so the expense never seemed to be a problem. But, I never thought that tennis in these development years cost so much!  Anyway, my question is, is this a realistic cost for junior development (as my sister is saying)? $5k-$7k per year from (roughly 8-10 years)? Or do kids develop in the schools teams (as I did)? Thanks.  SportyCo cannot promise directly for her niece that will support her, but in any case is this example typical for our unique platform for collaboration and contribution towards increasing sporting activities for young tennis players.   https://news.sportyco.io/2018/02/14/her-tennis-career-is-too-expensive-for-us/",False

To start off big: we are on track for the Q1 launch! In the last update, we were focused mostly on the user facing part of the platform. During the last month, we were however mostly working on the backend — the invisible part. So, while there’s not much new to show you, there’s a lot to tell.   Let’s go step by step:  The KYC process was upgraded and the user flow on the platform updated in line with the latest recommendations on how to do proper user vetting. The process is a bit streamlined, enabling us to validate more users in the same time frame.  The exchange between the platform and the blockchain was set up and is undergoing basic testing. We also defined which processes will run on the platform and which on the blockchain. We’ve added some additional security elements, going beyond what was planned to ensure both scammers and hackers will have a harder time. The donation module is done — frontend wise. When the backend is ready, we will start to test transactions.  Smart contracts and the DApps are defined, and the development team is currently hard at work to implement them, as this is THE biggest task before we do anything else. We are also thinking ahead — while the development team is working towards version 1.0 of the platform, the rest of us are already brainstorming on future upgrades and new features, and proposing some wacky ideas to make the whole experience more streamlined and more fun.  We’ll do regular updates on the development status of the platform every fortnight, so stay tuned!",False

The process is a bit streamlined, enabling us to validate more users in the same time frame. The exchange between the platform and the blockchain was set up and is undergoing basic testing. We also defined which processes will run on the platform and which on the blockchain. We’ve added some additional security elements, going beyond what was planned to ensure both scammers and hackers will have a harder time. The donation module is done — frontend wise. When the backend is ready, we will start to test transactions. Smart contracts and the DApps are defined, and the development team is currently hard at work to implement them, as this is THE biggest task before we do anything else. We are also thinking ahead — while the development team is working towards version 1.0 of the platform, the rest of us are already brainstorming on future upgrades and new features, and proposing some wacky ideas to make the whole experience more streamlined and more fun.  We’ll do regular updates on the development status of the platform every fortnight, so stay tuned!   + new big exchange  = SPF price rise to 5$ in short time   Nice progress team!  Wonderfull",False

We have, as probably everyone knows, secured an endorsement from one of the most recognizable faces in sports, Ronaldinho, just a couple of weeks ago. In the following weeks and months, we will build upon this by adding new endorsers and supporters, and by engaging existing ones more. As we are currently flooded on all channels with Santas and his Elfs, we have started conservatively and will add more and more as the launch of the platform comes closer. Our team will be present at several blockchain-related and sports-related events and conferences in the beginning of the next year, and we are planning some surprises also — stay tuned.  Launching the platform is a big milestone for us. We already have several launch partners for the platform and are securing more — so the platform will be alive, not just live, when it launches. Here we are not only focusing on recognizable names (although there are quite some in tow) but also on people who will make the platform thrive: managers, scouts, trainers, etc., who perhaps are not household names (except in professional circles), but are vital for the platform to be a success in the long term.  This is just a short (well, quite long for a blog post, actually) overview of everything that has been done. There are some minor details to wrap up: in the next days, we are moving into new offices (more on that when the boxes are gone and we make presentable pics), adding several people to our marketing team, and checking-off a lot of boring tasks that come with setting up a start-up company.  https://medium.com/sportyfi/crowdsale-aftermath-f35052c5fadb",False

He wanted to show 2 pretty big transactions (287 ETH and 600 ETH). I'm not confirming it was done by Barcelona players!

SportyFi is a decentralized sports investment & funding ecosystem. More on what that means is available on our website.  Who is in the SportyFi team? You can see our team, advisors and ambassadors on the website, complete with links to their LinkedIn profiles.  When did the SportyFi Token Crowdsale start? On November 21, 2017.  When will the SPF Token Crowdsale end? It will end when block no. 4,708,120 on the Ethereum blockchain is mined — we expect that to happen on December 9, 2017. More on why the date and time is not specific is available on our blog, and the countdown can always be checked on our website.  How do I participate in the Token Crowdsale? You participate on our website. We’ve also prepared a beginner’s guide for everyone with less experience in the crypto world.  What’s the price of a SPF token? The SPF token’s nominal price is $0.12. The ETH to SPF rate was set one day before the beginning of the crowdsale, at 2998 SPF for 1 ETH. Due to the fluctuations in ETH price during the crowdsale we’ve introduced an additional bonus for ALL presale and crowdsale participants.  I’m an athlete. How do I participate and find investors on the SportyFi platform? The alpha version of the SportyFi platform is currently undergoing internal testing. We plan to have a beta ready at the end of this year, with the platform launching to the public in Q1 2018. A roadmap is available on our website.  What happens with unsold tokens? All unsold tokens are burned.  Are the team and ambassador tokens locked? Team tokens are vested for a period of one year from the end of the crowdsale — meaning team members will hold their tokens for at least a year. Ambassador and advisor tokens are not vested.  I’ve sent ETH to your address. Where can I see my tokens? You can see them in your wallet. For the most commonly used, MyEtherWallet, we’ve prepared detailed instructions on how you can see your SPF token balance (just scroll down a bit after clicking the link).  Is there a bonus for participating in the SportyFi Token Crowdsale? Yes. You get a 10% bonus for contributing over 100 ETH (in one transaction). There’s also a bonus that will compensate for the Ethereum price fluctuations. More on the reasons for this is explained on our blog.  Is there a bounty campaign? There are several running and some are already finished. We recommend you check in with our team on Telegram.  When will I get my bounty or bonus tokens? Tokens for the 10% bonus (for contributions over 100 ETH) are sent to your account immediately, together with your contributor tokens. Tokens from the additional ETH price fluctuation bonus and from bounties will be distributed within 10 days after the end of the SPF Token Crowdsale.  When will you be listed at an exchange and on which one? We plan to have the SPF token listed on exchanges in the days after the end of the SPF Token Crowdsale. We will disclose our partner exchanges when the deals are finalized (after the crowdsale).  When can I move SPF Tokens to another wallet? The tokens are locked till the end of the crowdsale. You will be able to move them immediately after the crowdsale ends.",False

Here is top7 reasons why to invest: 1. SportyFi is the first to combine Crypto world and sports, while solving real life issues of the majority of young athletes. As being first we will be the market benchmark for this industry. We are sure other teams will follow and copy SportyFi's idea and vision. But they will still only be following SportyFi. 2. The core team behind SportyFi is transparent and most importantly has a good track record. The team established a company running the platform for gym live-streaming onlinegym4me.com and convinced world famous tennis superstar Ana Ivanovic (ranked No. 1 in the world in 2008) to join as co-owner and got a substantial investment from the worlds leading gym equipment manufacturer TechnoGym (who joined as strategic investor). So, the core team has a very good track record, which shows its business capabilities. 3. SportyFi has one of the best (worldwide) blockchain development teams - the company Netis (netis.si) - blockchain technologies, which shows that the investors funds will be secured and that the smart-contract will execute as it should. 4. The acceptance of the idea in the sporty community was tremendous. This shows that the niche market SportyFi is attacking needs SportyFi. The ""services"" of SportyFi will thus be utilized. Increasing utilization of SportyFi's services will lead to the  increased demand for SportyFi's services and at the same time for SPF Token (as only with the SPF token the use of the services will be possible). The worldwide acceptance of the project by sports community is proven by the public support by Roberto Carlos, Noriaki Kasai, Primoz Brezec, Savo Milosevic, Slovenian Basketball Association, no name just a few. 5. SPF Token is clear utility token of value. Without SPF Token there would be no SportyFi ecosystem and vice versa. The SPF smart contract will contain a gateway which will enable further development of smart contracts between athletes and investors thus rounding up the entire ecosystem. Furthermore, only SPF tokenholders will be permitted to attend DAO voting within the SportyFi Professional Fund. 6. One can ask why do you need blockchain to do this - and here is the answer: as Vitalik said in his interview with Naval Ravikant (at TechCrunch), one of the best applications of Ethereum platform is exactly in crowdfunding (you can watch the entire interview titled Decentralizing Everything here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CBrVXjDNBU, while the relevant part is somewhere from minute 8 onward); Ethereum platform (SportyFi ecosystem will be built on top of it) is thus perfect for SportyFi - enabling long distance smart contract execution between numerous participants in a transparent way. 7. What is written in the WhitePaper is not the end of the road but just the beginning. Already at this point we are constantly developing new ideas and making strategies how the new ideas can be introduced within the ecosystem (e.g. secondary market for investment smart contracts into athletes (or portion of right deriving from them), short term funding of an athlete to cover his travel costs and accommodation costs just for particular game or match, where the prize money will be known in advance, and similar). Please note that we will newer stop developing and here we are coming back to point No. 1 above - we will never stop brainstorming and developing to retain the No. 1 position worldwide, which we are getting now.

How to add SPF Tokens to MyEtherWallet (MEW) Most of our contributors use MEW to contribute to the campaign. As the SPF Token is the new kid on the block, it’s not set up automatically in your wallet — yet. You can always check the SPF Token transaction when you receive the tokens on the Ethereum Block Explorer, but most (us included) prefer to see the SPF Tokens, as we are all used to, in the wallet balance. So how do you do that? Go to MyEtherWalet and choose the »Add Custom Token« button. In the field “Token Contract Address” enter: 0x85089389c14bd9c77fc2b8f0c3d1dc3363bf06ef In the field “Token Symbol” enter: SPF In the field “Decimals” enter: 18 Click on the “Save” button and that’s it! The SPF Token balance should be shown in your MEW wallet, along with any other tokens and coins you have in the wallet.",False

SportyFi Alpha version — ready for internal testing SportyFi was always about developing a platform. And we are developing the platform as we speak. So how far along are we?  Setting up a crowdsourcing investment platform is not a trivial task — so it’s a good thing that the development team, lead by Blaz, has quite the track record in developing platforms used by a massive amount of users. The SportyFi platform, in its current state, is now available for internal testing — both for our quality assurance team as well as for our advisors and ambassadors. As there are many features still missing, we can’t call it a beta — but we are comfortable calling it a “strong alpha”.  So… what is already done? Athletes, clubs and organizations can already create a profile and create crowdsourcing campaigns. The cornerstone when creating the profile is the KYC check, which is fully implemented and functional. We consider this function as the crucial part for the security of the investors.  Investors and supporters can also create a profile, and the KYC system is in place for investors and supporters as well, to ensure the integrity of the platform on both the investor as well as the athlete/club’s end of the platform.  A comprehensive profile page is already set up, so everyone participating can set up a proper presentations of herself and himself. But, the more important part: what still needs to be done?  The blockchain integration is not set up yet. The SportyFi smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain is set up and will be deployed for the token crowdsale. After the distribution of the SPF Tokens to Contributors, we will integrate the SPF Token ecosystem into the platform.  All texts on the website will of course be updated, by us and by the participants in the SportyFi ecosystem. The texts currently used are temporary and are set up just for the sake of testing. We are heavily relying on lorem ipsum at the moment — this will of course not be the case at the launch of the platform.  Updates and improvements to all existing elements will be implemented. As we add additional elements to the platform, we will have to update existing systems to ensure a smooth operation and a consistent experience on the SportyFi platform.  And what is the timeline from now on? The current platform is a good tool for internal testing and further evolution of the platform. We know many of you are eager to test the platform: we are working towards making it public. By the end of the year, a closed beta of the platform will be ready — and then, we will invite a sizeable part of the SportyFi community to participate in the testing. And the most important part, we are on track for a Q1 2018 launch of the final version of the SportyFi platform.",False

We are sure other teams will follow and copy SportyFi's idea and vision. But they will still only be following SportyFi.  2. The core team behind SportyFi is transparent and most importantly has a good track record. The team established a company running the platform for gym live-streaming onlinegym4me.com and convinced world famous tennis superstar Ana Ivanovic (ranked No. 1 in the world in 2008) to join as co-owner and got a substantial investment from the worlds leading gym equipment manufacturer TechnoGym (who joined as strategic investor). So, the core team has a very good track record, which shows its business capabilities.  3. SportyFi has one of the best (worldwide) blockchain development teams - the company Netis (netis.si) - blockchain technologies, which shows that the investors funds will be secured and that the smart-contract will execute as it should.  4. The acceptance of the idea in the sporty community was tremendous. This shows that the niche market SportyFi is attacking needs SportyFi. The ""services"" of SportyFi will thus be utilized. Increasing utilization of SportyFi's services will lead to the  increased demand for SportyFi's services and at the same time for SPF Token (as only with the SPF token the use of the services will be possible). The worldwide acceptance of the project by sports community is proven by the public support by Roberto Carlos, Noriaki Kasai, Primoz Brezec, Savo Milosevic, Slovenian Basketball Association, no name just a few.  5. SPF Token is clear utility token of value. Without SPF Token there would be no SportyFi ecosystem and vice versa. The SPF smart contract will contain a gateway which will enable further development of smart contracts between athletes and investors thus rounding up the entire ecosystem. Furthermore, only SPF tokenholders will be permitted to attend DAO voting within the SportyFi Professional Fund.  6. One can ask why do you need blockchain to do this - and here is the answer: as Vitalik said in his interview with Naval Ravikant (at TechCrunch), one of the best applications of Ethereum platform is exactly in crowdfunding (you can watch the entire interview titled Decentralizing Everything here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CBrVXjDNBU, while the relevant part is somewhere from minute 8 onward); Ethereum platform (SportyFi ecosystem will be built on top of it) is thus perfect for SportyFi - enabling long distance smart contract execution between numerous participants in a transparent way.  7. What is written in the WhitePaper is not the end of the road but just the beginning. Already at this point we are constantly developing new ideas and making strategies how the new ideas can be introduced within the ecosystem (e.g. secondary market for investment smart contracts into athletes (or portion of right deriving from them), short term funding of an athlete to cover his travel costs and accommodation costs just for particular game or match, where the prize money will be known in advance, and similar). Please note that we will newer stop developing and here we are coming back to point No. 1 above - we will never stop brainstorming and developing to retain the No. 1 position worldwide, which we are getting now.",False

Read read read and take care    1. NEVER SHARE YOUR WALLET’S PRIVATE KEY WITH ANYONE. If someone is asking for your private key, they are trying to steal from you. Don’t save the key in a file online. Don’t make screenshots and send it around. Don’t leave it in a “privatekey.txt” on your computer. Save it offline — on paper — and store it in a safe place. Or, even better, use a hardware wallet. Also, be careful when pasting your wallet address around. We’ve seen cases where people unintentionally sent the wrong info — the key instead of the address. Your address is ok to use publicly (and you have to share it in order to receive coins and tokens), your private key is not.  2. NEVER PARTICIPATE IN TOKEN CROWDSALES AND ICOS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY INTERMEDIARIES. If someone is giving you “an alternative way to participate”, offering to take care of things for you — don’t trust them. Learn the basics, or ask a friend you trust to help you (don’t share the wallet private key with him), but don’t trust intermediaries, so called agencies and other third persons. The website of the project will always have detailed instructions on how to participate — if it doesn’t, you should reconsider investing in it anyway.  3. DON’T SEND YOUR COINS AND TOKENS TO “RANDOM” ADDRESSES. There will be scammers trying to give you the “official” address of a project, perhaps even pretending to be a member of the team, or admin of an official channel. Don’t use the info they give you. The address to participate in the SportyFi Token Crowdsale will be published on the website and only on the website! Any other address you receive to participate should be ignored.  4. DON’T TRUST RANDOM “EXPERTS” GIVING YOU A PROFILE ON PROJECTS. People will try to hype-up a project with random out-of-context information. People will also try to discourage you to participate in a token crowdsale, with dubious claims, and even incite you to switch to another project. Don’t just take them for their word. Do your own research and ask people you trust.",False

After that price will come back close to ico and then slowly grow if the project is successful. Looking at it this way I have all the time in the world.

And we are developing the platform as we speak. So how far along are we? Setting up a crowdsourcing investment platform is not a trivial task — so it’s a good thing that the development team, lead by Blaz, has quite a track record in developing platforms used by a massive amount of users. The SportyFi platform, in its current state, is now available for internal testing — both for our quality assurance team as well as for our advisors and ambassadors. As there are many features still missing, we can’t call it a beta — but we are comfortable calling it a “strong alpha”.  So… what is already done? Athletes, clubs and organizations can already create a profile and create crowdsourcing campaigns. The cornerstone when creating the profile is the KYC check, which is fully implemented and functional. We consider this function as the crucial part for the security of the investors.  Investors and supporters can also create a profile, and the KYC system is in place for investors and supporters as well, to ensure the integrity of the platform on both the investor as well as the athlete/club’s end of the platform.  A comprehensive profile page is already set up, so everyone participating can set up a proper presentations of herself and himself. But, the more important part: what still needs to be done?  The blockchain integration is not set up yet. The SportyFi smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain is set up and will be deployed for the token crowdsale. After the distribution of the SPF Tokens to Contributors, we will integrate the SPF Token ecosystem into the platform.  All texts on the website will of course be updated, by us and by the participants in the SportyFi ecosystem. The texts currently used are temporary and are set up just for the sake of testing. We are heavily relying on lorem ipsum at the moment — this will of course not be the case at the launch of the platform.  Updates and improvements to all existing elements will be implemented. As we add additional elements to the platform, we will have to update existing systems to ensure a smooth operation and a consistent experience on the SportyFi platform.  And what is the timeline from now on? The current platform is a good tool for internal testing and further evolution of the platform. We know many of you are eager to test the platform: we are working towards making it public. By the end of the year, a closed beta of the platform will be ready — and then, we will invite a sizeable part of the SportyFi community to participate in the testing. And the most important part, we are on track for a Q1 2018 launch of the final version of the SportyFi platform.

I get some facts for investing into SportyFi ICO - only 3 days left to start  - check timer at http://www.sportyfi.io   1. SportyFi is the first to combine Crypto world and sports, while solving real life issues of the majority of young athletes. As being first we will be the market benchmark for this industry. We are sure other teams will follow and copy SportyFi's idea and vision. But they will still only be following SportyFi.  2. The core team behind SportyFi is transparent and most importantly has a good track record. The team established a company running the platform for gym live-streaming onlinegym4me.com and convinced world famous tennis superstar Ana Ivanovic (ranked No. 1 in the world in 2008) to join as co-owner and got a substantial investment from the worlds leading gym equipment manufacturer TechnoGym (who joined as strategic investor). So, the core team has a very good track record, which shows its business capabilities.  3. SportyFi has one of the best (worldwide) blockchain development teams - the company Netis (netis.si) - blockchain technologies, which shows that the investors funds will be secured and that the smart-contract will execute as it should.  4. The acceptance of the idea in the sporty community was tremendous. This shows that the niche market SportyFi is attacking needs SportyFi. The ""services"" of SportyFi will thus be utilized. Increasing utilization of SportyFi's services will lead to the  increased demand for SportyFi's services and at the same time for SPF Token (as only with the SPF token the use of the services will be possible). The worldwide acceptance of the project by sports community is proven by the public support by Roberto Carlos, Noriaki Kasai, Primoz Brezec, Savo Milosevic, Slovenian Basketball Association, no name just a few.  5. SPF Token is clear utility token of value. Without SPF Token there would be no SportyFi ecosystem and vice versa. The SPF smart contract will contain a gateway which will enable further development of smart contracts between athletes and investors thus rounding up the entire ecosystem. Furthermore, only SPF tokenholders will be permitted to attend DAO voting within the SportyFi Professional Fund.  6. One can ask why do you need blockchain to do this - and here is the answer: as Vitalik said in his interview with Naval Ravikant (at TechCrunch), one of the best applications of Ethereum platform is exactly in crowdfunding (you can watch the entire interview titled Decentralizing Everything here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CBrVXjDNBU, while the relevant part is somewhere from minute 8 onward); Ethereum platform (SportyFi ecosystem will be built on top of it) is thus perfect for SportyFi - enabling long distance smart contract execution between numerous participants in a transparent way.  7. What is written in the WhitePaper is not the end of the road but just the beginning. Already at this point we are constantly developing new ideas and making strategies how the new ideas can be introduced within the ecosystem (e.g. secondary market for investment smart contracts into athletes (or portion of right deriving from them), short term funding of an athlete to cover his travel costs and accommodation costs just for particular game or match, where the prize money will be known in advance, and similar). Please note that we will newer stop developing and here we are coming back to point No. 1 above - we will never stop brainstorming and developing to retain the No. 1 position worldwide, which we are getting now.",False

But to alleviate any doubts, our SPF tokens will be vested for a period of one year.  We’ve started the SportyFi project almost a year ago: first by developing the idea, then by checking its legal framework and in the last two months by working relentlessly on the Token Crowdsale, coming up on November 21. We do, however, know, that the real work does not end with a successful crowdsale — it’s when our work really begins.  There was always an agreement in the team that we will hold our tokens for an extended period of time, and when that time comes, we will re-invest them into the platform, not transfer them to an exchange and cash out. And while our verbal commitments were never doubted, we’ve decided to go one step further and put this in writing.  The founders and the team will therefore commit to holding their tokens for a period of at least a year after the successful completion of the Token Crowdsale. We believe in this project more than anyone and, come one year around, we will have set up a lively platform, that will make the life of prospective athletes easier and the sports industry more open to small investors.  No such limits will, of course, be placed on the participants in our Token Crowdsale. We’re working hard on setting up a trading ecosystem and are in talks with several prominent exchanges to list the SPF Token as soon as possible, and, of course, we’re also on track for a Q1 2018 launch of the SportyFi platform.

While football has several thousand pro events (i.e. matches) in Europe  alone every weekend.  Same for baseball - why is it so high? Expensive TV rights, but also... a lot of events. There are 162 games per season for each MLB team. A few high profile boxing events a year don't come close in turnover to a steady presence every couple of days, with full stadiums, billion dollar TV rights contracts and millions of players being professionals - as opposed to several 100 in pro boxing or golf.  We were actually a bit surprised that football (the European kind) is so much ahead in turnover compared to the second biggest sport (i mean, almost half of all money in sports is football). But when you go deeper, you see that it's actually surprising that i.e. golf is so high.",False

Box is a small sport - a few big earners (they are, however, really big), a few big events - and that is it. Many other sports have thousands of big earners, thousands of events. That's why boxing doesn't come close to the big ones. Floyd earns as much as a top fotballer - but he is one athlete, and there are several hundreds of top footballers.  If there were big boxing matches every week, the story would be different. But a good UEFA Champions League week brings more money into the sports industry as the biggest boxing event of the year. You can't look at one athlete and say ""that's a big sport"". You have to look at the whole ecosystem, and the boxing ecosystem is, in terms of revenue, a dwarf compared to the big leagues.",False

SportyFi Token Crowdsale moved to November 21 due to the Segwit2x fork After a careful consideration and after discussing this subject with some of the leading figures of the cryptocurrency community we have decided to move the SportyFi Token Crowdsale for a short period to November 21.  The Segwit2x Bitcoin fork is currently the big bad wolf of the crypto community. It’s different from the Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold forks, and will have a more profound impact on the future of Bitcoin, and consequently, on the future of the whole cryptocurrency market.  Several big exchanges and services have already announced that they will suspend trading for a certain period before, during and after the fork, expected to happen most probably on Nov 16 (change will be enacted at block number 494,784). During this time, the whole cryptocurrency ecosystem will be extremely volatile.   As the original date of out Token Crowdsale was November 14, right before the Segwit2x fork, this would put a lot of potential investors in a disadvantaged position — due to exchanges and services not working and transactions being processed slower right when we begin with the Crowdsale. Therefore, we decided to move the date for a short period of 7 days, when the ecosystem will balance itself out after the fork-related fluctuations, giving everyone a fair and equal opportunity to participate in our Token Crowdsale.  “SportyFi is an exciting project with high investor demand. We always want to make the first step in protecting and making our potential token holders happy without leaving anyone out. In that respect, because of the potential Bitcoin fork on or around November 16th, we’ve decided to postpone the SportyFi Token Crowdsale until November 21th. This will allow everyone to participate when all chains are stable again.”  Charlie Shrem As of the rest of the tasks on our calendar — we’re on track on all fronts. The alpha version of the SportyFi platform is coming along nicely and will be ready before the Token Crowdsale, and we have several more aces up our sleeves we can’t wait to show you.

We are talking with the sports community constantly and the response is great and everybody is waiting for the platform to be up and running and fully functional. If you check our webpage (www.sportyfi.io) you will see that already now we are supported by many great athletes (our Sports Advisers are great current and ex athletes, Olympic Medalists, NBA player). On social channels we have been publicly supported by many great athletes, such as: Pter Prevc, Robert Kranjec, Jernej Damjan, Jakov Fak). Our main ambassador is FIFA World Cup Winner and UEFA Champions Leauge winner Robero Carlos. We have partnered up with the Slovenian Basketball Association (the  home association of the Slovenian basketball team, as the last European Champions).  Currently we are in the final phase of negotiations with a worldwide foundation (established by one of the greatest tennis players ever), who will be our launch partner for the platform (will reveal that soon - first through our Telegram Group https://t.me/sportyfi_official).  So, as to the response from the sports world - all of the above and much more proves that it is great.  The SPF token is a utility token of value. The token will be an entry ticket into the sports financing through SportyFi Platform. The real value ill be generated once the platform will be up and running and the value will increase with development and growth of the SportyFi ecosystem. This should be a good incentive to hold the SPF Tokens.",False

You are betting whose athlete or player that are going to win in order to receive profits. More like a gamble thing.  Where SportyFi is a crowd source campaign which mission is to support athletes that has potential in the future but doesn't have enough financial capability to move further towards success.  It's more like a donation program (as per my understanding) w/ a mix of investment. Think of the athlete that you support like a STOCK/SHARES which will eventually grow or mature as he/she moves to the PRO ranks.  Not only you'll help athletes but you also receive rewards from your investment in return. It's a win-win situation in a long-term standpoint.",False

The Smart Manager Platform (the “Platform”) is a blockchain-based sports investment platform, acting as an intermediary connecting those with an active need for funding with contributing crowds on a micro level. The Smart Manager Platform can be used by anyone connected with sport, whether an athlete, a team, a club or any other sports organization.  The Platform will have two main modules: a cryptocurrency-based donations platform (Donations Module), and a cryptocurrency financial reward-based platform (Investment Module). The Donations Module will offer athletes a blockchain-based donations platform where they are able to raise funds by creating profiles, listing their current achievements and plans for the future, and their specific crowdfunding goals. For example: an athlete or a club can turn to their fans and supporters for donations, enabling them to continue with training and competing.  The second module of the SportyFi Smart Manager Platform, the Investment Module, will enable detailed sponsorship smart contracts of various types, and most importantly, complex investment smart contracts, where an athlete, club or other sports organization can offer a long-term deal to financiers by committing a share of their future income or other revenue stream in exchange for an upfront investment.

He has three Olympic medals and 17 wins in the FIS Ski Jumping World Cup); - Savo Milosevic (Vice president of Football Association of Serbia.

Here is top7 reasons why to invest: 1. SportyFi is the first to combine Crypto world and sports, while solving real life issues of the majority of young athletes. As being first we will be the market benchmark for this industry. We are sure other teams will follow and copy SportyFi's idea and vision. But they will still only be following SportyFi. 2. The core team behind SportyFi is transparent and most importantly has a good track record. The team established a company running the platform for gym live-streaming onlinegym4me.com and convinced world famous tennis superstar Ana Ivanovic (ranked No. 1 in the world in 2008) to join as co-owner and got a substantial investment from the worlds leading gym equipment manufacturer TechnoGym (who joined as strategic investor). So, the core team has a very good track record, which shows its business capabilities. 3. SportyFi has one of the best (worldwide) blockchain development teams - the company Netis (netis.si) - blockchain technologies, which shows that the investors funds will be secured and that the smart-contract will execute as it should. 4. The acceptance of the idea in the sporty community was tremendous. This shows that the niche market SportyFi is attacking needs SportyFi. The ""services"" of SportyFi will thus be utilized. Increasing utilization of SportyFi's services will lead to the  increased demand for SportyFi's services and at the same time for SPF Token (as only with the SPF token the use of the services will be possible). The worldwide acceptance of the project by sports community is proven by the public support by Roberto Carlos, Noriaki Kasai, Primoz Brezec, Savo Milosevic, Slovenian Basketball Association, no name just a few. 5. SPF Token is clear utility token of value. Without SPF Token there would be no SportyFi ecosystem and vice versa. The SPF smart contract will contain a gateway which will enable further development of smart contracts between athletes and investors thus rounding up the entire ecosystem. Furthermore, only SPF tokenholders will be permitted to attend DAO voting within the SportyFi Professional Fund. 6. One can ask why do you need blockchain to do this - and here is the answer: as Vitalik said in his interview with Naval Ravikant (at TechCrunch), one of the best applications of Ethereum platform is exactly in crowdfunding (you can watch the entire interview titled Decentralizing Everything here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CBrVXjDNBU, while the relevant part is somewhere from minute 8 onward); Ethereum platform (SportyFi ecosystem will be built on top of it) is thus perfect for SportyFi - enabling long distance smart contract execution between numerous participants in a transparent way. 7. What is written in the WhitePaper is not the end of the road but just the beginning. Already at this point we are constantly developing new ideas and making strategies how the new ideas can be introduced within the ecosystem (e.g. secondary market for investment smart contracts into athletes (or portion of right deriving from them), short term funding of an athlete to cover his travel costs and accommodation costs just for particular game or match, where the prize money will be known in advance, and similar). Please note that we will newer stop developing and here we are coming back to point No. 1 above - we will never stop brainstorming and developing to retain the No. 1 position worldwide, which we are getting now.",False

Very glad that you like our project!  As to your questions: Ad1) 5% of tokens are teserved as incentives for future important partnerships. We intend to become no.1 sports financing platform and we intend to do it very quckly. We are of the opinion that a business partner is always more focused and goal oriented if it gets a portion of the ecosystem. We already have two partnerships with well renewed associations/foundations - will reveal them soon  Ad2) You are fully correct as to the functioning of the Smart Manager Platform. The conjunction between an investor and an athlete will be a smart contract signed over our platform. So, the answer to your wuestion is: yes, there will be a contract signed - a smart one  As to the SportyFi Professional Fund: all funds invested during the Crowdsale over USD 9 million will be alocated to the Fund. The “backoffice” of SportyFi will search for perspective athletes, prepare files and info for the Advisory Board, where the selection proces will be done on a professional level. If the professional Advisory Board will evaluate that an athlete is a perspective one, the board will propose such an athlete to go to a DAO  voting. So the final say whether an investment into a particular athlete shoul happen, will be in the hands of SPF tokenholders. 70% of the profit generated by the fund will be reinvested by purchasing SPF tokens on market and reinvesting them into future perspective athletes.  Hope this clarifies your questions   Simon",False

Within the Smart Maneger Module the token usage will be as follows: »» Investments within the Investment Module will strictly be limited to SPF Token (SPF Tokens will thus be the only available currency for making investments, representing the “entry ticket” into the world of individual-based sports investment); »» To purchase support from SportyFi in relation to investment campaign strategy and networking (this means that SportyFi will offer additional professional advisory services, while basic consulting and guiding will be free of charge for the ones opening a profile and accepting donations); »» To purchase special features, such as the “Featured section” or the “Hot pick” and similar, which will bring additional attention to the ones making investment campaigns.  Within the Donations Module the token usage will be as follows: »» to make donations (to athletes, sports organizations, clubs and similar); »» to purchase support from SportyFi in relation to profile management and campaign strategy (this means that SportyFi will offer additional professional advisory services, while basic consulting and guiding will be free of charge for the ones opening a profile and accepting donations); »» to purchase special features, such as the “Featured section” or “Hot pick” and similar features, which will bring additional attention to the ones making donations campaigns.  This is the current basic ""token usage"" scheme, while during the detailed platform development phase additional token usage schemes will be added (we already have certain ideas how to develop current basic ""token usage"" scheme even further, e.g. implementation of secondary market, where SPF Token will play the crucial role, and similar).",False

Current financing in sport is not transparent at all. Top 10 (or maybe 15) biggest sports agencies control the good majority of the market. While we believe that the major advantage of SportyFi is not so much in full transparency (while SportyFi platform will be fully transparent as it will run on open sourced platform of Ethereum, this might not be the biggest added value at all), but in the ability to interconnect athletes, clubs and other sports organizations on one side, with fans and other sport enthusiasts (small investor). It will be the first crowd-micro financing platform in sports and thus constituting a completely new sub-industry.  As Vitalik said in his interview with Naval Ravikant (at TechCrunch), one of the best applications of Ethereum platform is exactly in crowdfunding (you can watch the entire interview titled Decentralizing Everything here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CBrVXjDNBU, while the relevant part is somewhere from minute 8 onward).  Current financing in sports (from an athlete's perspective) works somehow like this: (i) you have to be extremely talented, (ii) you (or your parents) need to know the right people and (iii) you need to have a tremendous amount of luck. Having just item (i) above, is almost never enough. While talent should be the only important measure, it almost never is. Which is why many talented athletes have to cancel their careers due to luck of funding.  Current financing in sports (from fan's or small investor's perspective) works somehow like this: you cannot participate.  SportyFi will create a platform where the above participants (e.g. athletes on one side and small investors on the other) will be able to ""meet"". Naturally, also athletes campaigning on the SportyFi platform will have to convince their future ""investors"" with their talent, while SportyFi will completely eliminate item (ii) above (regardless of who you know, you will be able to participate on SportyFi platform), while item (iii) will surely still be present (as in any matter in life, but surely it will be less important).  What is also important to mention in regard to SportyFi Platform (transparency-wise) is that the options that are currently available (and that will be available in the future with the development of blockchain technology) are limitless, e.g. the funds raised by an athlete can be put on escrow and released in tranches, while investors might perform a DAO voting whether an athlete adequately  performed in the previous period, while the next tranche will be released only in case the investors will confirm the release (otherwise, in case of under-performance of an athlete, the funds will be returned to the investors, etc).  To sum up, SportyFi will: - be a fully transparent ecosystem, run on Ethereum open source platform, with clear rules and everybody will be able to check how the funds are raised, how much each athlete (club,...) raised, while it will also be possible to monitor how the funds are being spent; and - introduce a completely new crowd micro-financing sub-industry, which was not possible and available before the advent of blockchain.",False

As we spoke with them they immediately saw that the partnership will be mutually beneficial. While SportyFi platform will be beneficial for the Slovenian Basketball Association in the sense that it will potentially increase the pool of professional athletes - basketball players (as more athletes will have the required funding and more of them can thus become a pro player). Namely, even training basketball costs a lot of money (equipment, travel money, accommodation abroad, camps, etc) and also in basketball, many players finish their career prematurely due to lack of funding. On the other hand, the Association will be able to offer valuable advice to SportyFi when it comes to the Smart Manager Platform and to the SportyFi Professional Fund. So, based on mutual benefits we can offer each other, we entered into a long term partnership.",False

SportyCo is a decentralized sports investment & funding ecosystem. We will introduce a brand new industry of sports crowd micro-financing while providing athletes, clubs and sports organizations with macro-funding on their respective end.    Why?  Professional sport today has a high entry barrier - both for athletes as well as for small investors. SportyCo will remove these barriers and consequently change financing in the sports industry by deploying a blockchain-based financing platform. We will serve athletes, clubs and other sports organizations in raising the funds required to achieve athletic success by enabling a wider community to invest in sport, therefore disrupting the existing model for financing participants in this industry.    SportyCo Smart Manager Platform  SportyCo‘s Smart Manager Platform will enable donations, detailed sponsorship smart contracts of various types, as well as complex investment smart contracts, where an athlete, a club or any other sports organization will offer a long-term deal for a share of their future income or other revenue streams in exchange for an upfront investment. An alpha version of the platform was available before the token crowdsale.  First investment campaigns are live:  https://sportyco.net/. Blog post with some more info.    SPF Token  SPF token is ERC 20 token. ERC20 defines a set of rules which need to be met in order for a token to be accepted and called as 'ERC20 Token'. The standard rules apply to all ERC20 Tokens since these rules are required to interact with each other on the Ethereum network. These tokens are blockchain assets that have value and can be sent and received, like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrency. The SPF token will be the primary means of transactions on our platform. It will be used both for investing in athletes (and crowdsourcing donations) as well as other transactions on the platform—which includes paid advertising, paid reach and other premium services offered. The SPF token will be listed on several exchanges to integrate it into the wider crypto ecosystem.  The SportyCo (SPF) Token Crowdsale started on November 21. (ETH block: 4.595.138) and ended on December 10 (ETH block: 4.780.120). Crowdsale address  - Bonus in the presale and in the first 72 hours of crowdsale was 10%. Afterward a 10% bonus applied only for contributions over 100 ETH.  - Additional bonus due to ETH price fluctuation was introduced for all participants of the crowdsale.  - Final rate ETH/SPF = 3704 (+ 10% bonus, if applied)  - The total number of ETH raised was 11,540.  - Unsold SPF Tokens - 129,326,547.02 SPF (up to 200 mil) have been burned.  - Total SPF Token supply is 70,673,453.98.  - 18% of all SPF Tokens, allocated for founders and team are locked for a period of one year.  - The circulating supply is therefore 50,466,991 SPF Tokens.  SportyCo Token Crowdsale Funds Allocation:    Since we didn't collect more than $9 mil Professional fund won't start! We collected a bit over $5 mil - ETH price at that time was $441,64.  Up to USD 9 million contributed will represent SportyCo's operating capital. The funds will be used for the development and full deployment of the Smart Manager Platform, its optimization, growth, marketing and monetization phase.        Team  Our team combines experts in sports platforms, professional athletes, scouts and trainers, communications and marketing experts, and a strong development team with over a decade of experience in setting up enterprise platforms. We also have a legal & compliance team in place to support both investors and athletes.  We've also partnered with Spartan Solutions a company, specialized in developing partial or full ecosystem for supporting blockchain based Cryptocurrencies. Blog post with more info  Among our ambassadors are several global superstars in their respective sports and also well-known names in blockchain space:  - Roberto Carlos - Ronaldinho Gaúcho - Luís Figo - Charlie Shrem - Phillip Nunn - Robby Schwertner aka CryptoRobby  And many more!
