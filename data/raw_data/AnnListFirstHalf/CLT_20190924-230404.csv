It was the Big one! 1100+ blockchain leaders, including 350+ entrepreneurs, 250+ investors and dozens of visionaries as stated by the organizer. Great job, #Latoken, absolutely top notch!  According to The Economist Intelligence Unit, Singapore heads Business Environment Rankings. It‚Äôs no wonder that foreign companies choose this city for Asian branch or even for new business activities. We looked forward to meeting many new people and got in the right place!  CoinLoan‚Äôs stand has been visited by more than 1000 people. Among them there were potential platform participants, contributors, and business partners.  We were glad to meet one of our contributors from Singapore. That was awesome, we learned more about Singapore and discussed investment prospectives. Finally, CoinLoan found not only funding, but also a long-term partnership.  Max Sapelov had an interview about the project with a Korean crypto blogger.  Mike Rozhko pitched CoinLoan from the stage and presented the progress achieved during the ICO. As a result, we had some fruitful conversations with potential contributors and platform users. We have even received a proposal to buy CoinLoan in its entirety. Sorry, we are not for sale üòÑ  It was worth to go. Our Team enjoyed meeting so many people from so many different places.

We will try to obtain a license in other countries (including those in Asia) depending on the amount of the raised funds. 2.

The minimal amount of the loan on the platform is $50 (also expressed in other currencies). This allows providing microloans. The maximum amount is not limited. 4. All applications for providing and borrowing loans will be processed automatically and immediately. 5. CoinLoan Tokens (CLT) will be used for paying the fees on the platform for receiving and borrowing loans. They form an integral part of the system which provides the high demand for them at the market.  6. The borrowers will be able to evaluate the risks related to the cryptoasset volatility and set the LTV (Loan-to-value ratio) at their sole discretion (from 10 to 70%). 7. Loans can be provided or borrowed in many fiat currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, CNY, JPY, RUB, CHF). This list will be extended as the platform is developed. 8. Various cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, Dash, Monero, ZCash) can be used as a collateral. This list will also be extended. We'll try to cover all popular cryptocurrencies with a high capitalization rate. 9. We will focus on convenient and fast methods of depositing/withdrawing fiat funds on the platform with a minimal fee.

We don't prohibit placing our tokens at the exchange, in fact, when ICO ends we'll try list the tokens on the largest cryptoexchanges. 11. Also, we'll try to provide the most profitable fees and lending conditions on the market. 12.

First, let‚Äôs look at the lenders. They will be charged 10% of their income (i.e. accrued interests). Here‚Äôs an example: let‚Äôs assume that the lender has provided a $10,000 loan at 15% and gained $1,500 as interest. These $1,500 will be charged a 10% platform fee, i.e. $150 (a low fee for the full safety of funds). Lenders will be able to choose how to pay this fee. They can pay $150 in fiat or 15 CLT, where 1 CLT = $10. As explained earlier,  1 CLT >= $10, therefore, it will more profitable for lenders to pay the platform fee in tokens. Note: The fee will be 10 times lower for Pre-ICO participants who have bought tokens at $1.  Let‚Äôs now look at borrower‚Äôs side. Borrowers will have to pay a fee in CLT. Unlike lenders, they cannot choose to pay in fiat. This fee will depend on the loan amount and determine by the following formula: 1 CLT for $10,000 (i.e. 10 CLT for $100K loan and 0.1 CLT for $1,000 loan, etc.).",False

Repay the entire loan amount of 70,000 USD + % and get 25 BTC back. 2. Replenish the collateral with the cryptoasset in the amount of 6.125 BTC to restore the ratio of the loan amount and the value of the collateral (LTV) to 70%. 3. Repay part of the loan in the amount of 14,000 USD to reduce the loan principal and restore the ratio of the loan amount and the value of the collateral (LTV) to 70%. 4. Repay the loan in full through selling part of the collateral. In this case, the system will sell about 22 BTC, and the balance of 3 BTC will be available for withdrawal. 5. Do nothing. If the collateral value drops to 75% (the BTC rate drops to 3,000 USD), then part of the collateral required for restoring the 70% ratio will be automatically liquidated, and the loan amount and interest will be returned to the lender.* In our example, the sale of 19.45 BTC for 58,350 USD will be initiated. After the sale, the loan balance will amount to 11,650 USD, it will be secured by 5.2 BTC at a price of 3,000 USD (the total value is 16,650 USD) and equal to 70% of the loan-to-value ratio. This process will be repeated if the market value of the collateral (BTC) drops to 2,250 USD. * Depending on the market situation, the sale process will be initiated from 71 to 75%",False

From the borrowers' side, 1 CLT allows paying the platform fee for borrowing a loan up to $10,000 for one month.  The lenders on CoinLoan will have to pay a fee in the amount of 10% from the credited funds (i.e., interest). For example, a lender provided a loan in the amount of $10000 and earned interest in the amount of $1000. The 10% fee will be charged from these very $1000 and will comprise $100 (a rather reasonable fee for full funds security). But the lender can pay 10 CLT instead of $100 calculated as 1 CLT = $10. So for the lenders, it will be more profitable to pay the fee in tokens. For Pre-ICO participants who have purchased tokens for $1 the fee will be ten times lower.",False

Here are the main differences: 1. CoinLoan project will be launched in Europe and licensed as a payment institution. This allows working legally and providing services all over the world, excluding those countries where a local license is needed. We will try to obtain a license in other countries (including those in Asia) depending on the amount of the raised funds. 2. Any individual or legal entity can act as a lender and provide loans or as a borrower and receive loans. No licenses are required for this. 3. The minimal amount of the loan on the platform is $50 (also expressed in other currencies). This allows providing microloans. The maximum amount is not limited. 4. All applications for providing and borrowing loans will be processed automatically and immediately. 5. CoinLoan Tokens (CLT) will be used for paying the fees on the platform for receiving and borrowing loans. They form an integral part of the system which provides the high demand for them at the market.  6. The borrowers will be able to evaluate the risks related to the cryptoasset volatility and set the LTV (Loan-to-value ratio) at their sole discretion (from 10 to 70%). 7. Loans can be provided or borrowed in many fiat currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, CNY, JPY, RUB, CHF). This list will be extended as the platform is developed. 8. Various cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, Dash, Monero, ZCash) can be used as a collateral. This list will also be extended. We'll try to cover all popular cryptocurrencies with a high capitalization rate. 9. We will focus on convenient and fast methods of depositing/withdrawing fiat funds on the platform with a minimal fee. E.g., instant withdrawal on any bank card, local bank payments, conventional international SWIFT-transfers, etc. 10. We don't prohibit placing our tokens at the exchange, in fact, when ICO ends we'll try list the tokens on the largest crypto-exchanges. 11. Also, we'll try to provide the most profitable fees and lending conditions on the market. 12. Borrowers will have more discretion in different market conditions which affect the value of the cryptocollateral.",False

The borrower has different ways what to do in such situations. You can read more in our White Paper.   Quote from: trunghieu250688 on October 19, 2017, 01:42:20 PM Hi Is this coin the same SALT?  We often receive this question. Here are the main differences: 1. CoinLoan project will be launched in Europe and licensed as a payment institution. This allows working legally and providing services all over the world, excluding those countries where a local license is needed. We will try to obtain a license in other countries (including those in Asia) depending on the amount of the raised funds. 2. Any individual or legal entity can act as a lender and provide loans or as a borrower and receive loans. No licenses are required for this. 3. The minimal amount of the loan on the platform is $50 (also expressed in other currencies). This allows providing microloans. The maximum amount is not limited. 4. All applications for providing and borrowing loans will be processed automatically and immediately. 5. CoinLoan Tokens (CLT) will be used for paying the fees on the platform for receiving and borrowing loans. They form an integral part of the system which provides the high demand for them at the market.   6. The borrowers will be able to evaluate the risks related to the cryptoasset volatility and set the LTV (Loan-to-value ratio) at their sole discretion (from 10 to 70%). 7. Loans can be provided or borrowed in many fiat currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, CNY, JPY, RUB, CHF). This list will be extended as the platform is developed. 8. Various cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, Dash, Monero, ZCash) can be used as a collateral. This list will also be extended. We'll try to cover all popular cryptocurrencies with a high capitalization rate. 9. We will focus on convenient and fast methods of depositing/withdrawing fiat funds on the platform with a minimal fee. E.g., instant withdrawal on any bank card, local bank payments, conventional international SWIFT-transfers, etc. 10. We don't prohibit placing our tokens at the exchange, in fact, when ICO ends we'll try list the tokens on the largest cryptoexchanges. 11. Also, we'll try to provide the most profitable fees and lending conditions on the market. 12. Borrowers will have more discretion in different market conditions which affect the value of the cryptocollateral.",False

Thus, tokens will be used in the platform for paying fees related to applications for provision and reception of loans. The fee amount will be calculated in CLT and will depend on the amount and term of the loan.  As our project has little in common with conventional P2P lending platforms, we decided to transfer the positioning of the project to ""a platform for loans secured on crypto assets.""  Also, we have extended the opportunities of the borrower to provide maximum preservation of the crypto asset. In case of the increase of the market value of the secured asset (collateral) the borrower has a multiple choice of actions: 1 - to withdraw the excessive amount of the collateral, 2 - to increase the loan amount. If the collateral market value falls, the borrower has a multiple choice of actions: 1 - to increase the amount of collateral with the help of an additional crypto asset, 2 - make an advance payment on the loan, 3 - to do nothing and system will begin to liquidate the collateral (crypto asset) automatically in increments.   Let`s take the following case as an example (the interest rate is given for convenient calculation, the actual value will be much lower): Let`s assume that you have 10 BTC of current market value which comprises 4000 USD. You wish to receive a loan for one year at 10% per annum which consists of 12 scheduled monthly payments (also an opportunity of receiving a loan with one-time repayment). You may get a loan up to 70% of the market value of your crypto asset, i.e., 28000 USD. In this example, the collateral balance comprises 10 BTC with the exchange rate which comprises 4000 USD. As a result, the loan shall have a percentage ratio between the loan and the cost comprising 70%. In other words, the loan shall be hedged by 42.8%. The loan repayment will be made in equal-sized payments within 12 months and the monthly payment will comprise 2461.64 USD (among which 2228.31 USD will be spent for repaying the principal debt and 233.33 - for accumulated interest). After making the first payment, the principal remainder shall be reduced to 25771.69 USD, and the percentage ratio between the loan amount and collateral cost will be reduced to 64.4%.  Further, in this example we`ll consider the reduction of BTC market value to 2800 USD which results in the ratio (92%)  between the amount of the loan remainder (25771.69 USD) and 10 BTC used as a collateral. We will inform the borrower about the necessity of replenishing the collateral amount by 3.94 BTC or make an advance payment in the amount of 6171.69 USD. Any variant will result in the 70% ratio between the loan amount and collateral cost.  If the borrower is not able to replenish the personal account and reduce the percentage ratio between the loan amount and the collateral cost, the platform will initiate partial liquidation of the collateral for repaying the part of the loan and reaching the 70% ratio. Particularly, in our example selling of 7.34 BTC for 20552 USD required for reducing the loan amount will be initiated. After the selling, the loan remainder will comprise 5219,69 USD and will be backed by 2.66 BTC at a price 2800 USD (total cost - 7448 USD) and will be equal to the 70% ratio between the loan amount and collateral cost. This procedure will be repeated if the market value of the collateral (BTC) falls to 2100 USD.  We will accept various ways of notification of the borrower about the reduction of the percentage ratio between the loan amount and collateral cost, including notification via E-mail, SMS and via PUSH-notifications from the mobile app.",False

Typically, you exchange your current assets for the new ones. Their mutual exclusion is quite natural, but it often causes a loss in the future.  Sometimes, it is much more reasonable to hold some current assets in the new ones to obtain them back later.  CoinLoan is a platform for lending secured on crypto-assets (cryptocurrency, tokens) aimed at meeting the demand that cannot be satisfied by the traditional credit system. It provides borrowers with the most favorable conditions, and lenders - with the full repayment of their funds and the absence of risks.   Problem At a certain moment, every crypto investor faces the need for fiat money. Obviously, taking into account the market situation, your crypto asset is a highly liquid investment, but one-time transaction through crypto exchanges would be not strategically beneficial due to the duration of deposit/withdrawal, fees, and the market volatility.   Solution A proven business model endowed with all the power and flexibility of modern technologies and cryptography and tested for centuries can be a solution - low-interest loans secured by a cryptocurrency.  Using our platform, you can capture the full benefits of your relations with your creditors, and achieve your goal and completely save the original asset.  You may get up to 70% of the current market value of your crypto assets invested in a fiat currency that is withdrawable in a number of convenient and fast methods, e.g. by international or local bank payment, or transfer to a bank card, etc.   How it works In our platform, a client may act both as a lender and a borrower.  The lender may deposit his/her fiat money with the aid of international/local bank transfers or bank cards and individually create requests for loans on favorable terms (terms, interest rates). He/she may also choose our system to do the above in a fully automatic mode, thereby avoiding the manual creation and continuous monitoring of his/her requests. If the borrower fails to return the funds, the system will automatically liquidate (sell) the pledged crypto asset and return the funds to the lender (including the interest rate), thereby ensuring the absence of risks and a full repayment.  The borrower shall deposit his/her cryptocurrency funds, then create a loan application, the amount of which cannot exceed 70% of the current market value ‚Äî this restriction is created to preserve the borrower's crypto assets and reduce the risks caused by the high volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Next, he/she shall withdraw the received fiat money in a convenient and fast way, and later repays it, and gets his/her crypto asset back in full.   Market Analysis According to experts, the total P2P-lending market may reach a trillion dollars by 2025. Nowadays, it is more than 100 billion annually and will grow exponentially.  At the same time, it is clear from the forecasts of many crypto enthusiasts that by 2020 the crypto asset market will exceed the above estimate of a trillion dollars.  These markets shall bump into, as the cryptocurrency becomes a real investment asset for its holders and can be monetized at any time.  Cryptocurrency, blockchain technologies, and P2P lending, while improving the economy, move the market in a modern direction, leaving behind traditional financial institutions that fail to notice the waves of the blockchain revolution.

After completion, all the tokens allocated for the Pre-Sale will be proportionally distributed among all investors; thus the value will be determined by the current market demand.

Could you please clarify what is the similarity between our project and TrustCoin besides the word ""P2P"" in the description? We differ significantly from the conventional concept of P2P platforms. Our only association with the P2P concept is that each user gets an opportunity to act both as a lender and a borrower who co-operate throughout our platform which acts as an underwriter.  Here are some key features which distinguish us from other projects: 1. We will provide loans in fiat currency, and the borrower will be able to withdraw them to a card or a bank account at the touch of a button pledging cryptocurrency or tokens as collateral. 2. We are the only entity in the market which guarantees the lender full repayment of funds with the rate of interest. Thus, the lender does not bear any risks and does not need to perform assessment of solvency and reliability of the borrower. 3. Our company will be fully licensed for official activity.",False

Let`s take ICO Polybius as an example: When Polybius was performing its ICO, Bitcoin was traded over approximately 2000 USD.  You pledge BTC at the current exchange rate and receive funds in the amount of 1200 USD. Then you buy PLBT tokens, and thus you have a one more cryptoasset in your portfolio. You have bought 120 PLBT tokens for 10 USD. Alternatively, you could have done another way: buy PLBT tokens for this very 1 BTC. As a result, after ICO the token price would fall twice, and the BTC exchange rate would increase twice. In view of this situation in the first case, if you have used our services and borrowed a loan to invest into another ICO, currently you would own 1 BTC (which costs 4000 USD at the moment) and 120 PLBT (5 USD each). As a result, you own 4000 USD (with the debt which comprises 1200 USD + 1.5% of overpayment = 1218 USD), and you have PLBT tokens in your portfolio with current total value 600 USD. After repaying the debt, you will own 4000 USD - 1218 + 600 = 3382 USD of net funds and locked-in profit which comprises 1382 USD, although the PLBT exchange rate has dropped.  In your case when you buy 200 PLBT for your 1 BTC, you become an owner of an asset 1000 USD worth and locked-in loss which comprises 1000 USD.  It`s only one of the potential patterns of using our service.",False
