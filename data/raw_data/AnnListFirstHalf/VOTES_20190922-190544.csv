I‚Äôd like to present you our project ‚Äì VOTES.  VOTES is an international platform for taking votes of any level. It uses Blockchain technologies and smart contracts providing transparency and honesty of polls, votings, elections, testings, and other activities on the base of the platform.  At the present moment, VOTES is based on Russia‚Äôs largest online voting service Simpoll.ru. More than 10 mln people have become the users of the service during the whole time of its existence. Among the system‚Äôs clients there are such large companies as Samsung, Bosch, Adidas, Re:Store, and tens of thousands of other companies.  What problem does VOTES solve? The main problem resided in centralized recording and storage of information about the votes. This problem is solved by VOTES platform with smart-contracts and the Blockchain technology thanks to the decentralized infrastructure.  How do we use Blockchain? Thus, polls / votes / elections based on VOTES can not be fabricated or falsified. To distort the results, scammers will need to change the whole chain of records, which is impossible.  Why is it worth investing in VOTES? We are confident in the continued growth of the value of VOTES tokens. 60% of the funds collected under ICO are intended to be invested in marketing and attracting customers. They will create a demand for tokens, which are required for organizing voting and elections on the platform.  We plan to conduct pre-ICO on August 1 and release 10 million tokens within its framework. More information can be found on our website and in WhitePaper.
