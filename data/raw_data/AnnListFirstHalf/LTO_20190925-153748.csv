The whole travel industry is one huge mix of service providers with varying strategies and as much as we want to be as unique as possible, there is still that chance that we will be doing similar promotional feats as others. True, we might be more advantageous than other travel startups, but there are also those who can swallow us wholly without even thinking about it.  That is the exciting challenge we've prepared to face. Nevertheless, we do not focus our thoughts on that trivial matter.  What Lotus wants to focus on - and is working towards now - is to create a new mix and grow a travel-loving, blockchain-informed community in the process.  Btw let me introduce myself -- I am one of the first few devs (contracted junior smart contract engineer) and was also helping out develop the business model (behind the scenes). I happened to love the project's vision so I am still here to support however I can. You can find my profile at LinkedIn and the rest of the team members at our Official Website, but it would be better if you join us over at Lotus Telegram Community  since we are most active there.  Do take note that this is a startup project and its future is in the hands of the powers that be (which includes supporters like you).",False

Yes, that's something that we have also envisioned - to provide a way for travelers to customize packages depending on available partner establishments. It relies on the way the establishments get accessed via the Lotus dashboard.  Ideally, smart contracts will be put in place whenever a tour or tour-package is sought. Like existing booking systems, policies will be drafted to protect both the service provider and the consumer (i.e. full or partial refund for canceled reservations). These policies will be hard-coded on the smart contracts and will be the basis of tokens that get transferred between affected parties.",False

I want to add that we have also organized bounties to help us expand our reach in a more organic manner.  At the same time, these bounties enable participants to own Lotus Tokens without the need to join the crowd sale (although we do need supporters on that token-sale end of the marketing/business plan).  Hopefully, you will participate in our bounties/airdrop campaigns and if you can't contribute to our crowd sales, you would help spread the word and invite others to support this project.

They are better known and familiar than Lotus. A lot of people have use it, and could recommend new people to use them instead of Lotus.  Lotus is a new creation and so wouldn't currently be as mainstream as the aforementioned travel agencies. Existing travel agencies use legacy and outdated traditional and proprietary booking platforms with varying complexity from one agency to the other,  these old infrastructure setups are costly and complex, not to mention year-on-year increase on operating cost. We aim to simplify, modernize and secure these outdated platforms into a simpler and more manageable way by using blockchain technology.  2. They sometimes offered promotions like vouchers and discounts  We’re different in that side context, as well as vouchers & discounts Lotus will work with an upgrade system which means you will get upgrades for free, Lotus will also have an affiliate rewards system and those two features are considered better than any offer or discount any agency can offer.  3. They're in fiat which means they are more applicable and acceptable by a wider user (at least for now, while crypto is slowly fusing itself with our daily life) than Ethereum-based token  We aim to operate 'machines' similar to an ‘ATM’ in Airports that transfer FIAT into Lotus and vice-versa allowing for low-fee currency exchange. The issue a lot of holiday makers have is that when they're heading home, they have currency left-overs which end up in their drawers at home, or they get it exchanged with a high % fee. We can completely rule this fee out with Lotus machines. So, what if you have those left-overs and instead of bringing them home just by using the Lotus machines you can get that money back in your card.  4. You're in crypto, which is infamous for its volatility. I believe it will be the least interest of anyone to book a hotel worth 100 USD which at that moment (let's say) equals to 1,000 LTK only to find that the next two days, LTK rises and they can have the room at a mere 500 LTK.  Volatility can be controlled just by setting up our token to represent a real-world value (X) that can’t be disclosed for now, but as you said we can't stop volatility with BTC and ETH, but that is the point even when we can’t stop it we can control it and, as bitcoin and any other crypto currency most people hold because of its volatility.  5. And ultimately, their beloved mobile app could literally decide at anytime that it's time for them to apply bitcoin or ether as their newest payment method. This will instantly reduce your bargaining point because (a) as mentioned on point 1, these applications are better known, and people will feel more comfortable on using them instead of the relatively new app (b) the usage of btc or eth (or even doge) which has a stronger market position will be considered as a safer option if they want to try a crypto-payment-holiday than LTK.  Simple, most people nowadays are looking for cheap prices, fast service and easy handling of what they just booked. We offer 3 things:  Cheap prices, and fast service (real time) Upgrade, Rewards & Offers system Have you ever had the problem that you booked with a travel agency and needed a change on your booking, so you need to call the airline and then call the travel agency and then get charged more just by the “booking service”?      - Now with your Lotus card on your account it's simple! You book your “hotel – flight” and if you need to make any changes it will be much less trouble just to give them a call directly and make the changes instead of waiting for hours or days with extra fees to have it done.

They also offer the same service where you only needed your internet-connected phone to book hotels and flights.  In fact, people might prefer them more than Lotus because of some reason like below: 1. They are better known and familiar than Lotus. A lot of people have use it, and could recommend new people to use them instead of Lotus. 2. They sometimes offered promotions like vouchers and discounts 3. They're in fiat  which means they are more applicable and acceptable by a wider users (at least for now, while crypto is slowly fusing itself with our daily life) than ethereum-based token 4. You're in crypto, which is infamous for its volatility. I believe it will be the least interest of anyone to book a hotel worth 100 USD which at that moment (let's say) equals to 1,000 LTK only to find that the next two days, LTK rises and they can have the room at a mere 500 LTK. 5. And ultimately, their beloved mobile app could literally decide at anytime that it's time for them to apply bitcoin or ether as their newest payment method. This will instantly reduce your bargaining point because (a) as mentioned on point 1, these applications are better known and people will feel more comfortable on using them instead of the relatively new app (b) the usage of btc or eth (or even doge) which has a stronger market position will be considered as a more safe option if they want to try a crypto-payment-holiday than LTK.  Please mind that I'm not trying to corner you here. I only suggested  some points that you might (or might not) missed. Also please mind that I haven't read your WP, so I wouldn't know if those points are already on your control or not. But a lot of new comers and end-users also wouldn't bother reading a lot of pages just to book tickets (hey, we even skipped TnC that's only few paragraphs long) so you might want to make these points clear to your future customers.",False
