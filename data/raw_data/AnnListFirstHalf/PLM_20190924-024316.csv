I want to introduce our blockchain project called algo.land. It is a trading pool that trades with bots in the Forex market. We have many years experience in the field of algorithmic trading and can contribute some excellent trading bots (live forward tests available). Also the participants can contribute trading bots, the owners of the tokens will have the power over the pool. By voting over proposals the participants decide about trade size of each bot, payout of profits etc. The token will be available for trading on exchanges, in case someone wants to get out of the pool. So it's a kind of investment club, but on the blockchain. Each contribution will be 100% your trading equity! The smart contract and the peripheral software are already existing. For safety reasons the broker account will be in the hands of a trustee (a Swiss lawyer). The base currency of the account can be (besides fiat currency) also in Bitcoin or gold, so we can be free of fiat currency with the safety of a bank account.  For more info check our website https://www.algo.land  Best Regards from Switzerland Eddi & Team  P.S. Sorry if in wrong thread, but the thread ""Alternate cryptocurrencies > Project Development"" does not exist",False
