In short, I think Publiq is great, and I would love to get the word out on this service.  Publiq is a not-for-profit peer to peer distributed network that seeks to reward authors for creating accurate and meaningful content while at the same time building an ecosystem around smart news, and advertising in the hopes to give readers a way to get the most out of digital news. This media ecosystem is based on blockchain combined with a smart analytics system and AI. The goal is to fight fake news and clickbait misinformation. Today many news articles are duplicated or pirated and shared online, making it hard to trace the original content and author. This makes the ability for the writer to earn royalties more difficult.  https://medium.com/@m.aadilk96/publiq-case-study-43a254c2fa1c",False
