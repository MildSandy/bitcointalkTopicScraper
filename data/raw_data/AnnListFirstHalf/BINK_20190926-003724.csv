BINK is not a security and is not intended for cryptocurrency speculators.  Please read our Notice and Legal Disclaimers at the bottom of this page and in our White Paper.  Ether, “ETH,” will be the only acceptable form of payment in the token distribution event. During registration, you will be asked to enter the address of the Ethereum wallet you will use for the token event.  The price of ETH per BINK for the sale will be set prior to the sale.  As part of registration, we will be collecting information with the aim of verifying KYC (“know-your-customer”) for every participant and running the data against AML (“anti-money-laundering”) and CTF (“counter-terrorist-financing”) databases.  Any attempts to send ETH from a different address or directly from an exchange (such as Coinbase, Kraken, Poloniex, etc.) during the distribution event will result in an inability to purchase BINKD (“BINK”) and your ETH may be permanently lost.  Be aware of scam websites or phishing emails attempting to obtain sensitive information such as password or ETH address. The BINKD public token sale occurs only on the domain (www.binkd.com) and all email communications are sent from the sending domain “@binkd.com.”  Important: BINKD never requests or sends any sensitive information via email.
