You can catch me on Telegram almost everyday!  https://t.me/PEXTokens  For your questions I'll answer one by one...  ""... When we sell a house to a homeowner, the homeowner gets a great house with easy credit approval... and they get an interest rate discount if they pay their mortgage payment in PEXT "" - What kind of discount? and what is the interest rate?  What kind of discount:  The discount that our homeowners will receive will be an interest rate discount of 0.25%.  This is the incentive that the homeowners receive to pay their mortgage payment in PEXT rather than USD.  As an added benefit, if the homeowners choose to become PEX-Token holders themselves, meaning that they hold on to PEXT over and above their monthly mortgage payment, they will have an opportunity to experience appreciation in the price of PEXT should the PEXT go up.  The mortgages are priced in USD.  So in theory, as the months and years go by, the amount of their monthly payment in USD will stay the same, but if they've held on to their PEXT their monthly payment due in PEXT could drop significantly.  What is the interest rate:  The interest rate today is 7% on a 30 Year Fixed Rate Mortgage.  This is historically an extremely good price.  We reserve the right to change the interest rate along with market rates to protect our project, but if you're quoted an interest rate it is valid for 30 days.  After 30 days, if you don't put your down payment in escrow with us, the rate may change.  Once your rate is locked in, the rate is a 30 Year Fixed Rate.  No funny business, everything is straightforward.  "" ...the homeowner gets a great house with easy credit approval.. "" - What does ""... with easy approval of the loan ...?  We don't verify employment.  We don't verify income.  We don't require an aging of your assets.  We need to know who you are, and you'll need to prove it by government photographic ID.  We need to know where you live, and you'll need to prove it by a current utility bill for your residence.  This is for KYC/AML requirements.   We will verify the amount of your liquid assets.  You must prove that you own in liquid reserves the down payment you will be paying down plus 24 months in monthly payment reserves.  You will pay us the down payment into escrow, and you yourself will hold on to these monthly payments, but this is the criteria that we use to prove that you have the wherewithal to tackle a house like this.  That's all there is to it!  If I want to buy a house from your site for $ 350,000, then tell me on the numbers or% what and how will I pay? Using PEXT.  The numbers are the purchase price of $350,000.00 requires you to pay $87,500.00 USD-equivalent down, payable in either USD, an equivalent fiat currency, or BTC, ETH, and/or LTC, and/or a combination thereof.  At this time we cannot accept PEXT as down payment until liquidity is established for PEXT in the markets, since we will be returning PEXT to the market.  Additionally, you must prove that you have liquid assets in the amount of 24 months' worth of mortgage payments.  Then we're ready to move forward!",False

Banks were supposed to be simple. Banks were to be a place where people could take their money, deposit it for safe storage, and the bank would put it to good use in loaning deposits to the community for building projects and other needs within the community. Sounds simple enough, right? Who could argue with that?  Banks were supposed to be a public service that served a necessary community function. Even today most bank charters still state that the business of the bank is to serve the needs of the community. If this were the reality then cryptocurrencies would have been created inside of the bank model instead of as a valid and even superior alternative. People know intuitively that something is wrong with the banking model, that banks aren’t their friend. However, what other alternative has there been until now?

This helps the token holders and helps us to create a growing and vibrant market for #PEXT.  We have promised to let you know whenever we are getting ready to make a change with our #PEXT Investboxes, and today, we are announcing a major change that I think everyone will like very much!  MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT!!!  20,000 PEXT remain in the current 5% Investbox, with min/max limits of 25/100.  This box will stay open until the #PEXT runs out.  In addition, we are opening a BRAND NEW 5% Daily #PEXT Investbox, with a minimum of 25 and a maximum of 10,000.  We are committed to funding this with 100,000 #PEXT!!!!  We are thankful for the #Yobit trading community and are thrilled with the participation that we've received from you.

We can list on EtherDelta now, but we're working to have our token listed there as a PEXT and not the contract value so we're pushing through that right now.

Everyone that has helped to spread the word, helped to answer questions, bought some PEX-Tokens, and/or participated in the bounty program is much appreciated.  You guys worked hard and it didn't go unnoticed.  Thank you.  We ended up at 10,091,353.  I sure wish it were closer to our 25,000,000 token offering, but we realize the climate of ICOs right now that we've pushed through towards success, and are satisfied that we've been delivered a clear win and vote of confidence from the crypto community at large with your help.  The other tokens that appear in our thermometer on our website includes the founders, bonus, and bounty tokens, so what you're seeing there is the total number of tokens pledged against the 30,000,000 total token supply.   Thanks to everyone for your support and hard work through the ICO phase.  We're already miles down the road today with regard to distributing the tokens.  There remains some prep work to that regard before distribution and we will deliver on time, as scheduled, and on budget, just like we deliver our houses   Thanks for going down this first leg of the journey with us.  We've learned a lot, we've worked a lot, and we've got a whole lot more planned in the near future.  Be sure to visit our website for regular updates, and as they become available, virtual tours of our houses, groundbreakings, on-site webcams, and meet & greets with happy homeowners in fantastic homes that you've helped to create with your support.

Long and short of it is that we've migrated to ERC20 instead of Waves.  It's just simply a business decision to do what we feel is best after people were scamming people with PEX-Tokens that weren't from us.  Our PEX-Token will now carry the ticker symbol ""PEXT"" and is indexed and searchable on Etherscan at https://etherscan.io/token/0x55c2a0c171d920843560594de3d6eecc09efc098.  It's unique identifier is 0x55c2a0c171d920843560594de3d6eecc09efc098.  If the PEX-Token you are purchasing is not identifiable in this way you are not purchasing a PEX-Token associated with Prime-Ex Perpetual!  If you're due PEX-Tokens:  Create a public address for yourself at MyEtherWallet and send us your public address.  Send it to us in the same email address that we know you as, or include that email address in your email.  Send your email request to erc20@prime-ex.com.  Your tokens will begin to be distributed immediately upon receipt of your public address.  Be sure your public address is correct!  There will be instructions posted here and on the prime-ex.com website of how to initially locate your token once distributed.  It's easy.  Then, in the next week or so, the tokens will be listed on and sold on Ether Delta and Ambisafe's Orderbook for beginners.  Be sure to keep up with us at prime-ex.com for more details as they come up, and I'll post here when I can.  Thanks for bearing with us!  We've done this to protect our company and our token holders.   --- --- ---  PRIME-EX PERPETUAL ANNOUNCES SWITCH FROM WAVES TO ERC20  PANAMA CITY, PANAMA — Panama real estate developer and homebuilder Prime-Ex Perpetual has announced a switch in their token platform from Waves to ERC20, an Ethereum-based token platform.  The PEX-Token will now carry the token symbol PEXT and will be indexed and searchable on the Ethereum blockchain.   In announcing the switch, John Gilbert, Prime-Ex Perpetual CEO, commented, “Since before the pre-ICO we’ve had people who believe in and support our project to encourage us to consider switching to an ERC20 token because of increased possibilities to list our token on multiple exchanges.  We’ve come to believe that for us, in this moment in time, this is the best move for our company and our token holders so that our PEX-Token reaches the most people possible.”  Prime-Ex Perpetual recently completed their ICO, achieving token sales of over 10,000,000 PEX-Tokens.  The switch from Waves to ERC20 is occuring before their planned token distribution, which Gilbert says will occur sometime in the next week.  “Since our token distribution has yet to occur, the switch at this time will impact our community in the least possible way while providing the opportunity for the token to trade on multiple exchanges for greater visibility and opportunity to trade for our token holders.”  ERC20 is the token standard interface for tokens on the Ethereum platform.  EOS, Qtum, are OmiseGo currently the most popular Ethereum-based tokens, each possessing market capitalization in excess of $1B USD.  “People who are expecting PEX-Token distribution will need to supply us their MyEtherWallet public wallet address at erc20@prime-ex.com along with the email associated with their account with us”, Gilbert stated.  “We will then distribute their tokens and make an announcement in the near future of where they can go to trade PEX-Tokens.”  For more information regarding the ERC20 switch being made by Prime-Ex Perpetual, keep informed at https://prime-ex.com or visit their ANN thread at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2150472.msg21513985#msg21513985.",False

I can't agree though.  Real estate projects have been successful for almost as long as men have been roaming the earth.  From the perspective of a person that started from nothing and became a multimillionaire, how many of the millionaires do you think became that way because of real estate?    I don't understand why anyone would identify the real estate industry as being the only industry that is incompatible with technological advances.  Look at how many ways that people throughout the centuries have already created to possess real estate, whether by sovereignty or grant by royal decree, whether by title or rights of possession, whether held by real persons or nonpersons, whether ownership or leasehold, etc.  Whenever political persuasions of men have changed, so has real estate.  We are doing something not only unique, but uniquely special.  We have created a REIT on steroids.  We have created a whole new asset class of unlimited monthly volume potential that exists peer to peer; one that can grow outside of the underlying collateral values, one that can be branded, one that can be advertised, one that can be fractionalized, one that can be leveraged, one that can control a market wherever it lands.  We have created an ownership structure whereby our client can become a participant in our success, or our token holders can become our clients, where we control our own lending guidelines, where our buyers control their own destiny, all outside of the control mechanisms that traditionally stand between a buyer and a seller by third parties.

Feels good to get a little media exposure!  https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/5a0c98b8e4b006a16baf1eb9  Ayodeji Onibalusi, Contributor Entrepreneur and digital marketing expert, CEO at Effective Inbound Marketing  How it Can Pay to Buy Residential Real Estate With Blockchain Tokens 11/15/2017 02:54 pm ET  Cryptocurrencies are huge right now, and they should by no means be underestimated. Research shows that some $4.9 billion worth of bitcoin is traded every 24 hours and usage of bitcoin is unrestricted in a whopping 96 countries. When you also consider the adoption of blockchain technology in established industries as well as emerging ones, it’s easy to see that cryptocurrencies are here to stay.  However, cryptocurrencies have a lot more potential than many would imagine.  Can you imagine buying a property without credit scores, without age restrictions, and including a guaranteed buy-back program at two-thirds of the original price outside of your home country? Companies like Prime-Ex Perpetual, a company catering to expats in the Republic of Panama, do exactly that by tokenizing their own real estate ecosystem using blockchain technology.  Prime-Ex Perpetual CEO John Gilbert believes that blockchain technology will change how real estate is approached, and that the improvements introduced to the existing real estate model will enhance the bottom line of the company as well as the owning experience of the homebuyers.  How Tokens Might Take Thousands of Dollars Off the Price of a Home  Gilbert thinks blockchain can greatly reduce the effective cost of buying property by reducing monthly payments and by becoming token holders themselves.“When our homebuyers become our token holders, they win in three ways. First, they experience a cheaper monthly mortgage payment. Second, they will enjoy dividends derived from our company’s profits in their proportional share. Third, as the PEX-Token realizes ever-increasing demand against their permanent fixed supply, there is a chance that the underlying value of the PEX-Token may go up over time, which would effectively make the purchase price of their home cheaper with each future mortgage payment they make. Everybody wins. Most of all our homebuyers who become token holders.”  He credits the company’s “3 pillars” for making this possible:  3 Pillars of the Prime-Ex Perpetual Real Estate Ecosystem  To understand what Prime-Ex Perpetual is doing you need to understand the 3 Pillars of the Prime-Ex Perpetual Real Estate Ecosystem. Prime-Ex Perpetual relies on a handful of improvements to the traditional real estate model to reinvent the way that residential real estate is experienced.  The hope at Prime-Ex is to be able to handle every step in the residential property development and sales process through its platform. Under Prime-Ex’s current plan, all the steps in the process including property selection, land development, home construction, advertising and sales, mortgage, rental, and maintenance would take place in the blockchain.  Prime-Ex is testing the model with luxury properties in the highlands and beach front areas of the Central American nation of Panama. The hope is to market the properties, it plans to finance with an initial cryptocurrency offering (ICO) called PEX-Token, to wealthy expatriates from Europe and North America.  Pillar 1: Controlling the Real Estate Process  The way that Prime-Ex Perpetual holds title to the individual properties ensures superior lien rights from beginning to end. This protects the interests of both Prime-Ex Perpetual and its token holders. The permanent mortgage for a future buyer is attached to the property at the very beginning of the process, and is only enjoined to a payment structure when a buyer purchases the home. This creates efficiencies in chain of title and eliminates the possibility of loss for both the buyer and Prime-Ex Perpetual.  Pillar 2: Improving the Borrower’s Financing Experience  Prime-Ex Perpetual is introducing their proprietary Revolution Loan, which replaces interest rate risk experienced by borrowers with equity participation by the lender. The loan is meant to eliminate the negative reinforcements banks traditionally use to get the borrower to pay, and replaces them with a very big reward: after the borrower has participated in the Revolution Loan as agreed for three years, the borrower can execute a clause in the agreement whereas Prime-Ex Perpetual will buy back the house for two-thirds of the original purchase price, no questions asked. Borrowers are able to lock in a lower maximum risk exposure that allows them to experience living abroad without the full financial risk attached of buying a home outside of their home country.  Pillar 3: Leveraging Blockchain Technology  Prime-Ex Perpetual has tokenized their own real estate ecosystem in a way that allows home buyers to pay their mortgage at a discounted payment by using PEX-Tokens, and allowing their token holders to enjoy dividends equaling 80% of the company’s profits. The free exchange of PEX-Token value within the Prime-Ex Perpetual ecosystem in a way that benefits all effectively creates a whole new asset class built on top of a traditional real estate investment trust. Homeowners enjoy lower monthly payments. Token holders enjoy dividends. Token holders enjoy a more direct and transparent way to sell their investment without the need of middlemen with very low transactional fees. When homebuyers decide to become token holders they become active participants in the very model that helped them to purchase a home in a new way.  Prime-Ex Perpetual believes that the improvements made to the real estate process puts their company in the conversation of every person considering purchasing a home in any market that they choose to operate in. “When you consider the quality of our homes, the easy monthly payments, the ecosystem that our homebuyers get with one of our homes, combined with a guaranteed buyback, there’s really no other choice,” says John Gilbert, CEO and Co-Founder of Prime-Ex Perpetual. ”People will choose our homes because it makes the most sense for their lifestyle experience and their bottom line.”  The Initial Coin Offering of Prime-Ex Perpetual’s PEX-Token begins on November 15, 2017. Prime-Ex Perpetual is offering 25,000,000 PEX-Tokens for sale at $1.00 USD-Equivalent. Token purchasers will take possession of their PEX-Tokens during the first few days of December. PEX-Tokens are a Waves-based token and will trade openly on the DEX Exchange. To hold the tokens you will have to use a Waves wallet. PEX tokens can be purchased with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Waves, US dollars, Euros or British pounds at https://ico.prime-ex.com.",False

NG lays the foundations for our next phase of growth and a step-change in the size of the ecosystem we can support.” -- Alexander Ivanov, CEO and founder of Waves   https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogeraitken/2017/11/08/waves-set-to-become-fastest-decentralized-blockchain-platform-globally/&refURL=https://www.google.com/&referrer=https://www.google.com/  Waves Set To Become Fastest Decentralized Blockchain Platform Globally  NOV 8, 2017 @ 11:36 PM Roger Aitken , CONTRIBUTOR  Waves, a global public blockchain platform founded last year that completed its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in June 2016 raising over $16 million (c.30,000 bitcoin (BTC)), is implementing new technology to enable the network to process “thousands of transactions” per minute and become the fastest decentralized blockchain platform in the world.  The innovation is touted as bringing blockchain technology to the “next level of evolution”, enabling the platform that was the brainchild of a Moscow-based physicist to compete with mainstream payment processors and to achieve mass-market adoption.  “Waves-NG”, a next-generation technology and consensus algorithm designed and based on the Bitcoin-NG proposal made by Cornell Computer Science academics Emin Gün Sirer and Ittay Eyal.  It increases effective bandwidth and speed of block creation, which is described as being “especially significant for businesses” using the Waves platform since it allows for conducting micro transactions - without any delays that are typical with traditional blockchain systems.   Furthermore, it allows the platform to withstand high loads, such as distribution of tokens following crowdsales and airdrops of bonus tokens. The speed of processing trading transactions on Waves decentralized exchange (DEX) is increased as well.  The prototype for the development of Waves-NG was Bitcoin-NG, a protocol developed for Bitcoin by Gün Sierer, Co-Director of the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts at Cornell.  “In recent years, we have seen blockchain technology show the world its unique capabilities and amazing promise. As well, we have seen it hit a wall when it comes to scalability,” said Gün Sierer, who holds Ph.D. & M.S. qualifications at the University of Washington and B.S.E. from Princeton University.  He added: “If blockchains are to conquer the world, they need to scale. The Waves team is at the forefront of this race to scale. And, with NG, Waves has adopted the cutting edge of blockchain protocols for on-chain scaling.”  Current Blockchain Systems   The problem with current blockchain systems is that in many decentralized systems, nodes are scattered around the world, and their synchronisation entails significant delays.  So, for example, if you create a large block and starts sending it, while waiting for it to reach the rest of the network’s participants, one of them may have time to create a new block. And, due to this problem, forks will occur.  That is one of the reasons why, in the bitcoin community, there are constant debates about whether to increase block size. Waves explained that if one increases the size of a block in the bitcoin network by four times, “only 90% of participants will have time to download it before creating a new one. If you increase it to 36 MB, then only half of participants will have time.”  Specifically, NG enables blockchains to minimize latency and maximize throughput. According to Gün Sirer the Waves team has shown that they have an “innovative platform that incorporates the best-known technology and is ready for challenges of the next generation of demanding applications.”  NG is a protocol change that allows an increase in the number of transactions per block without increasing the number of forks.  The information necessary to start generating the next block is delivered to all nodes quickly after the previous one is generated. And, only then does the miner send the transactions that will fill the block to the network, submitting them in several tranches (i.e. microblocks).  Bitcoin-NG  Bitcoin-NG is a blockchain protocol, which serializes transactions in much the same way as Bitcoin, but allows for better latency and bandwidth without sacrificing other properties.  The protocol divides time into so-called epochs. In each epoch, a single leader is in charge of serializing state machine transitions. And, to facilitate state propagation, leaders generate blocks.  It introduces two types of blocks: (1) Key blocks for leader election, and (2) Microblocks containing the ledger entries. Each block has a header that contains the unique reference of its predecessor, namely, a cryptographic hash of the predecessor header - among other fields.    Traditional Blockchain Model Versus NG Model  In a traditional blockchain model, blocks are discovered at roughly similar intervals and the most recent transactions are processed once a miner has earned the right to submit them to the network. As such, this places fundamental limits on the capacity of the blockchain. Bitcoin, for example, has a theoretical maximum of roughly 3 tps.  By contrast, in the NG model, the next miner is selected in advance. The miner creates a “key block”, which is then immediately filled with microblocks containing transactions, which requires no further proof-of-work.  Whilst maintaining the open structure of the protocol, it enables transactions to be confirmed “as fast as the network will allow.” Waves’ proof-of-stake approach is said to further improve speed, and thereby increasing capacity by a “factor of a hundred or more”, it is claimed.  Alexander Ivanov, CEO and founder of Waves, commenting in relation to the development said: “As a platform of mass adoption, it is critical that we should be able to support a high throughput of transactions, whilst maintaining robust security. NG lays the foundations for our next phase of growth and a step-change in the size of the ecosystem we can support.”  The public stress test, which began on November 8 2017, requires the community to help stress test it.

Each token holder will receive their proportional share of the 80% profit distribution that Prime-Ex Perpetual will make to its token holders perpetually.

First off, to purchase PEX-Tokens, you have to provide us with a Waves wallet, which you get for free from Waves.  It takes approximately 3 minutes to set up.  You install their Lite App on your computer or phone.  It works great with the Chrome browser.  So the Lite App has access to everything within the Waves platform.  It has any number of tokens that you own inside of the platform, and it has access to the DEX Exchange.  Inside of the DEX Exchange you can trade up to 70 different token and fiat pairs.  We consider this an amazing advantage for our ecosystem in that our PEX-Tokens will be immediately tradable on the DEX Exchange itself.  You can trade in and out of PEX-Tokens into any of these pairs.  You can hold your PEX-Tokens right here in the Lite app Waves wallet.  You can transfer most holdings in and out of the Waves platform into and out of other platforms.  While inside of the DEX Exchange your trading activity is extremely cheap.  Homebuyers within our ecosystem will have an easy method of storing their mortgage payments, no matter what country they go to, inside of the Lite App Waves wallet on the DEX Exchange.  They will be able to send their PEX-Tokens for their mortgage payments instantaneously to our own Waves wallet.  No international border reporting, no waiting 30-45 days for an international check to clear, no crazy international wire fees.  Just a quick, easy payment from one Waves wallet to another.  When our customers need more PEX-Tokens, they purchase from you right here on the DEX Exchange.  Nobody else has created internal, organic demand for our tokens the way that we do.  Once the homes are ramped up and sold this will be truly impressive. ",False

That's a good sign!  Dividend, is something that the 3 big exchanges will (Bittrex, BitFinex, Binance) act really tough towards, to the point i can say you guys need to find another ""word"" for it. As long as you don't describe it as ""dividend"" you are good to go. Otherwise, from experience in other big projects, I can say you will just be arguing with them to the piont that you will change it anyway.  ""We're fully compliant with KYC/AML procedures for anyone across the world purchasing tokens in fiat. We have policies and procedures in place to be compliant and stay compliant.""  - That's good, perfect.  ""We're nine months out from funding from delivering our first houses."" / ""We already build and develop houses in Panama."" / ""We have other houses for sale in Panama in subdivisions that we've developed, but these are outside of the Prime-Ex Perpetual project and are built for and marketed to a different homebuyer than expats.""  - That's good, this confirms you guys are not some ""get rich quick and be gone"" ico's. This also confirms you guys have experience in this. So this ICO's is to fund the new houses that will be build under this project. That's fair. One small question.  Why are the first houses being build after 9 months and not, let's say, in 3 months after the ICO?? What's with the hold up?  About ROI should be a year goal, long term. That's all good also when communicated as such during the ICO.  All in all this project can be good if everything will go as is promised and I'm interested. The only thing that i see can form a problem (from the viewpoint of traders) is the name ""dividend"" to get listed on centralized populair exchanges.  As last, enjoy the Pacific.",False

We just haven't accepted the down payment yet because we want to know we're moving forward first.  What we are communicating is that the first homes will be DELIVERED approximately 9 months after we begin.  We say 9 months knowing that this is the maximum timeline to deliver the home.  We're getting ready to enter the dry season and buiding speeds are accelerated from mid-December through to about the end of April, there's a 5-6 week span that's rainier than others, then clear sailing to about mid September.     We will use cameras to show the progress of the actual builds while CGI videos and 360 virtual tours are used in earnest as part of a robust marketing program to expats.  These are already being created to begin marketing the homes beginning in December.  People will know what the homes will look like from day one and where they're being built, while people from all over the world will be able to watch the progress of the homes from start to delivery via technology.  I'll personally be on the sites on a routine basis and plan to broadcast videos from the job sites a few times a year as both part of the marketing strategy and to provide transparency about what's going on inside of Prime-Ex Perpetual.  We have internal markers in place that will are gauging the stability of the ecosystem.

We're a dividend token.  We make no apologies for that.  This is what we are and it is key to our ecosystem.  Our real estate ecosystem will experience organic demand, or internal demand within our own ecosystem.  We will trade openly on the DEX Exchange and wherever else Waves tokens are traded.    The most important thing to understand about our ecosystem is organic demand.  Remember, we are self-financing what is usually people's largest purchase in their lives.  The payments for these purchases generates huge demand inside of our ecosystem.  In the future, when our global reach expands and more and more houses are built and sold to more and more customers who take out more and more mortgages being paid in PEX-Tokens, while we will always welcome those outside of our ecosystem to own and hold PEX-Tokens, we won't need them to.  We will generate enough demand internally that it's not outside of the realm of possibility that it may make more sense one day to keep the exchange of PEX-Tokens largely inside of our own ecosystem.    The key is the internal demand that is possible.  125 homes generates 400,000 monthly token demand on a 30,000,000 permanent token supply.  The number of homes represented here is a very small number.  Do the math.  We could be a very small real estate company on the global stage where each market experiences only a normal growth rate and still create internal demand for PEX-Tokens every month in an amount that exceeds the total token supply inside of our own ecosystem.  Regarding dividends...  Ask yourself...  How many cryptocurrencies TRULY pay dividends from actual profits?  For example, we have major press releases out today announcing the launch of our pre-sale today.  We'll be published today in many known print media names that we all know all across the world.  When this day comes for Prime-Ex Perpetual that we do a press release to announce a real XDiv date to pay out real profits,  just ask yourself what the impact will be on the demand for PEX-Tokens.  When we do it again the next year, and then announce a switch from annual to quarterly profits, just ask yourself what the impact will be on the demand for PEX-Tokens.    So while your point is valid on listing with Bittrex today for example, the point is irrelevant to the validity and success of our project.",False

Here's a quick interview I did that might help:  https://youtu.be/LnYjYUelO0U  Expats enjoy the most discretionary income of any measurable group in the world. They’re globetrotters, trendsetters, and love technology no matter they’re age. They pay for convenience and that’s what we’re selling them. This is a whole new asset class for REITs that can be sold in the future for many multiples over existing REIT valuations. Expats will be able to go to multiple expat destinations throughout the world to buy within our branded ecosystem and experience common expectations and results that are known quantities.  We’ve tokenized the ecosystem so that homebuyers can pay their mortgage payments with PEX-Tokens easily, no matter where they roam.  We’ve created the capacity for huge organic demand for our PEX-Tokens that is unlike any other blockchain real estate project. This positions us easily as the #1 real estate blockchain project.  Our PEX-Token is an 80% dividend token that generates huge returns for the best historic collateral class in existence and PEX-Tokens reap 80% of those profits.  We’re career real estate developers, home builders, realtors, and mortgage lenders. We don't need to figure out how to develop property in Panama.  We already do that.  We don't need to figure out how to build houses in Panama.  We already do that.  We don't need to figure out how to sell and mortgage our own houses.  I've done that my whole professional career.  What we need to do is test our tokenized real estate ecosystem, and that means that I need you.  I need investors. We need to build a small test of our ecosystem where upwards of 125 homebuyers purchase our homes and then purchase PEX-Tokens from you, the token holders, pay them to us, and then we turn them again in the market.  We are testing the liquidity and illiquidity of our PEX-Tokens on a small scale before we take our branded ecosystem global.   We're raising only the money necessary to test our ecosystem.  We can't float this many houses from our own resources.  We could raise traditionally but that means debt with interest rates attached and no ability to build out what is truly special about this:  A branded ecosystem where the economy is tokenized across national borders, with a common level of quality and experience expectations from the homebuyers.  There is no branded anything in the expat world, and we're changing that.  The beauty of this is that we will be not only valued in the future like a REIT, which trades on average at 43x earnings right now, there is no other REIT that will have a branded, tokenized economy that is built as a platform on top of the underlying real estate and mortgage collateral.  The ecosystem, ten years down the road, will generate monthly dollar demand greater than the total lifetime token supply.  Imagine the underlying value of PEX-Tokens if the organic demand expressed in dollars exceeds the total supply of PEX-Tokens created each and every month organically inside of our own branded ecosystem!  Disney cruises are more expensive than other types of cruises because you know you're getting the mouse ears, you know that you're getting princesses, and you know that you're getting castles.  We're building the same type of expectations that expats can count on in our branded ecosystems in the top places around the world where expats frequent.  Thats' the long term vision, and we need your help to get there.",False

Doubts are what has led my team to put so much planning and effort into our project.  We've sliced it and diced it from every angle possible.  I'm a risk mitigator by trade.  Any token that is coming out today, dividend tokens or otherwise, will find it hard to get listed on the large exchanges immediately.  The large exchanges have all been burned by scammy ICOs ran by con artists.  The exchanges seem to be taking a ""wait and see"" approach to most of the new tokens being generated out of the newer ICOs.  They want to see that their team is using funds according to their whitepaper and that the project is continuing to move forward before they'll consider listing.  When the exchanges do list a new token, it's not exactly an altruistic decision by them.  It costs a lot of money to be listed on most of the larger exchanges.    We're more than familiar with the SEC.  We've taken great care and spent many thousands of dollars with legal representation to be a project that does not rock the boat with the SEC.  We hard block IP addresses from the United States that try to access our payment gateway.  We're fully compliant with KYC/AML procedures for anyone across the world purchasing tokens in fiat.  We have policies and procedures in place to be compliant and stay compliant.  We consider our project a multi-billion dollar play in five years.  We're not going to trip over a dollar to make a nickel.       Also it's based on waves platform... everything on waves is dying slowly.. the project sounds good, caught my attention, but why waves for God's sake? While Ethereum erc20 platform is growing and pretty much most wallets and dex exchanges are based on ETH.   I think you paint with a very large brush here.  There are many companies on the Waves platform that are thriving.  What we bring to the Waves platform is our organic demand.  Waves is a newer platform and is continuing to grow.  Will they have bumps and bruises?  We assume so.  We're nine months out from funding from delivering our first houses.  Waves will continue to mature, continue to grow.  We love the Waves platform and how we're automatically listed on their DEX exchange.  Because of our organic demand all we need is the mechanism by which to transact back and forth from PEX to fiat to PEX to fiat to PEX etc.  Being listed on DEX eliminates a lot of the concerns that we had about not being able to freely trade in and out of PEX-Tokens.  I don't any problems with ER20 token platforms and wish them all the success that they can achieve.  They shouldn't have any problems with us either.    Will any big crypto boys invest in this because of it being on waves platform and not erc20 token?   Apparently     Does the company have permission/licenses to build houses in Panama? What other country?   Have you read our whitepaper?  We already build and develop houses in Panama.  Our proof of concept market is in Panama for the next few years so it would be silly for us to go into a bunch of other countries at this stage and permit up.  When that time comes, you can be sure that we'll do it right.     Does the company already have build at least a house that's ready for sell? Or is it going to be like some other doing projects who had everything on paper but nothing in the real world, if so to see any ROI from this token will take at least one year or more. Would it be attractive for traders to invest in this? More traders quicker price gain. Quicker ROI.   We have other houses for sale in Panama in subdivisions that we've developed, but these are outside of the Prime-Ex Perpetual project and are built for and marketed to a different homebuyer than expats.    We have our designs from our architects and promo material is being created now.  We will not sell houses in our ecosystem until we are funded.  We are nine months away from delivering houses from the date of funding.  We won't start selling something we can't deliver.  When we can deliver we will start selling, and when we start selling we'll be the first option in any market that we choose to enter.    You're right about the ROI.  We'll be a year out from ROI in Prime-Ex Perpetual.  This is the real world.  You can't just start building an ecosystem of 125 houses.  That takes funding.  We're not pulling other resources out of other projects and putting them into Prime-Ex Perpetual.  Prime-Ex Perpetual will stand on its own two feet.  No welfare here.  This is pure capitalism.  We're brick and mortar and dollars and cents and PEX-Tokens and a whole bunch of profit for PEX-Token holders.     Also is there a telegram chat for this?   Yes.  Visit our website.  At the bottom there will be a social media button for Telegram.  Hope that helps.  I've tried to be as accurate and detailed as possible for you.  Again, I agree with doubting this project or any other project, whether inside or outside of the ICO space when it comes to pouring your resources into a start-up.  Is the downside risk worth the upside?  What's the background of the principals involved?  Are they professionals in the field that they're pursuing?  What's the real world applicability of the project?  Does the team possess the talent and capability to deliver on what they say?  Can the project be demonstrated and proven?  Can the project achieve mass appeal?  Is the project backed by anything?  Are their projections reasonable?  These are all questions that I ask myself when I'm looking at any opportunity, including my own.  Okay, time to take my five hours off this week and check out the Pacific.

You don't need to live in Panama to access the housing solutions that Prime-Ex Perpetual will offer to its homebuyers. In fact, the main argument for the financing solution (Revolution Loan) that Prime-Ex will provide is precisely because expats have most of their income from abroad.  They have an interesting criteria to apply for the Revolution Loan. For instance, no income verification but asset verification. You must also have proven reserves to pay your mortgage for at least 2 years. See page 11 of the WP.",False

As many of you know we have just wrapped up our Pre-ICO.  As we opened up a first round of public sales for early participants, we have also used this period to judge the varying interests in the crypto community, field questions, and address concerns to better understand how best to position Prime-Ex Perpetual as the #1 real estate offering in the ICO spectrum.   Early participation was more or less as anticipated.  We achieved 600+ subscribers and approximately a third of those have purchased PEX-Tokens.  We’re thankful for the participation we’ve received so far in our project and we are rewarding our early participants for their investment and their trust in us in the following manner:   The bonus PEX-Tokens that you will receive for your early participation is INCREASED from 15% to 40%.  So for a $100 USD-Equivalent purchase you will now receive 140 PEX-Tokens in total instead of 115 PEX-Tokens.  Congratulations!   We are protecting against the erosion of your early purchase value in the following manner:  For those who have purchased PEX-Tokens with any means other than USD, the exchange ratio for your USD-equivalent purchase will be clearly published on the Website 24 Hours prior to the ICO Pre-Sale on October 31 2017, following the official exchange rate from October 30 at 6 pm Panama Time.  What this means:  If you purchased in BTC on a day that your BTC was valued $3,000.00, but on October 30th BTC is $5,000.00, you will receive your PEX-Token bonus calculation from a $5,000 base rather than a $3,000 base.  In other words, your 1 BTC purchase of PEX-Tokens would yield you a total of 7000 PEX-Tokens instead of 4,200 PEX-Tokens.  Congratulations again!  Other news to announce:  NEW ADVISORS  We have brought onto our advisor board Clinton Senkow, Co-Founder of Influencive.  Clinton is very successful in global marketing reach and has most recently been very “influencive” in helping TenX raise their ICO capital goals.  We are “influencing” him to do the same for us.  Also added to our advisor board is Ian Scarffe.  Ian is a true globetrotter with extensive work in the crypto space across Europe and beyond.  We’re proud to have him as an ambassador for our project and he’s already hit the floor running with notable introductions.  ADVICE TAKEN  After listening carefully and thinking through feedback and advice given by quite a few of our subscribers, we have extended our offering and slightly modified it in the following manner:   Pre-Sale addition November 1st - 8th.  A Pre-Sale round is now added to our ICO rollout.  This round will be for investors seekiing to purchase PEX-Tokens in volumes of 3.5 BTC or 50 ETH.  Pre-Sale purchasers must register at our Whitelist as posted now on our website.  Pre-Sale Purchasers wll receive a 20% discount off of the PEX-Token ICO offering rate.  Those interested in purchasing above 35 BTC or 500 ETH should contact us directly for special incentive. We will provide numbers on the raise after the completion of the Pre-Sale. ICO launch will now be November 15th - November 30th.  These changes are reflected in our white paper and website. Revised whitepaper can be read here:  https://prime-ex.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Prime-Ex-Whitepaper.pdf  VALUE PROTECTION  Early Pex-Token purchasers will now enjoy their purchase being protected against the possible extreme rises that BTC is known to make.  Instead of the equivalent dollar value of your purchase being determined at the time of purchae, your equivalent dollar value will now be calculated on October 27th for your protection.  Discounts awarded in the Pre-ICO and the Pre-Sale will be awarded from the October 27th valuation.  If I think of anything else I’ll report back, but these are the changes that have been made, as always with the protection of our project and our token holders being kept in mind with all changes.  Thanks for your continued support!  SIGNATURE CAMPAIGN  A reminder that our signature campaign is active and live for bounty participants.  This is an easy way for bounty participants to earn PEX-Tokens.  Tell your friends and get involved!  CUSTOM CAMPAIGN  Several of you have submitted ideas to our bounty campaign a few of those ideas have been accepted.  I highly recommend that you participate in the Custom Campaign.  Not a lot of activity so far and a lot of tokens are up for grabs!  Thanks for listening, see you in the forum!",False

Let's say $2,000,000.00 in USD-equivalent profits are generated for Prime-Ex Perpetual in our ongoing concern.  Let's say that cryptocurrency-loving Jamie Dimon owns 20,000 PEX-Tokens  Jamie would be due $2,000,000.00 X (20,000/30,000,000) = $1,333.33  The question becomes how is Jamie paid?  We thought about paying in PEX-Tokens.  But what does that look like?  Prime-Ex would enter the market to purchase PEX-Tokens, and then pay back PEX-Tokens to the remaining PEX-Token holders, or the PEX-Token holders before we made the purchase?  Is Prime-Ex now a token holder and it's going to pay itself a proportional share now?  These questions were put to rest by us by making the decision to simply pay out our profits in Waves.  First, it's a very nice support of our growing platform.  Second, PEX-Token holders who wish to hold PEX-Tokens instead of Waves would then only need to convert their Waves to PEX-Tokens by buying them on the open market, thus perpetuating the demand for PEX-Tokens.  We felt this was the best way to go about it in the most logical manner that we could think of.  Hope that helps!",False

It is surprising how Panama Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has increased over time, although the region's has decreased.  Take Costa Rica for example, a very popular travel destination in Canada. FDI is lower than Panama's, and its net increase last year was only 1%, compared to Panama's 16%.  What do you attribute such high FDI?

Also Prime-ex has done their research on what to actually target and where can the blockchain be of use. Prime-ex has chosen Panama because there is a ""need"" for this. Many ICO's fail to realize that what they are creating is not in demand to begin with or the area in which they are marketing it is not demanding that product or service. In Panama you have a market that is waiting in line for this.  The community makes all the difference in the world.

We’ve put a lot of time, effort and money into structuring our company and our ICO so as to limit our exposure to interference that could potentially harm us.  One of the first things that we did was structure our company in such a way as to mitigate both legal exposures as well as the bureaucratic risk that we would face by entering into the cryptocurrency environment.  For this reason, under the advice of our legal counsel, we’ve chosen to disallow participation in the ICO from Panamanian citizens.  This line of thinking is just smart business planning.  It’s the main reason that we’ve chosen to disallow citizens in the United States from participating as well.  While we would have loved participation from U.S. citizens, the risk that we would face from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could not be mitigated, so we simply had to exclude them from participation.  The Republic of Panama is actually a great place to do exactly what we intend to do regarding our tokenized real estate business by allowing for-profit businesses to be owned inside of a Foundation structure, which is exactly how we’ve set up the Prime-Ex Perpetual project. There are many reasons for this. Know that we’ve meticulously thought through them all.  We are fully compliant with all of the laws of the Republic of Panama. We could have incorporated anywhere in the world and still performed the exact same real estate business that we intend to do in Panama. Structuring in Panama made the most sense for us and made the most sense for our Token Holders.  While Panamanian citizens are disallowed from participation in our ICO, the real estate aspect of our project is distinct and separate from the ICO phase.  After the ICO phase people from around the world, including the United States and Panama, will be welcome to purchase our homes provided that they meet our underwriting guidelines.",False

Sorry, we don't have LinkedIn profiles.  For me, relevant information pertaining to this project is a Series 7/66 Licensed Financial Advisor with Wells Fargo Advisors, escrowed/lapsed.  Commercial Lender III Community Trust Bank, Kentucky's largest domiciled regional bank.  Kentucky Area Manager Guardian Savings Bank.  Owner, Freedom Mortgage Consultants.  Founder/Co-Owner, Precision Wall Systems, one of Kentucky's larger foundation sub-contractors.  Ulrich and Theresa are father and daughter.  Theresa has been an integral part in helping to manage their family's large construction business.        While researching I found the phone you've added on your site (+1 833 PRIME-EX (774-6339), that is the same with the phone that has https://newworldcapital.global/   Yes, indeed!  New World is our marketing entity for Panama.  This is a vital and integral part of our proof of concept.  While in Panama we will serve as our own third party provider, it is envisioned that as Prime-Ex Perpetual grows beyond the boundaries of Panama that we will partner with non-related third-party providers.  Obviously, the relationship between the owner of the homes, Prime-Ex Perpetual, and our service providers, in this case New World, has to be rock solid.  A major part of the proof of concept is ""fleshing out"" how this relationship evolves, in both form and function.  It is necessary for Prime-Ex to be able to maintain control as the owner.  It is necessary for third-party providers to be able to make day-to-day decisions in their coverage area.  How this is handled needs to be contracted.  Rather than hope and dream that we get it right the first time with people not related to the Prime-Ex Perpetual project, we will operate as both of these entities ourselves, so that in the future, when the project expands beyond our local territory, the policies and procedures of how exactly everything works and whom exactly is responsible for what is firmly spelled out.  There is nothing at all weird about this, and if you watch the video located at the New World website it speaks very openly about being a Prime-Ex Perpetual Participating Partner.  This is all part of the plan.  While the website is in place, we have not marketed it as of yet because we have no homes for sale as of yet, and we want to know the success level of the ICO before we start spending marketing dollars on actually selling houses.  Just know that the plan is in place to proceed forward to do just that, and part of that plan includes New World as a Prime-Ex Perpetual Participating Partner.      To me the entire concept looks awesome but with such a shady information like no social profiles of your team, having the same phone number as https://newworldcapital.global/ isn't looking good to me.   I disagree completely with your ""shady"" comment.  That is not now nor has ever been our intent.  We want to change the way that homes are built and sold and we have the experience to make it happen.  There are quite a few shady plays in the crypto world but we're not one of them.  The fact that you may not agree with our LinkedIn level of use doesn't make our project ""shady"".  Microsoft doesn't need to know everything about us for this project to be viable.  New World doesn't have an office yet as we're not building houses yet.  We used our own phone number, Prime-Ex's phone number, to place-hold the number for the website.  That doesn't make us shady in any way, I think that it makes us transparent!      I've read the entire white paper, didn't saw a partnership in the roadmap. Any plans on that?   What do you mean by a partnership?     Will you release more information on who are the developers who are developing the token? Because so far we only know information about the co-founders/CEO.

Feel free to reach out anytime.  You will always get a response back just as soon as BitcoinTalk lets me post      What happens if the ICO fail? People are going to get refund? Any plan B?    ICO fails if we do not sell 2,500,000 PEX-Tokens.  At this point, by all indications, this is now thankfully unlikely to occur.  We've had several large buyers reach out to us indicating their intention to make larger volume purchases.  If this holds true then my answer becomes immaterial.  But to answer your question, should the ICO not be minimally funded with a sale of 2,500,000 PEX-Tokens, then buyers will be refunded less transactional fees, all of which are clearly spelled out in our Terms.  The minimal sale of 2,500,000 PEX-Tokens gives us sufficient funds necessary to begin our proof of concept, albeit on a smaller scale.  Funds would then be raised in the future from our fixed token supply of remaining PEX-Tokens from the standpoint of a company in the middle of various stages of home builds and buyer placements into our ecosystem.",False

That's an almost impossible question to answer because nobody can tell you today what the value of our PEX-Tokens will be in six months, much less six years into their history.  What I can tell you is that a hundred thousand dollars USD equivalent of PEX-Token demand being purchased from our existing PEX-Token holders by homebuyers for our ecosystem consumption is a lot better scenario for the value of our PEX-Tokens than would be no organic demand at all.    Panama Economic Data > Don't forget about this one.   You have to research ECLAC data to begin to understand the impact that foreign investment has on Panama.  At first blush the numbers appear depressing, as foreign investment is down for this segment as a whole from recent years past.  When Panama is isolated from the group, however, things begin to brighten up quite a bit.  While foreign investment in Central America was up just 3.7 percent from 2015/16, or in other words not keeping up with the rate of inflation, foreign investment in Panama is up a massive 15.9 percent from 2015/16, and foreign investment into Panama today has tripled from the numbers in 2009.   https://www.cepal.org/en/pressreleases/foreign-direct-investment-toward-region-continues-downward-trend-and-totals-167043  It seems that the world is betting on Panama, as nearly 40% of the foreign direct investment into Central America is represented in the $5.2B Panama investment.  Stable government, improving infrastructure, tourism destination, being the banking and shipping center of Central and South America all factor in to reasons why Panama is a smart investment opportunity, over and above the obvious advantages that the Canal factors in.   How does all of this play a role in Prime-Ex Perpetual being able to sell its houses?

I'll answer your questions honestly and to the best of my ability.  1.  Company was established formally I believe May of this year.  The project as a concept has been in the making for well over a year, in the 15 to 18 month range.  2.  Goal of the pre-sale is to raise awareness and give away tokens.  The sooner people buy the less we'll raise.  For example, if people max out the bonus tokens on day one then we will have raised $5,000,000 in USD equivalent tokens.  If nobody buys until day 10 then and then all of the sudden the bonus tokens are exhausted we will have raised $7,500,000 in USD equivalent tokens during the Pre-ICO.  The overall goal of the project is to raise $25,000,000 tokens while giving away 1,000,000 tokens in the Pre-ICO bonus and bounty campaign combined, and hopefully, that's what we'll do.  3.  Tim is a senior software architect for a Fortune 500 company.  He's also the technology parter of the MonsterByte project, a recently completed casino ICO.  He's helped us out with our technology regarding escrow of tokens and creating a payment gateway that's acceptable to our legal team from a fiduciary perspective.  He has no day to day influence in our operations but I'm sure we'll see each other from time to time after our offering is over.  Maybe we'll pull him from his Fortune 500 gig one day!  4.  Slack channel / Telegram.  We've thought about it.  Since we're more of a dividend token play I'm not sure what meaningful part a slack channel or Telegram account would play.    5.  Price of the Pre-ICO involves bonus tokens in addition to your purchase, not discounted token prices.  On day 1 of the Pre-ICO, a person purchasing $100 USD-equivalent of PEX-Tokens will receive 115 PEX-Tokens due to the 15% bonus.  Day 10 purchasers would receive 110 PEX-Tokens with their 10% bonus.  6.  None of us are big fans of LinkedIn.  I'm sure if you check there may be some data gathered up from around the internet, but I don't think I have a formal LinkedIn account.  Theresa might because she's younger.  The only conversation that we've had about LinkedIn is that ICO listings kept asking for a LinkedIn thread so I directed our tech team to make the company a LinkedIn profile.  We've been business executives and entrepreneurs, and nobody's going to do business with us based on our good looks, well except Theresa.    7.  The purchased tokens will be released to people's individual WAVES wallets sometime in November, after the ICO during our Post-ICO process.  Any unsold tokens may be sold on open exchanges in the future at some unspecified time, but there will be no more PEX-Tokens ever in existence beyond the 30,000,000 fixed supply.  As a WAVES-platform token, the PEX-Token will trade freely on the DEX Exchange.  We would love to have our token trading freely Post-ICO on platforms such as Poloniex and Bittrex.  We've emailed them with no response, probably because we're still early in the process, but as we move forward we'll make decisions such as this to the benefit of our Token Holders.  We're Token Holders too after all.  Hope that helps!",False

Here's where leasing can play a factor, however:  we're building in areas that expats routinely favor.  That means that we're building in places that expats routinely fly down to check out.  These areas are tourist areas, with many people coming down every year as tourists checking out the highlands and the beaches.  If our homeowners want to take advantage of this and lease their property out as vacation rentals or even long term rentals that's there business.

The Prime-Ex Perpetual project will disrupt the real estate industry by re-thinking the way homebuilding, home selling, and home financing are approached. Prime-Ex Perpetual realizes synergistic system and bulk purchase efficiencies that are passed along via dividend distributions to PEX-Token holders.  “We’re both humbled and inspired by the attention given our project in such a small amount of time,” remarked John Gilbert, CEO and Co-Founder of the project. “This was certainly more initial support than we anticipated. We realize this is a huge vote of confidence, and we continue to push on toward our official Pre-ICO launch on September 18th with a new sense of pride thanks to the amazing support shown to us by the cryptotoken community.”  About Prime-Ex Perpetual  The Prime-Ex Perpetual proof of concept occurs in the cool highlands and the warm beaches of the Republic of Panama, a top expat destination where financing homes is very difficult. Prime-Ex Perpetual delivers 80% of profits back to the token holders. Once the concept is proven, Prime-Ex Perpetual will expand into other geographic locations worldwide.  About Pre-ICO  PEX-Tokens will be offered beginning September 18th pegged at 1:$1.00 USD-equivalent values of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and WAVES tokens. Early-bird purchasers will receive as much as 15% in incentive PEX-Tokens for participating early in the campaign limited to a combined total of 750,000 bonus PEX-Tokens.

Anyone that seeks to improve the real estate status quo is fine in our book.  We understand real estate.  We understand how a quality home starts with quality engineering, quality materials, and quality workmanship.  We understand chain of title.  We understand the value of comparable sales and quantifiable market data.  We understand the impact that document retention and complete, consistent loan files that are compliant with the company's underwriting guidelines have on the company's mortgage asset class.  We've worked in all phases of real estate as builders and bankers on two continents.    We understand the inefficiencies in the current system.  We understand how the market has shifted and how homebuilders, homeowners, and home lenders alike are at greater risk.  We believe we are uniquely qualified, given our experience, to help shape the future for the better.  You can read our whitepaper for all the details, but we've created a real estate ecosystem where everyone participating within our ecosystem wins.  Home builders win.  Home buyers win.  PEX-Token holders win.  We have created a fixed supply of tokens against an ever-increasing demand for tokens as principal payments are continually reinvested into the building of more and more houses.  The ecosystem wins.  Prime-Ex Perpetual wins.  The way that title is held is better because of the way that we use corporations.  The experience of the home buyer is better because of streamlined terms and the mitigation of their risk.  The experience of the home builder and home seller is better because they determine their own fate without the involvement of a third party controlling their future sales instead of themselves.  The quality of the collateral is better because experienced workers will be maintaining it month in and month out generating consistency across the collateral pool.    We've created an ecosystem that we believe is positioned to be first in our market.  Once the concept is proven the ecosystem will continue to expand both in terms of market cap and geographic reach.  We're not competing with other offerings.  We're getting up each morning, looking in the mirror, and figuring out how to end each day better than we started it.  I know I'm biased, but I like very much the road that we're on.  Thanks for asking!",False

So what is support?  If you see an advertisement out in the digital space somewhere about Prime-Ex, be sure to re-post it here.  Same goes for outside articles or other types of noteworthy things that you see out there about us.  If someone's having a hard time finding a document or signing up and we haven't addressed it yet, help them out. We'll get you some PEX.  Once the bounty program starts, the bounty page for the support thread will have a google docs form where you can post your user profile along with the URL for the bounty that you're claiming.  When you register to our website you will share with us your deposit key into a WAVES wallet that you set up.  Once you do that you'll receive PEX tokens at the end of the ICO.  It's as simple as that, and we much appreciate any support that anyone can help us with!",False

We have put a whole lot of time and a whole lot of legal fees into putting this concept together in a way that is both beneficial to people and legally viable.

Our concept is not renting, it's a legitimate sale but in a whole new way.  We build, sell, and finance our homes.  From the moment in which a lot is either developed or purchased by us, we put the lot inside of its own individual corporation, and we go ahead and affix the end user mortgage to the property.  When the property sells, the new buyers execute a promissory note that initiates payment terms toward the mortgage, and the shares of the corporation are transferred into the name of the buyer where the shares of the corporation are held in third-party escrow under an escrow agreement that the parties mutually agree to abide by.    Here's what's different about us:  Our buyers execute a maintenance agreement with us to where we cut the grass, maintain the landscaping, fix faucets, leaks, etc., in real-time as they occur.  That means service after the sale, and it means that we have eyes on our collateral on a monthly basis.  In essence, we're paid by our buyers to maintain our own collateral and that's a great thing, because we plan in advance for the possibility that we might be selling it again.  There's a built in minimum buyback clause that the buyers can execute that states we'll buy the house back at two-thirds what they paid for it.  That means that they can lock in their maximum risk exposure, and it means that we've placed ourselves on the same side of the table as our customer: what's good for them is good for us, and the customer has traded interest rate risk, or the risk of time, in favor of equity participation with us.  We all win!  There's of course more to it, but in essence that's the difference between a rental program and and ownership program.  Thanks again for checking us out, if you have any questions about the whitepaper please let me know!",False
