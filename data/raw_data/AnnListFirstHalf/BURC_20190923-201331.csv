You are trying to gether almost ETH 2 000 (!) (near $1.5 million) And what for? This is hard cap. We didn't have a goal to raise all the 2000 ETH, 2'000'000 token is minimum we need to make 1.0 release. So 2000 ETH can be raised in 1 year, for example.   Your ""product beta"" in an application that simply executes Claymore miner. And that's all! And ou developed this for 6 months! We are very glad that you studied our product. And you absolutely right that right now BURON uses Claymore to mine (actually we can use any miner). But this is the tip of the iceberg. We trying to release beta ASAP to get customers feedback and make our product together with our customers. Writing code is not only we do last 6 months, we make customers development with a lot of miners, trying different software to understand market, we use different technologies to select what best fit us, and a lot other stuff.  We create basic core, bones of the project. Next we need to construct other parts of body.  Our release is a small part of what we do. Right now we testing features, that soon will be released: * Grab data from mining pools. We already can work with pools data, but it is not on public * Compare data form pools and miners logs. While mining we have a lot of different data about hardware, pools data and technology specific data. The goal is to bring all data together to human understandable format * Mass management * Get data from third party services. Like whattomine or blockchain explorer * Telegram bot for monitoring and management * Also currently we are working on BURON box, this device will manage ASICs  This is part small part of our backlog, we need to do a lot to make v.1.0   In my opinion BURON is SCAM. If it is not , then I really do not know what scam is.  May be I didn't understand what is SCAM,  but I know 100% that mining software is VERY HUGE AND GROWING MARKET. So our goal is develop company with $2M monthly profit in next 2-3 years. So what you prefer - $1,5M right now or $1,5 every month in next 2-3 years?",False

NiceHash and MinerGate is close to our functionality.  In NiceHash you can sell or buy mining power, and get profit in BTC. It is marketplace. You can't tune your hardware and be notify if, for example, one of your GPU is down. We making tool for complex managing and monitoring mining hardware, and also we have completed solutions for big miners and mining hotels. Also on nicehash you cannot mine, for example monero, you always get BTC - because you didn't mine, you lease your hardware.  MinerGate is great product (as well as NiceHash). But first of all this is mining pool, you can select coin to mine and start mining on minergate pool. With BURON you can mine on any pool.  NiceHash, MinerGate and BURON - different products but yes, it looks like very similar.  Right now you can use BURON to take full control of your GPU mining hardware. Monitor what happens, tune it, select coins and pool you prefer and get BURON award!  What we are developing is BMW in world of mining. Sometimes it looks like Toyota or Mercedes, somebody thinks that best is Chevrolet...",False
