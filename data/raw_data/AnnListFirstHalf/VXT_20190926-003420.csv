We all crave for the perfect and most efficient banking products that will help our businesses grow, opening up more opportunities for development in the process. Those dreams are a reality with the launch of Verto Token by the Verto platform. The Verto Token is ideal for FINTECH and Money Exchange organizations as it integrates Blockchain technology into existing applications to decrease the amount of time it takes for transactions to complete. It is designed to provide these organizations with a way to utilize cutting edge technology to benefit their client bases.     The Verto platform was created to service a growing need from users to avoid excessive fees and time associated with sending FIAT currencies across borders. The way Verto platform works is such that a user logs into the Verto system and then links Verto to their bank account. The user then transfers funds from bank account to Verto account. The funds transfer using the built in exchange functionality of Verto. Funds are then converted back to FIAT at the recipient’s currency into a Verto account. Funds are then transferred to destination bank account.     There are numerous organizations that try to offer innovative solutions in international transfer of funds but they all are required to integrate with the traditional banking system and fall prey to the existing issues that arise from such systems. With Verto Token, such problems are eliminated.           The launch of Verto Token shows Verto’s commitment to making sure business organizations and individuals are able to enjoy a faster, simpler and more secure transfer of funds. Verto Token would minimize thefts and hassles in transactions due to the complex nature of the system and the multitude of data required to transfer funds.  The Verto Token will reduce days to minutes in transaction times due to its liquidity in the market and direct accounts setup in both initiating and settling countries. Utilizing the Blockchain ensures the transactions are recorded correctly and the immutable nature of the Blockchain ensures no tampering can occur with the financial information. All of these features ensure this technology provides a faster, simpler and more secure platform for transferring funds.     The Verto Platform will also compensate customers who are holders of the token for their trust in the platform. An ICO will be held in the upcoming months to allow the Verto Token platform the ability to collect liquidity within the market. Any user who holds tokens will see a compensation which at present is evaluated to be a 6% return per annum. This ensures that believers of the platform will be repaid for their trust in the Verto Platform and ensures an equal return as systems are profitable and transactions utilize the Blockchain.
