As the technology progresses adding livestream might be an options, but that is for the developers to decide when that option is stable and reliable.

The way I see it is yes, a lot of content creators depend on the ad revenue but clearly that isn't enough because you also need ad placement for example ( introducing a product from a sponsor in your video ) to make at least a decent living.  Last I have read the average content creator makes about $1/1000 views if he is lucky and his video is not put side and demonitized because it's not ""advertiser friendly""  In my personal optinion, if we take a good look an average of $1/1000 views is not a lot, if only 10 people would put $0.10 ( through likes, comments, sponsorships, patronage style, etc ) ( 0.10% ) said content creator would make at least the same amount as they would have adverts on.",False

The idea is that all the participants should have the best possible information at all times which includes, but is not limited to, results of PoA ( proof of availability )  challenges, video demand statistics, copyright and content id tags and basic telemetry.   If a material is found by the community copyrighted or not family friendly it will recieve a tag and the hosting node would not want to host copyrighted material, the uploader and the hosting node ( if he continues to host the content ) would recieve a flag.   There will be an order book held and a real time bidding between content creators and hosting providers. Each video will be stored on at least three distinct nodes to ensure the video is not lost. Each content creator will likely receive personalized offers from potential hosting providers, primarily influenced by popularity and risk profiles. To make this process easier, as well as to aid in matching the particular content creators with the optimal hosting providers, we should aggregate additional information based on usage of the Viewly app, such as viewership statistics (timing and frequency of views, average per-country aggregates) and the risk profiles (content id tags, copyright flags, and/or other disputes).   The price of storage will only be a small proportion of earnings for popular content providers, a small price to pay for storing videos with high intrinsic/emotional value and  too expensive for low quality content and/or spam, ultimately eliminating the surplus of unpopular and/or spam videos.    The selected host will issue a bond (e.g. 20% of the annual hosting price) as a collateral for actually storing the file. If the hosting node fails a Proof of Storage (PoS) or Proof of Availability (PoA) challenges, they will lose the bond and and the offer to host this video will re-enter the marketplace. In the event where content is purposefully discarded, both the bond and remaining funds in the contract are burned. The hosting provider forgoes the bond for the sake of aversion of potential legal liability, and the original uploader loses the remaining funds in the hosting contract. The hosting provider also suffers a small loss in their reputation score.  Of course nobody would stop you to spin up any kind of website based on the infrastructure and host your own materials but you would do so at your own risk.",False

Thank you for the question.  Here's a brief explanation about decentralization, taken from Wikipedia: Quote Decentralization is the process of distributing or dispersing functions, powers, people or things away from a central location or authority. Also, we are not aiming to be a social network so we will be completely different from Instagram. Viewly is a decentralized video platform which is powered by the blockchain, focused on its content creators and eliminating one of the biggest problems content creators encounter - demonetization. And yes, the platform will be ad free.  Quote from: MaksonJoe on February 10, 2018, 02:09:49 PM Explain pls, for what will people get money at your platform? For videos, for views? For subscribers?  Hello MaksonJoe, thank you for your question!  On Viewly, creators build their ""tribe"" of dedicated fans, and receive Patreon like support through frictionless micropayments and subscriptions. Creators can also sign sponsorship deals that are in-line with their fanbase best interests‚Äîwith the on-chain escrow smart contracts, without middlemen. You can read more about this on our Medium blog here: https://medium.com/view-ly/solving-the-money-problem-viewly-embraces-creator-monetization-on-revolutionary-platform-e0f04fe414f8   Quote from: andiko on February 10, 2018, 02:23:04 PM I do not quite understand why a project needs a token?  Hello andiko, in our case - the VIEW Token will be used on Viewly to support and show love to creators!  Quote from: tiCeR on February 10, 2018, 06:33:15 PM Is this going to be an ICO and what's the timeframe for that? Also from a technical standpoint, will blockchain be able to cope with the massive load that comes with storing and playing videos on a global scale?  Hello tiCeR, thanks for the question.  The seed sale was ongoing in October and the hard cap was reached. There is a presale for strategic contributors that's ongoing at the moment until the 19th February - above 100 ETH. Then on the 20th and on the 21st February there will be a presale for whitelisted contributors - above 5 ETH. The public token sale starts on the 22nd February and it will last until the hard cap has been reached or until the 22nd March.  Videos are not stored on the blockchain, you actually only store the information regarding transactions and that relates to videos (hashes, etc). The technology is advancing.",False

Its a bit trickier when tokens are held by 3rd parties, but still doable.

These problems mainly lie in the fact that creators are not only limited in the way in which they can set up incentive programs, but also in the ways that supporters are getting the somewhat shaft end of the deal.  Most platforms only allows creators to make money by fans paying for exclusive content. These same platforms also does little to promote its creators or facilitate community building.

These channels are typically backed by corporate interests or major advertisers, putting them at a meaningful advantage ahead of the vast majority of content creators, who do not have time to invest.  A Brand Based on Quality Content, Not Algorithms Building on the philosophy of a patronage business model, View.ly is the first online video platform to use a decentralized content delivery network (CDN) that will allow high quality creators with a small, medium, or large following to build an audience based on the quality of their work rather than wait for YouTube to use arbitrary algorithms regarding view, watch‚Äêtime, and likes to put their videos in front of potential subscribers.   Transparency, Immutability, Security, and Community By using the blockchain and decentralizing network operations, as well as using a token system that is built on the blockchain, there is far less of a risk for security breaches as well as misappropriation of fans‚Äô donations. Since there is no centralized body holding and managing payments, fans can be sure that their tokens are going directly to the creators and vice versa. The blockchain application also serves as a reward, synchronization and enforcement layer for the peer‚Äêto‚Äêpeer hosting.  Thank you for following us! A new announcement will be coming after 24 hours.",False
