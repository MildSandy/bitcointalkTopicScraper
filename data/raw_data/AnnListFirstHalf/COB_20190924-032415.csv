He does not use a smart phone well and has 2FA set up on his computer instead by using a Google Chrome browser to hold a 2FA app.  All the other exchanges, he says, gives their clients the ability to set up 2FA manually. But COB does not have that yet.  COB needs to provide a number under the 2FA smart phone scanning gizmo. That is how the other exchanges do it.

I don't know if its just me, but currently am a bit confused about the J Token listing and airdrop which Cobinhood stated would be similar to CyberMiles (AKA a 1 to 1 airdrop per COB/CMT).

Please stay tuned."") The posts here state that the sale will be held March 13th until April 9th 2018. So does that mean that all the holders of Cobinhood tokens must have them deposited into their Cobinhood accounts with minimum level 1 verification before March 13th in order to receive a 1 to 1 airdrop of J tokens? This clarification would definitely be appreciated! Also if anyone knows of any info of other upcoming drops please let us know too, even though figure its probably just the one for now.

And if you invested in them, it was probably a good year for you, as well.  While the unfathomable success of Bitcoin took the spotlight (rising from USD 1,000 to USD 20,000 over the course of the year), it wasn’t alone in its ascent. Ripple grew even more than Bitcoin did this year. Ethereum and Litecoin made monumental jumps. Even some of the altcoins made unprecedented leaps of over 15,000% in this year alone.  If you’re a swing trader, day trader, or just a general investor in any of these cryptocurrencies, your payout was probably substantial. But, you likely paid out a good amount of those profits in trade fees, as well.  Think of all that money lost to the exchange...  The problem with exchanges: high trading fees  Businesses in the financial sector tend to make a lot of money. Cryptocurrency exchanges are no different.  Coinbase, for example, charges a 1.5% fee to buy Bitcoin from their site. And its sister site, GDAX, features “taker” fees of 0.25%. So if you have $10,000 and make a single round-trip trade with all that capital (buy and sell), you’re instantly down $50. If you made 30 round-trip trades per month with all your capital? You’ve now lost $1,500, or 15% of everything you invested.  These fees, while they don’t seem high at a glance, eat away at profits. And they’re the norm everywhere. They’re why the vast majority of day traders are not profitable, even if they make decent trades. Your trades can’t just be decent if you’re making round-trip trades every day. Those fees add up quickly.  This is why Binance has become the largest exchange by daily volume in under half a year. The Shanghai-based exchange has the distinct advantage of only charging 0.10% of each trade. That’s significantly less than every other major player. Using the same $10,000 account as an example, you’d only pay out $20 per round-trip trade. These low fees, combined with Binance’s numerous trading pair offerings, has allowed it to thrive in an expensive cryptocurrency exchange ecosystem.  But 0.10% still adds up over time. And when you factor in the taxes you have to pay on your winnings, your profits dwindle all too quickly.  The truth is that trading fees are put in place to turn a profit—not to benefit customers. Most exchanges not only could care less about your bottom line, they actually factor in your “lifetime value” as a customer because they know how long someone will stay with them before they go bust.  These are all reasons why Cobinhood (COB) seems so exciting and groundbreaking. It’s the first 100% free cryptocurrency exchange. There are no fees and no commissions at all. Sound too good to be true? I did a deep dive into it to see if it lived up to the hype. Here’s what I found.  What Is Cobinhood (and why should I care)?  Cobinhood launched its exchange in December of 2017 with one goal: create a user-friendly, dependable cryptocurrency exchange with zero fees.  Taking a page out of the book of the zero-fee stock trading site Robinhood, Cobinhood’s value prop couldn’t be easier to understand. There’s no fine print or “fees that aren’t actually fees.” They are the genuine article and offer exactly what they advertise.  The wise skeptic might ask, “But how do they make money?” Good question. Rather than collecting piles of money from commissions, Cobinhood underwrites new ICOs that can be featured on their exchange. Cobinhood takes a small percentage of these new ICO coins to finance their operation. That’s how they locked in Cybermiles and helped them raise $45 million.  https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/no-really-a-free-cryptocurrency-exchange-in-2018_us_5a4e3b71e4b06cd2bd03e50a",False

That’s the nice/bad thing about trading with crypto. The whole market is highly volatile and at the moment, after growing this exponentially, the market needs to cool off a bit. It always stays risky to put in that much on anything, but I expect it to grow again sooner or later. Don’t forget that since the ICO, just a few months back, the price of COB went x20 or so. Same as the ICO’s of a lot of exchanges like BNB and KUC for example. People will cash out sometime, but after this the eventual growth returns. CobinHood is one to watch out for this year and probably surges even more. Putting a few k’s in an ICO with a new exchange coming up is maybe a better investment for high returns, but ofcourse the risk is also higher then an exchange that already proved itself to be working and functional like COB. When more and more coins and tokens are being added on the platform CobinHood (plus Cob.X) will be an exchange for the future among the biggest exchanges out there. But then again, this is just my perspective..",False

SONM allows miners to put their (currently wasteful and environmentally unfriendly) PoW mining rigs to a good cause. Rather than confirming transactions and mining blocks, miners will participate as part of a global supercomputer, allowing for scientific calculations, game server hosting, machine learning, video rendering and streaming and much much more.

It had/has great potential but it is being run to the ground by people who appear to be completely clueless.  If you want to have your money tied up in an exchange and you won't be able to withdraw it for potentially weeks then be my guest. Otherwise you should definitely avoid this for now.  Also remember Popo Chen saying withdrawals will be free, yet they charge 0.01 ETH for them just like other exchanges (significantly more than the actual cost).",False

It's useless to try to destroy Cobinhood, they have 0 transactions fees and better technology while other exchanges are collapsing.  It's easy to find answers to these questions, however:  - COB is a standard Ethereum ERC20 token and can be stored in Etherium address;  - The Benefits Of Being A COB token holder are:     50% off margin trading loan interest can be discounted when paid with COB tokens.  When Cobinhood underwrites an ICO, COB token holders will be able to get future ICO tokens at significantly lower rates. The amount of ICO tokens that a COB token holder can get at a lower rate is as follows:  (ICO Tokens Received by Cobinhood from ICO Underwriting Service) * (The Amount of COBs Owned) / (Total Amount of COBs)  Token holders can bind their Ethereum wallet address, which is holding COB tokens to their Cobinhood trading platform account, by calling the binding function in COB token smart contract.  After the binding is complete, COB holders can get the ICO tokens at a lower rate on the Cobinhood exchange.  As an example, Cobinhood underwrites an ICO for a token called XYZ. The total issuance of XYZ tokens through ICO is 100M and Cobinhood takes 5% as underwriter service fee. 10M COB tokens holder will have a lower rate, i.e. : 5M * 10M / 1B = 50k XYZ tokens. Cobinhood will make efforts to maximize a COB token holder’s benefits.  There may be more privileges for COB token holders in the future.  - 1 billion COB tokens was issued, half of it (500 million tokens) for ICO (they attracted more than 7,000 investors and raised $13,440,705). 400 million COBs belong to the team, while the remaining 100 million COBs will be used as private placement. Consider they invested a lot of money in technology, their systems can handle millions of transactions per second.  - There will be 9 airdrops this year. Free money. Airdrop is a coin give-away. If Cobinhood lists a new coin that is a ico, Cobinhood will be payed this for new coin listing and those free coins will be handed out to COB holders based on the number of COB. It happened recently with CMT, it was airdropped.  That's why people are buying COB, infact volume rise from 800k to 5millions, profits since ICO are huge and will continue to grow a lot.....",False

I am under the impression that this was the only airdrop that will happen (I hope I'm wrong), the whitepaper stated that COB holders will be given a discounted rate to purchase underwritten tokens, never has it mentioned that tokens will be distributed for free to all COB holders.  This means one of two things: 1. COB has decided to airdrop CMT to guarantee a flying start for both the coins, and the next projects won't be airdropped 2. COB has decided to be very generous, and from now on all underwritten tokens will be airdropped.  Personally I think option number 1 is the more rational explanation, however I would really like to get a lot of free airdrops just by holding my COB's",False

First the exchange started with no pre-arranged tokens to trade beside cobs and Cybermiles. Secondly, the way token distribution is been conducted it's not fair to those who purchase the cobs ico. If you participated in the ico, the sharing of coin should first be based on people who actually participated in the ico then, others can buy and enjoy the benefits as well. For example, I purchased 4000 cob during the ico, was unable to upload it to the exchange before the deadline of of January 5th, that means I missed out of the CMT. so what's the benefit of been an Ico holder then?? That's very confusing. They were lots of people who purchased cob after the ico cheaper than those of us who bought the original ico, they get more benefits than us...

You had almost 2 months to do it since they announced! Why should they give you special treatment? You snooze, you lose.  As a matter of fact why should they give any ICO investor special treatment? It is good enough that ICO investors got the coins really cheap. Unlike most ICO's COB is way above ICO price, very little people managed to buy cheaper. Giving ICO investors special treatment will only alienate future investors - which will lower the price of the coin, in turn harming you!  How can you blame anyone when you are the one sleeping?

Maybe that is why ED is pushing so hard for their ICO and well rushing it. I think ED will be the first exchange that gets buried by cob. I have heard a number of times about problems with withdrawals. It seems there was technical problems with that. Kind of to be expected as they launched only couple of days ago. Apart fromt that I am very bullish. The circulating supply has increased recently and there was a sell-off stemming from that of all places on ED  . CMT airdrop on 5th Jan you will need to have your cob on cobinhood for that one. After it should mainly be up with the price if things start to work.  CMT trading on 24 Cent so will make a nice additional position. For each 500 cob roughly 27 CMT was latest I heard.,False

First time posting here since began investing in Sep. so hope this isn't a re-post. Initially got into some ICO's but was wondering in the case of cobinhood and possibly others in the future what would be a good method of registration. I was just starting the COB verification process and since this was the fist step; this question would be relevant for anyone who is a dual citizen who owns property in each country but currently resides in the USA. How should someone best register for either an ICO or exchange like cobinhood if asked for residency/nationality info, so that they do not potentially miss out on ICO's like regular US citizens who live in the USA? In my case I have both US and Brazilian passports and vote in both countries but live the majority of the year in the USA. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks.",False

Discounts on ICO tokens that Cobinhood underwrites; no need to swap COB for new tokens, you only need to hold them. The amount of ICO tokens that a COB holder can get at a lower rate is as follows: (ICO Tokens Received by COBINHOOD from ICO Underwriting Service) * (The Amount of COBs Owned) / (Total Amount of COBs)  3. The circulation will end at a good 250-300 million tokens after the ICO, while the rest is locked in a vesting pool to keep it that way.  4. They have also said that they will offer more privileges for token holders in the future, so thats another reason to invest if you trust in the companys ability to deliver on their promises.",False

Powered by successful Swiss international Job Platforms Jobstoday.ch; Jobstoday.de; Jobstoday.at; Jobstoday.pl, Global Jobcoin ICO has become very popular among cryptocurrency investors & enthusiast within a few days.  It is not a surprise since Global Jobcoin ICO is backed by an established & successful company. The Job platforms are already in the market since last 3 years & have already more than 5000 clients & 1 Million + users registered on their platforms.  On the market, there are many ICOs being announced daily but most of them don’t even have any company structure, no product, no prototype or the team has no experience in product & business development. Global Jobcoin ICO has ticked all the boxes for a successful ICO. It is apparent from the presale & extremely high interest in the crowd sale. Independent ICO rating agency ICObench.com has rated Global Jobcoin 4.7 from 5.  “The fact that any investor can check that we exist since 2014 & have a working successful product in Switzerland, Germany, Austria & Poland, gives them confidence that their investment is safe with us”, said Sanket Deshmukh, Co-founder & CEO of Jobstoday & Global Jobcoin. He further added, “We receive daily at least 100 mails from our potential investors who like our ICO & are pleased to invest in it. Today’s ICO investors are smart, intelligent & they see the potential in ICOs with working product. Distribution of tokens is very important factor in deciding about the ICO. Global Jobcoin founders only hold 10% of total tokens, so the manipulation of the price is not possible. Lots of ICOs are keeping a lot of tokens for themselves so that they can manipulate the price. We have been very transparent with our investors from the beginning & that makes a big difference. Besides that, we will only have a circulating supply of 70 Million tokens & we will also invest 10% of our global profits in buying back Global Jobcoin tokens from the market.”  “Cryptocurrency investors are pushing the technology to its next level. ICOs are here to stay & the ones with successful products will give the investors a good return in short or long term”, said Lukasz Ochnik, Co-founder & CTO of Jobstoday & Global Jobcoin. He further added, “We hear about various scam ICOs daily, I personally never invested in any ICO which doesn’t have a legal company structure, experienced team & at least a prototype. Another important factor is whether the company address is revealed on the website & they can be found in company registration directory of that country. I don’t understand how people should invest in an ICO if the company does not even want to reveal its address. We spent 2 months in planning the ICO with our great team. We looked at various factors & how we can guarantee our investors the return that we promise. Our token holders not only benefit from our rising token price but also from the 20% dividends that they receive from our worldwide profits.”  The Global Jobcoin presale is currently in progress & minimum investment of 10 ETH is accepted, tokens are guaranteed through a SAFT agreement during the presale. The public crowd sale will start on October 28. The hard cap is set at 200,000 ETH, which is approximately $60 Million.  About Global Jobcoin  Global Jobcoin is an ERC20 decentralized token to pay for services related to employment. Using the Ethereum blockchain, this token is created for employers & employees worldwide. Global Jobcoin will be used on all Job platforms of Jobstoday in Switzerland, Germany, Austria & Poland.

Why and specifically through what will the COB grow in value. For example if one of the benefits is reduced fees then would it not serve to purpose that a high valued token would not be beneficial. Buying the token would potentially cost a lot more then the fees I save? Secondly it talks about privileges for token holders. Do you distinguish between holders based on how many tokens they hold? Or does that not effect the benefits I can get.  Really love the platform and concept just can't help but feel that buying into the company would be great but is the token really going to rise in value or is it another ripple.  Thanks for the help.,False

The difference in privileges between holders is that if you own more COB, you can acquire more ICO tokens and margin loans at discounted rates.  The amount of ICO tokens that a COB holder can get at a lower rate is as follows: (ICO Tokens Received by COBINHOOD from ICO Underwriting Service) * (The Amount of COBs Owned) / (Total Amount of COBs)  Ripple is a payment system between banks with a circulation of 40 billion tokens.. not comparable to Cobinhood.  COB will have a circulation between 250-300 million tokens after the ICO, so the potential price gain is much higher than XRP.",False

The circulating supply will probably land at ~250 million after the ICO; unsold tokens will be vested if i understand correctly.  As a comparison we have Binance Coin, which peaked at ~3$/BNB in August with a circulation of 100 million tokens. The benefits of BNB are discounted trading fees and margin loans, but the discount percentage drops every year for 5 years. COB has discounts on both margin loans and underwritten ICO tokens with no yearly drops. There is obviously no need for a trading discount, because COBINHOOD doesnt have any trading fees!  COB is clearly a more valuable token on a more ambitious exchange platform, so when they go online in November, this coin could easily grow to at least 1$ within the first months.
