Maybe soon they will update more news in this exchange and we can hope BXY will be good value when the trading officially starts. I will wait and hope for the best start to this project.

I'm amazed at how you keep ignoring questions asked by the community. Anyone who does any research will find that you are obviously lying about many aspects of this project & many of your ""team"" are simply stolen identities from the web.  This is your last chance - unless you answer the questions I've asked on 4 occasions without reply, you'll leave me no choice but to open a scam accusation against your ""project"" where I will provide the proof of my findings.  Answer the fella Khilone7.  To be honest am surprised you're advising this scammy project.  thought you did well with Stratis.  such a shame.....     It's my policy to not engage with those kind of posts with no substance on Bitcointalk...   The very first sentence of your statement makes no sense. Questions do not require ""substance"" - statements do. Questions are asked in the pursuit of ""substance"", or facts as they are commonly called. You have constantly failed to provide any ""substance"" to back up your statements - it is you who lacks substance, nobody else.  You stated that Beaxy has an office in Chicago & I asked where - no ""substance"" needed for a simple question that requires a simple answer. However, I will give you some ""substance"" regarding your business office address which might help: according to the official Chicago Data Portal on business addresses & licenses, it doesn't exist. There isn't one:  https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Business-Licenses-Current-Active/uupf-x98q  What a surprise.  As for the rest of your ""look what I've done"" ramblings about Stratis, save it for the Stratis thread, it's off topic & won't help you or Stratis. You prattle on about it like it's some kind of get-out-of-jail-free card, it ain't. It's nobody's fault but your own that you decided to associate yourself with this scam that uses fake ID's, shill accounts & dodgy tax free registration domains etc, etc - you should have done some research yourself beforehand - or maybe you knew about this all the time?  It reminds me of when the user ""Emercoin Official"" posted this BS on the Emercoin thread:  Quote from: Emercoin Official on October 02, 2018, 02:32:25 PM Our offices are located in the United States, Spain, Germany, Ukraine and Russia.  Only they don't - it was a lie. When questioned about those fictitious office addresses the Official Emercoin account suddenly disappeared & hasn't been seen since - that was 5 months ago. I'm curious as to weather you'll be doing the same..... Oh, I have already archived the beaxy website just in case the faked/stolen ID's suddenly disappear.  I have a long list of info in preparation for your scam thread & it's getting longer by the day. If you want to save your precious reputation you need to either come clean or abandon this ""thing"", believe me.  Edit:  ***Khilone7 logs off***  Your silence is an admission of guilt.  Why have you lied about your business address?  And:  Quote from: blurryeyed on February 12, 2019, 07:12:32 PM Quote from: mandor on February 12, 2019, 03:39:57 AM how much longer do have to wait to exchange Beaxy and distribution tokens? this project has been running for almost 1 year and the prize participants are still waiting for their payment. it should be now BXY tokens have be listed on the market because have been running for very a long time but why still not?  You won't get a straight answer, only lies/false statements. This will go the way of all other shitokens, hype on it's listing to boost the price - then the usual dump by devs/bagholders.

Also, I'd still like an answer to these questions please:  Quote from: Enokkei on January 31, 2019, 07:15:02 PM As for Matt? He's an amazing marketing expert and entrepreneur....  Is that why there's not a single reference to Beaxy in any of his social feeds, some of which haven't been used for 2 years? That's a different kind of ""amazing marketing"".  Quote from: Enokkei on January 31, 2019, 07:15:02 PM Yes, Beaxy is registered in Nevis for regulatory reasons. However the main office is in Chicago with satellite teams around the world.  What regulatory reasons would make you choose a PO Box address that's on the ICIJ offshore watchlist?  What's the address of your Chicago office?   Nobody at beaxy has answered any of the above questions & I have already proven them to be liars about their office business address in Chicago & their use of fake ID's.  Makes you wonder what else they're lying about eh?  Of course, if they simply answered the questions then I wouldn't have to keep asking, would I? They love posting BS about transparency after all, so - lets see some.",False

So my sole reason on Bitcointalk is to spread the information for the people that don't follow Discord, Twitter, Telegram, Reddit or some other channel. Any legit questions about information about the project will be answered properly.  That being said, there already has been a post from one of the advisors who already confirmed he has worked with the others as well.  Anyone that knows me, knows that I have been with Stratis for over 2,5 years and that I have been helping them voluntarily for that period of time and I spend countless hours and still do. In that 2,5 years this is the first project I attached myself to in this compacity, meaning an official advisor. You can expect me to have done days of research, meaning reading every single document that has ever been published by Beaxy or a 3rd party about Beaxy, countless hours of asking questions and talking with the CEO and other key members of the project. As an advisor I try to bring value and awareness to this project in all ways I can imagine and they let me.  After all that research I decided to join Beaxy and ever since I did I have been more impressed by the day, these guys are one of the most transparent teams out there. All the information is out there for anyone to see. I advised them not to engage with posts of no substance on Bitcointalk as I rather have them focused on building the exchange which should launch in Q1.  We had this discussion before with our ambassadors and to explain that I wrote an article about it -> https://medium.com/khilone/beaxy-ambassadors-and-why-they-stand-behind-beaxy-51f768014b28  There are so many people in the Beaxy community already and interested in the project and so far we only got one person who keeps on bringing this up, the others know the advisors are legit. So I am not going to waste my time on 0.001% while 99.999 % knows it's legit.  I am not to going to engage after this post either, if you guys don't trust it, that's your good right and you can do whatever you want with it.  I want to close with that I would never get myself into with a scam project, my core values in crypto and life always have been honesty, transparency and loyalty so I expect the projects I work with (Stratis and Beaxy) to work along the same values.  I have been over this with Stratis countless times as well, and so many false claims were made there, it's part of crypto and Bitcointalk. I for one don't spend my energy on it (except for this one post).",False

Questions do not require ""substance"" - statements do. Questions are asked in the pursuit of ""substance"", or facts as they are commonly called. You have constantly failed to provide any ""substance"" to back up your statements - it is you who lacks substance, nobody else.  You stated that Beaxy has an office in Chicago & I asked where - no ""substance"" needed for a simple question that requires a simple answer. However, I will give you some ""substance"" regarding your business office address which might help: according to the official Chicago Data Portal on business addresses & licenses, it doesn't exist. There isn't one:  https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Business-Licenses-Current-Active/uupf-x98q  What a surprise.  As for the rest of your ""look what I've done"" ramblings about Stratis, save it for the Stratis thread, it's off topic & won't help you or Stratis. You prattle on about it like it's some kind of get-out-of-jail-free card, it ain't. It's nobody's fault but your own that you decided to associate yourself with this scam that uses fake ID's, shill accounts & dodgy tax free registration domains etc, etc - you should have done some research yourself beforehand - or maybe you knew about this all the time?  It reminds me of when the user ""Emercoin Official"" posted this BS on the Emercoin thread:  Quote from: Emercoin Official on October 02, 2018, 02:32:25 PM Our offices are located in the United States, Spain, Germany, Ukraine and Russia.  Only they don't - it was a lie. When questioned about those fictitious office addresses the Official Emercoin account suddenly disappeared & hasn't been seen since - that was 5 months ago. I'm curious as to weather you'll be doing the same..... Oh, I have already archived the beaxy website just in case the faked/stolen ID's suddenly disappear.  I have a long list of info in preparation for your scam thread & it's getting longer by the day. If you want to save your precious reputation you need to either come clean or abandon this ""thing"", believe me.  Edit:  ***Khilone7 logs off***",False

Next to that their exchange is almost live, which means an immediate use case for your investment in the $BXY token including liquidity and volume. For me this is a no-brainer, sure there is a lot of competition, but there is room for multiple exchanges to succeed. 3M USD is not a small amount in exchange for just some utility token. As far as I understand developers retain 100% of exchange ownership and profit to themselves. So in fact the private investors invest not in the project or the company, but just buy some utility token with expectations of a fast profit. During the public sale (where the tokens will be 2-4 times more expensive, than they were for the private 'whale' investors), those private investors will sell their tokens for 2x-4x immediate ROI, so I am sure the token could be bought from the market much cheaper than for $0.41 the company is going to sell it. Maybe $0.2 in average, taking into account that most private investors entered considerably cheaper than that.  In any case I would not consider the token being a good investment at the current price of $0.2. If the exchange would share the part of revenue with the investors, or use the part of profit to buy back and burn some of the coin from market, that would be quite different story.  That could be the reason why investments are not flowing in at the moment, and project funding is not going that well.",False

Do you have any idea how much it costs legally to get all the paperwork for FIAT in the EU and USA, that alone costs millions. After that they have to developer a whole exchange, set up customer service, marketing etc.  I have seen exchanges raised much more and offering way less, so based on all those comparisons, I would say its a fair amount that Beaxy is raising.  I didn't say 19M in general is a small raise, I stated that for what they want to achieve (their ambition), 19M is a fair raise.  As with almost any ICO, an investor invests in the token and not in the company, unless you buy equity. So I don't get your point on that, that's pretty standard, that's every single ICO.  The utility token has an important role to play in the exchange though, so that creates the value for you as an investor in the token. So when you invest in an utility token, you have to check what utility it gives you and what the chances are that it makes you profit next to the speculation part of the token. In almost every other utility token you would invest you only buy it for speculation, because next to exchanges there is almost no utility token that brings value to the token right away. Most of them are years away from adding utility to their token, because they need adoption etc.  You have to read better next time, because you mention if the exchange would share the part of revenue with the investors, that would be quite a different story. Well that's exactly what they do. As mentioned in my article:  Beaxy chose to use an alternative token for their Loyalty Rewards Program, the PLUS ($PLS) token. The $PLS token will apply to be a registered security token in applicable jurisdiction. $PLS tokens may not be transferred or sold to a third-party but can be exchanged for $BXY tokens at a 1:1 rate. It will not be a part of the Token Sale process. Important to note is that due to regulatory uncertainty, $PLS will not be available for United States citizens.  So how does the program work? Qualified holders will receive a percentage of transaction fees collected based on the duration the $PLS tokens are locked, and the percentage of each user’s share among all locked $PLS tokens. Up to 1 month: receive 15% of fees collected 1–6 months: receive 20% of fees collected Beyond 6 months: receive 25% of fees collected  This is a very innovative approach that could mean that a lot of the $BXY tokens are of the markets and as a staker, you can earn a nice amount of fees if the Beaxy Exchange is a success.  So Beaxy is sharing 25% of their fees collected with their stakers. This is next to their discount in fees you get with paying in the BXY token.",False

Indeed, I admittedly skipped the PLUS token part when reading. Actually the words ""Loyalty Rewards Program"" triggered my skipping reflex - the name didn't suggest anything of interest, or anything related to profit share  I had a bit of negative bias towards the project - I think mostly caused by the annoying KYC requirement, even for small users and small transactions. There is something making me very uncomfortable when I have to submit my documents and selfie photos to some entity in the internet (I would say, requirement to submit a selfie with doc in hand is kinda humiliating too). I still believe this should be avoided at least for smaller trades, and in especially in the trial stage, until exchange get popular.  In general, on the second thought, I agree, the program sounds interesting, though still at current entry cost, I would not consider this to be a steal, though it is comparatively low-risk and still could provide a 110-120% [almost] immediate returns. But that's just my problem - I should have found this and entered earlier.  Regarding your statement on utility tokens without any utility, couldn't agree more - there are heaps of them, but they do not deserve any consideration, as those are mostly just a pump'n'pump trading toys. This one at least has a clear usage, so is worth considering.",False
