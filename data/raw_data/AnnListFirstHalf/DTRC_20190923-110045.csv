This is no mean feat and one that demands a little insight into what the platform is all about.  Datarius Cryptobank is a decentralized, partially closed P2P platform that gives users a chance to select the many applications and various services it offers. The Datarius Cryptobank’s approach ensures that users can maximize on the conveniences possible while reducing the cost of whatever transactions they make.  Overview of the Datarius Cryptobank  The platform is primarily a link or marketplace that brings together practitioners in the financial industry such as lenders and borrowers and their target services providers such as fund providers and managers, analysts, insurance companies and even trading terminals. The platform intends to provide all these players with adequate automation that eliminates the stereotypes associated with systems and services as well as communications with customers in the financial services sector.  The Hurdles that Datarius Cryptobank Seeks to Solve  The providers in the financial marketing as it is, are not able to offer their customers the maximum number of products that the said market offers. Also, the many boundaries existing in the sector makes it difficult for providers to offer cutting-edge benefits to customers.  Advantages of the Datarius Cryptobank Platform  The platform shall offer the most comprehensive set of tools for facilitating currency transactions, one-to-one lending, investment programmes, demand deposits, credit for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), card programs for intrasystem as well as access to partner companies. Also, the Datarius Cryptobank shall offer a new scoring model that uses a combination of algorithms that employ the data available from a set of authorized partners. Besides, the platform is built on the blockchain and shall use the novel capabilities of this technology to broaden the set of services it can offer. Importantly, it shall provide a verification method that is trustable and unique, and that allows providers to set limits to users according to some predefined criteria.  Datarius Cryptobank is now on the Bancor Network  Token holders and would-be holders can now trade the Datarius Credit Token on the Bancor Network. This development is essential since the Bancor Network allows users to avoid the limitations of the counterparty in all the transactions they make on the network. Moreover, by joining the Bancor Network, Datarius Cryptocurrency is ensuring that its users can afford continuous liquidity, on-chain conversions that don’t require users to create accounts. Also, counterparts aren’t necessary since tokens can be converted on-chain directly.  Hottest: Grab Free 10,000 DTRC Token  Aside from the many developments witnessed in the Datarius Cryptobank circles, the platform has announced a thrilling competition among members of its community. The theme of the said competition is “Why do you think the future is for p2p banks?” Participants can either write an article addressing the said topic in no more than 3000 symbols or do a video presentation lasting no more than three minutes. The winners shall receive 10 000 DTRC from the platform.

The Bancor network is a new way to trade DTRC tokens and provides some interesting features.  Bancor is more than a standard exchange in the sense that there is no counterparty in transactions made on the network. Tokens can be converted without the need to match two parties with opposite wants. This is possible thanks to a simple algorithm balancing buys and sells so that every token in the network maintains a formulaic relationship to others. This includes numerous advantages such as:  · Continuous liquidity, tokens can be converted at any time regardless of buyers and sellers or trade volume  · No counterparts as tokens are converted directly on-chain as opposed to exchanges where there is a third party involved in the transaction  · No deposit required on Bancor, you use the funds directly on your wallet, no need to wait for deposits to arrive on Bancor  · No registration, on-chain conversion of tokens happens directly on your web3 wallet  Start purchasing DTRC on the Bancor App Since Bancor works a bit differently than standard exchanges in order to offer better features, we have created this step-by-step video tutorial to guide you through the process. We will show you how to create your web3 wallet (Metamask), buy DTRC on Bancor with your web3 wallet and see your DTRC balance in your Metamask wallet:  https://youtu.be/LDw8mYH1QyA  What’s more: you can trade DTRC with any token available on the Bancor network Thanks to its specific protocol, Bancor offers the interesting possibility of buying any token available on the platform… with any other token available on the platform. This means an impressive number of token pairs available. So if you do not want to buy DTRC with ETH, you can do so with another token you might already own and which is available on Bancor.   ⚠️ Remember that for any transaction to go through on the Ethereum blockchain you need a gas payment in ETH, so even if you are not trading with ETH you will pay for gas in ETH, always leave some on the side 👍 Let’s socialise with Datarius on the following social media channels  · ✈️ Telegram Group: https://t.me/datariusgroup  · 🕊️ Twitter: https://twitter.com/datariuscrypto  · 🤖 Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/datariuscryptobank/  · Ⓜ️ Medium : https://medium.com/@datariuscryptobank  · 📘 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/datariuscryptobank/",True

First and foremost, the Datarius project was intended as a unique social fintech project. What does it mean? We decided to provide our users with almost full freedom of action and to completely remove the team core from the main project’s functions, reserving only the platform technical support, a wide range of additional services and marketing. This step paves the way for minimizing the cost of all services. The cost of all services will be build by the users independently, thanks to a convenient designer. Almost at any step, absolutely any user will be able to order any additional service provided directly by the Datarius Cryptobank team or by accredited third-party services.  Datarius is the only cryptoproject that integrates such social functions as Trust Limit and Trust Management. Any user can provide access to a certain amount of funds at one time to a specific user or a group of users. The users will no longer need to constantly log into their accounts to make small similar transactions.  Datarius is the first project aimed at implementing the most frequently used and popular functionality in a “single window” mode. We implement the best classical solutions, remove the drawbacks, make it available from any nook of the world, socialize and get the product, which most relevant to the market requirements and needs.  https://medium.com/@datariuscryptobank/what-makes-datarius-stand-out-from-the-similar-projects-261f4ba5df9e",True

What does it mean? We decided to provide our users with almost full freedom of action and to completely remove the team core from the main project’s functions, reserving only the platform technical support, a wide range of additional services and marketing. This step paves the way for minimizing the cost of all services. The cost of all services will be build by the users independently, thanks to a convenient designer. Almost at any step, absolutely any user will be able to order any additional service provided directly by the Datarius Cryptobank team or by accredited third-party services.  Datarius is the only cryptoproject that integrates such social functions as Trust Limit and Trust Management. Any user can provide access to a certain amount of funds at one time to a specific user or a group of users. The users will no longer need to constantly log into their accounts to make small similar transactions. Datarius is the first project aimed at implementing the most frequently used and popular functionality in a “single window” mode. We implement the best classical solutions, remove the drawbacks, make it available from any nook of the world, socialize and get the product, which most relevant to the market requirements and needs.",True

This step paves the way for minimizing the cost of all services. The cost of all services will be build by the users independently, thanks to a convenient designer. Almost at any step, absolutely any user will be able to order any additional service provided directly by the Datarius Cryptobank team or by accredited third-party services.  Datarius is the only cryptoproject that integrates such social functions as Trust Limit and Trust Management. Any user can provide access to a certain amount of funds at one time to a specific user or a group of users. The users will no longer need to constantly log into their accounts to make small similar transactions.

Decentralized banking is a term that has been construed in the wake of the cryptocurrency boom.  That is because cryptocurrencies are the first intelligent asset that can create such a tool.  And because of this, many are referring to decentralized banking as “crypto banking.” Cryptobanks are decentralized platforms that provide the usual services that centralized banks provide, primarily lending services and credit scoring, but essentially cuts out all of the middlemen that a centralized bank uses. The people needed in a bank to approve loans and structure financial data are replaced in a crypto banking ecosystem by smart contracts and p2p, peer-to-peer, services.  Currently, most of the network will be online, as all issues can be solved online. The “bank” takes shape in the form of a computer interface, whether on a desktop or a phone, and the currencies dealt with are mostly cryptocurrencies.  2.How is this different from decentralized exchanges?  Decentralized exchanges or DEX swap currencies, while decentralized banking swaps credit and trust.  DEX, which is also a new concept, utilizes p2p transactions between two users who want each other’s currency. For example, if Alice wants to sell six ETH for five BTC, and Bob wants to sell five BTC for six ETH, the DEX exchange will trade these for them without a middleman. Cryptobanking utilizes decentralized p2p trading in the same way but uses it for lending purposes. While the lending process sounds a lot more complicated, the goal is to make it as automated a possible- making transactions fast like DEX exchanges.  3.What kind of technologies do crypto banks use?  P2P, #Blockchain, #cryptocurrencies, Machine Learning, Big Data and smart contracts are used in crypto banking.  P2P. Participants are private users, not banking institutions. The crypto bank links a borrower that meets the correct credentials to a lender. P2P takes away many of the bureaucratic processes that centralized banks need to go through when approving a loan.  Blockchain. All transactions are recorded on the Blockchain. It is a transparent, immutable ledger that will provide data for users and well as AI algorithms to find the right matches for lenders and borrowers.  Machine Learning Big Data.These technologies help to automate the lending process and cut through bureaucracy. AI can work 24/7 and match lenders with borrowers.  Cryptocurrencies. While fiat can be used in decentralized banking, cryptocurrencies operate much smoother and will become the sole future of decentralized banking. These decentralized currencies speak the language of the Blockchain and keep perfect track of asset transactions.  Smart Contract. Smart contracts are used for a variety of reasons in crypto banking, such as converting currencies, binding contracts between two parties and automating transference of funds between the borrower and lender.  4.Do crypto banks have their own native currency?  Yes. Native cryptocurrencies help make the bank global.  Datarius, the first social p2p crypto bank, for instance, uses their own native token DTRC for all transactions. This helps create a standard for a global payment system within the p2p lending process. Tokens are easily transferable to other cryptocurrencies, as well as fiat. The native cryptocurrency speaks the language of the native Blockchain and creates an incentive for the currency to appreciate in value. It gives the token concrete utility; an essential part of the puzzle.  5.How safe is p2p lending? Can machine learning really find the right borrower for a lender’s standards?  While the process is automated, there are plenty of toggle functions which lets borrowers and lenders control with whom they want to work.  In the company’s model, borrowers are categorized into three different listings, which range from the minimally verified borrower, via verified transactions made by the borrower on, say, the Datarius Blockchain, to fully transparent borrowers who are reviewed by risk management. Less trustworthy individuals can account for higher interest rates and build up credit, and those with high credit can ask for lower interest rates. But these decisions are really up to the lender, which makes p2p wonderful- decentralized banking will see some new interest rates based on people interaction.  6.What is social lending?  Social lending looks at many aspects of a borrower to determine their score.  Thanks to Big Data and AI, crypto banks can see beyond a borrower's credit score to identify their level of trust. Listings can include Trust Limit, Trust Management and User Ratings which helps AI decide if the participant is justified in borrowing from a specific lender.  Particularly, Trust Limit, for instance, gives the possibility to automatically pick up some funds from your wallet by any user according to your requirements, say, ratings, user groups, etc.  It will allow to automate lending with small amounts. Based on this, there will also be the so-called ""credit"" cards, and when you have insufficient funds, you will automatically pick up some from Trust Limit. And that is one of the main points of socialization - you can ""trust"" every user of the system.  7.What other ways does machine learning help?  AI contributes in many ways in a decentralized banking system, including fraud, forecasting, scoring and calculations.  Fight fraud. Tracking suspicious transactions and artificial rating raising; having automated systems for finding unreliable users with high probability. This is what allows Daritus to create a social aspect to their rating system. AI helps stomp out fraudsters and give room for users to be judged on points other than credit.  Forecasting. This will help lenders understand the risks involved with borrowers. AI forecasting can also predict when payments are likely to be made based on the borrower’s data.  Scoring. Risk assessment when granting a loan. This can come from a wide variety of big data from the borrower.  8.Is the reach larger than that of centralized banks?  Decentralized banking is global.  The advantage to using a universal cryptocurrency, AI automation, and ease of access via cell phone means that users can access all over the world. This will also create a huge market for micro-loans, a service made popular for startup businesses in developing areas by offering small loans to people with zero credit but known in the community as trustworthy. Crypto banks will create a large loan marketplace throughout the globe that traditional banking can never touch. Centralized banks are restricted to brick and mortar locations, bureaucracy and many people to pay. Decentralized banks do not have these strings attached and can easily scale globally. A global economy will be stimulated through global banking.  9.What are the benefits of decentralized banking?  In today’s world, 2.5 bln people do not have access to banks.  Yet, only one bln don’t have access to cell phones. Decentralized banking has the mobile infrastructure to allow those without access that to at least have a chance at having a decentralized bank. Simple mobile wallets will be used to store cryptocurrencies, and DApps can give many people an opportunity to take out loans and have a shot at starting something big. These banks can reach places that centralized, traditional banks will never reach, the truth is that centralized banks are becoming too bulky in light of Blockchain and the fall of the middleman..",True

My experience and track record of high performance provide the depth and expertise required to elevate my clients’ businesses and execute a successful ICO / ITO launch. I provide customized solutions to clients to help them meet their strategic goals. As an industry leader I have helped raise well over $75M usd in ICO funding for various blockchain start-ups.  I am dedicated to providing the best advice to founding teams, corporate’s, and funds on how to optimize ICO execution while navigating the increasingly complex legal and tax hurdles involved. I am also dedicated to providing potential investors a thorough evaluation and opinion of a projects ability to have an ROI, market share and mass adoption. These analytics are done through both qualitative and quantitative risk analysis and “deep research” form of due diligence.  I am available to provide council through an individual and non-technical approach, and can explain the underlying technology and provide individuals and groups the knowledge to take advantage of emerging technology as an early adopter and make sound investment choices.  I have been involved as an investor and promoter of cryptocurrency since 2013.  I am personally invested in more than 30 current and closed ico’s and make investment decisions through a process of extreme due diligence and risk assessment to which I have 27 years experience in both quantitative and qualitative risk analysis.  This effort and investment in time has translated into a very successful and diverse portfolio that includes investment in 4 (pre ico) unicorns and convertible proffered equity stakes in numerous projects.    Why did you get involved with the Datarius Cryptobank ICO?  The idea that it is a P2P platform that greatly reduces transaction costs, I believe is the differentiator and future of crypto trading.   Why do you think it is such a powerful idea?  Self governance and P2P is the basis of blockchain and crypto currency. When it can all be integrated into one platform, that is the most extraordinary and powerful tool one can possess. I also believe this has the potential for investor ROI in both the short and long term.

It finished successfully — the project raised over $ 500,000, four times the projected SoftCap level that was quite limited for this stage. The round was preceded by seven months of work on the project development and three months of the active advertising campaign.  #Datarius is the first social p2p cryptobank. Actually, the word “social” should be primarily emphasized. You can see a large number of cryptobanks actively emerging on the market. In this respect, 2018 promises to be the year of the first commercial releases. However, so far no one cares so much about the fintech socialization, as the Datarius project team does. What is the “socialization” and is it really necessary? Yes, indeed.  The direct user interaction between each other is no longer a unique model, including in the finance. At the same time, most competitors simply copy classical models and transfer them to the blockchain. Datarius is different. The project team decided to entirely avoid strict regulation, reserving only the website technical support and providing a wide range of related services on an equal basis with other project’s partners. Thus, the team plans to completely address the traditional systems’ shortcomings — lobbying and toxic assets promotion. No more product line imposed on the customer, no document packages binding on everybody, no template correspondence, and forcing high paying partners. Lenders will make their own decisions based on a huge amount of input data and will vote with a dollar for one or another application. Users will have the freedom to choose the most appropriate terms and conditions to borrow funds. And if any participant doubts — he can always consult analysts, risk managers, databases, credit and user ratings, the whole history of transactions and expert opinion — not one and not just of the project’s staff. Datarius will provide three listings with different trust levels — from the borrowers minimally verified by the system algorithms and to the completely transparent borrowers, thoroughly reviewed by the project’s Risk Department. Any interested user, at any time, can personally order one or another related service — in-depth computer evaluation, evaluation by project partners, evaluation by the Risk Department, evaluation by user-managers and so on. The results will be immediately available to all other users. Accordingly, one or another application can automatically shift from one listing to another in keeping with the wishes of the project participants, and not merely as preferred by the submitting user. If the user needs no additional services, we will charge just a symbolic fee. This model will allow partner projects, including blockchain, as well as simple professional users or trained users, to independently determine the cost of their services and to earn with the project, acting both as a project participant and as a consumer of the project services.

Constantly improving and listening to its community participants, the first social #p2p Datarius Cryptobank is pleased to announce a…  The #Datarius team is the first and the only one to identify the integration of the social function Trust Limits as its highest priority. The implementation of this function will allow all users to outline the conditions related to the use of their funds by third parties. The Condition Designer will allow both to establish the classic Trust Limit used for regular micropayments to deemed trusted recipients, and to use it for the automated microlending. Now when using services of a writer for your blog, you have no need to choose between two options: to pay for each article written or to make an advance payment. It will be enough to set a limit for a daily write-off and a maximum monthly write-off for a certain user. All you have to do is monitoring. If you have some surplus funds, there is no need to select an offsetting order on the exchange — you are enough to set a rule for a certain user group or all users, underlying the required conditions (minimum rating score, verification level of the limit recipients, minimum-maximum term, % rate or its absence, targeted/non-targeted use, possibility to withdraw funds from the ecosystem, etc.). The system will automatically notify eligible users of the possibility and conditions to use the limit, and will automatically offer to use the limit in case of lack of their own funds upon the invoice receipt. You’ll experience total non-interference by the team, only a set of user conditions and a customer choice. Isn’t that a freedom and sociality of the fintech?  The format allows us to describe only the key differences. The traditional financial instruments used in the project have been revised and adapted. They have imbibed the basic idea of the project. More details can be found in the WP and discussed in the group, where the project founders regularly answer the community’s thorny questions. This point is also a distinguishing feature of a socially oriented project.  Speaking of the team, such a dynamic development of the idea was possible outright thanks to a strong creative team of like-minded people and a pool of advisers that joined the project. Let’s see what the participants think about the project:  Alexey Vuyko (COO):  I have 15 years of successful career in various financial institutions under mys belt. The specialization is different, the format is the same: vertical structures; over-regulation, limited authority, staffing tables, functional responsibilities, perspective to move to grade +1 … Could the next employer be like the previous one? Fortunately, no! The company iCryptoSA is totally different. TOTALLY really means TOTALLY: from the company’s corporate structure to a completely new product to be revealed to the world in the near future. This will be a bank free of all the shortcomings identified with classical banking: high fees, biased rules, queues, geographic attachment, long transactions, lack of trust, limited tools, etc.  I was really glad to join the team of professionals and to find personal fulfillment at an entirely new level.  The project attracted me by its revolutionary innovation, scale, complexity and, if you like, audacity. I feel comfortable with diverse complex professional challenges and enjoy the achievements on the verge of creativity and risk. I am pleased to work in a team of like-minded professionals at the forefront of financial technologies. I expect the project to be challenging and full of sizeable achievements. It means a lot to me to be part of a new ecological system in business, to work for results and to change the world for the better. And Datarius gives me this opportunity.#Cryptorize!  Ruslan Vasyutin :  I thank my lucky stars to be in the Datarius team! Working within the same company and in the same position of the top manager for the last 10 years, I started to notice that my development was stagnating. In this regard, I became more open to innovation in my career. And what could be more perfect in this case than being literally on the cutting edge of ultra modern business?!  I’ve got a great opportunity to develop every day and to enjoy my personal growth. I am very glad that my “classic” top management experience at the insurance company can be effectively used here, in particular, in the development and implementation of the marketing strategy, institutional development, international project management, and teamwork. Datarius provides me not only with my favorite work, but also with a wonderful team, interesting tasks, many professional challenges and involvement in a new paradigm of financial culture.  The ecosystem, which Datarius successfully develops, is essential to society at the current stage of its development. This is a progressive stage in terms of increased confidence in financial institutions, in the state and in each other! I am confident that the project will give me and all its participants many more opportunities for self-fulfilment and reasons to look forward with pride.  Expert opinion of Jason Hung (MBAT Bank Chairman & Co-founder):  The traditional financial institutions and their clients have had unequal relations for a long time. Today, the famous banks compared with the banks one hundred years ago have not made any significant progress in the nature of their service and their service modes, except for the more magnificent decoration and higher office buildings. Traditional financial institutions will only make Icing on the cake, but never offer fuel in snowy. There is no substantive contribution to future needs from the world. Due to the centralized credit evaluation mechanism, the centralized financial institutions can not fulfill the ever-changing future of innovation, so centralized financial institutions have become increasingly inconsistent with the needs of the future. Datarius P2P financial platform let me see the possibility of new financial institutions in the near future. The peculiarities of the blockchain are a good foundation for future financial services, and then what we need is a finance-professional team with advanced blockchain technology and innovation idea to prepare for the future of the world. Datarius team is strong, professional, hard working and groundbreaking qualities which is one of my favorite blockchain projects.  Expert opinion of Dmitry Dzherikhov (Head of Sales and Trading Millenium Capital):  I firmly believe that classical banking will lose its marketshare over time as well as classical way of money and value. It is obvious already today that cryptocurrency holds big portion in many investment portfolios. Thus, cryptobanking is natural reach to service that cryptocurrency as well as other P2P assignments covered by classic banking today.  Returning to the project’s prospects. As far back as January, the team made an executive decision to launch the product as soon as possible. The launch will be effected through the integration of the DTRC token into a classic core, which has been under the development of the large studio ?rtARTERY with an extensive experience in developing classical banking applications since mid-2017. The project will simultaneously develop its own blockchain — the duration of this process will depend directly on the results of the main round. This will ensure the launch of Datarius and will prevent it from becoming another neverending project. Though the main round hasn’t finished yet, the company has already submitted an application for a DPL license, which completely covers the legal framework for implementing and launching a commercial version of an ecosystem with its basic functionality, including all the project’s social functions and key integrations. The limited token emission and ensured lack of additional rounds in addition to the team’s strategic goals to celebrate 1,000,000 users as early as 2019 — the only risk all this involves is the risk of failure to become the holder of probably one of the popular tokens of the near future.  From the interview for the cryptoanalyst: “We believe in what we are doing and we are confident that the format of the fintech we propose is the format of the future.”  The main ITO round will start on March 5, 2018 at 12:12 UTC.

The project has already experienced more than a year of preparatory work, attention from key personalities and companies, crypto-community support, highly successful pre-ITO round, gap analysis, a fivefold increase in the number of community members since the beginning of the year, and high ratings of the rating agencies.  What is #Datarius?  #Datarius is the first social p2p cryptobank. The main idea of the project is to provide the consumer with the widest range of financial instruments. The widest possible. To bring the maximum number of financial consumers together. To give freedom of choice and action. To provide a high level of automation. To create a truly social fintech product. We will prove by ourselves that the decentralization and lack of borders are benefits, and a financial company can and should be a partner and a friend. No one fintech project has thus far paid so much attention to socialization and direct interaction between the participants. The project team decided to completely eliminate the strict regulation, preserving only the technical support of the platform and providing a wide range of the related services on an equal basis with other project partners. Users will have the right to choose the most appropriate cost and terms of borrowing funds. They will always be able to call on analysts, risk managers, databases, credit and user ratings, the entire history of transactions and expert opinion — not one and not just of the project’s staff.  Why participate in #ITO?  DTRC token is a unique key and the only tool to access all the benefits of the Cryptobank: loans with the most favorable terms, joint investments, personal piggy cryptobank, trust limits, trust management and much more. The ITO round, which runs from March 5th to April 5th, is the last chance to become the key holder and get significant bonuses. The emission of tokens will end together with the round. The number of people, willing to gain access to the most complete set of financial instruments, will continuously grow and the number of tokens will remain the same forever. This is the last unique opportunity to become an active user of the bank of the future and start earning money with the project’s team.  What to do?  It is rather simple to become a part of the future. You have only to:  - Visit the Datarius official website and register as a future member at ito.datarius.io  - Subscribe to any project’s official social media to stay abreast of the latest news, updates and to follow the Datarius development.  - Participate in the Referral Program of the project and share your vision and information with friends to get an additional 5% bonus.  - Come on March 5 at 12:12 UTC to participate directly in ITO and get a 30% bonus.  And speaking of bonuses, note that following the ITO restructuring, the project’s bonus grid is as follows now:  30% — 0–6 hours; 25% — 6–12 hours; 20% — 12–24 hours; 15% — 24–48 hours; 10% — 48h (hours) -15d (days) Since the 15th day and until the round completion no bonuses will be available.

It has been more than a month since the completion of the first social p2p Cryptobank Datarius pre-ITO. It's amazing how time can be differently felt. Before working closely on the project, the month seemed incredibly monotonous. Now, with the approach of one of the most important events for the team – the main ITO round, scheduled for March 5, time is getting tighter around us like a tangible substance.  From the very beginning of the year, the team has been actively working on the project. We had a very important task ahead – gap analysis. Although, we reached SoftCap four times higher than it was planned, we continued to think that we could anyway took results to another level. Almost half of January we have spent actively collecting and analyzing all the information, working closely with the advisers and actively negotiating with potential future partners, listening carefully to the core of our community and monitoring the campaigns of our partner and competitors.  The first results of intensive work have led to changes in the ITO campaign structure. Thus, following consultations with investment analysts, advisers of financial projects and partner blockchain projects, the nominal value of DTRC is reduced from $ 1 to $ 0.01. HardCap is also lowered from 67 M to 51 M. The Token Distribution Structure has been recalculated and changed. Today it is as follows: Bounty — 2%;  Partners — 5%;  Datarius Team— 5%;  Reserve Fund — 15%.  We have also reviewed the analytical data on the main stage structure. Our marketing team has developed and approved the optimal Bonus Program in our view:  in the first 6 hours each participant receives a 30% bonus in DTRC tokens;  from 6 to 12 hours — a 25% bonus;  from 12 to 24 hours — a 20% bonus;  24—48 hours since the ITO launch— a 15% bonus;  from the 3rd till the 15th day of the ITO each participant receives a 10% bonus;  from the 15th day bonus tokens shall be neither allocated nor emitted .  Having analyzed the collected statistics on questions and numerous requests, we have launched a Referral Program. With regard to these amendments, we have changed the smart contract and the token swap, during which the Pre-Sale DAT ticker was replaced by the official DTRC, new tokens were recalculated and additionally paid to the participants of the closed round and Pre-Sale, and in the process the technical error of the previous smart-contract related to the incorrect bonus calculation was fixed Our next step was a conversion. Based on the figures received, we had to almost completely change the website structure. We get more experts involved to arrange the site blocks according to the requirements of our target audience. Having processed the main issues encountered during the Pre-Sale, we almost tripled the amount of information, structured and presented it in the most accessible and terse manner. The site will become truly multilingual and will speak 5 basic languages before the ITO launch. We have also enhanced the technical part – the new site runs faster on all types of devices.  The project’s roadmap has also encountered some changes. In our opinion, we have agreed the major milestone: to launch the commercial version of the project as quickly as possible by integrating the ERC20 token into the interfaces being already under the development upon our request. This solution will allow promptly implementing almost all of the announced functionality and presenting a pilot version as early as autumn 2018 with a commercial product open presentation scheduled for the end of the year. We decided to simultaneously develop our own blockchain. Therefore, we will be able to demonstrate the results of our work at all times and promote the project among new potential users, encouraging the project participants. With confidence in our strategy, we made no changes to the strategic objectives related to the number of the Datarius Ecosystem’s active users. The number of 1 million active users, planned for May 2019, now seems even more achievable and tangible. The team has been also changed. A number of agreements concluded before the Company’s registration have been renegotiated. The license application has been submitted. Four experts of worldwide standing have joined the team of Datarius advisers. Now we have the following experts continuously working with us on the project:  Simon Cocking — a Blockchain and IT specialist with 20 years of experience in information technology.  Nikolay Zvezdin — an expert in the field of financial audit and consulting, attracting private and venture investments to the projects. During his bright career he has worked on projects in heavy industry, energy, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications in the US, Japan, China, Russia, Hong Kong. His work as an Executive Director at Enlight Visionary and as a Financial Director at Envinary Group is incredibly impressive.  Douglas Lyons — an advisor with 27 years of investment and risk management experience. Douglas has in recent years devoted himself to studying and working on the technology of the distributed ledger, consulting the blockchain startups, assisting them in launching ICO.  Jason Hang — a professional with extensive experience in the marketing, blockchain and mobile technologies. For 20 years, Jason has been creating and assisting in establishing companies that change the world around – Treascovery, Chidopi, TimeBox, SuchApp and. We continue to take proactive measures to launch our ambitious project – the pioneering social p2p Cryptobank Datarius. We believe that we can create a truly unique and highly demanded product.

What does it mean? We decided to provide our users with almost full freedom of action and to completely remove the team core from the main project’s functions, reserving only the platform technical support, a wide range of additional services and marketing. This step paves the way for minimizing the cost of all services. The cost of all services will be build by the users independently, thanks to a convenient designer. Almost at any step, absolutely any user will be able to order any additional service provided directly by the Datarius Cryptobank team or by accredited third-party services. Datarius is the only cryptoproject that integrates such social functions as Trust Limit and Trust Management. Any user can provide access to a certain amount of funds at one time to a specific user or a group of users. The users will no longer need to constantly log into their accounts to make small similar transactions. Datarius is the first project aimed at implementing the most frequently used and popular functionality in a “single window” mode. We implement the best classical solutions, remove the drawbacks, make it available from any nook of the world, socialize and get the product, which most relevant to the market requirements and needs.

On the basis of the numerous consultations, the recommendations received from the respected project Advisers, and as a result of the in-depth study of the model, we have adopted a number of amendments related to both the distribution of tokens and the ITO structure.  In particular:  The nominal value of the token has been changed and now it is equivalent to $ 0.01. All the participants of the previous rounds will automatically receive a difference in the near future (before the start of the main round). The structure of the tokens distribution has been slightly changed and today it is as follows: Bounty - 2%; Partners - 5%; Team - 5%; Reserve Fund - 15%. The number of tokens available to participants remains the same - 73%. The structure of the main round of ITO has been changed as follows: +30% - 0-6 hours; 25% - 6-12 hours; 20% - 12-24 hours; 15% - 24-48 hours; 10% - 48h (HOURS) -15d (DAYS) 0% 15d + -. The level of HardCap has also been amended. We have taken a clear decision to reduce it to $ 51,000,000. In the near future, these amendments will be recorded in all the main project’s documents. We are continuously working on optimizing and improving the model. Thank you for your interest in our project, your support and participation. Together we will undoubtedly achieve our goals.

On the basis of the numerous consultations, the recommendations received from the respected project Advisers, and as a result of the in-depth study of the model, we have adopted a number of amendments related to both the distribution of tokens and the ITO structure.  In particular:  The nominal value of the token has been changed and now it is equivalent to $ 0.01. All the participants of the previous rounds will automatically receive a difference in the near future (before the start of the main round). The structure of the tokens distribution has been slightly changed and today it is as follows: Bounty - 2%; Partners - 5%; Team - 5%; Reserve Fund - 15%. The number of tokens available to participants remains the same - 73%. The structure of the main round of ITO has been changed as follows: +30% - 0-6 hours; 25% - 6-12 hours; 20% - 12-24 hours; 15% - 24-48 hours; 10% - 48h (HOURS) -15d (DAYS) 0% 15d + -. The level of HardCap has also been amended. We have taken a clear decision to reduce it to $ 51,000,000. In the near future, these amendments will be recorded in all the main project’s documents.

The p2p model is no longer innovative in fintech, however, the socialization of a financial company, and especially in the cryptocurrency segment, is a unique and completely new approach. Datarius main target is to demonstrate that fintech can be completely different.  Datarius Team decided not to impose any services at all upon the users. Ecosystem will propose three listings with different trust levels – from the borrowers minimally verified by the system algorithms and to the completely transparent borrowers, thoroughly reviewed by the project’s Risk Department. Any interested user, at any time, can personally order one or another related service – in-depth computer evaluation, evaluation by project partners, evaluation by the Risk Department, evaluation by user-managers and so on. The results will be immediately available to all other users. Accordingly, one or another application can automatically shift from one listing to another in keeping with the wishes of the project participants, and not merely as preferred by the submitting user. Thus, Datarius provides its users with complete freedom of choice both in terms of actions and cost. There will be a very symbolic fee if users haven’t used the services of project. Moreover, this will allow partner projects, including blockchain, as well as simple professional users or trained users, to independently determine the cost of their services and to earn with the project, acting both as a project participant and as a consumer of its services. This model offers great opportunities to all market participants.  Datarius Cryptobank has very ambitious targets for the expansion of the fintech market. It is the only one Cryptobank who declare the socialization of the fintech, full freedom of action and formation of service fee by users, declare and have the expertise in implementing instant money transfer systems such as Western Union, Moneygram, Transferwise.  Datarius is the first project to declare the whole fintech market in a single window.  Datarius Cryptobank will provide automatic package closing of offsetting orders (at the user’s request), as well as the assist at the closing to expedite the interaction. This means that if a number of offsetting orders meets the user’s requirements, such orders will be closed automatically, and if there are orders in the system that do not meet any criteria, they will be shown to the initiator and automatically recommended for acceptance.  The whole system is aimed at making the interaction between users possible without involving the team core. Datarius reserves only the power to ensure the operation of the platform and to provide a wide range of related services. Thus, project plans to completely cancel out the shortcomings of traditional systems – lobbyism and the promotion of toxic bonds.  Information about the project is fully open and can be found in their draft of White Paper. Every member of the team is an expert in his/her field. The entire Datarius core has no less than 10 years of continuous work experience within its field of competence. The core management team has experience in banking and financial spheres, including work with non-performing loans, experience in large international companies. The technical arm of the project is ultra-class professionals, enthused about their work and pioneers in the field of decentralized technologies. Datarius also has a strong support in legal issues.  Datarius Cryptobank has opened the doors to participate in the project to all and has gone to the pre-ITO stage which will ends on 12:12 UTC 31.12.2017. A SoftCap of $125,000 has been reached within just a few hours from the start of the campaign, as stated by information now available on the official website of the project. The main round – ITO is scheduled for February 2018. You can follow the progress of pre-ITO in real time on the official  https://coinsmoon.com/datarius-first-social-p2p-cryptobank/",True

The main goal of the project is to provide people with free and equal access to transparent financial instruments using blockchain technology. The Datarius hallmark is the integration of social functions into classical fintech projects, the declaration of the most complete toolkit, the use of artificial intelligence, and a special tariff designer adapted to the needs of each system user.   Features and Goals of the Pre-sale   Pre-sale (pre-ITO) began on December 12, 2017 at 12:12 UTC. However, before its launch, in particular on December 9, a closed round was held for the investors most interested in the development of the project. Some of the DTRC tokens were distributed in batches, and the registration itself was made upon the preliminary application – a kind of declaration of a desire to become a full-fledged user of the Cryptobank of the future.  The DTRC token is the only access key to the further participation in the Datarius project. All financial tools will be available exclusively to DTRC holders. Each of the token holders can be engaged in the formation of financial products line, as well as make a non-material contribution to the development of the system. The Loyalty Program is expected to be launched in 2019: each of the active DTRC token holders will receive 65% of all fees and charges collected by the cryptobank. The number of tokens is limited, and undistributed tokens will be burnt upon completion of the ITO campaign.   Pre-sale pursued several objectives. The main ones were to test and prepare the system for the main round - ITO. In addition, the funds raised will be allocated to the audit and optimization of the existing model, market analysis, and further promotion of the First Social Cryptobank Datarius.     Pre-ITO Results   The Presale was more than successful. The targeted SoftCap (the minimum amount of funds required to implement the project) had been raised within the first few hours upon the pre-ITO launch. Even when the threshold was reached, users continued to actively support the project.  The presale ended at $ 510.000 (at the current exchange rate), which, taking into account the $ 80.000 collected during the closed round, opens up broad prospects for the development of the project in the future. The Datarius Cryptobank thanks everyone who has participated in the Pre-sale campaign for supporting the project! The main round – ITO still lies ahead. Its launch is scheduled for the second half of February, 2018. We remind you that you will receive a 30% bonus in the first 6 hours of the main round   Join our chat in the Telegram http://goo.gl/nBfwkb to not miss the start date and time of the ITO, as well as to get an opportunity to learn more about the project directly from its team.

The p2p model is no longer innovative in fintech, however, the socialization of a financial company, and especially in the cryptocurrency segment, is a unique and completely new approach. Our chief target is to demonstrate that fintech can be completely different. We decided not to impose any services at all upon the users. We will propose three listings with different trust levels – from the borrowers minimally verified by the system algorithms and to the completely transparent borrowers, thoroughly reviewed by the project’s Risk Department. Any interested user, at any time, can personally order one or another related service – in-depth computer evaluation, evaluation by project partners, evaluation by the Risk Department, evaluation by user-managers and so on. The results will be immediately available to all other users. Accordingly, one or another application can automatically shift from one listing to another in keeping with the wishes of the project participants, and not merely as preferred by the submitting user. Thus, Datarius provides its users with complete freedom of choice both in terms of actions and cost. Of course, we will charge a very symbolic fee if users haven’t used the services of our project. Moreover, this will allow partner projects, including blockchain, as well as simple professional users or trained users, to independently determine the cost of their services and to earn with the project, acting both as a project participant and as a consumer of its services. This model offers great opportunities to all market participants.  http://telegra.ph/DaTaRius---Hot-interview-with-the-platform-creators-12-22",True

This post contains information about cards, asset exchanges and transaction insurance.  Payment Cards  We will issue plastic payment cards to our customers in conjunction with a partner bank. When the user orders and receives the card, we create an additional account, which is automatically assigned to the administrative account of the system. Datarius receives the transaction data through API, and the required balance is maintained automatically in real time.  The cards will have their own design with the logo of the issuing partner bank. They will be serviced by a partner bank.  Asset Exchange  Upon the project launch, we plan to create an Asset Exchange, which will allow users to carry out transactions in cryptocurrency, DTRC tokens and fiat money. All transactions will be conducted automatically.  Now we are actively discussing the introduction of the loan purchase and sale services on the exchange. This will provide additional opportunities to interested customers.  Transaction Insurance  All transactions can be insured by our partner companies. The cost of the service is transferred to the insurance company’s account in the Datarius system. If the insured event has occurred, the money from this account is automatically transferred to the account of the insured user.

Jim Conners is a Blockchain enthusiast and evangelist based in Portland, Oregon. He is a freelance journalist and his articles have appeared in top Blockchain media all around the globe.  Since the invention of the internet the idea of decentralization has always been at the forefront. Few people seem to know that the internet was originally developed by the American military and one of the goals was for the network to be survivable. Even if the worst case scenario were to arrive, the military wanted the predecessor of the internet to be able to continue functioning – even if it were in a diminished capacity.  So, from the very start decentralization was critical to the development of the internet. Centralized structures and hierarchical network architecture would make the young internet far too easy to cripple or destroy. So the military engineers developed a system where there was a bare minimum of centralization and everything that could be decentralized was decentralized.  However, the internet was only a military instrument for a short period of time.  The fire rises  First picked up by scientists and then later by tech enthusiasts and hobbyists, the internet remained the domain of people committed to decentralization and the easy spread of knowledge and communication. And as more industries moved online the very nature of the internet began to decentralize them.  One of the first things to be totally decentralized was communication. IRC, USENET, and more provided the freest space for communication the world has ever known. Following communication came the news.  What did these two things have in common? They were constantly oppressed and controlled by governments the world over. However, the internet has proven to be a tough bull to wrangle and people that want to speak freely and report freely moved online.  Communication and reporting in general have both profited heavily and are slowly becoming as decentralized as possible (much news nowadays is reported first on social media and hours later by the ‘real media.’)  But in this era of decentralization, when everything important that had been for so long oppressed is finally escaping the cunning clutches of oppressive regimes, they hold one last bastion.  Banking.  Storming the castle  Personal banking still remains heavily centralized and controlled by relatively few players. One of the reasons is because governments so effectively hold onto control of finance, money, and assets within their borders.  And the only reason they retain this control is because the government issues money and the government backs money. Without the government, (fiat) money is worthless as it isn’t actually backed by anything of real value.  And so long as the nation controls the currency, the nations control the finances of all citizens and non-citizen residents.  And because the nation needs this money to stay inside the country so it can be taxed, finance tends to be one of the most restrictive areas insofar as individual rights.  But with cryptocurrency this is changing and personal banking is finally decentralizing. Why? Because it cuts the control structure off at the root.  When currency is decentralized, finance is decentralized.  Decentralized banking puts you in charge  Cryptocurrency has caused a seat change in banking. Because people can remain anonymous and secure, it requires a whole new kind of system to manage crypto finance.  This has led to something spectacular – the new system (cryptobanking) frees you completely from the restrictions of the old one.  Borders are meaningless with cryptocurrency as they don’t exist online. A transaction between a user in NYC and another in LA is no different from a transaction between one in Beijing and another in Frankfurt. The system is totally decentralized and the power rests with the person holding the money not the person printing it.  A new world order for personal banking  Take Datarius – a startup cryptobank that makes full use of the benefits of cryptocurrency. As a cryptobank, Datarius will let you choose the services you’ll use (there’s no required service to be used for each country as is the case with old banks), and money transfers will not be obscenely taxed or subject to unnecessary fees, and cannot be forbidden by an oppressive government.  And perhaps best of all – It’s impossible for fees to be hidden on the ledger. You’ll know exactly what every transaction, purchase, or action will cost. Hidden fees won’t sneak up on you anymore. In the new world of cryptobanking, your bank can’t ask extra money from you because you’ll see it coming – everything is visible on the blockchain, after all.

The information provided in this post is the responsibility of the writer.  When you think of international banking you probably think of fat cats at their summer homes on Long Island who keep most of their money ‘abroad’ so as to avoid the ridiculous taxes that society asks of them.  Well you’d be partially right, for much of the last two centuries international banking has been synonymous with the extremely wealthy. But this wasn’t just for tax reasons. Not at all. International banking and transactions have wide appeal, and are often downright necessary, if one wants to take part in the world outside their own international borders! And until recently, it was really only the rich that spent a lot of time abroad or who were interested in investing abroad But all this has changed.  The opening up of the outside world  With the advent of cheap international flights, more and more people started going abroad just to visit rather than to immigrate forever. In this way people became far freer than ever to interact with the world at large.  As long-range communications developed along with the rise of the information age, information and knowledge became freer than ever. People could move around, knowledge could move around, but money stayed stubbornly flat footed. It was hard to get money across the border — be it digital money or otherwise  This is because nations are far more protective of capital than they are of either people or knowledge. The government needs money to function and often goes at great lengths to make international finance and banking difficult, all with the goal of keeping as much money as possible in the hands of the state itself.  So, while the world had opened up in many ways, finance remained stubbornly stuck in the past.  Stifled personal freedom  This naturally makes several things more difficult: The first is living abroad in general. Moving money across some borders is quite easy, across others it is nigh impossible. Often even opening a small account abroad can be extremely difficult.  This also limits investment opportunities — for yourself, and for people who might be interested in investing in your own company, but live in other countries.  The crypto revolution  Cryptocurrency is changing all of this. Because cryptocurrency is a digital revolution, it is naturally borderless. Wherever the internet might extend to, cryptocurrency is there as well. This means that cryptocurrency opens up basically the entire world to anyone that has coin in their wallet. And this opens up all kinds of possibilities that were previously closed off to the general public. To start with, the difficulty of managing multiple currencies is no longer a real issue as coin can potentially be exchanged for any world currency. Need to send money abroad? You can use cryptocurrency. Want to take part in an investment opportunity abroad? Now you can — even if you don’t have very much money to invest. It is even easier with ICOs. International Coin Offerings allow anyone in the world to join in a venture.  And perhaps best of all, oppressive governments have a pretty dang hard time stopping cryptocurrency transactions. So, if a poor citizen wants to flee a war zone or wants to get everything he can out of the country, then cryptocurrency might be his best solution.  But that is just the most dramatic possibility.  For the average person out there, perhaps the biggest gain would be that there are no currency conversion costs to look out for and no foreign transaction fees when using a cryptocurrency in another country.  Cryptobanks are getting us ready for a world that’s changing  Currencies are complicated, and cryptocurrencies are even more complicated. This is one of the reasons that we tend to use banks to manage much of our financial lives. One example of a bank preparing us for the new decentralized banking landscape that we see unfolding today is Datarius. Banking across borders — beyond borders — is about being able to have a choice. You should be able to choose what to do with your money yourself, and where to do it. With banks like Datarius, you get more of a choice in all kinds of ways.  With personalized banking solutions, you are now able to manage your assets from anywhere, and choose which assets you want to use, when, where and how.  With cryptocurrency, the world has changed. And banking with it.  Source: https://www.coinschedule.com/blog/2017/12/04/banking-beyond-borders-crypto-revolution-decentralization-international-banking/",True
