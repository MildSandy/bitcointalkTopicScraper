Yet despite the threat, it unquestionably presents endless opportunities for innovation and sustainable development. While certain fields like energy and weather deservedly get much attention with regards to climate change, one of the largest factors affecting it — farming and food production as a whole — is usually overlooked. Moeda’s sixth project of its Pilot Seed Program tackles this challenge head on by changing the way large-scale farms operate and making other agroecological production centers (highly scientific, responsible, and sustainable agriculture) even more efficient and eco-friendly. Cooperfavi-Bio, located in Dona Emma with 266 members, aims to implement organic bio-inputs for agroecological production, such as providing natural fertilizer and composted farm waste. This may not seem capable of increasing production or efficiency, but by taking such steps to farm responsibly the quality of the soil in effect remains high for a much longer period of time, the waste and losses from production and transportation are reduced, and the need for chemical agents is all but cut out entirely. In order to take up such a large and long-range project, Cooperfavi-Bio will be provided with 526,300 USD in Moeda microloans, and will help build sustainable cities and communities, take action on climate change, and improve the quality of life for farmers across Brazil. We can all learn much from Cooperfavi-Bio, by recognizing how much resources go into (and are lost) in “industrial” farming, learning the benefits of bio-inputs, and how to implement them in farming practices throughout the world.",False

But if you were a wannabe baker in Brazil, and even if you had the location, the raw materials and resources, and the know-how to run your own bakery, where could get the equipment for it, like racks, ovens, freezers, and utensils?  The seventh project of Moeda’s program, the Seed Women of the Contestado Land, will be likely be the ones to help you get those materials and get your bakery off the ground.  The project’s name is a reference to the Contestado War, in which settlers in the Santa Catarina region (the project is based in Lebon Regis) fought their oppressive landowners over one hundred years ago. The sixteen members of the Seed Women have not forgotten their history, and as such wish to do their part to help others build their own businesses and protect them from debt and foreclosure. They will receive 207,430 USD in Moeda microloans to give bakers across Brazil the tools they need to get going.  The sustainable development goals that are a part of this project include increasing gender equality, providing decent work opportunities and economic growth, overseeing infrastructural and industrial growth, reducing inequality, and using partnerships to achieve such goals. To some history is irrelevant, but to others it can be the spark to bring positive change in the world even today.  https://medium.com/moeda/moeda-selected-seed-seed-women-of-the-contestado-land-5edb5c62f370",False

Naturally, Mr. Eisenstat was featured on the blockchain panel, and presented Moeda as a solution.  The panel covered topics ranging from as general to the nature of blockchain technology and how it has taken the world by storm (including established banking and other financial circles) to specific questions, like how blockchain can be used for international aid, by refugees, and social and environmental sustainability.  When asked how he would explain blockchain technology, Mr. Eisenstat said his favorite way to do so was to simply call it “the future of software… It’s the future of database management, and what the internet has done with information, blockchain is now able to do in the physical world. It’s becoming the internet of value.” Mr. Eisenstat also answered questions about Bitcoin, mining, and said he hopes that since so many people made money off of cryptocurrency, there will soon be what’s known as “crypto-philanthropy”to fund projects and non-profits across the world.  “Looking back at 2017, not only have we seen an explosion of growth and wealth and startups creating new enterprises but [blockchain] also come into the mainstream for the social impact space, and I hope we see a lot more of that in 2018.”  For more news on blockchain’s social impact, keep following Moeda!  https://medium.com/moeda/moeda-featured-in-dukes-sbsi-conference-55bd6c27136b",False

The first major on is that cattle, often in large numbers, have to raised, fed, and corralled in what is usually a fairly small area. Second, the actual dairy produced by the cows need to be extracted and refined with machinery in order to be efficient. And third, though likely not the last problem for a small farmer, even if dairy products other than milk can be produced on-site, they need to be stored in a refrigerated setting, or else it will spoil. It’s a surprisingly difficult process for such a basic necessity.  That’s where the fourteenth project of Moeda’s Pilot Seed Program comes in, helping 380 farmers overhaul their local dairy production. The members of SISCOOPLAF (quite an acronym, we know), located in Cascavel, will receive 84,676 USD in Moeda microloans to provide them with equipment to build up their operating capacity for dairy products. Prior, most production of dairy products was done by hand or with limited, often outdated tools. Now, SISCOOPLAF will receive modern refrigeration units to store their products, boilers to pasteurize the milk, and mixers to make yogurt on a fairly large scale. With those, SISCOOPLAF will be “milking it” in no time!  https://medium.com/moeda/moeda-selected-seed-siscooplaf-6577a9de3fed",False

Moeda’s will be providing an estimated USD $103,000.00 loan to Daring Women so they could purchase and build the facilities to store their frozen pulps in the warm climate of Formosa. This project helps to end hunger, provide good health and well-being, promote economic growth, and build better partnerships in the community, which are all UN sustainable development goals.

A maximum of 5 million MDA tokens will be issued in the public phase. The USD/ETH exchange rate should be updated on a daily basis. Times are approximate and based on when the start and end blocks are mined on the Ethereum network.  Token Generation Rules A ~$1 USD contribution in ETH will receive ~1 Moeda (MDA) token. A maximum of 5 million MDA tokens will be issued in the public phase. The USD/ETH conversion rate may be updated on a daily basis but due to market fluctuations and speed of the network, you should expect some pricing variability. Tokens will be transferrable once the sale has ended and has been finalised.  The sale starts when block TBD has been mined, and ends when either the equivalent of 5 million US dollars worth of Ether has been received, or once block TBD has been mined. Contributions sent before the starting block has been mined will be rejected, and the sent Ether will be returned, minus the transaction fees.   THE TEAM      MOEDA Project Seeds Program  MOEDA partners, the cooperative entities UNICAFES and CRESOL have combined 700,000 members in more than 1,100 cooperatives and have been, for 30 years, providing micro loans and financial services for small agricultural communities in Brazil. Under UNICAFES’ umbrella MOEDA is directly working with 170 Brazilian Cooperative Credit Banks and 128 Communitarian Banks to give mobile banking and access to capital for sustainable development projects. During the first year, MOEDA Seed Projects Program aims to provide 100,000 members with lines of credit.    United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  MOEDA is working in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to remove three key barriers that have plagued effective public financing of the SDGs:  1. Impact lenders have insufficient transparency into sustainable investments. This makes it risky to manage a large portfolio because there’s no way to see where the money is going.  2. Due to the lack of transparency, borrowers have insufficient access to capital. Moeda gives borrowers a way to establish reputation, document project status, and to collaborate with others in the community.  3. Statistics have shown that investors have a gender bias against women-led projects, despite having historically higher success ratios and repayment rates than projects run by men. More than 40 percent of businesses registered in Latin America and the Caribbean are owned by women, according to the World Bank-IFC Enterprise survey. However, the credit gap for women-owned enterprises remains high throughout the region. Brazil has the largest gap, whereby 45 percent of women-owned SMEs identify access to finance as a major constraint in operating and growing their businesses.    GET IN TOUCH",False
