The heir to PayPal’s throne - can FinTech startup Bitcoinus succeed where Stripe failed?  The first quarter of 2018 was notable for two major announcements in the ecommerce and payments space.  The most promising potential usurper to PayPal’s crown; Stripe announced in January that they would completely phase out Bitcoin payments on their platform by April, citing high transaction costs and slow speeds. It seems a shame that the innovative disruptor founded by the precocious Irish Collison Brothers would take a step back rather than find a technical or operational solution.  A month later Coinbase, the popular consumer focused cryptocurrency wallet launched Coinbase Commerce enabling merchants to accept multiple cryptocurrencies directly into a user-controlled wallet. While not a truly decentralized solution, Coinbase’s approach is not hosted to the merchants have full control over their wallets and currency.  All aspects of finance are being impacted by Blockchain technologies. This should result, not only in significant cost reduction for market participants, but will transform financial services and online commerce as we know it. Cryptocurrency will do for payments what electronic mail did for communication.  Beyond FinTech — Power to the Participants 2018 will be remembered as the year that Crypto Payments went mainstream, massively disrupting the ecommerce space. The main incumbents, Paypal and Stripe have yet to embrace Cryptocurrencies while the only other serious contenders; Coinbase Commerce and BitPay are traditional centralized business. Decentralized user-centric ecosystems like Bitcoinus will dominate this sector as they reduce costs for all participants and put the power back into the hands of merchants and consumers.  Bitcoins is powered by a discreet ERC20 Powered Token called BITS. When payments are made with this token there will be zero transaction fees. When you combine best in class merchant dashboard & wallets, robust APIs, UX focused payment & checkout views, integration modules with low (or zero) fees you get a recipe for a FinTech platform that can grow exponentially.  “Personally I see Bitcoinus as the PayPal of the next few decades except that this time, (for once) the value will accrue to the ordinary people — the users and merchants — and not by a monopolistic centralized company charging high fees.” As the network of merchants and users of the Bitcoinus wallet and BITS token grow, the value will accrue to the holders of the token; not the company as happens with traditional centralized companies like Coinbase commerce or Bitpay.  As well as saving consumers significant money by eliminating transaction fees for online payments, the fact that Bitcoinus is having a Token Sale is a rare chance for ordinary people to support and participate in the upside of the next Coinbase Commerce, Bitpay or indeed Stripe. All three are private companies and only Venture Capitalists and accredited investors got the chance to invest in the these multi million and billion dollar companies.  Personally I see Bitcoinus as the PayPal of the next few decades except that this time (for once)the value will accrue to the ordinary people — the users and merchants — and not by a monopolistic centralized company charging high fees.

And there's no clear leader in providing easy way for merchants to accept cryptocurrencies. So we are solving two problems at once - helping merchants to set up crypto-payments with a simple plugin, one-wallet solution, and helping customers to pay for things they want with the coins they have.

This how its work here, all top projects are open source. If you really could solve the problem you talking about, you got funded in seconds.  Again simple question: how you going to confirm bitcoin transaction in 2 seconds using external wallet?

Most of what you've written is unfortunately false as you can indicate our progress to this moment by looking at our roadmap which is located on our website and Whitepaper too.  Speaking about MVP, we do have it, although it is being developed now and is NOT ready for the commercial use yet. We have also clearly indicated in many places like the website and the WP. The idea that ""is not yet solved by top community devs"" is a little bit a lie, as our project isn't really the first one who does this sort of processing. It would be great if next time you comment anything like this, you could firstly do a proper market research as now you form a wrong opinion not only about Bitcoinus, but industry and other similar projects too. Very misleading.  To get more technical, our plan is to accept payments in lots of cryptos (100 for the first stage in Beta version, BTC included) and the main thing is for example when we get BTC pending transaction we instantly send confirmation callback for e-shop to proceed with the order. Usually the whole process of sale/delivery of the item or a product take longer than BTC confirmation if we specifically speak about Bitcoin. After the payment is confirmed, we send another callback for confirm e-shop for shipping of the item or etc.  That would be the basic underlying idea which is now being developed and actually works.  Also, I've looked through many of your comments in this forum, smartJEV, and found several ICOs which for some reason you have indicated them as ""scams"". Eventually - they weren't. Just saying.  All questions are more than welcome. We will share as much as we can so that everyone would fully grasp the idea beyond Bitcoinus. Cheers!",False
