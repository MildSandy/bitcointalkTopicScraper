What the future will be like?  How we want it to be?  Nobody really knows the answers for sure, but the future will definitely be more convenient for all of us to live in. Throughout all of our history, we changed our lifestyle, habits, made inventions and explored new horizons just for one reason – to make our world a better place to live in. We developed medicine, held lots of research of human body to fight the plagues and illnesses that used to kill big parts of population. And we succeeded! Nowadays, we don’t have to hide from predators, hunting for us and our average lifetime is in average twice as long as it used to be in the stone age. We don’t spend our day in constant search for food, we create pieces of art and music instead! But does it mean, that there’s nothing to improve?  What about medicine?  We all know that medicine these days is making huge steps forward, but we also know that all the money spent on research by pharmaceutical companies will be added to the price of the cure. For example, we all know that HIV is constantly researched to find mechanisms of destroying it in human body and, according to the latest news, the way to cure it seems to be out soon. It will be great news and we also know that it will definitely cost a lot.  Another problem is that normally, when we have some health problems, doctors tell us that if we came to them earlier, the problem would be easier to fix. We become more cautious about our health and next time we try to visit doctor earlier. But this time, doctor either tells us the same words or that there was no problem this time. And every visit is consuming money and time.  Nowadays, we have lots of fitness trackers and other medical devices to provide us some statistics, related to our health. Apple Health App even has function of sending all the data collected by e-mail to your doctor. But here comes another problem – in most cases, he will have no idea of what to do with this huge amount of raw data.  Is there any solution?  The main purpose of the World Health Application Project is to provide constant analysis of the health-related data of every single client and to reduce the costs on healthcare of every individual. Furthermore, the WHA Project aims to create the means of payment that will be accepted globally.  Every app user will be constantly rewarded with WHA tokens for every data submission.  Such data should be really sustainable and trustworthy and this is exactly what the blockchain technology is capable of.  Such system will reduce the costs of the hospitals and clinics for obtaining and analyzing the data caused by less equipment, personnel and premises required for the actual data collection.  Insurance companies will benefit as well as the price of the health insurance will be more precisely calculated for every single client that’s involved in the Project.  Recent studies show that the majority of people are ready to wear different trackers if the insurance company will require that for their client’s benefit.  Our app users will have access to the best and more effective health tracking devices at built-in app market that will allow to purchase them with discounts in exchange for WHA tokens. All devices will be tested for compatibility and maximum effectivity.  The WHA Project aims for rethinking medicine allowing every single user to benefit in every way from taking part in it.  The better future is here, join us to be part of it!   WHA project is the world’s first clear raw data source of all the health parameters provided by the token holders. WHA Application will use decentralized platform for collection, storage, analysis and constant update of information on the health condition of its users based on the blockchain technology.  Users will be granted by serious and efficient application that will provide useful guidance in health improvements staying anonymous through the benefits of the open-source application. Medical and research centers will gain constant real-time observation of health condition of large groups of patients. This will lead to more efficient medical treatment and faster research possibilities. The mission of this project is to provide efficient observation and analysis for both users and healthcare institutions. Data should be impartial and unchangeable that will be reached by implementing the blockchain technology. In addition, WHA own cryptocurrency will inspire users to get involved into the project and will allow purchasing updated and more efficient gadgets on the internal project market. It will supply users with only most precise and multi-functional equipment.

PRE-SALE DETAILS  pre-sale first day bonus - 20% pre-sale date - 16.10.2017 number of tokens - 10 000 000 single token price - $0.04 official token name - WHA deposit method - ETH  (Updated) What are we planning to build?  Software. Mobile app, to be exact. It will have built-in market for wearable devices as well. It will provide deep analysis of user health parameters by our medical specialists.  We want to make our app as professional and attractive to users as it is possible. We also need to create token circulation as high as possible to raise it's validity and market price. That's why we plan to reward users with our tokens as it will raise popularity as well. We need to build the whole ecosystem around health tracking wearable devices to collect huge amount of data that later on, will be possible to be used by medical organisations and insurance companies. That's why we need to make it really popular and it will cost a lot to advertise it.  It was impossible to do few years ago because all these trackers were pretty inaccurate in data collection that's why they were normally treated no more than entertainment. But these days, the technology became more advanced and data collected is gaining high reliability. Now it meets the problem that medicine is not ready for this huge amount of data. That's the exact moment when our project can benefit in linking technology and medicine. No, we are not the first with this brilliant idea. Check http://www.qualcommlife.com/ for example. No need to explain, what Qualcomm is and what this company is capable of. But again, it is a huge company that will make it as a service for those, who will be ready to pay a lot.  Aren't there any startups alike? well, there is one, planning to do something close to our idea - Litra (currently has over $10 millions collected during ICO)  But ""something close"" is only creating Electroninc Health Record (EHR) - static data that will be changed only after visiting a doctor, I guess (according to the information from their whitepaper) According to their research (and we totally agree on that) - ""market readiness for digital health in the US appears to have reached an inflection point"" (outline from their Whitepaper)  How are we different?  Our plan is in creating constantly updating EHR (not just static as Litra plans) and not only for US (as it seems to be done by Litra) and we want users being constantly rewarded for data submission (unlike both Litra and Qualcomm). As if it is not enough to be really unique, we plan to build the whole ecosystem that will involve insurance companies (that's where huge amount of money in healthcare are currently held) and different clinics.    Attracting investors is a good thing, but we aim for popularity among users.

That's kind of funny if it weren't tragic. Look into the connection between hiv and aids. There is no cure, because there's no connection. Back in the eighties, they needed an lbtg-friendly way of solving the mysterious gay men disease in LA. So, an old cancer retrovirus from the '70 was put forward as the 'probable cause of aids', which was hiv, and to this day still is. Even the inventor of the, for 'aids research' vital PCR-method (for which he won the Nobel prize) said it's an unproven hypothesis on which billions of tax dollars are spent. Well what about Africa? In Africa, you don't even need a dodgy hiv-test to be categorised hiv-infected.",False
