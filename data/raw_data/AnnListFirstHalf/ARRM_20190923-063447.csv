Regrettably we, ARRM.IO, are forced to announce the cancellation of the launch of our project's ICO.  One of the main reasons is the complicated situation caused by a large number of SCAM projects launching ICO. Many Medias, market participants and crypto-enthusiasts say that about 95% of projects are frank SCAM. In such circumstances, we consider it will be very difficult for a potential ARM-token holder to single out ARRM.IO among other ICO projects and give an appropriate assessment of our products and solutions. In conditions of limited resources, it seems inexpedient for our team to spend huge amounts of money on marketing and promotion of our ICO, so we decided to use our funds to complete the development of several more demonstration products. If the situation with ICO evaluation criterias will not become clearer within six months our team plans to apply for funding to relevant classic venture capital. All funds of participants of the closed private round of Token Sale have already been returned back to their owners.  Thank you for attention. With kind regards, ARRM.IO team",False
