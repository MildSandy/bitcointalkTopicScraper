[In Development],"   Hey, thanks for the question.  The website serves as the white paper, and actually gives a lot of info of exactly how the token will be used (between the main text and the FAQ answers)  But I'll try to give a quick answer here for you: Fame is used to create a gladiator, and to equip them, train them etc. Fees are paid to the engine for these things. 100% of those fees actually are held by the gladiator, they are not taken as skim or by the ""house"" When a gladiator is defeated in battle, the gladiator who defeated them takes half of the fame held within the gladiator Gladiators can also win fame by being victorious overall in an event, but more on that later. Gladiators are ""Owned"" by a player. They can be traded, etc. So as you fight, the gladiator gains skills, earns fame, etc. And becomes a better warrior, able to more easily win in battle. In addition, as they win more fame they are holding actual value. The gladiator themselves own the fame. A player can choose to ""retire"" a gladiator. This is permenant, and you would then need to start over, all skills etc that are gained by the warrior, are now lost. However the benefit of doing this is 100% of the gladiator fame is sent to the player. So this acts as a ""Cash out"" mechanism Gladiators can earn fame in several ways, and the cash out isn't the only way fame is earned by the player. Over time every time a gladiator earns fame, a small percentage is skimmed by the player that owns them. So building up a gladiator will earn fame slowly, depending on the success of the gladiator, but cashing out is a lump sum. As the gladiator levels up, they can potentially warm fame faster, meaning it's a decision by the player to keep building or cash out by retiring. There is an entrance fee for an event. This is paid by the gladiator, not the player. Though the player can at any time send more fame to the gladiator if they run low. The fee is not skimmed by the house, 100% of it is put into the event pool. The event pool can also earn money via advertisers. Who also bid fame in an auction, to secure one of the advertising slots in the event. This gets them advertising during the spectating of the event, the losing bids get their money back, but any winning bid is kept and put into the event pool as well Finally there is wagering on the events. Spectators can wager using fame, which gladiator they think will win. If correct, they can win a portion of the betting pool. It works kind of like a 50/50, 50% of the loosing bets goes into the event pool, the other 50% is won by the winning bets. Wagering will help to drive spectating, also increasing the value of the advertising. the event pool is split up with most of it used as the prize for the winning gladiator. If there is no winner, it is held for the next event, building up the prize pool. A small portion is reserved for the ""crew"" that help run the event. None is kept by the ""house"" Any spectator can help out by driving the transactions that power the event and the combat engine. They do this via essentially a ""mining"" activity while spectating. This costs them some gas, but all crew divide up the crew share of the event share, compensating them with fame making this activity worthwhile.  This ecosystem creates demand for fame via many avenues, and makes it profitable via fame to participate in many ways.  The fame put into the system is 100% circulated in and out between participants. There is absolutely no ""skim"" or ""house advantage""  We hope that a secondary market will also develop around the training and buildup of effective Gladiators.  And of course we plan to expand the ways in which a gladiator can be used, new event types, new things to participate in, and ways to expand the ecosystem around fame tokens.  Does that help answer the question? I suggest you re-read the website, and all faq entries, as that may also help explain this.  If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to follow up on this thread, or contact us via email at icosupport@battledrome.io  Thanks! Hopefully we can count on your support!",False

[In Development],"   No new fame will ever be minted after the ico. The economics will be dynamic in other ways (with supply and demand driven pricing, and adapting variables in the platform itself, much how Bitcoin uses difficulty as one variable to control mining economics.  As for how players participate, only by first aquiring fame can they ""play"" the game.  We are already speaking to leading cryptonexchanges and fully expect fame to be traded and liquid on at least one major exchange shortly after ico.  As for a method for new players to get in. By participating as crew any spectator can ""mine"" fame from events. This game is not newly minted, it is recirculated from a small portion of the fees paid to enter an event.  But this doesn't require anything but a bit of gas cost for the ""crew"" so that is the cheapest way in. By simply spectating events, and helping to ""mine"" new transactions.  And in doing so they are contributing to the fame economy by lending their eyeballs (viewers/spectators in turn grow the value of advertising etc)",False

[In Development],"   We don't earn any money directly from BattleDrome beyond the ico. This is by design.  The ico gives us a small amount of fame, which we can use to participate, or to sell onto the market to make extra funding. And if the platform is a great success, we fully anticipate the value of fame to increase materially.  The plan is the system will be 100% complete with basic feature set at final launch in early 2018. That goal is fully funded by the ico funds.  We have many ideas for future features as well, and intend to achieve this via in of a few means:  If the ico does well enough, the extra funds will find further development.  If we only slightly exceed the minimum, it still funds the core features to completion. But then future ideas can be funded via additional crowd funding rounds (don't worry these ideas would build on the fame ecosystem, we have some creative ideas how we could crowdfund them without detracting from the value of fame), or alternate funding methods (direct investment, community bounties, etc). The success of the initial platform will help drive additional funding initiatives as we will then have a proven track record.  In addition the entire platform will be 100% open source. Meaning the community can continue to develop on to of the basic platform as well.  We fully intended this to be something awesome for the community, and ""don't be greedy"" was one of our core concepts we wanted to instill in this ico. We want to be paid for our contribution of the platform, we have no interest in skimming money off the players, so 100% of all money put into the game is recirculated back to the community.",False

[In Development],"Approximately 11 days to go!  Just quickly chiming in to say our supporters are awesome! And we still have support rolling in!  We continue to need your support even though we’ve crossed the threshold of the minimum goal. Every extra bit of ether contributed will help us make BattleDrome that much better!  Also it’s come to my attention that there is some confusion about the end-date of the ICO. It has always been 190,000 Blocks duration, starting on Block #3960000 this means that it will end on block 4150000 exactly.  I know that most of the ICO listing sites use actual date/time, not block number to show their count-downs and this has caused some confusion as some are reporting we’re done already.  I want to be 100% clear, we ARE NOT DONE. As per our most recent estimates we will end APPROXIMATELY 3:30am on the August 12th, Eastern Time. This is not an exact end-time, as it depends on the Ethereum Blockchain. If blocks are mined faster, or slower, this date/time will shift.  I have sent out notices to many listing sites asking them to update their countdown clocks.  I’ve also noticed some of you have attempted to run the payMe method to withdraw your FAME tokens. And you’ve received an error. This is OK! (because it’s designed to block this until the completion of the ICO, and it’s not done yet!)  If you are in doubt, feel free to check the isComplete method on the ICO contract. That is the 100% definitive source for “Are we there yet?”. If isComplete returns TRUE then we are done, and you can safely execute payMe. If you tried and got an error, no worries, you FAME is safe, and the same call will work once the ICO is done.  Thanks again for all of your support! And keep it flowing in!  I’d also like to drop a hint that very soon (in the next few days) we’ll be announcing another surprise for the final stretch of the ICO. So keep checking back here for more info!

[In Development],"New Surprise Bonus for our Contributors! So I hinted a while ago that we had another “Surprise” up our sleeves for contributors… Now is the time to reveal it!  We’re offering 2 Bonuses to our Contributors: Membership in the BattleDrome Founders Guild Early access discounts on our future projects/crowd-sales for FAME holders So what do these mean? I’m glad you asked!  Summary: Founders Guild is an exclusive LIFETIME club, based on contribution level, that will give you discounts in future projects, and benefits in BattleDrome. Early Access discounts apply to ANYONE who holds FAME going forward, giving “Early Bird” access to our future ICOs and crowd-funding campaigns! Read on for the full scoop, and more details:  BattleDrome Founders Guild The BattleDrome Founders Guild will be an exclusive list of members (based on wallet addresses) which will be permanently stored in a new Smart Contract we will deploy shortly after ICO completion.  Any address used to back BattleDrome at certain minimum levels will be added to the Founders Guild with an associated “Level”. Each Level comes with special benefits going forward (forever).  There will be NO WAY for new founders spots to be added to this list after the initial creation shortly after the ICO. And don’t worry, each “slot” will have a method allowing the “owner” address for the slot to “transfer” it to another owner (in case you change addresses in the future, or want to “give” it to someone else, etc).  So to be clear on this: NOW IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE to get into the Founders Guild, and gain these “Lifetime” benefits as a result!  Don’t worry, if you’re already backed us at one of these levels you will ALREADY get into the Founders Guild! But if you’ve backed us already, and would like to “up your game” to get into the Guild, now is the time! We’ll consider the “Total Contribution” from each unique Ethereum Address. So if you want to “add on” to your past contribution, make sure to send in any new funds from the same address!  Also, in case you are wondering, NO the Development team does not automatically get slipped in as founders, unless we also chose to back the project with our own funds. ONLY addresses who backed via the ICO contract (on public record) will be added to the Founders Guild.  The levels will be: Founder (Level 1): Minimum 1 ETH Total contribution Gold Founder (Level 2): Minimum 5 ETH Total contribution Platinum Founder (Level 3): Minimum 100 ETH Total contribution As for the benefits, here is how that will break down:  Founder: Early access to “Founder Round” of funding in our future ICOs and Crowd Funds for all future projects. This will give you the absolute first shot at these opportunities. “Founder Round” will have a 20% discount rate applied to future ICOs and Crowd-Funds In BattleDrome, the “Skim” you gain from your gladiator from their FAME earnings, will get a 1% bonus. This does NOT affect game-play balance/mechanics at all, but does give you a material earning bonus in the long run from your Gladiators. Cosmetic Indication in the Spectator Engine that you are a Founder (to be determined exactly what this will look like, etc) Potential other real benefits in future features/projects etc, as the founders list will be public, and accessible to other smart contracts, etc.  Gold Founder: Everything “Founder” level gets, except your “Skim Bonus” in BattleDrome is 2% instead. A visually different cosmetic indicator, differentiating Gold from regular Founders. (TBD what it will look like)  Platinum Founder: Everything “Founder” level gets, except your “Skim Bonus” in BattleDrome is 3% instead. A visually different cosmetic indicator, differentiating Platinum from Gold, or Regular Founders. (TBD what it will look like)  Early Access Discounts for FAME holders In all of our future ICOs or Crowd Funding campaigns, we will have 2 “Early Access” rounds:  Founders Round, which will only be accessible to Founders (see above)  Early Bird Round, which will be open to anyone holding at least 10 FAME AT THAT TIME.  Early Bird Round will come following Founders Round, and will have a 10% discount applied to it.  What does this mean? It means that during the ICO if you have bought FAME and you hold a balance of at least 10 FAME you can get into the early-bird round in any future ICO or crowd-funding campaign. And it also means if you like, you can BUY or WIN FAME to be able to get access to the early bird round.  Basically our future versions of our crowd-funding and ICO contracts will have these “rounds” coded into them, and the “entry criteria” in the smart contract will be “are they on the list for Founders?” for Founders Rounds, and “Do they currently have enough FAME” for the Early-Bird round.  So in closing: I think it’s obvious that we have many plans for BattleDrome, for FAME, future Features, etc. As well I’d like to be clear, we have some BIG plans for other projects. We deliberately started small, fun, and achievable. But some of our longer term future projects will be MUCH larger in scope (and profitability).  We fully intend to prove with BattleDrome that we can efficiently execute a plan, deliver a project on the Ethereum Blockchain, and do so with lean ideals, maximizing value of the contributions to our projects. As a result anyone who backed our first project, will be honored, and rewarded for having faith in us early in that journey.  I hope you’re all as excited as I am about these announcements, and hopefully we can close this ICO off with a BANG over the next week or so. And then we’ll buckle down and push hard towards the Alpha release of BattleDrome!  Thanks again for all of your support with this project so far!",False

BattleDrome 是一个游戏平台/生态系统，基于分散式战斗场，允许任何人创建一个战士: 一个存在于以太坊的实体，能够被交易，训练，装备，并参加活动，其他战士进行战斗，并获得乐趣及收益!  就好像罗马角斗士的祖先, 战士们在技术与战斗上的提升能通过时间的迁移所获得的经验来加成。在战士们透过他们的事业所获得 FAME 中，一部分 FAME 将移交至他们的主人。  活动将由社区分散式地被定期安排，并设定规则（战士的数量，等级限制等）。任何人都可以在“注册时段”内让他们的战士加入。之后就到“下注期”，允许观众对活动的结果下注。  当处于注册时段和下注期时，赞助者可以选择贡献他们的财产给予活动的胜利者，以获得在活动期间做广告的权利。  我们有意让活动本身能在视觉上被观赏及动画化，并允许观众与进行中的战斗互动，为下注的那一方加油鼓励（或扰乱观众反对的一方）。  当战士们在战斗时，战士们将利用主人帮助他们获得的技能与装备（以及他们本身来自其他战斗的经验）来击败其他战士。在这个情况之下，部分的FAME将从被击败的一方抽取并给予胜利的一方。  若在一个时间点上，只有一个战士还活着，他们将获胜！并获得大量的FAME。  主人能在任何时候让他的战士退休，把战士的所有FAME都交给主人。可这位战士将无法再次参与，主人若想要继续参与活动，将需要重新锻炼一位新的战士。  除此之外，BattleDrome是一个平台。我们将持续开发未来的额外活动，以及扩展战士们的功能。花俏的组团战斗？玩家对环境式地牢？能转换战士战略/行为的可自定义人工智能？这些都有可能在BattleDrome平台上实现，并由FAME来驱动!  FAME是什么?  FAME 是一个驱动BattleDrome平台的 ERC20 令牌代币。  FAME 是BattleDrome生态系统中的核心。 就好象古罗马斗兽场，FAME 是个被所有主人/顾客们争夺的货币，它是战场上工人们所希望获得的，它让战士们愿意使出浑身解数击败对方，并且也是那些希望获得关注与营销的工具。  BattleDrome 是个被从零开始设计的多面化平台，用以支持FAME的需求量，并提供大量的娱乐来取悦大家。  从技术上来说，FAME将成为全面ERC20令牌的代币，并将在一次发布后，由于被限制的供应量，在ICO众筹后将无法被铸出。此货币能被“烧毁” （永久性销毁FAME代币），这将成为我们销毁ICO众筹后没被售出的代币的方法。在经过时间的推移，此举将增加资源的稀缺度。  在ICO众筹中，总共最多 210万 的FAME将被铸出 （200万ICO众筹最高目标 + 5%给予开发者），但最终流通量将取决于ICO众筹的成果。  被提出的开发时间线有什么？ 这是来自网站常见问题部分的开发线。 每一个里程碑（测试，释出）是与里程碑被达成时第三方托管所释放的资金有所关联的。   背后的团队是谁？ 此团队由3位创办成员组成。我们有意愿在ICO众筹结束后依据所获得的资金录取/扩展团队。我们3位创办成员拥有能力来完成所承诺的目标，但凭着来自ICO众筹大量的资金，我们将能提供更大的价值。例如一个能带来惊艳的视觉的引擎，或在首次释出时带来额外的特点。  Paul Mumby: 创办人及开发领导 Paul (在这个论坛也被称为 Glasswalker ) 涉及在加密货币的生态系统中有一段很长的时间了。他也是位工程师，从硬体设计，机械工程到程序开发他都有着非常深厚的经验。目前他是个程序开发和大数据咨询公司的首席技术官，他有着积累下来的经验，智慧和技术让这个项目能够成功。  Jeff Warford: 联合创办人及开发人员 一名长久以来的区块链爱好者，Jeff是位有经验的系统架构师，曾管理Linux系统和后台网页开发。他目前专精在面向网页的Paas产品的设计及构造。  Ian Anstey: 联合创办人及系统管理员/测试员 Ian是一位有经验的系统集成商及zeal for bitcoin的构造师。利用他强大的管理及部署测试背景，他现在是个Linux和虚拟化集成的专家及咨询师。  我为什么要参与？ 我们认为我们有着强大的市场定位（请看下方）。 已完成的概念证明，准备在短时间内推出测试版本。 完全透明化 有机会以FAME持有者的身份来为开发选项/特征作出投票（利用FAME结余）。 低目标 合理的低限额 对成本限度负责 阶段性释放资本配合完整的第三方托管，保护支持者的投资。 开发者只占非常小额的代币。 无预先开采及众筹预售。 已规划好未来生态环境的扩展（发展代币的价值）  ICO众筹之前进行的市场调查表明我们处于游戏业的甜点: 游戏行业非常注重拥有能够制造“宠物”的游戏。 加密货币的投注正在频密发展，在2016年下注了超过 8.9亿 比特币。 使用“风险限制”的游戏非常出名（“玩家”在游戏外操控着“角色”，当在游戏内时玩家则失去直接的控制。例如原本的角斗士游戏，和现代（缺乏吸引力）的版本，例如公鸡战斗和狗战斗）。 大型多人在线角色扮演游戏中的生态系统造就了第三方数据化物品市场及玩家之间的“交易”。 我们综合了这些元素，成为一个干净，安全，及有趣的游戏平台，并且能够扩展，及支持一个强大的金融经济，驱动于来自广告，运输，参与及下注的资金循环。  我如何才能参加ICO众筹？ ICO众筹合约将联合所有的支持者。 为了迅速及简单，和支持者风险保障而研发的设计。 只需轻易地将资金从你的以太坊钱包送到ICO众筹合约的地址。 当ICO众筹已完成时，在ICO众筹合约上执行payMe方案。 若ICO众筹成功，你将立即获得你的代币! 若ICO众筹无法达到最低目标，你将拿回所有的以太坊! 教程将在网页上发布。 ICO众筹合约将在短期内发布，届时也将开放源码。 ICO众筹分散式程序将在7月1日释出。  我们计划利用分散式程序让过程迅速且简易，并不会依赖复杂的程序，避免支持者使用不被支持的游览器，或使用网站式钱包，或硬体钱包，来完成交易。这将会确保过程即简单又灵活。  结合ICO众筹合约，先前部署的代币，及第三方托管将成立一个安全，严厉管制的ICO众筹，这将会降低投资者/支持者们的风险。   请探访我们的主要网站于 http://www.battledrome.io 或我们的部落格 https://medium.com/@BattleDrome 已获取我们最新的ICO众筹咨询及更新!",False

Currently we are 74,950 blocks into our campaign, which has a total of 190,000 blocks. This puts us at about 39% through the duration.  That puts us just slightly behind pace (based on pure trend). Though considering most crowd-funding campaigns receive a large percentage of their funding in the first couple days, and the last couple days, with a slow ""coast"" through the middle, combined with the fact we still have a big surprise up our sleeves we're saving to announce in the last week approx of the campaign.

[In Development],"   Actually we have several marketing campaigns going on, and support from several ICO listing sites. Unfortunately this is one of the things we significantly underestimated.  We've found that the vast majority of the media outlets seem to be taking advantage of the recent boom of ICOs and are demanding up-front payment on the order of 10BTC or more for basic listing/twitter services, etc...  We have some support, but our model is such that we are accountable to our backers for any money spent on marketing. And as such it needs to neatly (and justifiably) fit into our marketing budget already declared.  We've found a few excellent souls willing to help, but the majority seem to be clinging to the bubble...  We'll see how that pans out in the long run as the ICO market becomes more ""mature"". In the meantime we're doing our best to promote it any way we can and get the word out there. I think we'll get it across the line, but certainly lots of lessons learned about the unique aspects of running an ICO as a means to fund a project!  Thanks!",False

In addition we can potentially expand the team, and tackle additional features beyond the basic promised scope.  So let’s keep up the pace! Every bit of contribution helps make BattleDrome that much more of a success!  The ICO still has quite a bit of time left, so let’s keep the support rolling in!

[In Development],"   That was essentially my reaction as well... There have been some that have been willing to list for free, and a few that were willing to work with our model of marketing funds being dependent on the success of the ICO (and understanding that we have a realistic budget, not a ""let's raise $100M and go to the Caribbean"" budget)  So we've been able to get word out, but we suffered in the first (nearly half) of the campaign, due to underestimating that market, and the avenues for promotion/exposure  All good though, as we've hit our goal, and are coasting towards a successful finish in a couple weeks time approx. And as we get more exposure, more sites are listing us, and we're being contacted by more promotion opportunities. And hopefully our community program will drive some social exposure (still plenty of bounties to grab!)  Thanks!",False

[In Development],"A word about smart contract security  With all the news of hacked wallets, thefts, vulnerable ERC20 tokens, etc… I wanted to take a moment to provide some clarity (on how these things apply to BattleDrome) and our opinions/perspectives  First of all let’s get this out in the open: BattleDrome is NOT affected by the recent multi-sig vulnerability!  Does this mean that the ICO Ecosystem, or Network is insecure? And we should stop investing in new startups? NO! Definitely not! (if anything, it highlights the need for further investment, and development!). Though it does highlight things to be aware of as an investor (more about that later).  Ok, now that that’s out of the way… Let’s talk a bit about why that is:  So what exactly happened? How did the theft occur?  Well you’ve all probably heard several posts about this, but here is a short version:  There was a small bug in some central library contracts used by (primarily) the default contract provided by the Parity client for users when they create a Multi-Sig Wallet.  This bug allowed an attacker with the right know-how to “reset” the wallet to a “new” state, which then allowed them to set themselves as the “owner” of the wallet (making it easy to withdraw the money).  Further details on the exploit itself can be found here: https://blog.ethcore.io/the-multi-sig-hack-a-postmortem/  How does this affect BattleDrome?  It doesn’t.  There are 2 smart contracts in play for BattleDrome: The FAME ERC20 Token (which controls FAME balance) The BattleDrome ICO Contract (which houses the ICO funds, and acts as an on-chain escrow during the ICO itself).  Both of these contracts were developed from scratch. And we are not leveraging any centralized libraries in them (so no vulnerability to the delegate call exploit used in the Parity Multi-sig wallet), also the ERC20 address exploit is explicitly blocked in our Token code.  Did we do this because we knew there was an exploit and we knew a fix? No. Nobody saw this coming. In our case we simply wanted to take another approach instead of re-using the same old contract code everyone’s been using for the majority of ICOs out there. We thought we could do things differently, and wanted to take a stab at providing a more secure, trustworthy ICO for our investors.  So what does this mean for investors in the whole ICO ecosystem?  Developer due diligence is important. Make sure your devs know what they are doing and aren’t just “copy and pasting” some existing code.  Code Review practices are important. Ensure your devs are reviewing/testing their code, and that they are conducting third-party code audits of any contract code before it’s published live on the main-net.  If this information isn’t readily available, then ASK the developers to provide it. This shouldn’t be an unreasonable request to ask someone you are about to invest money in to support their idea/cause/project.  The above said, we all need to be aware that the Ethereum Ecosystem is still very young. Think “Where the Web was in the early 90s” kind of thing. The tools, systems, and libraries need time to mature.  It’s important to continue to pour more investment into the ecosystem, despite unexpected circumstances like this. That investment drives more talent, and mind-share into the ecosystem. Over time that leads to better tools, systems, libraries, procedures, best-practices, etc. And these things lead ultimately to mature methodologies that result in secure software.  Other thoughts & comments:  Everyone likes to focus on how Ethereum is “Web 3.0”. But there is an important difference many others have called out. With Smart Contracts there is finality. You can’t simply “iterate” or develop in a traditional “agile” methodology. Sure there are mechanisms you can use to reduce the impact of this, but ultimately a Smart Contract is a final thing once deployed.  This means that Ethereum Development is much less like traditional web application development today, and much more akin to things such as integrated circuit design, embedded system design or aerospace engineering. These industries still write code, but that code needs to be as close as possible to bullet-proof at time of deployment. Once it’s released, it’s final, and can’t be changed (easily).  Ethereum is a new beast. The software industry has never seen anything quite like it. Developing immutable smart contracts on the blockchain has it’s own nuances, and complexities. We need to build up new best-practices that apply to this new paradigm.  These are all things that the BattleDrome development team hopes to bring to bear during development of our platform. Our team has experience in a broad array of development industries, which we can draw from as we find our way in this new ecosystem, including Hardware design, Integrated Circuit design, Enterprise Application development, Web Application development, Financial Sector, Military, and Aerospace.  Again, thank you for your support of our project, and we look forward to making this project (and our future projects) a great success with your support. Keep the funding rolling into the ICO!  Also reminder, don’t forget about our Community Program! There are still several bounties up for grabs! And referral bonuses!",False

[In Development],"Notice: Gas Cost & Contributing  I’ve just noticed that several initial contributions failed to go through as a result of the transaction running out of gas.  It is absolutely critical that you include 85,000 gas with your transaction when sending in a contribution to BattleDrome!   Don’t worry, if this happened to you, your ether isn’t magically lost, the transaction simply failed and you should attempt to send it through again (this time with the correct gas amount).  The reason this wasn’t caught, is that some wallets (like Parity) auto-detect the right gas amount on default sending transactions.  Others send with a default amount such as 21,000.  I’m sincerely sorry this was missed in the instructions. They have been updated to reflect this, and clearly note the gas requirement.  Luckily it’s only affected a couple of transactions at this point.  Please remember, if you have any trouble at all during the ICO, don’t hesitate to contact the BattleDrome team at: icosupport@battledrome.io  Thanks again for your support, and if your transaction failed, please re-try with the correct gas amount.  To check if your TX failed you can either execute the checkEthBalance function on the ICO contract (passing in your address). Which will let you know your balance (if it reflects what you think it should, then you are good, if not, you likely have a failed transaction).  You can also go to https://etherscan.io/address/0xeaaf270436a0ed397ed23bbf64df7b1dcaff142f And look at the failed contribution attempts in the tx log there. (they are clearly marked)  Some of these transactions failed because they were sent before the ICO actually opened as well. (again same outcome, please re-send, ensuring to use right gas amount).",False

[In Development],"Thank you! 24 hours in, and already at 22% of goal!  Just wanted to post a quick update and say THANK YOU!  We’re just 24 hours in approx. Based on blocks, we’re about 2.5% of the total duration of the ICO. And we’re already at over 110ETH raised, over 22% of the minimum goal! That’s a fantastic milestone, and sets an excellent trend for the rest of the campaign. (considering that campaigns without a front-weighted discount scheme, which we opted out of for simplicity. Have a tendency towards the majority of their contributions ramping up later in the campaign, this means there is actually a possibility of us selling out in this campaign, based on this very early indication, though at this point prognostication is a bit premature as we don’t have a broad enough sample yet).  Reaching the minimum goal will mean we can definitely deliver on what we’ve promised, and make BattleDrome a success. But at this rate, we are on track to significantly exceed the minimum goal, and if we can do that, I think everyone will be amazed at what we can achieve. The more we raise beyond the minimum, the more we can deliver. With more budget, and the potential of a bigger team, we can deliver an even more compelling platform.  So thank you very much for your support so far!  Keep spreading the word! And keep those contributions rolling!  Let’s make BattleDrome into THE go-to online gaming and entertainment platform!",False

[In Development],"Announcing our Community Campaign!  Well, you’ve all been asking for it, and we’ve spent a lot of time coming up with a program we hope everyone will be excited about, but which works within the specific challenges we have as a result of our ICO model.  First let me explain why this was difficult: We have already launched the ICO and it’s 100% in the control of the ICO contract. Even we can’t alter the outcome at this point. This is by design for security. This means we can’t simply re-allocate any of the tokens, or money. We do have one thing we can play with. The 5% additional tokens minted for the Dev Team. (which is already much lower than the norm right now!)  We have decided to sacrifice some of our cut for YOU! Our community!  I know we’ve had a lot of demand for forum signature campaigns, and translations. But after significant thought we want to spend the little bit of tokens we have wisely on this Bounty Program. And we also need to use mechanisms we can track with 100% certainty.  We’ve come up with the following program: Twitter Campaign = 1% of all FAME issued Referral Program = 2% commission on any referrals for you, and a 1% bonus for the referee. Translations = Fixed price of 20 FAME awarded to the first person (yes, it’s a race) to post a valid translation in one of 5 pre-requested languages (and only in those languages).  Keep reading below for all the details on each of these campaigns!  Twitter Campaign  The Twitter Campaign will be allotted 1% of the total tokens minted (that’s 1/5 of our entire share!). Here is how it will work:  In order for a tweet to qualify: It must contain the hashtag #BattleDrome It must contain a shortened link to our website battledrome.io (shortened links are ok) It must contain the first 24 characters of your Ethereum Address that you wish to be credited with the bounty. The tweet must be made while the ICO is active and accepting contributions. Use up the remaining character limit with your ensorsement of BattleDrome’s ICO!  How the reward will be distributed: At successful completion of the ICO, the 1% of all FAME will be set aside, and divided into shares. All tweets that match the requirements will be gathered using the Twitter APIs (this may take up to 30 days from completion of the ICO to tally all the data, etc). Each qualifying tweet, will be multiplied by the number of followers that the poster has. For example, if you tweet 100 times through the campaign, and you have 20 followers, you will get 2000 shares. If however you tweet 20 times, and have 1000 followers, you will get 20,000 shares. Etc. All shares will be added up for each 24 character “address prefix”. And the total share count (and resulting FAME balance) will be posted publicly via a google sheet. Each participant will need to email us at twitter_campaign@battledrome.io with your full address, in order to claim your bounty. Upon claiming, the FAME will be transferred to your address.  Referral Program  We’re sacrificing potentially another 3% of our share (at least for the referrals) to help you recruit your friends/family/contacts!  By referring in another contributor. You get 2% commission of their contribution! And they get a 1% bonus for being referred!  This means for example, if you refer in someone who contributes 5 ETH, they normally get 500 FAME, but now they will get 505 FAME, and you will get 10 FAME just for the referral!  Requirements: The Referee must contribute at least 5 FAME minimum. This is because there is a fair bit of clerical work to track this. (Lesson learned, next time we’ll build this into the ICO contract. But for now we have to work with what we have.) The Referee must create a signed message saying “I am address XXXX and I was referred by address YYYY” and sign it with the private key of address XXXX. This message must be sent to referrals@battledrome.io in order to claim the referral commission/bonus for each party. Once the ICO is successful, the bonus FAME will be sent along with other Bounty pay-outs (may take up to 30 days from ICO completion). This is because it must be done manually by the dev team. The contributor will still get their normal amount immediately upon ICO closure, but the 1% bonus, and 2% commission will be paid out manually.  Translations:  This is a popular request, and we understand we want to be inclusive of as many people as we can. However we totally underestimated this at ICO launch.  We don’t have unlimited funds to work with, and so we’ve decided that based on statistics (which we’ve been gathering from several channels) our leading demographics appear to be (in this order): English Japanese Korean Russian Mandarin  So here is the deal:  First person to post a confirmed translation of our main post in BitcoinTalk with the following requirements: Translation posted as a reply in our main thread Cross-post in the appropriate language specific forum in bitcointalk (if applicable) Add a link to the main thread in your signature on bitcointalk Translation validated as correct (not the first to be validated. The first reply in the thread for each language which later is confirmed to be valid is the winner, if the first reply is found to be invalid, then it falls to the second, etc.) Decision on what is “correct” is entirely up to us.  Will receive the bounty of 20 FAME. To be paid out at ICO successful completion.  There will be 5 accepted translations (for a total of 100FAME paid out, which by the way is another 1/5 of our total share of the minimum goal): Japanese Korean Russian Mandarin Esperanto (just for fun)  Note: This does NOT mean we are discriminating against other languages. We encourage others to translate to other languages if you wish. However we simply don’t have the budget to allow any arbitrary translation. The above were chosen because of the gathered statistics about our audience, and determined to have the most impact.  First come, first serve! The race is on!  Conclusion:  We’re eager to hear your feedback on our community program/goals. And excited to see what you all come up with for this!  In addition I want to drop a hint. We have another big surprise planned, but it will come later in the ICO campaign. For now you’ll have to sit in suspense and try to guess what it might be!  Thanks again for all of your support! Let’s make BattleDrome a huge success together!",False

Tied to milestones during development cycles, and controlled by Escrow provider Full Transparency: YES! Via accounting for budget and expenditures through escrow on public google sheet  What is BattleDrome? BattleDrome is a platform/ecosystem for gaming which is built on top of a decentralized Battle Arena, allowing anyone to create a Warrior: an entity which exists on the Ethereum Network, which can be traded, trained, equipped, and entered into events to do battle with other Warriors for fun and profit!  Much like their roman gladiator predecessors, Warriors gain experience over time which they use to gain in skill and combat prowess. Warriors gain FAME throughout their career, a portion of which is transferred to their owner each time.  Events are regularly scheduled, by the community in a decentralized way, and have rules (number of warriors, skill level limitations, etc). Anyone may choose to enter their warriors during the ""Registration Period"". Following this period the ""Wager Period"" begins, allowing spectators to place wagers on the outcome of the event.  During both the registration and wager period, sponsors may choose to contribute some riches to be won by the victor of the event, in exchange for advertising during the event.  Perhaps now is a good time to mention that we intend for the events themselves to be a spectacle, visual, and animated, allowing the battle to unfold to spectators as you cheer on those who you've wagered on (and heckle those you've wagered against).  As the warriors battle, using the skills and equipment that their owner has helped them to gain (And the experience they've gained from previous battles), they may defeat other warriors. In this case a portion of the FAME held by the defeated warrior is taken by the one who bested them.  If at any time only a single warrior is left standing, they are victorious! Taking a large amount of FAME as a prize!  At any time an owner may retire their warrior, taking all the FAME of that warrior for themselves! But this warrior may never participate again, requiring them to start training a new warrior if they wish to continue to compete in events!  In addition, BattleDrome is a platform. Supporting the future development of additional activities, and extensions on what Warriors can do. Fancy team based battles? Or PvE Dungeons? Customizable AI which let you change strategy/behavior of your warrior? Etc, all of this is possible on top of the BattleDrome platform, and all powered by FAME!  What is FAME?  FAME is the ERC20 Token that powers the BattleDrome platform.  FAME is the heart of the BattleDrome Ecosystem. Much like the ancient Colosseum of Rome, FAME is the currency that all owners/patrons are vying for, it's what the crew/workers manning the arena are hoping to earn, it's what the warriors take from one another through skillful combat, and it's what those wishing to garner attention, and market their wares use to advertise.  BattleDrome was designed from the ground up to be a multi-faceted platform to encourage the demand for FAME, while providing an enjoyable entertainment experience regardless of your pleasure.  From a technical perspective FAME will be a fully ERC20 compliant token, which will be issued once, with limited supply, no further FAME can be minted after the ICO. The currency also supports ""burning"" (permanent destruction of FAME tokens) which will be how we destroy un-sold tokens at the end of the ICO. As a result, over time, scarcity of the resource will increase.  There will be an absolute maximum of 2.1 Million FAME minted (2 Million max ICO goal + 5% for Dev Team) during the ICO, however the actual final amount in circulation will vary based on the success of the ICO.  What is the proposed Development Timeframe? Here is the timeline from the website FAQ section. Each of these milestones (Alpha, Beta, Full Release) is tied to gradual funds release by the Escrow once milestone has been achieved and confirmed.   Who is the team behind this? The team is made up of 3 founding members. With the intent to hire/expand the team post-ICO depending on amount of funding raised. We have full capability to complete the promised goals with the 3 founding members, however by growing the team if higher funding goals are achieved, we can deliver more value. For example a more visually stunning engine, or additional features for initial release.  Paul Mumby: Founder & Lead Developer Paul (also known as Glasswalker on these forums) has been involved in the crypto ecosystem for a long time. He is also a life-long engineer, with extensive experience ranging from hardware design, robotics engineering, and software development. Currently the CTO of a rapidly growing reactive software development, and big data consulting firm, he has the previous experience, knowledge and skills to drive this project to success.  Jeff Warford: Co-Founder & Developer A longtime blockchain enthusiast, Jeff is an experienced Systems Architect, with a background in Linux system administration and backend web development. He now specializes in the design and architecture of web-oriented PaaS products.  Ian Anstey: Co-Founder & Systems Admin/Tester Ian is an experienced systems integrator and architect with zeal for blockchain development and applications. With a strong background in administration and deployment testing, he is currently a linux and virtualization integration specialist and consultant.  Why should I participate? We feel we have a strong market position (see below) Proof of concept completed, ready to push towards alpha/beta release very quickly Full Transparency Opportunities for FAME holders to vote (using their FAME balance) on dev decisions/features Low target goal Reasonably low ceiling Responsible limits on budgets Full Escrow with staged release of funds, protecting backers investment Very small developer retention of tokens No Pre-mining or pre-sale of tokens Future expansion already planned for ecosystem well beyond initial full release (further expanding value of tokens)  Significant market research done before the launch of this ICO reveals that we are in a sweet-spot for gaming: Gaming industry heavily favoring games which allow creation of ""pets"" which are built up to compete Crypto-currency wagering growing rapidly, exceeding 890Million BTC wagered in 2016 Gaming with ""limited control of risk"" extremely popular (games where the ""player"" controls an ""avatar"" who the player controls outside of the actual game, but during the game the player looses direct control. Examples of this model include the original gladiatorial games, and modern (though apalling and un-appealing) versions such as cock-fights and dog-fights) MMORPG gaming ecosystem created the third party market for digital items and ""trading"" of players We have combined all of these elements into a clean, safe, and fun gaming platform which is expandable, and supports a robust financial economy driven by the cycle of funds from adverising, logistics, participation, and wagering  How can I participate in the ICO? ICO Contract will contral all contributions. Designed to be quick and simple, and protect backers from risk! Simply send funds to ICO contract address from your Ethereum Wallet When ICO is complete, execute the payMe method on the ICO contract If ICO was successful, you get your tokens immediately! If ICO did not reach minimum goal, you get back all your Ether! Process with tutorial to be posted to website soon ICO Contract to be deployed very soon, at which time source code will be released open-source ICO DApp to be released in-time for ICO Start date July 1st  We plan to make this quick and easy via the DApp, but also not reliant on a complex process in case backers had unsupported browsers, wanted to use web based wallets, or hardware wallets, to conduct the transactions. This keeps it simple and flexible.  The combination of the ICO Contract, with pre-deployed Tokens, and the Escrow, creates a very safe, strictly controlled ICO, which minimizes risk to backers/investors.

[In Development],"  Apparently I underestimated the interest in a bounty program. We left this out as we are attempting to take a lean approach to the team, and overhead. We also tried to keep the scope small and simple to not need to run community bounties. However I'm now re-considering this. Will post an update soon once I've come to a decision.  Quote from: SimpeleSimpele on June 22, 2017, 02:07:06 AM how much total suply 3.9 million coin what is platform create batledrom coin, use etherum smart contract ERC20 token Total supply is variable based on crowdsale. We are minting 21 Million FAME, and those are controlled by the ICO smart contract. It will issue tokens directly to backers at the end of the ICO. However if only 5 Million FAME are sold, the remaining 16Million are burned, leaving the total supply at only 5 Million. So the supply will shrink down to only be what has sold during ICO (and no more can ever be minted). FAME divides to 12 decimal places.  As for the platform, the ERC20 token is our own code. We've implemented the ERC20 standard fully, but not basing it on other code or platform. And we're accounting for the known payload attack against many existing ERC20 tokens (our code has a fix in place to make it immune to that attack).  Our code for the ERC20 token will be available on our GitHub account very shortly (we expect by the end of this week). for public code review. And we will be validating the source code against the compiled on-chain contract via etherscan so that anyone can feel safe using the contract.",False

[In Development],"   Thanks for the heads up we did find that one in our initial research, and you are correct in that FAME Coin ran an ICO, however from everything I've been able to find I can't find their actual token in any of the established token registries. It was traded on an exchange at one point in time, and the developer ran off without finishing it. From what I could find it was ultimately de-listed on any trading exchanges.  The goals/intent of the two coins are nothing alike as well.  We may run into some issues overcoming any previous stigma the name carries, but it's a suitable name, and I think it will work well.  Ultimately we're confident ours will succeed and that one will be forgotten.",False

[In Development],"   Hi, thanks for the question. The reason it's stated this way is because the total supply will flex down depending on the outcome of the ICO.  But to translate, the minimum goal is 50,000 FAME tokens, with A maximum sold of 2Million FAME. There is no pre-mining, no pre-sale, etc. There is 5% above what is sold, reserved for Devs but that's it. (we are considering adding another 5% for bounties etc, but that's still being debated). Also the reason for the minimum goal, is if we don't raise 500 ETH, the whole thing is rolled back, everyone gets their ETH back, etc. And all the minted tokens go back to the devs for now. (much like the ""kickstarter"" model, this doesn't preclude us from attempting again in the future, but if we don't meet the minimum goal, for all intents and purposes we call it off).  there are currently 2.1 Million tokens being minted which covers the absolute ceiling of 20,000 Ether for a total of 2 Million tokens sold plus the 5% extra for the dev team. But if we only raise 1000 ether for example, that means 100,000 coins get sold, and another 5000 coins reserved for devs. For a total of 105,000 coins. The remaining 1,995,000 tokens will be burned (which is supported directly in the ERC20 Token contract managing FAME), resulting in a reduction in total supply to only 105,000 total. Following this no more can ever be minted.  Since this question has come up more than once, I'll try to clarify further. I do have a FAQ entry on this on the main website, it's also explained in the token section, and I tried to answer it in an earlier post on this thread as well.  Hopefully this clears it up, and I'll try to provide a clearer picture of how this works in the FAQ.",False

[In Development],"Just a quick update post to let you all know: the FAME token is now LIVE on the main-net!  We have successfully completed extensive testing of the FAME token, and have now deployed it to the main net!  The FAME token has the following specs currently: Symbol: FAM Name: FAME Token Contract Address: 0x190e569bE071F40c704e15825F285481CB74B6cC Registered in Parity Token Registery Fully transactable in parity with standard tools Image Registered (nice end-user experience) Total Supply (currently) 2.1 Million FAME Currently held in secure BattleDrome Dev Account (until we deploy the ICO contract)  Note: Total Supply is CURRENTLY 2.1M. This will potentially change (shrink) depending on the outcome of the ICO. Any un-sold tokens will be burned, reducing the total supply on the token contract.  Note 2: Currently the Dev account holds the tokens. Once the ICO contract completes it’s round of testing (it’s a more complex contract, and requires a bit more testing) we will deploy it, and then all FAME will be transferred to beheld by the ICO contract (well before ICO launch date). This will be verifiable on-chain.  Tomorrow, we’ll be validating the contract source against the contract on Etherscan.io, and releasing the source code for the Token and ICO contract on our github account.  I’ll release an updated post when that happens.  One step down, several more to go!",False

[In Development],"The ICO Contract is now LIVE on the main-net! chriseth of the Solidity Dev Team kindly volunteered some of his time to give us a code review. Based on his findings we made a few tweaks to the ICO contract, and ran it through a full round of additional testing.  As of last night, the ICO Contract is now LIVE! That means you can now verify directly with the contract, that everything is ready to go, and once the contract state changes from “started=false” to “started=true” you can begin contributing to the ICO.  The ICO Contract maintains all required state, making it easy to check/verify status of the ICO throughout, and verify your balance, etc.  The deployed address of the ICO contract on the main net is: 0xeaAf270436a0ed397ED23BBF64DF7b1DCAfF142F  If you have Parity, you can simply add the ICO contract to your watch list, and then from there you can view it’s status, or execute functions. In addition, for just viewing status, and querying balances you can do that directly via EtherScan, the source code has been verified via their service. Which means if you go to the token address above via their search, and click the “Read Contract” tab, or you can go to this link: https://etherscan.io/address/0xeaaf270436a0ed397ed23bbf64df7b1dcaff142f#readContract  From there, you can view all the variables in the contract, or query the constant methods such as balances of an address, etc. Directly via the Etherscan web interface.  Coming very soon (likely next 24h) I’ll post another blog entry with detailed instructions on how to contribute, followed by a detailed post about the various methods/variables and what they do (or you can just go read the source code on our github account if you’re familiar with Solidity).  Now it’s just a waiting game. The ICO will open approx 1pm Eastern Time, on Canada Day (July 1st). At which point it will begin accepting contributions!  It’s all in the hands of the blockchain now!

[In Development],"   Hi! Thanks for the comments!  Unfortunately we didn't consider bounties in the original marketing plan, we underestimated interest in this aspect of the campaign. We are considering it, but with the short amount of time before the ICO start, we haven't time to sort out bounty details before then.  That said we do plan on releasing some kind of Bounty plan once the ICO Begins (which is only 3 more days!)  Whatever we release will be a small portion of the already slated Developer Portion. (in otherwords it won't affect the proposed budget at all, we will give up a share of our 5% cut to fund bounties).  As for your request for a screenshot for the game, currently in the dev roadmap you'll see that we don't have plans to begin the Spectator Engine until after the Alpha is released. Most of the complexity has been in developing a robust set of rules and mechanics that can be enforced purely in the blockchain without too high a cost in gas, or impact in performance. This is where all of our development effort has been focused so far. And we have completed the prototype of the on-chain game engine.  However we have no visual UI or aspects at this time to show. However with our existing experience in game development, and leveraging industry leading game engine technology, we expect to be able to develop a visual demo very early on in the development cycle.  While I understand it would have been helpful to have a visual example during the campaign, it is a simple matter of where our time and investments are best spent. And up until this point that has been on the core technical challenges. The Spectator Engine has it's own set of challenges, but none of them have anything to do with the look and feel of the game.  In addition, it is our hope that the look/feel and visual style of the game is something we intend to put to vote shortly after ICO completion (along with several other decisions along the development cycle) so that those who have invested in FAME can use their FAME balance to vote on how they want the features to play out (or how they want the game to look). Will it be retro style? Or AAA Realistic graphics? 2D? or 3D? etc... We want to pose those questions to the top investors, and end-users, and let them decide as we complete development.  As a result for a number of reasons, having a visual demo at this stage is simply impossible. Hopefully you can appreciate that, and understand why we made those decisions.  Thanks again for your interest! Hopefully we can look forward to working with you after the successful completion of the ICO!",False
