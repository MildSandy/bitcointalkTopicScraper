The Creative Industry is undoubtedly a gigantic and promising global market that will maintain its strong growth as society and technology continue advancing. However, the rapid advancement of IP also brings inevitable challenges to the field. Due to outdated basic infrastructure, severe information asymmetry and centralized governance doctrine, the Creative Industry has been confronting many problems,  1. Unclear Ownership Due to unclear ownership, many quality IP and content are not able to incubate effectively. Disputes are frequent.  2. Inadequate Data Authenticity Such inadequacy often leads to unfair distribution of proceeds, which greatly frustrates the motivation and creativity of quality content creators.  3. Centralised Governance of Publishing, Distribution and Platform Management Centralised governance results in various problems, such as inferior contents being marketed as premium products, unfair allocation of resources, hostile environment for young creators, and quality content and IP being neglected.  4. Immense Difficulty to Convert Original Contents to Liquid Assets Majority of the creators need a faster and more direct channel to convert their work into cash or cash equivalent.  5. Inadequacy in Ecosystem and Infrastructure in the Industry Due to this problem, there has been inadequate exploitation, creation and liquidity of value in the Creative Industry. Except for a small fraction of top-notched IPs, many quality content in the upper intermediate category are only utilized once and the utilization tends to be very elementary. As such, their potentials are not fully tapped into.  The above problems often manifest into two major complaints: unfair distribution of proceeds and irrational operation of the system.  Ink seeks to solve these problems. Through our development of the blockchain-based content generation, discovery, circulation, consumption, investment, commercialization system and related ecosystem, we can effectively tap into the various advantages of the blockchain technology. Our platform will ensure fairer distribution of proceeds and more rational operation of the industry. Ultimately, we will provide a new, comprehensive and capacious ecosystem for all original contents.",False

INK’s strategy is “Glocalization"", a combination of ""Globalization"" and ""Localization"". Under this framework, INK will customize, deploy and operate multiple INK consortium blockchains in different cultural context across the globe. Each INK consortium blockchain will become a distributed infrastructure for the local creative industry, focusing on the realization of synergies with the highly-efficient localized business networks. Such synergies will then be globalized using INK’s cross-chain protocol which provides interoperability between a public chain (Qtum or Ethereum), and INK consortium-chains. This will streamline the transfer of value and information across different chains and create an efficient globalized network.  Currently we have achieved cross-chain transfer applications.

It’s All About Protecting Their Work  Script writers, vloggers, designers, musicians, photographers and other content producers take note: Blockchain-based platforms are about to change the way you manage and monetize creative works. Technology is turning every person into a content creator, discoverer, disseminator and consumer. Internet literature, video clips, live streaming and paid knowledge have emerged as some of the many forms of digital content that we consume.  The counterfeiting of U.S. digital content such as music, film and books costs the U.S. economy over $60 billion per year. But outdated infrastructure, lack of information and bad practices lead to content creators not getting a fair shake. For example, plagiarism, piracy, inadequate data authenticity and other obstacles make it difficult to maintain control over intellectual property (IP). And when it comes to their wallet, creators often struggle to convert their works to cash.  Ink thinks there’s a better way, namely the blockchain. The Singapore-based project (creator of the INK token) is building a blockchain-based protocol, platform and IP asset exchange (to be launched in April) where content creators can register works and do business directly, rather than working through a middleman who takes a cut of their revenues. These empower content producers to convert their works into compensation and receive proceeds faster. While public users of the platform can ensure the highest-quality content stands out. As proof of the project’s potential, Ink says it will announce key participants and partners in February 2018.  https://medium.com/@inklabsfoundation/can-blockchain-help-artists-its-all-about-protecting-their-work-69ec6c9b8974",False

Do come and test it by logging in your wallet and experiencing Blockchain transactions! Mobile version will come out soon afterwards.  INK Wallet is a lightweight Blockchain assets manager introduced by INK based on developer community. The wallet is built on core codes of Qtum Blockchain, allowing users to manage their own accounts as well as initiate and accept transactions in Qtum Blockchain network.  Three core functions to manage Blockchain assets effectively  The three core functions of INK wallet include wallet creation and restoration, assets initiation and acceptance, and transaction record enquiry.  · The wallet creation function sets up unique memory words and retrieves the only wallet address and encrypted wallet files for first-time users; the wallet restoration function allows users to import their wallets on other devices by using memory words.  · The assets initiation and acceptance function allows users to freely transfer their assets on Qtum Blockchain, and enables them to make collections and transfer assets face-to-face through QR code (which will come out soon with the mobile version).  · At the same time, INK Wallets leverages the unperturbable nature of Blockchain networks to provide users with the complete transaction history. Moreover, with the user-friendly filtering function, users will be able to manage their assets more effectively.  Three dominant advantages make usage safe and convenient  · Security: INK wallet use encrypted wallet files as a primary mean of access, which reduces the frequency of words input, and therefore lower the possibility for malicious software to steal keywords and cause a loss to assets.  · Stability: Data request for Blockchain network is supported by exclusive Full Nodes that operate independently, which ensures the validity of data communication.  · Convenience: Optimized support for QRC20 certificates hides abstract intelligent contract logic in the background, which allows users to manage and manipulate such certificates more intuitively.  There will be no obstacles between web and mobile wallet address (public and private key) after the launching of mobile wallet, avoiding the inconvenience of requiring multiple wallet addresses on different platforms. Users will be able to manage their own Blockchain assets anytime and anywhere.  Currently, INK wallet is in support of both Qtum and INK Blockchain assets. Support for other Token-type assets issued in the INK Pan-IP ecosystem will come out subsequently. In addition, INK wallet will further integrate and support various Blockchain services provided by Ink, especially those related to cultural creativity industry.",False

Ink has put forward the concept of “trusted Sovereign Consortium Blockchain for regional use cases”, which is essentially a consortium blockchain that operates within a specific sovereignty. The structure makes it easier to deal with problems originating from different legal frameworks and different regulatory policies. At the same time, Ink focuses on the Creative Industry. The content has a strong cultural attribute. Due to difference in race, history and geographical locations, different parts of the world have markedly different and cultures. Therefore, a consortium blockchain for a specific area and culture will enjoy native and inherent convenience when providing industrial services.  Ink's Sovereign Consortium Blockchain is a collection of high-performance permissioned blockchain solutions. Its underlying technical framework follows the standards of the Hyperledger project. Aiming at generic application scenarios in a specific geographical region (such as the Creative industry in China), it comes with a series of customisation and enhancement.  Ink Sovereign Consortium Blockchain inherits all the superior features of Hyperledger Fabric, and it carries a series of innovative designs, such as incentive mechanisms, off-chain content storage improvement, as well as cross-chain interoperability. In short, it is a complete, robust and well-designed permissioned consortium blockchain solution. what's more, Ink Sovereign Consortium Blockchain integrates with the “Qtum-based Intellectual Property Asset Exchange, and its corresponding token and ecosystem “and “Ink Cross-chain Protocol” to form a complete solution.",False
