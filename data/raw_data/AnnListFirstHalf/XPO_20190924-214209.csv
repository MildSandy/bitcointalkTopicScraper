Thank you for your interest. The general cryptomarket falling has tightened the process of stabilization of XPO at the GAV level. But the crypto-currency wallet, the XRSS stabilization system and the bots are debugged and work. Recently, we have focused on developing GLOBULA game - the next step of our project. The release of it will ensure a constant demand for coins at the GAW target price. The expected period of stabilization is the beginning of 2019.

We guaranteed the presale and ICO sell prices, we guaranteed XPO backing by Cryptocurrency Basket, wich grows or falls with a whole market, but we never guaranteed profitability.

You can find me and our team here anyday and anytime.   3. A language mix for making the project meaningful. Part of the text, including Terms & Conditions, isn't translated into Russian, while the main website content is translated, and the team itself obviously has Russian roots and attracts funding among the Russian-speaking audience. The legal situation has changed so recently that Terms & Conditions has simply not been translated to russian. We did not have time for it, I'am really sorry about that. If the main part of the team speaks Russian, it does not mean that they are all Russians.   4. The team hasn't been in contact to answer our questions. You can contact me, team or our helpdesk at any time. Whom they tried to contact... I don't know.   5. Complex words and constructions, whereas all the same can be described much easier and more clearly, can be a sign of deliberate complication of the perception, which is not very good for investors. If someone can explain our project in a simpler language - we are ready to pay for it   6. A small number of subscribers in social networks. It is true. We don't want to buy phantom users, we are interested in real followers and subscribers.   7. Considerable discrepancies in the text on the website and the laid out documents. For example, on the website's Terms & Conditions we couldn't find the promised guaranteed profitability, moreover, there is a complete disclaimer of liability. Of course they could not find promised guaranteed profitability, because we did not promise such a thing, there is nothing about  guaranteed profitability in legal documents, Whitelist, Whitebook and website (I'll re-read it just in case.)",False

We have a completely new communication protocol between nodes and a new consensus algorithm. That allows you to achieve a huge transaction speed  and the highest scalability. 2. We have a geolocation game Globula, which in itself is a very viable product in which Xronos is applied. Globula is a specifically marketing tool for introducing Xronos into the masses. 3. Xronos is backed by dynamic crypto-assets basket (here you can see how it works in last one and half year). 4. Xronos uses specific mechanisms of rate stabilization (XRSS), as well as the invented GAW index, to which the target rate is pegged (in fact it is pegged to the human man-hour, which is expressed in SDR). Thanks to this mechanism we can provide 200% currency backing (super stablecoin). 5. Xronos has a key technology for achieving absolute decentralization, which allows you to create mobile and light nodes, unify a specific user but not publicize any information about him (one man - one node). 6. Bonds: Off-Chain transactions - disconnection of the recipient-sender chain  But in fact, the whole strength is not in these individual products, but in their sum. Therefore this synergy effect we call ""The sum of technologies"".  PS. Fresh Globula sketches from today: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSdHTwkAs0 Sorry for my bad english )",False

At the end of presale we acquired 17.61 BTC. There is 106 unique backers, that believed in XRONOS. We want to thank the participants for supporting the idea.  The XRSS has confirmed its efficiency: at the end of the presale the backing of each XPO coin increased from $ 1.79 (80% of selling price) to $ 2.46. This is entirely the merit of the XRSS, which allows XRONOS gradually increase the price of coins through supporting orders  During the presale we received a lot of feedback: both positive and negative. We will listen the reasonable voices of the crypto community (which not only hung labels, but also argued their point of view), and we will correct the development strategy and product positioning. We want to make uniquely XRONOS perception by users, and that support of community was invaluable. Thanks to everyone who supported us with criticism or bitcoin: with you we will become stronger and now we can achieve our goal faster than before.

New exchanges and our plans for ICO During November, everyone will be able to use the XPO / BTC cryptocurrency pair on a decentralized exchange. At the presale there was only one exchange avilable for trades, but now we are negotiating with new exchanges about the establishment of partnership. At the time of the Xronos release in exchange trades, speculative growth of its price is expected to be approximately 20-30%. It will be achieved through a constant wall of buy orders, thanks to which the liquidity of the coin itself is ensured.

The question is simple, do people believe in this technology or not? For those who believe - XRONOS provides a perfect option for expedient investment. XRONOS is backed by ~ 95% dynamic portfolio of foremost crypto assets, which means that XRONOS ensuring reflects the movement of the entire crypto-market. From this point of view, XRONOS is a set of capitalizations of all the coins that make up the backing portfolio. But this is how it just begins…  About XRONOS in a nutshell  XRONOS — is an absolutely new stable cryptocurrency backed by dynamic portfolio of crypto-assets and supported by markets of application. The cost of one coin is attached to the average man-hour expressed in SDR.  Specification  Hashing / encryption algorithms: AES, DES, RSA, Blowfish, SHA-160, SHA-256, SHA-512 Block Time: Immediately Consensus: Own algorithm. The development uses the principles and technologies underlying the well-known algorithms and protocols: CryptoNight, Zero-knowledge proof and Proof-of-Stake. Protocol: Custom format. The protocol is based on a ""ring signature"" (similar to the CryptoNote protocol). Fork: Xronos is not a fork, it's 100% new code Multi-Signature: Yes Opensource: It is planned to be opened after a number of external audits, and after reaching the last stage of stabilization Official ticker: XPO The target price of XPO: GAW (currently $21.53 or 15.215 SDR) Starting XPO price: 1/10 GAW   Primary goal  The goal of XRONOS is to create the first truly stable cryptocurrency.  Secondary goal  Creation of a user environment which allows the most efficient allocation of economic and other useful resources through the use of Smart Human Relations contracts, the fulfillment of which is guaranteed via geolocation arbitrage.  Mission  Short: Our mission is to create a truly decentralized, stable, massively applied crypto payment instrument that will accelerate the process of fiat money transformation into cryptocurrency and help move from an outdated banking system to a new stage of the world economy evolution. Mission in details  Video explainers  Xronos Stable Cryptocurrency / Technology & Targets XRONOS Presale Information XRONOS Idea Explanation Globula powered by Xronos - Game Teasers Globula gameplay powered by Xronos  Emission mechanism  Minting - emission is based on the sale of XPO by an emission robot on a decentralized exchanges at a fixed price.  Nodes owners rewarding  Masternodes are required to have 1000 XPO collateral, a dedicated IP address, and be able to run 24 hours a day. Masternodes get paid from network TX-fees, in which it participates. The appearance of new nodes occurs dynamically when the network reaches a certain number of transactions for a certain period. TX-fee for each transaction is constant and equals 0.001 XPO.  Key advantages  - Unique stack of reliable technologies. 100% new code - Off-Chain transactions - disconnection of the recipient-sender chain due to the bonds functioning - Unique combination of PoW and PoS technologies, so as CryptoNight and Zero-knowledge proof algorithms - Instant transactions - at the moment 96 TPS with a load of 2000 threads, but this is clearly not the limit. - Network elasticity, expandability and scalability - XRSS - system of rate stabilization based on adaptation of collective decisions by ring signature and ZKP - Self-optimizing blockchain - The technology enabling reformation of labor markets and world legal system - Simplicity of use and integration - The mechanism of virtual (or game) objects tokenization. - GLOBULA – innovative tool for demand stimulation   What is GLOBULA - extremely short description  GLOBULA is a geolocation game of a new genre, we call it MGMOGRCE (Massively Geolocation Multiplayer Online Game with Real Crypto Economy).  XRONOS is the only currency applied in the GLOBULA world. The game itself creates a monopoly market for the circulation of cryptocurrency: a large number of different items and resources. In addition, the game has a geolocation quests constructor, which allows you to create a variety of user-generated content.  This constructor is actually the progenitor and the test lab of a more complex system of interhuman interactions based on the eventive language SHRL, which is the basis of the future Work.space product.  We believe that the most effective way of integration of certain innovative technologies is to implement them into a global game. Therefore, Globula is not just a side product of Xronos, but it is one of the key tools for full-fledged application of Xronos into everyday life.  You can read more details in our Whitebook. The information solely about the game is available at www.globula.space.  ICO and Presale  Presale XRONOS: 1 000 000 XPO have been offered at the rate $2.15/XPO.

XRSS — XRONOS real-time stabilization system — is a complicated technology, lying in the base of XRONOS aggregator, making it unique. XRSS is the one responsible for XPO exchange rate control and transferring the funds into / out of the system. Operation options are not pulled out of the hat, but, of course, logically constructed.  Let’s mentally teleport to the nearest future, when Presale and ICO are over, and XRONOS becomes a Stable Coin. How the system works in field conditions? Where the exchange rate comes from? How it is controlled by the system? First things first.  The price of 1 XPO is attached to GAW value and it is denominated in SDR. What these abbreviations stand for? GAW is a worldwide average index, expressing the cost of a working hour on the planet. Its calculation is based on the open data, officially provided by OECD member countries. These countries take the data from revenue services and other institutions doing statistics.  SDR is the index used by IMF for internal calculations between member states of the fund. It consists of five largest and strongest currencies in proportion to their volume in the global economy. It is like a powerful cryptocurrency basket, which is so heavy, that it stays stable, especially comparing it to the prices storm at the currency exchanges.  That means that the price of 1 XPO is bound to two average indexes of global economy, which are stable and secure enough to rely on. Backing and liquidity are the only things that left to sort out.  How to hold the exchange rate in leash? Firstly, the correct price of the coin must be calculated. All the computations on the planned XPO price are conducted by so called XBA, analytical xronobot. It is also responsible for other tools’ operations, which are two other xronobots (XBE and XBG), and for strategy of “digital gold and currency reserve”, meaning cryptocurrency basket. To make it happen, the bot gathers the statistics on cryptocurrency and market conditions, information about GAW and SDR, analyzes the data and acts basing on the results. It constructs a plan for rates of purchase and emission of XPO during next 24 hours.  XBE - emitting xronobot Since XRONOS doesn’t use mining as new tokens resource, new coins emission is conducted only through its purchase at the market. Income is directed to the guarantee xronobot. The intensity of emission depends directly on its demand. Tons of crypto needed ASAP? Then xronobot emits coins at the price of GAW +1%. Supply at the market is much higher than demand? Then emission won’t be conducted at all, users buy out all of the other users’ coins, who needed conversion into crypt or fiat money.  XBG - guaranteeing xronobot XBG is a distributor of “digital central bank”, which manages the gathers cryptoassets. Approximately 40% stay in the cold storage, others are used at the exchanges as the cryptocurrency basket. It also conducts demission of the funds, or in simple terms, its conversion into fiat money. If the XPO supply is higher than the demand, the coins are bought out by the bot at the price of GAW-1%. It takes money for withdrawal from selling the gathers goods.  Cryptocurrency basket In fact, this is a diversified storage for cryptoassets. Based on the data of the bot-analyst, XBG purchases a package of ""crypts"" in accordance to the market situation: preference is given to the most actively traded and stable coins. Their total capitalization equals 90-98% of the cryptocurrency market. The information about current state of the cryptocurrency basket managed by xronobots is open and available on the official website. It’s updated once a day.  Common logic In sum, XRSS works with a pretty trivial logic. Someone needs new coins - he just buys them on the exchange from other users or from chronobot. The rate is calculated by the bot-analyst and is controlled by two systems: emission and demission. The first sells coins at a price higher than the planned one, the second one is buying them at a price below the target. So users can only have a narrow 2% corridor of exchange rate fluctuations. If the price is out of it, it is more profitable to use xronobots.  Withdrawal guarantee The funds withdrawal is fully guaranteed by the accumulated crypto-assets. The fact is that XPO is bought in the crypto, and the price equals the rate of fiat money for a certain day. In the long term, the ""crypt"" will only rise in price, so 0.01 BTC invested once will increase its dollar / euro value. As a result, for the return of funds from the system it will be necessary to spend less ""bitcoins"" or other crypto currencies, so that all XPO can be safely bought and sold: this will practically affect neither the exchange rate of the cryptocurrency nor the stability of the market.  Balance of forces In the end, we have a simple and harmonious picture. Analytical bot calculates the standard price of one XPO coin and the composition of the cryptocurrency basket. Emitting bot sells new coins at the price that is 1% higher than the standard, and it also transfers income into cryptocurrency basket. Guarantee bot buys up unnecessary coins for 1% cheaper than the standard, meaning, it provides a guaranteed fast and safe withdrawal of funds. Speculators have no chance.  Today It is the right time to come back from elegant theories to harsh reality. Crypto-market is very speculative, and it is really hard to bring attention to the currency, which won’t rise in price. That is the exact reason why we conduct 4 steps of stabilization (2 Presales and 2 ICOs), during which the rate will be gradually rising up from 1/10 of the price to the planned number.  It is an instrument for gaining popularity for us. For you it is, firstly, a test-drive of the system with transparent risks and, secondly, an opportunity to gain some funds on your trust towards the project.",False

XRONOS, the first aggregator of cryptocurrency, is 100% ready to work. XRSS is on alert. The website is launched. Technical documents are designed and imposed. We can begin. Presale of XPO coins will last till 21 October, 2017.  Elevator pitch To someone who missed our previous posts, XRONOS is the first aggregator of cryptocurrency and blockchain-technologies. The main goal of the project is to create so-called Stable Coin: cryptocurrency which is stable in relation to fiat money. Consider it something like “Bretton Woods” system in digital performance, but instead of tangible and finite gold, other cryptocurrencies and their increasing capitalization are used as its backing.  What’s inside? The system consists of three products (own blockchain, Wallet app and XRSS program). Together they form XRONOS cryptocurrency, stable to fiat money. Each of the products has its own unique features. All of these features make the project a breakthrough. Blockchain XRONOS operates on the highest speed, it is self-optimizing and linearly scalable. XRSS - XRONOS Real-time Stabilization System - works by transparent rules, its operation is based on fully open sources, which allows everyone to predict ts behavior and to stay confident in the system’s reliability. You can learn more about it, following this link. XRONOS Wallet differs from classical crypto-wallets, because of its lightness and the fact that the user does not need much space on his device, and open API allows to expand its functionality in a snap. All of the three products are fully completed and ready to be tested by the first users, who will take part in the Presale of the new cryptocurrency from 21 September to 21 October, 2017.    Planned results and global goals? As we’ve already said, the closest and tangible goal is to create Stable Coin, which is cryptocurrency not attached to any fiat currency, but stable to them.  Globally, we want to create such a crypto circulating medium, which will enable cryptocurrency to enter the real sector of economy, to push outdated banking system and to ‘let the genie out of the bottle’ - to start a process of forming p2p-economy. To make it happen, our crypto must be truly decentralized, stable and, what is more important, mass-applied. This is what we aim for.  4 Stages of exchange rate stabilization For active growth of user database at the beginning and its further development, XRONOS has a planned period of speculative growth, divided into 4 parts. Each one of the stages is connected with the sale of extra XPO coins and guaranteed rise in price of the coins at the next stage. This way the functionality of the system can be gradually updated, tested and expanded without any security risks, while the capitalization of the new cryptocurrency will be increasing by degrees.  The uniqueness of the project Presales and ICOs is in allocation of the funds: just 20% of the gathered funds at each stage will be spent on development of the cryptocurrency and its services, while the remaining 80% will guarantee the financial capacity of the coin. This will back its liquidity, refund guarantee and lower the risks for the first users of the system.  Period of exchange rate growth is divided into 4 so-called “Stabilization stages”: Presale XPO, $2.15 per coin will last from 21 september to 21 october 2017; ICO XPO, $3.50 per coin will last from 21 november to 21 december 2017; Presale Globula, $10.75 per coin will held in march of 2018; ICO Globula, $16.15 per coin will held in june of 2018.  What’s next? After the emission of 21 million coins, XPO transforms into stable rate. Its arithmetically predicted cost equals $21.53 for 1 XPO, but in August 2018 it may be slightly corrected, as XRONOS is based on GAW and SDR indexes. Once the target values are reached (emission> 21,000,000 coins and a stable XPO rate), the percentages of the emission earnings distribution will change: 98% will go to the cryptocurrency basket, and only 2% will be spent in the Vertex Capital Management LTD favour, so the work on XRONOS and its motivating services can be continued.  How to take part? The starting point of the work with XRONOS is Bitcoin-wallet with some funds charged to it. Via your wallet you will be able to buy XPO coins. To work with the system you will need a personal account, which you can create here or using your mobile app. And your further actions are simple: enter official website and buy yourself a piece of your bright future.  Next week we will start doing detailed reviews of each element of the system, and by the Presale mid-point you will understand the way the project is organized just as good as we are.

According to the official website, ""XRONOS is an aggregator of cryptocurrency and blockchain-technologies. XRONOS target is to create the first truly stable cryptocurrency."" We identified several alarm signs, on the basis of which we reached conclusions on the low investment attractiveness of the project:  1. Guaranteed profitability. The promise of profitability above the bank deposit is a serious reason to think about the sources of this income. The multiple profit guarantee is a clear sign of fraudulent projects.  2. Questionable social networks profiles. The vast majority of participants' accounts are closed and don't contain a mention of the project.  3. A language mix for making the project meaningful. Part of the text, including Terms & Conditions, isn't translated into Russian, while the main website content is translated, and the team itself obviously has Russian roots and attracts funding among the Russian-speaking audience.  4. The team hasn't been in contact to answer our questions.  5. Complex words and constructions, whereas all the same can be described much easier and more clearly, can be a sign of deliberate complication of the perception, which is not very good for investors.  6. A small number of subscribers in social networks.  7. Considerable discrepancies in the text on the website and the laid out documents. For example, on the website's Terms & Conditions we couldn't find the promised guaranteed profitability, moreover, there is a complete disclaimer of liability.  Among the advantages, there are stylish pictures on Facebook, the presence of Edgar Otchenshenko in the team, whose Facebook page is more like the living one, and the fascinating White Paper.  The DigRate team highlighted this project because of advertising in Yandex.Direct, which, in our opinion, is aimed at the least informed users. The Digital Rating Agency recommends thinking carefully before investing in such assets and assessing all the risks. ICO with signs of fraud, buying advertising placements, will always cause the DigRate team increased interest. We will sensitize the public to projects that pursue the goal of enrichment by inexperienced investors. In our opinion, the listed facts are sufficient to assign ratings without a more detailed express report. According to the collective opinion of Digital Rating Agency, the investment attractiveness rating of the XRONOS is ""C"" - low investment attractiveness, high default risk in the short term. Fraud Rate Scam.  This evaluation expresses the view of Digital Rating Agency and is not a fact-finding or recommendation to buy, hold or sell those or other assets, make investment decisions.
