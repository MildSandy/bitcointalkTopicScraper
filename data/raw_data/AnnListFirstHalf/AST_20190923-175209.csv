So, in other words - this function allows user to collect payments easily.  Regarding question about currently available deposit methods. There's only one deposit method currently available to the public - Wire transfer. We have almost all popular payment methods implemented (such as BTC, ETH, wire, WesternUnion and etc.).",False

ASSETA plans to offer traditional and future financial products in the environment based on the blockchain technologies and finally become a principle of single window to all the requirements of modern banking operations. ASSETA will establish a digital bank and all the attention will be targeted to provide low cost, modern, easy to use and borderless financial services, for instance, payments, lending, insurance, currency (incl. most popular cryptocurrencies) exchanges and investments. To achieve such goal, ASSETA will apply for banking licences in the main jurisdictions. Also we are working on participation in payment networks, for instance, SEPA (European Union) and etc. The banking sector is still controlled by players, who act very traditionally. The future bank not only offers traditional banking services, but also transactions in crypto currencies and is totally integrated in “FinTech” market.   ASSETA - About us (in a few words)  In 2016 there was the company JSC “CRYPTO BANKAS” (holder of Asseta trademark) established, which aim was to analyse the market of the crypto currencies, its possibilities and the potential. There has been selected professionals to join team of ASSETA project for the analysis of these purposes, which would not only be able to implement the foreseen targets but also apply the latest technologies in the market of crypto currencies and online banking services. From 2016 we have collected information about the crypto currencies and analysed them, after the acquired results, the leaders of JSC “CRYPTO BANKAS” decided that there is a strong demand for global blockchain based digital bank to operate in the field of crypto currencies.   OUR GOAL  Our main goal is to build the bridge between crypto and real (fiat financial) worlds. Nowadays people who holds their assets in the digital format (crypto-currencies) faces problems in the field of operation with such assets in the real world. These problems are caused by the lack of tools that could help spending non-fiat currencies in the real world every day. We are going to brake all the barriers and borders between fiat and non-fiat worlds. We have developed the system based on blockchain, which will be the solution to solve this problem. Using our system, you will be able to transfer your funds globally, easily and for a reasonable price – no matter it’s fiat or crypto. It means that having an account at Asseta you will get the opportunity to operate with all your assets via one application. There will be no need to use external resources, such as exchangers. We strongly believe that the implementation of blockchain and smart contract technologies in the banking industry is the way this business might operate in the nearly future. We are going to offer the complete range of financial products and services needed for everyday use. It is estimated that over 6 million of people are dealing with crypto-currencies daily and this number is growing every day. So we have great opportunity for growth here with the potential to become a strong competitor for traditional banks.   THE BENEFITS OF HOLDING AST COIN (TOKEN)  •   Token buyback program. The 25% of net profit will be assigned to buyback program quarterly.  •   Each token holder will have opportunity to pay for Asseta services in AST coins (tokens) with up to %50 discount.  •   Special offers for long time investments made with AST tokens.  •   Token price increases significantly every time the company release new products/services.

Company ""CRYPTO BANKAS"" is the owner of trademark and the whole project which is named ""ASSETA"" (www.asseta.eu).  1. About your observations regarding polybius project. I'm not able to comment situation with ""Polybius"", as I don't know any ""insider's"" information regarding this company. I'm not intended to split rumours here - it' s not ethical.  2. About our ability to obtain banking license. It's not a big deal. There're two ways for us to go. The first one: to obtain banking license in Lithuania (we need to meet requirements to do so, but it's not a difficulty. You can check the list of requirements here: http://www.lb.lt/en/credit-and-payments-market) The second one: our parental company (the 100% shareholder of JSC ""CRYPTO BANKAS"") already owns a part (62% of shares) of the company (bank) which was granted with such license. So in the case that JSC ""CRYPTO BANKAS"" (ASSETA) will not be able to obtain such license, we will go with the banking license our companies group already has. In that case we'll merge these two companies (the process isn't simple, but this is the solution).  3. About participation in VISA/MC networks. Yes, there's hudge difficulties to participate in VISA network right now, especially with cryptocurrency (we are working on this) and, honestly, we don't know how to make them change their decision. But we have the solution: We can go with other card providers or we can go with our already owned banking license and agreement to issue payment cards. That way ASSETA will be the main platform to aggregate cryptocurrency and will have the gateway (our owned company with banking license) to the fiat currency operations.  4. The difference from other projects:    a.) Established company (CHECK IT)    b.) Already developed product    c.) Unique ICO and financial structure    d.) Token buyback program (The 25% of net profit will be assigned to buyback program quarterly)    e.) Responsibly selected jurisdiction (Lithuania - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania)",False

I don't clearly understand why this was done. Both countries (Belgium and Estonia) are in European Union membership. Only they know exact reasons, maybe it's due taxes or regulations. Also it could be impacted by nuances of their business model and strategy...  Vilnius is neither better nor worse. We have built our business strategy model specially for Lithuania. Also, we have already built up our team and employees (which are ready to start work). The main facts influensed our decision: 1. Lithuania is the only jurisdiction in the EU to have a special-purpose banking license, allowing the foundation of a bank with registered capital of just €1m 2. There are over 31 000 IT specialists (according to ""Information Technologies in Lithuania, 2016"") 3. Excellent infrastructure. Lithuania leads the EU in broadband speeds and fibre-optic internet penetration, which is expected to increase from the current 72% to 85% by 2020. 4. Not big average monthly wage. We can find really good specialists at affordable price. So it cuts our expences drastically 5. Forward-thinking government, regarding blockchain (http://www.themeditelegraph.com/en/green-and-tech/technology/2017/12/05/lithuania-emerges-blockchain-gateway-europe-YVX3gnWsH60lH36eLrU3qL/index.html)  Besides all the mentioned, today (January 27) The Blockchain centre was launched. Blockchain Centre (BC) Vilnius is the first blockchain technology centre connecting key stakeholders in Asia, Australia, and Europe (http://bcgateway.eu/).  In conclusion, we can say: Lithuanian government and citizens welcomes and supports all the blockchain projects",False
