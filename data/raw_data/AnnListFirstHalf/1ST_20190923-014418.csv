That's 11.6 millions USD total, as you can see on https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/firstblood/#charts, as of now the market cap of circulating supply (some concerned have been raised by a reddior about the actual amount, as it was stated by 1ST team that the tokens kept by the company wouldn't be released until the dApp would be fully released and mass adopted; here is the link to the reddit post; https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstBloodio/comments/7zx149/founder_lockup_transparency/) is 25,113,948 USD, so still above ICO price in term of USD raised, but in term of BTC and ETH, which was raised during the ICO, which EVALUATED MUCH (ETH was around 13 USD, now is 855 USD; BTC was around 600 USD, now is 9660 USD) since the 26th of September, so from historical data from coinmarketcap.com on 28th of september 2016, the 1ST token was worth 0.00025112 BTC and is now worth 0.00003 BTC and went below followed by the Bittrex delisting message on the Bittrex website which is the biggest exchange trading 1ST tokens in term of volume.  Let's take it from there, how did we learn about the 1ST delisting? Through a message directly from Bittrex. No pre-announcement by the team, absolutely no notes or announcements on either the website, discord channel, twitter account, or the dev team blog. Also note, no post or announcements after the delisting from bittrex, members (I am guessing other concerned investors) have tried to reach through the different platform mentioned above to try and talk to the team to wonder what is going on. My feel on firstblood is that so far, it is SOLELY focusing on it's gamer community and absolutely not on it's investors. Great lack of communication concerning financial aspect of the firstblood ecosystem. A dire example of this lack of concern for it's investors, is that the only place where you can basically, talk to the team about concerns, developments, etc. is on their discord channel, and it is strictly forbidden to talk or discuss 1ST token price of any financial aspects, which is in my opinion ridiculous.  We all remember the massive firstblood pump and dump of this summer from June 13th to July 10th, the graph on CMC speaks for itself, when firstblood was paired 1ST/CNY which were subsequently closed due to the china exchange ban. So here is my REAL CONCERN;  Firstblood.io knowing that the chinese government would eventually close its exchange in an undisclosed near future because of Mr. Zhou, who, I think must know finances, being managing partner of a crypto hedge fund; https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/newblock-capital and founder of https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/alt-options-llc and stay on top the news, and even private news from exclusive members group, let 1ST main volume go through from 1ST/CNY and on the chinese exchange ban news all chinese whales that pumped the price hard for a month dumped hard in a very coincidental timely fashion with Mr. Zhou travels in China. Raking in thousands of BTC from investors, volume being 71.8 mln is USD daily volume on the hardest day of the pump, BTC being around 2.2k USD. This is pure extrapolation and hypothesis. But market and price manipulation is very very common in the cryptocurrencies ecosystem. And with the NOTORIOUS Firstblood.io radio silence over anything NOT related to gaming tournaments, additional features to the platform or various partnerships. It is really REALLY concerning. I do not think I am the only concerned investor here. We will await an explanation.  Update:  SCAM project do not invest.

Since FirstBlood hasn't yet delivered a final product, it makes sence for the volume and price to be low... it's more strange to see projects with no final product to be flying high (If I'm not mistaken, EOS is one such example).  However I'm a bit dissapointed that the team hasn't filled the hole that's left from Bittrex's delisting. I know they're active and the project is ongoing, it's just that they don't seem to be focused on having their coin listed in more exchanges. They seem to prioritize the delivery of their system first before they communicate with exchanges, which makes sense I guess, but would it really be that hard to do both things at the same time?

Guys, the delisting of FirstBlood was only a question of time. Of all the coins delisted since Fall 2017, I can't explain only the reasons for Bitshares. All the other tokens/coins had at least a trait that fits delisting criteria - low trading volume, existence of coordinated market action, lack of MVP or working product, strong appearance of a security. Don't tell me you are in altcoins for the technology, you are a speculator, just like 98% of other members online   It still bothers me that unclear movements happen sometimes accurately before the delisting announcement.  I envision many would like to praise Binance in such a situation, please - don't. 1. Binance does not care what token to list, they will announce a trading contest for a collaborative token - the trading volume on such events is absolutely stupid. Market Manipulation 101. 2. The praised Binance coin vote drives speculative pumps. 3. Adding new tokens, many of which are scams, does not benefit the ecosystem. Trading in obscure conditions is not price discovery, it's merely enriching Market Makers, the Chinese who run Binance (ex-OKCoin staff) and a huge opportunity cost for the wannabe trader. Despite some new additions to Bittrex do not pass my scam filter, I am grateful for the removal of obsolete markets.",False

Let's look briefly at firstblood.io source of funding, as stated on https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organizations/funding_total/firstblood firstblood.io recieved 6.1 millions USD through it's private sale (VC funding round, stated on crunchbase, but I think it was a private sale, correct me if I'm wrong) and 5.5 millions USD through it's ICO. That's 11.6 millions USD total, as you can see on https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/firstblood/#charts, as of now the market cap of circulating supply (some concerned have been raised by a reddior about the actual amount, as it was stated by 1ST team that the tokens kept by the company wouldn't be released until the dApp would be fully released and mass adopted; here is the link to the reddit post; https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstBloodio/comments/7zx149/founder_lockup_transparency/) is 25,113,948 USD, so still above ICO price in term of USD raised, but in term of BTC and ETH, which was raised during the ICO, which EVALUATED MUCH (ETH was around 13 USD, now is 855 USD; BTC was around 600 USD, now is 9660 USD) since the 26th of September, so from historical data from coinmarketcap.com on 28th of september 2016, the 1ST token was worth 0.00025112 BTC and is now worth 0.00003 BTC and went below followed by the Bittrex delisting message on the Bittrex website which is the biggest exchange trading 1ST tokens in term of volume.  Let's take it from there, how did we learn about the 1ST delisting? Through a message directly from Bittrex. No pre-announcement by the team, absolutely no notes or announcements on either the website, discord channel, twitter account, or the dev team blog. Also note, no post or announcements after the delisting from bittrex, members (I am guessing other concerned investors) have tried to reach through the different platform mentioned above to try and talk to the team to wonder what is going on. My feel on firstblood is that so far, it is SOLELY focusing on it's gamer community and absolutely not on it's investors. Great lack of communication concerning financial aspect of the firstblood ecosystem. A dire example of this lack of concern for it's investors, is that the only place where you can basically, talk to the team about concerns, developments, etc. is on their discord channel, and it is strictly forbidden to talk or discuss 1ST token price of any financial aspects, which is in my opinion ridiculous.  We all remember the massive firstblood pump and dump of this summer from June 13th to July 10th, the graph on CMC speaks for itself, when firstblood was paired 1ST/CNY which were subsequently closed due to the china exchange ban. So here is my REAL CONCERN;  Firstblood.io knowing that the chinese government would eventually close its exchange in an undisclosed near future because of Mr. Zhou, who, I think must know finances, being managing partner of a crypto hedge fund; https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/newblock-capital and founder of https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/alt-options-llc and stay on top the news, and even private news from exclusive members group, let 1ST main volume go through from 1ST/CNY and on the chinese exchange ban news all chinese whales that pumped the price hard for a month dumped hard in a very coincidental timely fashion with Mr. Zhou travels in China. Raking in thousands of BTC from investors, volume being 71.8 mln is USD daily volume on the hardest day of the pump, BTC being around 2.2k USD. This is pure extrapolation and hypothesis. But market and price manipulation is very very common in the cryptocurrencies ecosystem. And with the NOTORIOUS Firstblood.io radio silence over anything NOT related to gaming tournaments, additional features to the platform or various partnerships. It is really REALLY concerning. I do not think I am the only concerned investor here. We will await an explanation.",False

Second;  Delisting might be coming. It's known that after bittrex announces delisting of a coin, it gets pumped for one last time. Of course there is no such a thing that 1ST will be delisted but if someone got the news before anyone else, this pump might be a goodbye to 1ST.  Third;  If you look at closely to Bittrex chart, you will see the flash crash. Someone dumped from 5K sat to 111 sat. That's a crash. Someone might have picked up coins from dead cheap prices, pump it more to get more Bitcoin.  Another perspective would be one desperate 1ST holder, saw that wallet in maintenance mode for 3 days and decided to dump it.  I would go with the third option.",False

You put money into a speculative, risky investment and it hasn't worked out yet- either get over it and move on, or just quieten down, hold onto your tokens and have some patience.

FirstBlood is at the forefront of crypto and esports, two of the fastest developing sectors in the world.

Now all this rage vs Firstblood, what happened?  November 20 : Quote from: mademanalex on November 20, 2017, 07:06:25 PM Quote from: tycoonUA on November 20, 2017, 06:03:35 PM how is this project doing? making a little research on it. how does problem of smurfing addressed? not mine quote:  Quote People are going to be tanking their rating, getting smurfs to play in their games/play for them, DDOSing opponents, and manipulating the game in other ways to win money. There is no way that this will result in any kind of fair matchmaking.  also can I check somehow statistics of games played using 1stblood?  thanks  This is why there is firstblood. The reason firstblood exists is that judges who have nothing to do with the players and are randomly selected ot however, judge if the player has cheeated.  You cant DDOS the opponent , since you would DDOS yourself , games are still played on the official valve sever, so if they DDOS  they have to DDOS valve servers, And then then they would have lags themselves. And to the issue about smurf accounts, Firstblood has a ladder, if the player is smurfing, it doesnt matter, because he will be top of the ladder if he is good. If he plays for a friend, then he has to play against that friend ne day if he brings him to top of the ladder, since the earning from ladder are paid according to rank at end of a season or week. If people play against each other,  then smurfing is more important. I think its possible to link the IP and computer ID to each player. so that you cant play from a not registered computer or a totlally different geo location IP. This will reduce the chance to smurf for a freind in a VS fight. But i think this issue is not a big problem, because people will not bet over one hundred dollars if they are noobs. Only people with high skill level may bet higher amounts. But then also we have the judges. If someone who has a winrate of 20% wins against a person who has 60% winrate , then you can activate judges. they can look at the gameplay and the previous games of each user, and then decide of the game is valid or not. This kind of stuff will be minimal i think, because nobody will bet high amounts if they are noobs. If they got skills they will bet more money , and then only it is worth for a smurf to join in, but at that skill level the competition is strong.     Come on, you can't disgust a thing that you support only 10 days ago...",False

WE have a unique project here. this is not a gaming coin, it is a competition and dueling system for normal players who get a chance to make money with their gaming. This is not a currency for gamers, which has no properties. This is a token to participate in a system where you can earn real money by playing, or being a judge and in the future also as a node. If you compare gamecredits to this project , the firstblood devs are much much farther ahead, we are in Beta. after that comes the real product. And it is a unique product, not just another currency. Gamecredits is only a currency and the project is only hype, if you see what they actually delivered. Firtsblood is much more developed. The price wont drop under 30 cents, it is on 33 cents for 2 months now... guess which way it will go. It can only go up. I dont think there will be any more possibility to get it much cheaper. accumulating now! Most solid project out there. Even more solid than bitcoin i should say.  I see the devs working and we even had the BITS tournament. right now going on. I am glad im invensted in this project ! With the next game, price will jump to immeadiately 1 USD. no worries there. 2 dollar and 3 dollar leven maybe 10 dollars end of next year.  The reason people dont invest in this coin yet is simply because the devs not posting roadmaps and so on. There is always a dev update. But its not hyped.  They have many partenrships, but they dot talk about it too much, for example they have a partnership with an upcoming project for trading in game items and so on. They are official partner of ESIC (Esports Integrity Commision), The Chinese University Esports Organisation, and Purse.io.  So expect firstblood to be more than just a comptetition platform. It will be a whole Ecosystem from gamers for gamers, where you can actually earn real money with. NOt just another currency bubble.",False

The reason firstblood exists is that judges who have nothing to do with the players and are randomly selected ot however, judge if the player has cheeated.  You cant DDOS the opponent , since you would DDOS yourself , games are still played on the official valve sever, so if they DDOS  they have to DDOS valve servers, And then then they would have lags themselves. And to the issue about smurf accounts, Firstblood has a ladder, if the player is smurfing, it doesnt matter, because he will be top of the ladder if he is good. If he plays for a friend, then he has to play against that friend ne day if he brings him to top of the ladder, since the earning from ladder are paid according to rank at end of a season or week. If people play against each other,  then smurfing is more important. I think its possible to link the IP and computer ID to each player. so that you cant play from a not registered computer or a totlally different geo location IP. This will reduce the chance to smurf for a freind in a VS fight. But i think this issue is not a big problem, because people will not bet over one hundred dollars if they are noobs. Only people with high skill level may bet higher amounts. But then also we have the judges. If someone who has a winrate of 20% wins against a person who has 60% winrate , then you can activate judges. they can look at the gameplay and the previous games of each user, and then decide of the game is valid or not. This kind of stuff will be minimal i think, because nobody will bet high amounts if they are noobs. If they got skills they will bet more money , and then only it is worth for a smurf to join in, but at that skill level the competition is strong.",False

Think about a game like Overwatch for a minute. There's already a built-in ladder, as well as a reward system that's easy to engage with. It's simple, you don't need to constantly win to earn rewards, and your rolling stats are saved to your player profile after you're done playing a match. Blizzard even uses the regional Skill Rating system as a measure of one's worth to Overwatch esports. This isn't unique to Overwatch, either.

China General Administration of Sport and FirstBlood.io China General Administration of Sport (CISS) to adopt FirstBlood for China University Esports League (CUEL)  Hello Battle Mates! In place of this week’s Developer Update, we have something slightly different to present. We are excited to announce a brand new partnership and opportunity that will help FirstBlood expand further into the Chinese market. Stemming from our recent relationship with MOLD (a blockchain based game publisher), FirstBlood has entered a partnership with the China General Administration of Sport (CISS). The CISS will utilize the FirstBlood platform to host one of its flagship events; the China University Esports League (CUEL).  The CUEL is a national Chinese esports competition, comprising tens of thousands of universities and hundreds of thousands of competitors each year. By utilizing the Firstblood platform, the CUEL will be able to reduce tournament administration overhead. In turn, this enables greater focus on creating a smoother and more enjoyable experience everyone. “The CUEL is an incredible series of some of the most exciting and competitive esports events in the world. With our revolutionary blockchain based esports technology, we look forward to creating an even more thrilling and overall better experience for everyone involved.” — Joe Zhou, Co-founder and CEO of FirstBlood. Leveraging this mutual relationship and official usage from CISS, will allow the full spectrum of tournament and event organizers to utilize our technology. This can range from corporate partners to local LAN parties! All will be eligible to incorporate our technology to automate the administration of their events. Our relationship with the CISS is the first of many expected relationships as part of the exploratory partnership with MOLD. With this exciting new partnership we look to offer supplementary reward opportunities for gamers to win on the FirstBlood platform through the use of MOLD’s tokenized game content. “Mold’s technology has tremendous potential to increase the usability of popular game items and allow players who play multiple game titles to manage their in game assets.” — Joe Zhou, Co-founder and CEO of FirstBlood. With these new and exciting partnerships, FirstBlood takes one more step towards integrating blockchain technology with esports. Exciting time are ahead with more news always around the corner.",False

I agree counterstrike should be added to.  a article on 26 apr 2016 is saying that pc gaming was still more popular than console. maybe its changing I dont know but I dont think its wrong to focus on pc games their is the most prize money as far as I know.

We have never stated that you should expect an increase in value in 1ST from the price of the token. In fact, there have been hundreds of messages in our slack channel, on reddit, on social media, and video/audio statements made that state the opposite. There have also been formal announcements from our attorney stating the opposite. You should not expect the value of the 1ST token to increase. This is not an investment, nor is it a security. This is a utility token. You can gain value from 1: referring users to the platform (promotional work) 2: witnessing matches (contributing your computational power) 3: serving as a Juror (manually sorting our cases with provided evidence). If you are skeptical, simply do not buy. permalinkembed [–]GeorgeMorozDigixGlobal fan 1 point 10 months ago It was stated in the slack channel by one of you that you expect the token value to go up.

You are claiming an unknown team member stated something that all team members know is not true and and is has never been true. Our community also knows this is a non truth because it has been stated numerous times. Also there is no evidence to support your claims. You are the first person to assert this out of anyone on our team or in our community. We as a team and community know that you should not expect the price of 1ST to go up because it is not an investment. It is a utility token. As stated before this is published 100s of times all over the internet. Thank you for being civil about this matter. permalinkembedparent [–]nootnewb 1 point 10 months ago Why does it's use as a utility token automatically disqualify it from increasing in value.

Isnt it good that Chinese are interrested? Yunbi is not a whale, it is an exhange..pls check LTC and almost every coin, check top 10 wallet adresses and you will see one two address which almost always owns 30-50% or more.. examples: qtum https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0x9a642d6b3368ddc662CA244bAdf32cDA716005BC golem https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0xa74476443119A942dE498590Fe1f2454d7D4aC0d So what exactly is wrong that on Yunbis wallet is 30%? Its Chinese investors, its an exachange, its not like they own it all..if you keep money (tokens) on an exchange its in their wallet.. Before ICO First Blood partnered with Yunbi to host the sale to a Chinese-speaking audience..well I think its actually good when the Chinese are interrested.. The real problem is there is zero marketing and hype..which is both good and bad..you dont hear much about 1ST, my suspicion is that they dont want to work under pressure and dont want price being pumped much before they have polished the product..then they will be ready for marketing and community building  1ST is Very promising project, i did my research..quite under the radar..no marketing and hype..they first want to have working product, they released beta few days ago https://blog.firstblood.io/open-beta-has-launched-bdc5438349fa On founders twitter Joe Zhou is another new from July 31 that they are working on a new program with the goal to bring mass adoption to 1ST BLOOD project. Over the past few months they have been designing, building, testing, and breaking their platform. There was also rebranding recently - not just logo, they designed and developed an entire new website too! They also promised that they will start sharing weekly Dev. Blog Updates on each weeks progress. They are still polishing the beta, then they plan mass-adoption and they also plan to add other games. This may get big, I am excited. They also announced Founder Token Allocation: On July 4th, 2017 there has been an official update by the 1st blood team that they have decided not to unlock 1ST tokens allocated to the founding team just yet (10% from total tokens). This is actually great news and shows that 1ST blood means serious business and is dedicated to the work. They have decided not to allocate the founding team’s tokens until they feel they have achieved the following : 1. A robust esports platform that is able to scale to multiple popular gaming titles. 2. Network adoption to a wide user base of competitive gamers. 3. A sufficient basis for esports integrity and competition standards. Source : https://blog.firstblood.io/firstblood-defers-founder-token-allocation-9d53306b06b0  So much happened in July and almost noone knows, cant wait what they will bring next. If you do research in depth on 1ST you will be actually surprised, beacuse there isnt much bad you could say about it. And competition? Almost noone..Game Credits is great but that is for buying games..the only other similar project is ROUND which is very shady (if you check their website - social links not working, team unknown, website amateurish full of mistakes..the same goes for their whitepaper..they only copied 1st bloods idea plus the did it really bad). Almost noone talks about 1st blood and ppl pumping all possible shits so I thought it might be good idea to write something about a good promising project before the price goes up and ppl will call it pump for no reason...most altcoins are correcting in August, if you check 1ST you can see that it lost a lot during July like every alt-coin and its one the few which hasnt yet recovered..and hell after the news it has a reason to recover..",False

They have enough funds from the original budget for 30+ months of development. Not including their existing ETH position which is a few million (should go a lot farther).

We are still taking babysteps here and 1st is going to the direction planned. Just stay patient and it will pay off.  You should also pay attention to volume between First Blood and ROUND. ROUND's volume is very very small compared to 1st. I believe when First Blood hit the big exchanges and open beta phase it will rapidly rise to 1$-3$ mark so if you don't have anything on 1st yet I strongly suggest you to make account at Yunbi and store 1st now while it's still cheap. I have never been wrong with my predictions so far so you can challenge me.  You should all watch the video interview about 1st blood and make your own assumptions, but one thing is sure that this coin will rock. There are a lot of shitcoins with higher market cap and first blood will have an actual real world user case that can grow to an unimaginable levels.

That really means a lot to the team.  Just want to fill you all in on what happened today.  As most of you had guessed, we were planning to open up the alpha to some users. Unfortunately, we hit a couple of critical bugs that only made themselves apparent as we started to scale the system.  Kudos to our dev team, they had a marathon session of almost 24 hours of straight coding trying to fix the issue. But as is all to common in the world of building revolutionary apps, the bug turned out to be a bigger rabbit hole than expected.  The dev team will take some time to catch a few zzz's and then be straight back into bug crunching over the weekend. But we can't commit to a specific day until we've had a chance to catch our breath and assess the scope of the issue.  The good news is, the platform is actually working really nicely! In the midst of the bug hunting today, we did actually get to play some (very short) games of Dota 2.

A lof of users use their personal ether wallets for all other smart tokens. They automatically assumes ether address is compatible with all standard smart tokens based on ethereum. Just showing some warning messages on the exchange is not good enough to prevent this kind of disasters. If Yubni wants to use smart contact for receiving ethers, they should implement at least methods to handle standard ERC 20 tokens.  Anyway it happened and the tokens are permanently burnt. The 1st dev team and Yunbi exchange both can verify the tokens are lost permanently. So my suggestion is to reissue the same amount of new tokens to the original owner if possible. If this is not possible, then the exchange may reimburse his loss, and implement ERC 20 tokens handling interfaces to prevent the future incidents like this.  I guess Yunbi is not a just small miner exchange for the 1ST project. If it has the strategic interests on this, compensating this small loss will contribute on a lot bigger benefits for PR effects.",False

We hope you decide to participate in our pre-sale but only do so if you are motivated by a desire to help get our innovate platform launched and to be among the first participating members of our community.  •    There are several agreements you must read and certifications you must make on before you can agree to pre-purchase 1ST. These agreements contain important legal terms and disclaimers, please read them carefully when you generate your transaction data at firstblood.io/sale.  •    The network that the 1ST tokens you are pre-purchasing will operate on has not yet been fully built. We fully intend to honor all the goals outlined in our white paper and elsewhere, however the final functions of the token and usage terms related to 1ST on any future network will be conditional upon the acceptance of future contractual terms. Essentially, you are pre-purchasing a token for a partially-built network and must understand that there will be additional terms that will need to be accepted before you can actually use 1ST in the future.

Not to mention that their site couldn't even handle the traffic, people couldn't login so they couldn't see the btc address for 30min+, in the end they modified ICO details because of failed start (oh yeah and delayed 24hours because the day before they were afraid they couldn't handle traffic, which they in the end failed at even with the delay).  Now compared to that, this one is better even on paper. Where it could fail hard is the traffic/errors during the first hour, that will decide the fate of this ICO very hard. They could make the first bonus last 2-3-4hours longer or lower the bonus to say 160 tokens so people don't feel like they missed out too much.",False

Yunbi has also made it clear that pre-orders they receive may not go through because at the end of the say a smart contract on the blockchain is the great equalizer. The fastest buyers with the most gas will get their 1ST first. Yunbi has reached their cap of pre-sale orders and is not excepting any more at this time.",False

We are programing in the recent moving average price of ETH into the smart contract to determine the dollar value. Once that value is set, ETH will be assigned that value and the contract will stop accepting deposits after the $5.5M cap is reached. Afterwards, the contract will reject any transactions to the address and they will not be confirmed.  The token creation smart contract has been striped down to an extremely basic version. Our team, including Mikko who's a blockchain security expert, has reviewed the contract it is still undergoing testing it to make sure nothing was missed. You can take a look at it on our Git if you'd like! https://github.com/Firstbloodio/ As for our platform's smart contract, that will be undergoing external security audits.  Some exchanges like Yunbi.com have expressed that they will allow trading of 1ST on their exchanges. More announcements are to follow! Yunbi.com is also making it possible to directly buy into the smart contract during the crowdsale in order to receive 1ST.  Sure thing! I'm having a bit of trouble posting it here but let me direct you to our forum link: https://community.firstblood.io/t/easy-guide-use-mist-wallet-to-participate-in-firstblood-crowdsale-infographic/100  You can just send ETH to the address and then watch the token contract.

Just to clarify I'm Marco from the FirstBlood team! I am the OP but this is my personal account.  Because this is a smart contract built on Ethereum you can only send ETH directly in to recive 1ST tokens. If you can make it to the power hour, 1 ETH will get you 170 1ST (70% discount). The current price of 1 ETH to BTC is about 0.2208 BTC. So if all prices stay the same for the power hour then 1 ETH:0.2208 BTC: 170 1ST  If you would like to use shapeshift and Mist to buy into the smart contract we made an easy guide for you to follow.

The projects are similar but the details are where it really starts to differ. On the whole they are creating a platform for developers to make gaming and gambling applications on. Our project is focusing on eSports with our blockchain based rewards platform built on ethereum. We differentiate ourselves from the competition by only allowing skill based wagering on yourself, as opposed to wagering on others or betting on games of chance (i.e. gambling on casino style games). FirstBlood's function is not considered gambling in the United States and in many other jurisdictions throughout the world.  We also have our cross-title eSports Integrity System that includes Witness nodes to verify game data and our distributed Jury Voting Pool to deal with alleged cases of hacking, cheating, or toxic behavior. This is something that no other similar project has attempted to do (on or off the Blockchain).  Unlike other projects, we've also gone the extra mile by making sure we are complying with existing laws to ensure that the project can thrive. Other projects are violating gambling laws, issuing securities, or have no sort of legal counsel at all. These actions not only have the potential to kill the project, but may put the funders, users, and the founders at risk for criminal prosecution. This field has come under a lot of scrutiny in the last few months and we'd rather not get caught up in that mess, for the sake of the project and our users.  In terms of our token, the primary purpose of 1ST is to enable us to reward people for referrals, running witness nodes (similar to BTC mining), and compensate them for being an active member of our jury voting pool (similar to moderation). The incentives to participate in this crowdsale are nearly identical to the incentives of Augur's successful REP crowdsale. 1ST has similar functionalities to REP (verification and consensus mechanisms) with the added benefit of referral rewards. Likewise, you will always have the ability to use 1ST as a stake for challenging others.",False

Close, the token does not necessarily need to be pegged to a fiat value. The tokens will be issued with the base price of 1ETH: 100 (1ST). Their amount will also be permanently capped after the crowdsale and no more than $5.5mm worth of ETH will be accepted for token creation. Several 3rd party exchanges (centralized and decentralized) will allow for exchanging to take place, so gaining new tokens should not be a problem. In our early stages FirstBlood Tokens will be the only way to interact with the platform. However, in later versions users will also have the ability to challenge others with Ether and other tokens, including stablecoins.  That is correct, this token does not represent ownership, as that would constitute it as a security under existing laws. The primary purpose of 1ST is to enable us to reward people for referrals, running witness nodes (similar to BTC mining), and being an active jury voting pool member (similar to moderation). The incentives to participate in this crowdsale are nearly identical to the incentives of Augur's successful REP crowdsale. 1ST has similar functionalities to REP (verification and consensus mechanisms) with the added benefit of referral rewards. No gaming required, but you will always have the ability to use 1ST as a stake for challenging others.  P.S. @MemoryShock our lead Dev is an ACAMS Certified Anti-Money Specialist. Guess we broke the internet XD",False

However, I'm a bit confused  - Our model is decentralized and P2P so we have no ability to run off with user funds.  - Also, our project is completely different from GameBets and all other competitors. We have no sportsbook because users can only wager on their own match; there is no bookie. FirstBlood is only for skill based competition. A vast majority all other types of Fantasy eSports companies (crypto or not) are operating illegally in this space because they are accepting users for jurisdictions (US, EU) where this type of model is already clearly regulated. The P2P, blockchain, basis for our business allows us to be compliant, significantly reduces costs and allows users to more securely interact with each other without putting inhibiting volume on our platform.  We will be able to better address these matters when we release our white paper next month  ",False

FirstBlood will launch with support for a single gaming community, with plans to quickly expand to encompass all the most popular skill based eSports.    Autonomous ________________________________________________________________________  FirstBlood’s innovations will allow skill based competition to take place independent of middlemen, such as financial institutions or casinos. Ethereum allows for fast, secure and reliable processing of results and distributions from competitive eSports matchplays. Unlike existing platforms (both skill and game of chance based), all FirstBlood’s transactions are publicly verifiable, viewable, resistant to counterfeit, and not subject to the risk of institutional processing.    Decentralized ________________________________________________________________________  Traditional online businesses with a centralized structure are subject to hacking, strict financial regulations, and onerous overhead costs. P2P decentralization allows skill based competition without reliance on payment processors, reduces regulatory burdens, and protects against organizational corruption such as fraud and embezzlement.    Fully Automated ________________________________________________________________________  Each match outcome will be automatically verified by data obtained directly from game servers using a custom oracle. Payouts will be rewarded to the winner based on the data from the gaming server. This will eliminate the risk of fraud reporting that is rampant on similar platforms.    Justice & Protection ________________________________________________________________________  Cheating has been an issue in the gaming industry from day one and continues to negatively affect competitive gaming. To combat this risk, FirstBlood will deploy a decentralized adjudication system (Jury Voting Portal or JVP) to deal with in-game disputes. A deposit fee will be required from the player who opens the dispute. This fee will be used pay a randomized jury to adjudicate the claim.   [see the diagram]      Gamification Design ________________________________________________________________________  We plan to add a gamification element to this eSports platform by introducing concepts like global ranking (leaderboard style), dynamic Matchmaking Ranking (MMR) , reputations and achievements badges (on GUI).   Our Community ________________________________________________________________________  When we first introduced our concept to the digital currency community, we received an overwhelmingly positive response; we’ve become one of the top prospective projects in the space! We are expanding our community outreach to inform other cryptocurrency gamers about our upcoming closed Alpha test.   Future Vision ________________________________________________________________________  FirstBlood aims to be the preferred global platform for skill based eSports competitors. The project will initially focus on one gaming community but will expand to include all the major competitive eSports games. In time, FirstBlood aims to become a leading brand in competitive eSports, affiliated with P2P gaming as well as influential regional and global tournaments. Our team will work with leading game developers to enhance the gaming experience for all users, encouraging higher levels of participation on all parties platforms’.
