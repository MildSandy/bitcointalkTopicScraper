Nuvus Blockchain is formed to build a global ecosystem called “Global Exchange Platform” for data, supply chain verification & industry wide global exchanges of services & products using distributive ledger technologies and trustless trust platforms for the agricultural industry initially focusing on the cannabis industry. Our mission involves introducing a trustless verification system on all supply chain & business transactions in the cannabis industry, providing growers, processors, distributors, retailers, doctors and users full transparency into the supply chain, from seed to user distribution, with decentralized private & public blockchain verification at every step. This will provide total transparency & auditability to all industry participants adding significant value to the industry.  Industry Benefits   SECURITY Cryptographically secured and Byzantine fault tolerant by design. Blockchain ushers in a new era of security in a time where perimeter security and authoritative control are no longer viable security models.   AUDITABILITY Blockchain provides a shared, immutable log of every activity on the system, enabling improved activity auditability and traceability of the provenance and history of an asset.   AUTOMATION Smart contracts can securely automate and link existing business processes. When designed with blockchain input/output oracles they can be used to connect disparate systems.
