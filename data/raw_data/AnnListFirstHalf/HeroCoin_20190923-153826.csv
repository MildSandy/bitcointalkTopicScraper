Hello everyone!  An important event of this week is the start of the beta testing of the HERO.org app! This is so exciting for the team and we will be grateful to everyone who will join the testing and give the opinion on the app. To participate, fill out the form at http://bit.ly/2EkGAi8  Just a couple of minutes after installing the app, you will emit your own cryptocurrency! You will get 1.000.000 HRO, you will be able to compete in popularity with other users and the project team and find out how much money others are willing to pay for participating in your interactions.    Creation of your own cryptocurrency takes only a couple of minutes  After installing the app you will quickly pass the registration via SMS. After filling in the standard fields — name, date of birth, sex, photo — you will see to the selection screen: “become an observer” or “emit tokens”.  If you choose the first option, you will skip the step of emitting your own currency and will only participate in other people’s interactions.  If you select “emit tokens”, you will be taken to the crowdsale launch screen. Here you can think of the name of a new cryptocurrency and indicate its price in HRO (approximate price in USD will be written next to it).  At the same time, if the price is high, you will see a warning that you may not be able to sell all the tokens before the end of the crowdsale: at HERO.org, the user needs to sell 10 million tokens within 30 days, otherwise his personal ICO is considered invalid and the received funds are returned to the buyers of the token .    For a successful crowdsale it is necessary to sell all tokens in 30 days  After emitting your own currency, you will move to the main part of the beta testing — the conduct of the crowdsale.   Interactions On HERO.org, in order for your tokens to grow in price, you must create interactions. During the beta testing, regardless of whether you become an observer or emit your own tokens, you get 1,000,000 HRO on your account. Tokens can be spent on the purchase of cryptocurrency of those people in whose interactions you would like to participate..  Creation of interactions is the most interesting part of carrying out a crowdsale. Let others participate in some events of your life. It can be anything. Share your breakfast with the winner, suggest to go on a world tour with you or draw a guitar among the owners of your tokens.    Be creative and come up with unexpected interactions that will get the most response!  Maybe you are interested in charity — create interactions to help others. Or are you a real bully? Create an interaction where you and the winner can slap each other. Perhaps you will understand what is most popular among users and with the release of a full-fledged HERO.org app apply your knowledge in practice!  Take part in the HERO.org beta testing — join the world of personal cryptocurrency!    Check for updates!

With this article we start a series of cases that will show how professionals, opinion leaders, brands and ordinary people will be able to use the HERO.org app and realize their potential.   John           Occupation: YouTube vlog about fitness and bodybuilding Number of subscribers: 500k + Loyalty of subscribers: high John’s favorite pastime  John has been vlogging on YouTube for five years about fitness and bodybuilding. At first he just liked it when unknown people left comments on his videos and wrote that he’s in great shape. This encouraged him and motivated to move on. He could ban the detractors and spam-accounts right away, communicate only with subscribers interested in his content. Thanks to the qualitative feedback, the vlogger’s videos were improving, and John realized that he was becoming popular, and his content was of much benefit to many. So, sometimes instead of a simple “like” or a short comment, the vlogger was sent a detailed story in which the subscriber shared how John helped him finally stop being lazy, pull himself together and begin to strive for something better. Moreover, John began to earn well, and expected even higher incomes in the near future…  The Dip  However, over time, the YouTube Partner Program has become less profitable. He had to try to release paid content, sell training courses by connecting third-party monetization services. But their promotion requires knowledge in marketing, which John does not have enough time to get, and the income leaves much to be desired so far.  In addition, when the number of subscribers began to grow, there was too much flood and complaints about paid content, and comments had to be closed.  And now vlogging has turned into a routine for John — he does not read sincere words of gratitude and does not feel positive emotions, does not see a real feedback and does not understand how to develop further.  HERO.org Features  But today John learned about the HERO.org app. According to the description, this is something new, something that competitors have not applied yet. And the app functionality can really help in this situation.  With the installation of the HERO.org app, the vlogger immediately emits personal tokens — JohnCoin. In the next video, John informs subscribers about this and offers to those of whom he is really interesting as a mentor or just as a person, also install HERO.org and buy some JohnCoins. And even though these people are less than the total number of John’s subscribers, each of them made a purchase, which means that they are ready to buy JohnCoin or something else.  In this way, during the crowdsale, John gets a list of people who should be paid more attention to and sent special offers when paid training courses appear. The subscribers, who need to interact closely, hold consultations and listen to their opinion: what content is really interesting to them.  Moreover, through competitions, exclusive offers and voting, he will not only increase his popularity, but also increase his income — his own and JohnCoins holders — due to his currency value increase.  Thus, John received a tool that allows to create easily amazing interactions, build up quickly his own popularity, and get feedback again from the most loyal subscribers, thereby understanding the direction in which his YouTube channel should be developed. And, of course, he significantly increased his incomes with HERO.org.  The core of HERO.org is one simple idea — the emission of personal cryptocurrency, the possibility of “capitalization” in yourself. But with a smart infrastructure and convenient tools for interaction between all categories of users, the app’s potential increases greatly. Read the following cases to find out how to communicate with fans and how to use the HERO.org toolkit for different categories of users with different source data.",False

The blockchain has proven to be an exceptionally reliable ledger proof of which is the fact that all related cryptocurrencies are now worth thousands of dollars. That said the success of the blockchain could also be implemented by brands and social influencers to translate virtual face value or perhaps presence into real-world value.  The growing trend of social influencers  Social media stars and even average level influencers tend to have a few thousand followers. Each follower is loyal to the star and tends to like every photo, comment on every status and share ever quote. Brands recognise the power that influencers in their niche have. They see the drastic effects that influencer marketing can have on their companies and are beginning to use these industry influencers as part of their marketing and brand recognition campaigns. They (brands) have come to realize that it’s no longer good enough to say positive things about themselves but what matter is good things others are saying about the brand.  The impact of influencers is so significant that a recent survey showed that 59% of businesses had increased their influencer marketing budget. Another 74% acknowledge that influencers have helped improve customer retention and led to an increase in demand for their services and products. But regular social media platforms and transactions are posing their own set of problems.    Despite the effectiveness of influencer marketing it is still plagued by several noteworthy problems like:  It can be challenging to vet both influencers and advertisers leading to a high degree of fraud. While influencers tend to get paid by brands to promote their products, there is no way for that influencer to know how much they are worth. A high barrier to entry for small businesses and newbie influencers discourages new entrants. Managing influencers for businesses can be time-consuming making it near impossible to work with an extensive network of these people. Nearly impossible for brands to calculate their ROI. Challenging when it comes to choosing the right influencers for a particular campaign.  How can the blockchain solve these problems?  The blockchain can help social influencers translate the virtual value of their growing following into the rising value of their cryptocurrency. As the popularity of the influencer grows so will the value of their cryptocurrency. With each share, like, and subscription value increases which not just translates to monetary value but also a reference figure to quote when dealing with brands and other influencers.  Using the blockchain brings about a degree of transparency with solid immutability for each party that’s part of the transaction. Everyone knows who is doing what as part of the agreement. So, influencers know that they will get paid for their assistance in social marketing efforts and the companies know how effective these influencers have been in the campaign. All of which makes it easier for businesses to evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign. Hero.org is already using a decentralized ecosystem that brings all influencers and advertisers on to one platform backed by the blockchain. The blockchain ensures security and the fact that it helps reduce the time and money involved for both parties. Yet at the same time provides that each party is held accountable for their end of the deal. It also provides security owing to the very nature of the encryption algorithm used which to date has remained unchallenged. So, each side knows that they will gain something from the transaction and will be held accountable for the outcome which reduces if not entirely eliminates fraud.  Helps influencers directly engage with their audience  The blockchain can help influencers directly engage with their audience by cutting out the middleman for things like fundraising, charity work or perhaps promoting an upcoming event. Personal coins can be used to raise funds in a matter of seconds which are then instantly transferred to the said organization. Followers and fans can see that happen in real time and even verify the transaction via the blockchain. That adds a never seen before degree of trust which helps build stronger connection among fans, influencers and brands.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple have shown impressive returns. The innovative use of blockchain technology by various companies has made cross border payments easier, smoother, and faster. This is why many large banks, financial institutions, and government regulators are adopting this blockchain technology for secure and reliable cross border payments. Most cryptocurrencies take start by issuing tokens and distributing these through Initial Coin Offerings (ICO’s).            Tokens  One of the most interesting facts about tokens is that these represent assets in their original form. They are created and traded with the help of blockchain technology because these reside at the top of blockchains. Anyone can easily create his own tokens because there is no need to modify the codes of a particular protocol. The users can create these tokens through templates already present on a blockchain network. Hero.org can help you a lot in creating tokens that are distributed to the public though Initial Coin Offering (ICO’s).             Why Top Brands Would Want to Issue Tokens? Although anyone can issue tokens, top brands have particular interests in issuing these. There are various reasons behind the involvement of top brands in it. Some of the important reasons behind this are:            1. Earn More Profits  The very first and the most important reason behind this emission of tokens by top brands is the maximization of profits. This is because the cryptocurrencies showed many bullish signs in 2016 and 2017. Especially, the surge in the values of various cryptocurrencies in December has increased the profit of companies a lot. Some of crypto founders and investors became billionaires. Thus, top companies are issuing their own tokens to earn more profits over the time. Most of the digital currencies showed an increase of more than 5000% in 2017 with Ripple XRP at the top with an increase of 36000%. The value of many currencies even doubled within short periods. As a result, many individuals and businesses doubled their profits.            2. Liquidity of Cryptocurrencies  The next reason behind this issuance of tokens by top brands is the liquidity of cryptocurrencies. In simple words, we can say that the companies can easily see and track their profit margins through these tokens and ICO’s. Also, the companies can easily pull profits through their ICO’s. They only need to convert their cryptocurrency profits into some digital currency. This digital currency can then be traded at various crypto exchanges as well as can be converted into fiat currency through various dealers.            3. Security, Reliability, and Transparency  Another reason for issuing tokens by top brands is that transactions take place securely and transparently. There is no third party or intermediary involved in these transactions. Only the seller and the buyer know the amount of transaction and the status of the transaction. Thus, big brands issue more tokens to grow their customer database due to transparent and reliable transactions.            4. Advertising and Targeting Audience  A very good reason for issuing tokens by top brands is advertising the brand to the public. Top brands think on how to target audience to maximize the buyers of the brand and earn more profits. Crypto world is becoming more famous with every passing day. Top brands are taking it as a way to advertise their businesses and products to target markets and maximize profits.            5. Cost Effectiveness  Last but not least many top brands issue tokens because they can trade these tokens in a cost effective way. Since the trading of tokens and ICO’s takes place through blockchain technology, no intermediary is involved in these transactions and this decreases the cost of trading. No need to pay 3% to Visa and MasterCard. In conclusion, we can easily say that top brands issue their own tokens because of these and many other similar reasons. We can expect that with the increasing value of digital assets the governments may issue some regulations for monitoring the flow of funds in any form.

Use Cases    HeroCoin is the core of HeroApp. Practically all interactions inside the app will be processed with the help of HeroCoin. HeroApp will allow a possibility to emit cryptocurrencies for everyone. Though it’s not complicated to create own token nowadays, the primary challenge is to support the demand for it and manage the total supply. HeroApp provides various engagement tools to interact with token holders in a unique way. Let’s see how it works.  For individuals:  Dave’s favorite music band is The Prodigy. In HeroApp, he decides to participate in a contest to win 3 VIP tickets for the next concert and personal meeting with Maxim Reality. He will use HeroCoins to purchase ProdigyCoins to join the contest.  Dave is loyal to Lacoste. The company has already emitted LacosteCoins in HeroApp. Dave converts HeroCoins into LacosteCoins to purchase an exclusive polo shirt.  Then, Dave decides to use some of his ProdigyCoins to buy one more Lacoste polo. The conversion will be processed through HeroCoins.  The pleasant point is that Dave doesn’t have to do all these steps manually. He will need just to click on conversion button, and the HeroApp will process all automatically.   For professionals:  Sergio is an artist. He is loyal to Nike and its products and decides to create a series of posters to spread the word about his favorite brand. Nike notices the artist’s work and supports him. Nike gives Sergio 1,000 NikeCoins in HeroApp.There is a limited number of NikeCoins so that owning them becomes a privilege later, Sergio can participate in exclusive Nike’s contests and votings, purchase limited products lines using NikeCoins. Our Hero is loyal to the brand; he will highly appreciate these coins. On the other hand, if Sergio doesn’t want to hold NikeCoins he can exchange them. The trade will be processed automatically through HeroCoins.  For influencers:  PewDiePie decides to emit own cryptocurrency in HeroApp. He will get support from the loyal audience, and he also can create contests, votes, and exclusive offers for his fans. For example, he creates an offer that he will provide a personal meeting and a blogging lesson for 10.000 PewDiePieCoins. His fans use HeroCoins to buy PewDiePieCoins and purchase an offer. PewDiePie, on the contrary, can convert the received coins into HeroCoins or purchase any other brands’ or influencers’ coins to make partnerships. The conversion is processed through HeroCoins.  For businesses:  Max Mara launches own cryptocurrency in HeroApp. The brand offers exclusive clothing line in MaxMaraCoins. People use HeroCoins to purchase MaxMaraCoins and get an offer. Max Mara can use the received coins to give a reward for professionals who support the brand or make partnerships with influencers buying their coins through HeroCoins conversion. As HeroApp provides the liquidity of all emitted inside the app cryptocurrencies, any coin is converted to HeroCoin and then traded on external exchanges. The whole process will be done in few seconds and reflected on the blockchain. Thus, the user will not even notice these complicated transfers. Trades on external exchanges may take some minutes if not even hours. Due to internal exchange inside the app, we provide high speed of trades to our users. Moreover, we aim to develop an easy-to-use and intuitive interface so every user may make an exchange in few clicks. HeroCoin will reflect the value of HeroApp and cryptocurrencies inside it.   *** Join official Telegram group to continue discussion: https://t.me/TheHeroOrg",False
