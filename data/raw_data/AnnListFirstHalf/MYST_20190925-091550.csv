I'm not sure if such a solution exists, and it will probably give a lot of grief in the short term in any case, but in the long run, I really don't see a way around it.  Otherwise, you are coupling the future of your project to a number of unknowns of which you simply don't have any influence and, even worse, which are not directly related to your base project. I mean, even if your token was the best solution (whch I still highly doubt), looking at the overall Ethereum token craze aftermath would lead me to the solution that we'll see a huge drop in interest in that particular field. And then you have to explain to a completely disillusioned and fed up public ""yeah, we know most tokens suck, but we are legit, trust us!"". They won't listen.  And this ""exploring various possibilities"", come on. You are a VPN project, that's where your focus should lay. Are you seriously trying to shoehorn your token into your system, even if it is a bad fit? What if all the evidence would tell you that it was a bad idea, and commiting to it, no matter what, won't make it a good idea?  Also, in addition to hiring economy people, it might be a good idea to get some outside people to take a look at what you're doing. People who don't have to toot the companies horn in order to not lose their job, you know…",False

Unless you have good, technical reasons to use a token, a token approach is always inferior to a general money approach and will eventually be outrun by general money approaches. That's why we don't have Banana-Dollars to only buy bananas with, and Bread-Dollars to only buy bread with and so on. The only thing a token might still provide at that point is the utility of a discount method. And that'll only work if you find node providers who are willing to play the game that way.  So, are there technical reasons?",False

This is a problem, because the extra friction that buying selling first BTC/ETH, then the token, will drive users off the project. Plus, due to the weird intricacies of token economics, the value of the token is almost completely decoupled from its utility.  Quote P2P value transfer without 3rd party involvement  Yeah, no. ETH and BTC are P2P value transfer systems as well and they need less of a 3rd party as MYST does. Or where am I supposed to get the tokens other than an exchange? Not to mention how cluncky ERC20 token transfers currently are, with gas and all.  I kinda believe that you think you are doing everything right, and your position isn't exactly enviable, but I think if you took a closer look at the economics behind what you say your token is supposed to do, and if you spoke to some outside people, who are versed in economics, about your current approach, you'd find out that your current approach to payment, using a token, is a dead end.  From what I can see, you are working on your VPN and it's chugging along nicely. It would be a pitty if nobody uses it in the end. And under the current circumstances, over the long term, no one will.  I am just some random guy on the internet, but I'm telling you, go look for some experts, ask them what they think of your current payment model (you have the funds to do so, after all) and listen to what they'll tell you.  Because, here is the point: The general question for every token model is ""why a token, why not a general currency?"" If ""because we coded it in a way that you need the token"" is the only answer, your project is dead on arrival.   Our project has received funding, has a clear whitepaper with milestones and a team of security and privacy experts that has grown strong from 4 to 30 and growing.

You can check out our whitepaper for a detailed description of Ethereum smart contracts, identity service and payments.  https://mysterium.network/whitepaper.pdf  6.3. Identity Service There are interconnected software agents (we call one instance of this an identity agent) representing digital identities. Each identity agent acts on behalf of a person controlling the identity. This software agent is a functional part of the application (a Mysterium network node) used to connect to the Mysterium network to provide or consume VPN services. Each agent has access to a digital identity represented by the agent's ability to electronically prove service by signing and decrypting all communications using a private key associated with the identity. A node may have access to more than one identity. The identity is created by generating public and private keys. The identity is identified by a unique identifier derived from a public key by using the last 20 bytes of a keccak256 hash of the public key. This identity can be made publicly known to other network users by announcing its existence through invoking an identity registration smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract must be supplied with an identifier and a public key of identity as an argument. After the identity contract is successfully executed the public key of identity is appended to the Ethereum blockchain by miners. At this point the appended identity becomes a Registered Identity. All Mysterium nodes in the network follow the blockchain and read transactions of the newly registered identities and maintain a local copy of the database of all Registered Identities using data gathered from transactions. Nodes can use a local copy of the Registered Identities database to lookup public keys associated with other identities. This database is used by nodes to check if the communications received from other nodes comes from valid registered identities and are properly signed.  6.3.1. Registered Identity Value Mysterium nodes must attach a predefined amount of value (MYST) to successfully invoke the identity registration contract and have the identity registered. The amount of value will be adjusted periodically automatically to reflect the value of MYST in fiat currencies. This forfeiture of value (MYST) has a purpose of making identity something of value. By attaching cost to identity we make it unattractive to abandon. Also, because it is expensive to produce identities in large quantities the system limits exposure to several types of trust exploitation. We see Registered Identities as something to be reused to users’ own benefit. By reusing an identity for payments users will have their payments history and balances made public, and their identities made more predictable and thus trustworthy for service providers. We will discuss risk and trust relationship further when describing payments.",False

From an investors point of view, what you are telling is a problem though, because to use the service, the price per token will be insubstantial. This is a problem pure utility tokens face as a general rule: Since the payment to the VPN provider has to be dynamic in terms of how many tokens per unit of service, and because neither the user nor the provider have an interest in holding MYST longer than needed to not be affected by price fluctuations, we have a highly liquid utility token with pratically infinite supply, since the same tokens can be used over and over again: Both the user and the provider won't care whether they pay with 1000 MYST per unit or 0.00001 MYST per unit, and with no other means to regulate supply, such as collateral for hosting nodes or something along those lines, you'll likely have a market with extremely high movement of tokens.  This means the value of the token is only weakly linked (if at all) to its actual utility.  As I stated earlier, for the users (and providers), this is a non-issue. For investors, however, this is a great issue. It is obviously your decision if you want to cater to them at all, bt the fact that you had an ICO indicates, that maybe, you should.",False

A domain is not needed as we don’t detect and use it in proposals. For node to operate you need public IP. At this alpha testing phase we only support nodes operating in hosting servers (on external IPs only).  - I have launched my node with docker. Please tell what’s next? We are whitelisting alpha node testers to our discovery service. If you are getting 403 it may mean you are not whitelisted yet - send PM with your IP and OS to our Project Manager Andrius @Zygman on Telegram.  - How can I check that it works? After node IP gets whitelisted, you should get something like this: [Mysterium.api] Proposal registered for node: 0x561eddc8c00f42541f50f0d0275f7e34bd92c057 The node (and identity) should be visible in https://testnet.mysterium.network/ You will be able to test tunnel by installing mysterium-client package and use --cli  for command like client.  - Do I need to open some ports in my router? Yes, if node will be at home then you will need to forward required ports. You need to open at least 1194 (default OpenVpn) port. You will need to setup forward rule into your local IP address where node runs.  We would like to thank everyone for participating.

This is a significant step for Mysterium Network towards a decentralized, peer to peer based and server-less node network.  Users will be able to run Mysterium VPN nodes on any OS with Docker. As an alternative users will be able to setup VPN node using .deb packages on Debian or Ubuntu. Currently node supports OpenVPN as its underlying VPN transport.  Installation Guide: https://github.com/MysteriumNetwork/node/blob/master/INSTALL.md  FAQ on How to Install & Operate a Mysterium Node: https://github.com/MysteriumNetwork/node/wiki/Node-operation  You will need to have a static IP address for nodes. A domain is not needed as we don’t detect and use it in proposals.  - I have launched my node with docker. Please tell what’s next? Soon we will be whitelisting pre alpha node testers to our discovery service, stand by. If you are getting 403 it may mean you are not whitelisted yet - send PM with your IP and OS to our Project Manager Andrius @Zygman  - How can I check that it works? After node IP gets whitelisted, you should get something like this: [Mysterium.api] Proposal registered for node: 0x561eddc8c00f42541f50f0d0275f7e34bd92c057 The node (and identity) should be visible in https://testnet.mysterium.network/ You will be able to test tunnel by installing mysterium-client package and use --cli  for command like client.  For node to operate you need public IP. At this Alpha testing phase we only support nodes operating in hosting servers (on external IPs only).  - Do I need to open some ports in my router? Yes, if node will be at home then you will need to forward required ports. You need to open at least 1194 (default OpenVpn) port. You will need to setup forward rule into your local IP address where node runs.  The first node host countries will include: USA, China, Russia, Finland, Czech Republic, Romania, and Spain among others. We would like to thank everyone for participating. This is an open group so feel free to invite your friends to join us and host their own nodes as well.",False

Sales costs will largely be incurred by direct B2B sales to businesses selling Mysterium as a platform solution.  As for integration our Roadmap details one of the upcoming phases which is Opening our API for (d)App Developers which will enable them to integrate VPN functionality into their products.  See this reply by Mysterium Network Founder Robertas Visinskis to a similar question for our previous Reddit AMA:  ""Ultimately I believe we could see services built for crunching data, also Apps and dApps using Mysterium as their secure communication channel between any 2 end points whenever they need one - for example to create a secure communication channel between a user and a server, or a user to another user, or a user and a device. This could be applied to any number of services which need a secure communication channel. For example it could be: payment apps like Paypal, Revolut or any of the wallet apps, communication apps like Snapchat or Whatsapp, e-commerce services such as Shoppify, then content delivery services such as Netflix trying to ensure their users can access content when traveling abroad, etc..  If anybody would ask - I would be betting on a larger community to come up with use cases which we never even dreamt of. But one thing is sure - we will be listening and adapting the network to meet the needs."" - Robertas",False

Other users of the network will be able to find services matching their specific needs (location, price, etc...) and use search results to establish a connection to selected VPN service providers and use the announced services.

During this negotiation, a consumer of the service will make a promise to pay for some amount for services to be received in advance and this promise will be updated by the consumer every time an extension of service is desired. The VPN service provider later will use this promise to clear payment via smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

Why? Sooo many reasons...  1) They raised over 68k if I remember correctly. That alone is over 70M in capital they have. Pretty sure they kept it all in ETH and haven't spent more than 25% of it. So do the math.  2) The price of ETH has gone over x4.5 since the crowdsale. While MYST is still under ICO price.  Price was $1 at ICO. ETH was aprox $200-$250  3) The market has grown, but MYST's growth has always been stunted. Most recently, MYST finally started to take off and head towards its real value. That was instantly stunted by bad news of Bittrex delisting. That completely derailed the growth again.  I'd value MYST at 80-100m cap right now, which is 4-5x. After the release of MVP and other updates...Easily 200m+. MYST is so under the radar right now. All we need is some hype or FOMO and there will be no turning back. People will realize soon enough. Sometime in May or sooner.  I mean, its lower than ICO price right now. and the entire crypto market has grown 5x since their ICO. Buying more as I type this LOL.",False

TOR servers are tracked and destroyed. vpns are made illegal. the onyl channel is Fox News and Big Bang Theory on repeat.  there is little fiat. BTC market cap is 300T...governments have sent replicants to decimate all homegrown vpn cells...named 'Providers'. MYST is the currency and economy of providing access to uncensored information...it is .1 BTC...  ok...well..not exactly.  iota i see in smart cities, ripple i see as being huge because its fast as shit, bitcoin and eth are sweet because you can EARN them hence the incentive. all huge winners already.  only problem is you have to MINE for btc and eth (for now until Casper) which is expensive and honestly just wastes electricity...but MYST you can EARN just for having your computer ON and sharing a percentage of your bandwidth. like..no setup overhead involved. make money while you sleep.  its the lowest barrier to entry for ANYONE to be a part of it. is it easier than staking a wallet? maybe the same?  this network will grow. we have 8k twitter followers. it takes one price jump if Beta is cool...good news, some attention to get to 40k, then the other final jump to like 200k, and were BOOMING. 200k users would be sick, then who knows...this is all assuming the network is secure and fast...and how the market takes Orchid's product as well. i will probably get orchid tokens as well just because i support this dVPN idea so much.  and as for the tokens value, it has utility..if thats how we're pricing these things...its also definitely decentralized.   BTC (and decentralized systems) are apparently priced as such: square root of number of users * avg transaction value... it has nothing to do with supply or market cap  https://i.imgur.com/MP9atPJ.png http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-movement-explained-by-one-equation-fundstrat-tom-lee-metcalf-law-network-effect-2017-10  lets try and use that model to try and get a realistic expectation of MYST price relative to number of users and avg transactional value per node.  in my example say we get paid $5 a month of MYST for providing a monthlong Session, that is the avg $$ value of my node, and ALL nodes (perfect competition) per month...and well say network with 4000 participants....  = root(4000 users * $5) = $141.42    .....200k users?...$1000 per MYST...just a comparison    ..... the $5 is assuming people are using this constantly though   ...if they only use it for say 1 day a month? $5 a month /30(days) = .16 cent a day ( avg value transaction per account) * 4000 users = root(666 ) = $25 MYST...thats if only 4000 people only use it 1 day a month....  40k people using it only 1 day a month? = $80 MYST 40k people using it 4 days a month? = $163 MYST...which is my target we can hope right?    all depends on number of participants...and their participation.   its costs MYST to BE a node, AND to USE it. if you want free VPN, you just need to provide more bandwidth than you use on the network, since it should theoretically all cost the same. if you want free VPN constantly (the $5 a month constant usage scenario), you need to share bandwidth (while sleeping) to pay for what you use during the days  you could have free VPN for the whole month. you wont make anymore MYST than you use, unless you ONLY host sometimes and don't use the network...which should be an option.   i hope the costs of registering a node will financially deter a hacker from spinning up a bunch of bad nodes and slowly ruining all of their reputations from hacking. id like to discuss this more. and aspects of orchid if anyone would like.  anyway, this is some cool tech, circumvents firewalls, and you will get paid for it.  as always, hodl.",False

Australia banning torrenting sites to stop illegal download  UK passing the Snoopscharter bill where the government and security agencies would be able to track the users activities.

Each one of us occasionally shares sensitive information via the Internet, be it our names with photos, our addresses or identification documents (e.g. to open an online bank account you have to send your scanned documents for verification). Mostly, we do not even realise the risks we are undertaking. Almost every day we read in the media about a company that has had a data leak, and these include giant companies such as Yahoo.  Nobody knows the damage it could do in the future, as the internet is now full of sensitive information. Some people have already learned to use tools like TOR or VPN clients to try and combat this.

If Mysterium would read this: your price is falling for a while now. This is because there is no feeling of commitment to your continuity. You can't just post one (good) update in a month and say 'that's it'.  Its not all about developers saying this or that. That's a typically mistake of IT driven staff. Sorry guys, but your missing the commercial side like a lot startups do.  If you want to grow and not falling, then start posting some small weekly updates/know how's about the networks POI and the solutions it could bring for the common people in the future. Also other news articles related to your section would help. Make it exciting!  Informing people about your solution is the key to success and the awareness. This awareness can only grow when people know more about the market and solutions.  Try to raise this awareness to the public in a simple and childless way by start hiring a par-timer that could give some weekly social updates about the market and your product. The price will triple easily! It has all the potential. Look around, you see this happening with all coins who start to take there community more seriously in a pro-active way.

My two cents:  1. Privatix had a bounty program, so I heard. Then they canceled it. Why? Too many fraudulent participants. Who's fault was that? If they can't reliably filter their own participants prior to bounty program start, could I trust them in handling my IP?  Rather than admitting their lack of oversight (which is often understandable at early stage), they shifted the blame to the participants. But if participants were at fault, why cancel the entire bounty program itself? No participants worthy of the bounty? Not even a single one? Not a single legit promoter who finds the service worthy of being promoted?  2. Too many promises. And one of those promises involves hardware. Competition is always good. More competition = more options. But considering other crypto ICOs, I must say that the odds are not in their favor. All I can say for now about them is that they look like a promising team.  3. What is the US patent pending for? If they intend to use this against competitors: for a company that sells Freedom as a Service, I find this rather ironic.  My list is long, I just reduced them to things that concerned me most. These are just my opinions. I do not claim to know the future. But for me Mysterium still has the greater chance to succeed in this area.  My challenge to the Mysterium Team (if any of them gets a chance to read this):  Businesses are not built in a vacuum. Early communication and marketing is crucial. Ask feedback from your potential users. Ask them what things they need that traditional VPN simply cannot provide, and how do you plan to address them. I believe people in the journalism profession need this service badly than most (adding Marta to the team was a smart move, btw). And these people are generally not as tech-savvy as those in the IT industry. Write articles addressing common questions in depth. I have spotted a few of them in this particular thread alone, and as of now, nobody gave a reliable answer. Try to reply to Medium comments. In my opinion, one post per month on Medium just doesn't make the cut. These may seem trivial, but your end goal with early communication is engagement. So that when you finally launch the core, you won't scramble just to get more people to use it.",False

As I understand an ICO is based on a white paper proposal. And Mysterium done that and also demonstrated practically that it works. (Sorry for not using all the technical terms as I am not good at it- Newbie But I have been reading in the bitcoin forum enough to believe this could work. Many don't agree which I read as well.  It must have been hard work and exhausting to get the project to this state. I am new to block chain and decentralisation but I do understand business. In my opinion the guys are taking a time out, recharging their batteries and thinking about the project. And yes I do believe that they take some of this money for themselves and have a good time. It is the reward for long hours to get it to this point. And also there will be decent wages I am sure of and holidays. Sounds all normal to me. I'd rather have a well rested and fed team  to tackle the next stage. They don't have financial worries to bring their project forward. All this together could be ideal condition for success. I think the principal of the decentralised VPN and rewarding the participants is a great idea . I bought a good chunk of Mysterium coin for double the price it is now and I will hang onto it and probably buy some more. And I don't understand why some people complain that there is no more announcements and updates. The ICO was the biggest thing for Mysterium so far. They have probably given all the announcements,plans, information there was. They have used all their arguments. What else could there be in such a short time? The ICO was a success. They have a plan. They have a good product(at least on paper). Once operational the coins will have value as VPN is not for free. Sure it could be a scam but what for when you could make more delivering the product. Of course I am new and there have been many scams I keep reading about. Actually there is hardly a coin which has not been accused of being a scam. Wrong or right doesn't matter it seems. Anyway high return is usually high risk , and not a licence to print money. I wish the Mysterium team good luck and have a great time enjoying yourself ....and just don't forget to come back.",False

Let’s welcome Robbie @robertas from Mysterium. robertas Hello everyone techbytes Welcome robertas thank you jakethepanda Thanks for joining us Robbie. If you are ready let’s open it up. I have a bunch of questions prepared from some members of the community. Others will have questions as well. robertas sure, happy to be here and hope to answer some questions if you guys have any (maybe all is clear) axente welcome jakethepanda How would you, in a few simple words, describe the advantages of Mysterium to non-crypto people? moobox waves mallsbahoney thank you so much for all the great communication @robertas I've talked to you a little in your own slack and Mysterium's communication so far has been great. boldninja welcome @robertas robertas Mysterium is not about crypto, it just happens that crypto - enables what Mysterium is trying to achieve... so eventually we hope that end user will not have to have any crypto knowledge in order to participate (a bit long shot)... So to answer the question - Mysterium will be a decentralized VPN, which we believe will bring benefits similar to ones Airbnb or Uber has brought to already existing ecosystems: - a highly competitive price - much better global coverage - variation (not everybody wants the same thing) just to name a few axente So what the connection between mysterium and crypto? jarunik How much myst do I need to use your VPN ? boldninja who do you think is your biggest competitor? robertas This will be determined by the VPN providers, but we expect VPN prices to drop significantly. Currently VPN providers make over 100 times their actual cost, so you can imagine those margins to drop in a decentralized marketplace geezee is a decentralized more safe than centralized VPN? jakethepanda Are there any other projects that are similar to Mysterium? What makes Mysterium different? mward Hello. Whats the price for token? It will be on ETH chain? You have a limited amount of tokens? mallsbahoney Here's the big question: On BTCTalk, it was mentioned you guys were considering white listing certain sites to prevent your uses from committing illegal activities. Yet how would that work since the idea of this project is anonymity? Also, with the concept of public nodes, doesn't the people offering nodes put themselves at risk in case anyone on their network is doing naughty things? jakethepanda Let’s let Robbie catch up mallsbahoney sorry jakethepanda no problem robertas re Competitor: not sure about that, as the only thing similar to what Mysterium is trying to achieve will be Tor. But that is a very different product/solution. OFf course cannot rule out ingenuity of centralized VPN's... but on the other hand - we will be able to work with them in a relationship where we provide them with the node network, in a form of ""platform as a service"" - so not really a competition, but rather a partnership yeah - don't know which one to answer jarunik top down mallsbahoney We're excited man robertas Price: early stage (before 6mm soft cap) 1CHF = 1.2 MYST, after 6mm softcap: 1CHF = 1MYST (1CHF is almost the same as 1USD) mward MYST is the token name, right? robertas Yes mward so 1 dolar 1 token ok, thanks techbytes Will you be expanding your team after ICO? I'm sure you guys will raise millions. robertas re Node Risks: - yes whitelisted addresses and activities could be part of a solution protecting node operators. VPN at their nature send encrypted trafic from customer to Node, but then it un-encrypts at the exit node and goes out into the outer internet in pure text format (just like usual)... so the exit node basically can see what goes out (with the exception of https off course). taking that into consideration - whitelisted activities might be a possible solution for node to protect themselves (just want to make sure that these white/black lists will be overseen not by us but by the community) mallsbahoney that's a good answer axente Is the VPN speed influenced by the Ethereum blockchain in anyway, since it is based on it? robertas Team: if we are able to attract enough funds to develop the project - we will expand the team. We have some candidates in Berlin (and there is a great [Suspicious link removed]munity there) but we will be open to any candidates, as this will be a distributed project afterall jakethepanda So there are no exit nodes in Mysterium? axente Is the VPN speed influenced by the Ethereum blockchain in anyway, since it is based on it? robertas re VPN speed and Ethereum And yes and no. Mysterium will be a combination of various technologies - native on the device Node and client softwares, talkint to each otehr via state channels, talking to blockchain, oracles, smart contracts. The system is designed to first take care of microtransactions between node and client softwares and then later to clear the payment via smart contract... thus the speed would not be affected jakethepanda How high are the risks for someone to offer his bandwith as a VPN provider? Let’s say the consumer browses for WAREZ stuff through you as VPN provider. Does all this information channel through you? Or through a diversity of people? Can anybody relate this browsing history to you (the VPN provider) robertas RE: Exit nodes in Mysterium: Yes there are , and over 800 already (launched MVP 3 weeks ago ) mward ""so the exit node basically can see what goes out"" but why this? it's not best that the decryption to take part when it hits the receiver? mallsbahoney good question Jake, I'm also curious about data retention since the main selling point of top VPNs is they allegedly dont keep data mward why the node needs to see that info? that's what a vpn is for... encrypted the whole way. boldninja Will there be any kind of zero-log policy for VPN nodes? dr10 What is your budgeting plan? E.g. If yoi hit 20 million. What u plan over five years etc.? robertas re Node, risk, diversity: In I'st phase - yes all the information will go through 1 node. so it will be visible lets say by a ISP provider. Thus we will prepare recomendations for each jurisdiction - how to protect yourselves best against any legal implications. Most likely - we will not suggest you running a node from your home jakethepanda @mallsbahoney do you have questions on top of that answer? robertas to continue : getting into Phase II - we will be working on a proprietary tunneling protocol, allowing people to connect via many different nodes, shredding and encrypting the traffic so that no single node has any meaningful data via them. But that's much further in the future mallsbahoney not yet, I am processing it. Sorry for interrupting. jakethepanda no problem jarunik Do you have to hold MYST to operate a node? mward and it is PoS? masternodes? and if YES, how many MYST do i have to hold to keep a master? (edited) jakethepanda Do users need to install an App based on the Mysterium Network to use its decentralized VPN? robertas To operate a node - you will have to have create an identity (which will cost) this will act as a buffer protecting against frauding customers (sort of like a reputation system, discouraging you to lose an identity with money in and a good history) mallsbahoney another good question jake, I was going to ask how my 70 year old father would use this service jakethepanda Thank @dr10 for these questions. mward after how much time after the ICO ends do you plan to launch the system? robertas App: well the protocol will be open, meaning that anyone will be able to write their own apps to use the network. Off course we will be building our own applications(client, node- for all operating systems .. ) , but probably there will be other apps as well, also once the platform will be opened up for others to develop apps on top of it, people will be able to integrate Mysterium into their existing apps (say a Uber app with Mysterium integrated into it, which automatically routes their users through encrypted nodes- providing them with more privacy) jakethepanda Since the Mysterium Network is based on the Ethereum blockchain: If the Ethereum blockchain gets bloated by thousand of Dapps sometime in the future – will this influence the Speed of the VPN services provided by the Mysterium Network? robertas Re budgeting: We will not hit 20mm, because it's capped lower. Also to answer the development - we will start development right away, so we expect to have a V1 sometime within 6 months mallsbahoney Do you think your project will be under government attack in the future to give up customer info and are you prepared to deal with this? robertas re 70 year old father: They will use an app they downloaded. At first - one of the partners will create an app with Fiat payments in it, and later - once crypto is a common sense - we will all be able to pay with any crypto currency for the service boldninja Will VPN pricing for end-users be in the same league as traditional VPN providers (eg. PiA, nordvpn, expressvpn, ... ) or will it cost more? olejegcord joined #trading_altcoins robertas Re government: most likely yes. Therefore we are incorporating in Zug, Swiss - as a foundation, to be regulated to be protected. Also we will act as an open source software developer, and what happens with this software is beyond our control, as well you have to take note that this eventually will be a forkable solution, so at that point it's way beyond our control (and governments) nt91 What speeds will be obtained? nt91 Can your VPN service be used to connect into my home network remotely robertas nt91: Please specify this question a bit deeper (english is not my first) nt91 Or isit purely for traffic robertas re pricing: Existing VPN providers cost of service is about 2-3 cents/1GB of data (if averaged out all payments and usage) But they charge 3-5USD per same 1GB of data.. that is a hundredfold margin. We believe in a decentralized network - the cost to user will be significantly lower than current But this will be decided by the market, not us (edited) Speeds: Incentivization will be key when reaching high speed service, and node operators will be incentivize to optimize for speed. jakethepanda The identities that used the mysterium network get stored onto the blockchain. Isn’t there a danger to trace these identities back to the VPN user? nt91 Sorry Robert let me elaborate, What I meant is the VPN Service is this for traffic routing or do you also provide a service which will allow me to connect to my home network remotely and safely robertas yes there are if a VPN user is not careful and does reveal their identity in other ways, communicating it somewhere @nt91 - current solution is being designed for traffic, but once that is developed, if it's feasible - there could be a version of the node, which is allows you to connect to your internal network (used personally or by companies/organizations) Definitely for a bit later stage (edited) nt91 What protocol is the VPN running? mallsbahoney so lets say I'm a political dissonant or someone who likes to post anti-government memes in China, why should I use Mysterium over TOR? (edited) jakethepanda So as I ( @dr10 ) understand within the Mysterium Network you can use Mysterium VPN by standard terms, announced by the Network itself or look out for specific services if you want to use a VPN provider in a certain location, special price etc and you message with the provider/consumer. So there is a standard service and a VPN marketplace, right? robertas jakethepanda: That is correct robertas also please let me remind you that the project is fully open source, so the community might see a value in adding additional parameters/functionality unforseen by us at the moment pyrrhus Hi robertas, just on the cost of service of existing VPN providers vs Mysterium 2-3 cents presumably is just Direct Costs - what's the actual cost of acquiring a customer (marketing, etc.)? and what does the Mysterium budget look like in terms of customer acquisition forecast based on achieving maximum funding during the ICO? robertas pyrrhus: We have so far spent minimum efforts in terms of marketing, and already have >950 Node operators and growing each day. Incentivization of running a node and providing VPN service is built in Mysterium Network. Thus, we believe then we have a lot of supply for Nodes, the price for VPN will become very attractive for end users and this will be one of key differentiators competing with established VPN providers in terms of customer acquisition. We haven't got full forecast yet, but will work on this going forward. pyrrhus Thanks robertas, great result getting 950 operators up already robertas Protocol: For V1 we will do a due dilligence on all protocols and select the best one for given purpose, but eventually - all protocols will be added to the service, opening up a platform for ever better newer protocols to be included jakethepanda What gives your token its value? The more people use your network? robertas jakethepanda: In the I'st phase token value comes from it's usage, as at first it's going to be a utility token But once we are able to transition - we will (once it is legally viable) - we will make MYST token as a revenue sharing one. In both cases - the success of the network will determine the price jakethepanda Do you need to catch up Robbie? robertas re Political dissident: I would not suggest using Mysterium at least in Phase I for such purposes. In the early phase we will be building a decentralized infrastructure (decentralized: discovery mechanism, payment mechanism, identity management, state channels, etc... ) not working much on the tunneling protocol itself. So Mysterium will not be much more safe than existing centralized VPN's, and we will recommend to use it in much lighther use cases: like conneting to your gmail account from China, but not for trying to create a revolution... Only in later stages once traffic is shredded and sent encrypted through many nodes at once - this will become a lot more secure network, but we can't go there before the stable foundation is built... mallsbahoney thank you sir, good answer jakethepanda There is a question about token value above. Not sure where you are in the qeustions? (edited) boldninja I can see this as a nice ARK codebased blockchain tho - you elect VPN nodes (delegates) that process blocks + tunnel data. Any delegate that is not doing job OK (disconnecting, not reliable, ...) can get replaced by other more trustworthy vpn. each of this VPN nodes would be required to have a few relay VPN nodes jakethepanda Will Mysterium ever be used for anything else besides VPN services? robertas jakethepanda: most likely yes, because it will be an open network, and different app developers will be able to integrate encrypted tunneling into their applications pyrrhus Are DPI tools like Sandvine an issue for VPN's and does Mysterium have any benefits over a centralised VPN provider in this area? robertas pyrrhus: not sure what is DPI tools... Mysterium has a benefit of decentralization, meaning that all traffic will not flow through an infrastructure belonging to one entity and thus making it much more difficult to obtain that information, compared to now (ISP - your traffic is an open book, Centralized VPN - your traffic is in one hands, easily obtainable ) pyrrhus Apologies @robertas, by DPI I meant Deep Packet Inspection. What I was wondering was if I were an ISP/Govt. could I simply block Mysterium's traffic at a protocol level so that customers/citizens couldn't use it? Will Mysterium traffic be obfuscated at protocol level using something like Obfsproxy or similar? (edited) jakethepanda How many people on the team and do you and your team have references? Which projects were you and your team on before Mysterium? robertas jakethepanda: we have our names and you can look up everyone via linkedin (I know not everyone has their profiles updated though, sorry ) robertas but all of the tem members, have been time tested, have lots of experience in their respective fields and have been known by me personally nt91 Is there a website? robertas nt91: off course - https://mysterium.network/ alexius89 GRC training is moving again.. chuu chuu mallsbahoney https://mysterium.network/ alexius89 train+++ jakethepanda @alexius89 AMA topic. sorry jakethepanda What are some of your marketing plans to make Mysterium more known in those circles who frequently use VPN services? robertas jakethepanda: probably I am not the best person to talk about marketing, Augustas would be much better. WE have worked with various local partners who attract people in respective communities, I believe we will continue this trend robertas I am much more product person robertas First we will start with crypto community nt91 Should the team be on the website? robertas nt91: it is on the website jakethepanda Which exchanges will the token be traded on after launch? robertas jakethepanda: Bittrex and Liqui are the first ones to accept, but we are talking with others too. Also we will have a 2 week token lock period, after the sale. During this period we plan to make more deals with exchanges mallsbahoney How long do you think it will take to reach Phase 2? robertas mallsbahoney: we will start developing for phase II - in 1.5 - 2 years robertas that's our estimate alexius89 ohh sorry @jakethepanda jakethepanda no probs @robertas How many more questions can you take? robertas this was intense not much time left 1-2 questions please have to come back to work our token sale is in less thatn 24 h jakethepanda Ok then we can wrap it up here. mallsbahoney I'm done, thank you so much for your time. I'm very excited to invest and see your project blossom. jakethepanda You guys can sign up for the Mysterium slack at http://slack.mysterium.network with any other questions. (edited) mallsbahoney thank you, you answered everything on my mind :smile: robertas Thank you all, amazing questions, please don't run away - come back with them - as these questions help us understand the real needs especially afther the token sale - please come and talk to us jakethepanda Thanks @robertas for joining us Robbie.

Token Sales are a hot, maybe even hotter than hot buns these days. Mysterium also has a coming token sale on May 30'th as well. Thus we feel obliged to talk about potential risk of being tricked and how to protect yourself. This sudden growth attracted all sorts of fraudsters to the space — trying to trick people participating in a token sale by sending their ETH the wrong way. One of the most common strategies for the fraudster is to imitate a team member and post messages on the company Slack, Telegram, Bitcoin talk forums — soliciting the wrong address (owned by the fraudster of course) urging people to send ETH their way. One thing to note — mostly this type of communication is constrained to chat channels. In the face of FOMO “fear of missing out” — this is a very simple yet effective strategy, which has been repeated multiple times already.  Where to find information about Mysterium Token Sale? Statement from Mysterium team: Mysterium founders WILL NOT POST — token sale smart contract address on any chat channel! Therefore if you get any message saying that this is the address where you should send your ETH, that most likely means: It’s NOT coming from us, but from someone pretending to be Mysterium team member. And most likely they are trying to trick you into sending your ETH to the wrong address. Don’t fall for it. The only safe place to look for actual token sale/creation smart contract address will be on our website: https://mysterium.network/ Along with the address you will also find the actual guidelines on how to participate in the sale. Nothing to worry about and no need for heavy preparations — as this will be a simple and already common process for most of you. Don’t fall for cheap tricks neither now nor in the future — and we wish you to be vigilant and always double checking.",False

Mysterium is developing the first fully decentralised and distributed VPN in an effort to safeguard online privacy. The whitepaper, released for comment today, outlines their vision for a global peer to peer network that combats the risk of cybercrime.  The internet today is neither open nor private. Large corporate entities are increasingly self-proclaimed gatekeepers of the web causing it to operate as a centralised service. The problem with this trend is that we are now subjects of wide-scale data harvesting. There are big economic benefits to be gained from selling browsing data, but invasive online surveillance tactics are putting our security at risk. Mysterium is tackling the problem with a new vision for a fully decentralised VPN service that puts users privacy first.  The whitepaper outlines a protocol that is designed to ‘dissolve’ users data through a process of shredding, encrypting and sending it deep into the Network. The Mysterium platform is designed to provide this security layer on demand, whether browsing at home or in a public WiFi hotspot. Mysterium can also be used to protect sensitive data against cybercrime for example, in healthcare, BFSI and telecommunications industries.  So how does it work? Mysterium pools computing power to create a distributed network of nodes. Nodes are then made available to those needing secure VPN connections on demand. Users who share their excess bandwidth to the network can earn MYST tokens in reward. MYST is the native token of the Mysterium network operating as an access and permissions token. An inbuilt trading platform called CORE will manage the give and take of services on the network through a proof of contribution protocol.  According to MarketResearchFuture the global VPN market is expected to reach $106 billion by the end of 2022 with cybersecurity as a ‘major driving factor’. With it’s mission to provide privacy to all Internet users Mysterium are bringing cybersecurity into sharp focus. The Mysterium team firmly believes in a future where users are protected from being subjects of corporate and government interests. Mysterium will be a key platform to powering this future with the highest levels of transparency, resiliency and security.  Mysterium launches the crowdsale of it’s MYST tokens on 30th May, 13:00 UTC.

Mysterium Network To Build Blockchain-based VPN for Secure, Anonymous Internet Connection  Mysterium is building a decentralised Virtual Private Network (VPN) that anyone can use to connect securely and anonymously to the internet. The system is also designed so that users who share their spare bandwidth to the network will be able to earn digital currency in reward. The Mysterium platform will operate via its native MYST token, available through the crowdsale. Funds raised will be used to support development and the launch of the platform.  Until now the public have had to trust their private data to large centralized VPN providers. Now Mysterium will offer an alternative decentralised peer-to-peer (P2P) network that aims to take back power from big corporations. Mysterium acts as a distributed marketplace for the give and take of VPN services and is backed by secure Ethereum blockchain technology.  Internet privacy is under attack. Last month the U.S. reversed a set of important consumer protection rights allowing Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to track customer activity and sell that data to the highest bidder. According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation customers will now be subject to ‘new and invasive ways to track and deliver targeted ads to customers’. As a result the U.S. has seen a huge surge in demand for VPN’s as people seek to restore their privacy. Most users are unaware that they are simply moving their private data from centralised ISP’s into the hands of centralized VPN providers.  Mysterium offers a real alternative - a decentralized, open source and encrypted VPN solution with levels of privacy unmatched by centralized providers.  The Mysterium platform is designed so that anyone with bandwidth to spare can join the network as a VPN node provider and earn MYST tokens in reward. To enable the system to scale, transactions will be handled through the platform’s own decentralised micropayment system called CORE.  Visit our website: https://mysterium.network   Updates .

UPDATE  Mysterium Network explainer video - Quest to reclaim our privacy!  https://vimeo.com/215967001  UPDATE  Mysterium Releases Whitepaper Showcasing Ethereum-based Decentralised VPN  Mysterium have released their whitepaper showcasing a new model for a blockchain-based virtual private network (VPN). Mysterium is developing the first fully decentralised and distributed VPN in an effort to safeguard online privacy. The whitepaper, released for comment today, outlines their vision for a global peer to peer network that combats the risk of cybercrime.  The internet today is neither open nor private. Large corporate entities are increasingly self-proclaimed gatekeepers of the web causing it to operate as a centralised service. The problem with this trend is that we are now subjects of wide-scale data harvesting. There are big economic benefits to be gained from selling browsing data, but invasive online surveillance tactics are putting our security at risk. Mysterium is tackling the problem with a new vision for a fully decentralised VPN service that puts users privacy first.  The whitepaper outlines a protocol that is designed to ‘dissolve’ users data through a process of shredding, encrypting and sending it deep into the Network. The Mysterium platform is designed to provide this security layer on demand, whether browsing at home or in a public WiFi hotspot. Mysterium can also be used to protect sensitive data against cybercrime for example, in healthcare, BFSI and telecommunications industries.  So how does it work? Mysterium pools computing power to create a distributed network of nodes. Nodes are then made available to those needing secure VPN connections on demand. Users who share their excess bandwidth to the network can earn MYST tokens in reward. MYST is the native token of the Mysterium network operating as an access and permissions token. An inbuilt trading platform called CORE will manage the give and take of services on the network through a proof of contribution protocol.  According to MarketResearchFuture the global VPN market is expected to reach $106 billion by the end of 2022 with cybersecurity as a ‘major driving factor’. With it’s mission to provide privacy to all Internet users Mysterium are bringing cybersecurity into sharp focus. The Mysterium team firmly believes in a future where users are protected from being subjects of corporate and government interests. Mysterium will be a key platform to powering this future with the highest levels of transparency, resiliency and security.  Mysterium launches the crowdsale of it’s MYST tokens on 30th May, 13:00 UTC.  Link to whitepaper - https://mysterium.network/whitepaper.pdf  UPDATE  Mysterium blockchain-powered VPN opens to early adopters Mysterium Network has released an alpha version of its decentralized VPN offering MYST tokens to early adopters. Mysterium will provide a secure connection for internet users through its blockchain-based Virtual Private Network (VPN). The platform uses crowdsourced bandwidth to create a network of globally distributed VPN nodes. The alpha version is now live for anyone to join and start contributing their unused bandwidth to the network. Users offering their resources to Mysterium will earn MYST tokens in reward as a form of ’soft mining’, via a proof of contribution system.  Right time right place. Internet privacy is a growing concern for companies and individuals whose data is often sold on the black market. Cyberattacks have grown to as many as a half million every minute according to MarketResearchFutures. The recent malware attack on the NHS has brought cybercrime to the forefront as a major concern for organisations and governments. Last week the ’WannaCry’ virus took down parts of the NHS I.T. infrastructure and has since made its way around the globe, corrupting data and threatening privacy. Mysterium’s blockchain-secured VPN can help secure organizations against such threats, many of whom now rush to adopt a VPN into their networks and operations. With Mysterium’s live alpha just launched, we are in a strong position to scale up. The platform will operate through an integrated trading platform called CORE, providing an online marketplace where both VPN providers and consumers can monetise the give and take of VPN services. The efficiency of combined technologies and network effect is geared towards offering a competitive solution comparing to traditional VPN services, by offering savings that will be passed on to the users. The Mysterium Token Creation event starts on the 30th of May, 13:00 UTC at https://mysterium.network. For more information about MYST soft’mining and a guide on how to contribute to the network go here https://mvp.mysterium.network.   UPDATE  What is Mysterium Network? Mysterium Network aims to be fully decentralized, peer to peer based and serverless VPN node network, designed to provide privacy restoring techniques to its users and financial incentivization to its node operators (providers).  How Mysterium Network is different from other VPN providers? Mysterium Network will work by utilizing blockchain technology such as Ethereum, smart contracts advancing their features with state-channels and evolving mechanisms of promises, combined with censorship evasion protocols developed by the community acting as applications of the network.  When will I be able to use Mysterium Network? Development of Mysterium Network is spread out into distinct phases starting with Phase I and Phase II. Each phase is further divided into several internal stages.  How do I run Mysterium VPN Node? Please refer to https://mvp.mysterium.network. Ubuntu and Debian versions for Node are available to download and install.  What if someone misuses my VPN Node network? Mysterium will deploy technological and legal means to make sure node operators are safe: 1st we will focus on protecting node operators from legal perspective, 2nd we will implement an ingrained reputation & trust mechanisms (based on Registered Identities defined in Whitepaper) and finally we will develop a traffic routing mechanism which would combine splitting request data through different nodes and changing the end-to-end circuit between requests.  How much will Mysterium cost per month or per Mb of bandwith for the end user? Cost of Mysterium services will be defined by the Node operators. Since this will create a phenomenon known as ‘perfect competition’ — we expect prices to be significantly lower than of current VPN providers.  What is MYST? MYST holders will be able to use Mysterium Network, either as VPN clients or running VPN Node.  When is Token Creation event? May 30th, 13:00 UTC  How do I participate in Token Creation? The Token Creation event will happen on our website https://mysterium.network and will be a smart contract that will issue MYST tokens for you. Site will update and include information displaying the contract address.  When will MYST become transferable? MYST becomes transferable after the Token Creation event ends.  If I use MYST, how it will work? MYST tokens will work as access token to Mysterium Network. In the later stages of Mysterium Network development, we envision a possibility to accrue commission payments for token holders, eg. for VPN services provided.  Is there a lock-up for Founders tokens? Yes, Founder’s lock-up is 12 months.  Is there a lock-up for Seed round investors? Seed investor 1x return coins will distributed after Token Creation event, with other part will be locked for 12 months.

Token Sales are a hot, maybe even hotter than hot buns these days. Mysterium also has a coming token sale on May 30'th as well. Thus we feel obliged to talk about potential risk of being tricked and how to protect yourself. This sudden growth attracted all sorts of fraudsters to the space — trying to trick people participating in a token sale by sending their ETH the wrong way. One of the most common strategies for the fraudster is to imitate a team member and post messages on the company Slack, Telegram, Bitcoin talk forums — soliciting the wrong address (owned by the fraudster of course) urging people to send ETH their way. One thing to note — mostly this type of communication is constrained to chat channels. In the face of FOMO “fear of missing out” — this is a very simple yet effective strategy, which has been repeated multiple times already.  Where to find information about Mysterium Token Sale? Statement from Mysterium team: Mysterium founders WILL NOT POST — token sale smart contract address on any chat channel! Therefore if you get any message saying that this is the address where you should send your ETH, that most likely means: It’s NOT coming from us, but from someone pretending to be Mysterium team member. And most likely they are trying to trick you into sending your ETH to the wrong address. Don’t fall for it. The only safe place to look for actual token sale/creation smart contract address will be on our website: https://mysterium.network/ Along with the address you will also find the actual guidelines on how to participate in the sale. Nothing to worry about and no need for heavy preparations — as this will be a simple and already common process for most of you. Don’t fall for cheap tricks neither now nor in the future — and we wish you to be vigilant and always double checking.
