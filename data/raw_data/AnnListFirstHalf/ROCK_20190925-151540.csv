So 1,000 s9's running without any down time, in theory should yield 23.4 BTC each month.    This BTC is split between the team and token holders.  With token holders supposedly getting 50% as the ""investors profit share"".  23.4 / 2 =  11.7 BTC So 11.7 BTC for the token holders  each month. 11.7 x ~11,000 USD  = $128,700  Coinmarket cap shows a circulating supply of 15,724,272 ROCK2  tokens.  If we assume that all 15 million are held by retail  and get a portion then  128,700/15million =  0.00858 cents USD per token held  Assuming you hold 1,000 ROCK2 then the dividend yeild is $8.58.    How is my math?    The fact that IRM used ""puffery""  (its is a legal term) in its ICO is nothing new. Many over promoted their ICOs to generate interest. Not saying it was right or ethical (from a business viewpoint).  And lots of mis-information as I do not ever remember IRM PROMISING massive ROI.  There calculation was correct based on a series of (flawed) assumptions. If anyone actually believed their ROI calculator that was not set up in real time then they were not thinking very much about their investment (ie. they clearly ""cherry picked"" the best numbers to vastly inflate the predicted static ROI).  There is the old saying, ""If it seems to be too good to be true, it probably is"".    Does all the BS and questionable management from IRM matter to me.... Not really as all the other coins I hold pay me nothing.  For me this is a longer term hold, I will exit with a profit eventually. Simply by buying more ROCK2 with each month with my earned dividend I am slowly  dollar cost averaging down. I will eventually escape this crypto trade with minimal losses. Other than constant complaining what is your strategy to leave this trade with profit?  If you are focussed on everything the company is doing wrong then you are a poor trader as you aren't focusing on your money and your exit strategies... nothing else matters.  Good luck.",True

Investing in any stock or crypto venture is risky. There are no guarentees especially in cryptos (many altcoins sound great but go nowhere) but it sounds like you already know that IRM is a risky place to park fiat. Re-read my previous post about how little stocks are paying to investors as dividends and stock companies can and often go bankrupt too. Crypto dividends won't make any one rich under IRMs set up unless you hold a massive number of tokens. Not sure you or anyone can explain the recent price action of ROCK2 which hasn't caught up with BTC's recent uptrend. Perhaps someone holding a massive cache of ROCK2 has been slowly unloading over the past year. May be many holding are selling and leaving.  Even at a reduced price there are ROCK2 buyers. Again, everyone has different risk tolerances and expectations from this project. If you think IRM isn't stable then sell and exit. Good luck to you and best in your future crypto investing.",True

Someone here posted that  the dividend for ROCK2PAY was ~$2.88 per 1,000 ROCK2 tokens held per month, which is in line with what I received.  If you invested $12K as you say during the ICO but make only ~$5 a month dividend then you hold only ~1,800-2,000 ROCK2 tokens.    I am not sure what you were expecting as a dividend but your expectations of a ""pot of gold"" ROI does not sound reasonable or in line with reality.  You do know that many dividend stocks pay dividends per share that are quite modest with some of the best low risk stocks usually between 1-3% per annum per share.    For a list of the BEST dividend stocks see here:  https://www.suredividend.com/high-dividend-stocks/    The top ranked dividend stocks (that are deemed to be stable and long term companies) from their list offer ~5% dividend eg. their top pick is Energy Transfer LP (ET) @$14.36 per share giving .10 cents per share per month dividend.  So if you bought $12,000 worth of ET stock you would own 835 shares and be getting $83.5 per month in dividend.  That is for their very BEST dividend pick.  Compare IRM to MoonLite, another crypto mining farm venture that started its ICO at the same time as IRM. They still haven't built their Iceland crypto mining farm, not a single miner up and running yet.  Months of delays with no plausible explanation from the CEO.   Dividends scheduled for 2019 from MoonLite likely won't happen even if they somehow manage to get any miners running.  MoonLite can't even figure out how to pay tokens owed to their bounty hunters using a smart contract.   I agree that in some areas that IRM could have performed better from a corporate/professional view and been more transparent in decision making.  However, I am impressed that IRM has managed to move their project this far along this quickly.  To easily demonstrate my point regarding market timing.  Coinmarket cap shows Rock2 was at an All Time Low of $0.013861 USD on Feb. 28 2019. You could have loaded up and dollar cost averaged down significantly to be under .21 cents a token and holding profits.  Some people bought in at 1.38 cents per token at that time and are holding a 15X profit right now and making significant dividends if they loaded up on cheap tokens. There view will be the exact opposite of yours!  Continually complaining because your fantasy ROI didn't materialize holding ROCK2 compared to the reality of BTC and most altcoins down 90% since Jan 2018 is truly unbelievable.   Many of your comments show you are unhappy with this company's management and decisions. If you don't like how they run this company I suggest you sell and move on to another token that pays dividends more to your liking such as Binance coin or Kucoin.  I will gladly buy your ROCK2 when you post them to token.store or Hotbit. ",True

I highly doubt it . 5 1000 s9 miners installed after a year .. 10 million investors money you think that's a good deal ? that could have been done with less then 300k and then im including the factory upgrades vs the ready to go icecave. that was also called bullshit on before hand by people. 6 you have not been making any money of your investment  the value drop in the asset way out weighs the tiny payout your getting. 7 there have been some great suggestions here in by people on how they could turn this around they just ignored them. 8 What happened with the Rock1 people remember those they would get their money out right ..

However, we can estimate some numbers, until IRM provides the official data.

Above is quoted from the horses mouth/ass himself.  Problem now is that the 20% at this time or even the 30% does NOT cover the eletricity costs so where is that money comming from that can only be from the reinvestment or the 50% of the investors and since they still need to pay salaries and other costs that's kinda something that should  be made Very clear isn't it ?  Do you think anyone would have agree'd the team taking 30% of the payout .. lets say BTC was @ 30k now u think its fair for the team to take 30% .. when eletricity costs would be @ like 5 % .. whats the salaries .. next to the 10% for the team ?  Im sure pretty much everyone assumed that would be from the 10% but apperantly thats just of the top for dias and crew for their great idea.  You can see from Dais's responces that hes really willing to share that information .. if he wanted to he could easily shutme up by posting those numbers he doesnt because he knows hes in the wrong.   @dias ye funny how you commented on my rank here dias strangly enough all people with ranks like mine have said your a bullshit artist im definatly not the only one.

Quote from: Cashi on June 23, 2018, 10:00:24 PM Personally, I think, the most important thing is a research about the team, it's characters, amount of people for this project, qualifications, experieces and previous actions. This is very important and for doing this you can use google or social websites to get more informations about this team. Another one ist the project. Read website and whitepaper and ask yourself if the solution offered by this ICO would be neccesary or is it another copy of existing projects. The market for ICOs is very hard now and you need a good idea to exist. So given that IRM has done the following which totally goes against their whitepaper: No longer mining in a cave (major selling point was cooling) Not paying out investors in ETH (as was written in whitepaper) Commencing contract mining (Again not written in whitepaper) Lied to everyone about their earnings calculations and were not transparent about the fact that the calculator was set for a 12k BTC price  (on ICO website) Ban anyone who dares to question anything in the Telegram Are several months behind scheduale The list goes on and on.....

If mining will be prohibited in kazakhstan what will happen to your project?  I am a potential investor, not a competitor. Just wanna have the things clear. Hi Fudder.  Firstly this is not new ""News"" the same guy said the same thing in October 2017, but lawyers and financial experts have said it will not be possible to ban ""Mining"" as it is a persons choice to do so using their own electricity at their own private property.    Reference - https://news.bitcoin.com/national-bank-of-kazakhstan-restrict-exchange-mining-cryptocurrencies/   Further to that, the same guy in that very article says ""I do not even understand what Bitcoin is"" so like most, he fears what he does not understand and is only looking at things from a finance orientated centralized banking point of view.    So in order to ""Ban"" mining, first it would need to pass legislation, which it has not.  And I cannot find anywhere where a bill has even been submitted.  So all you are basing your fear on is one persons view.    And if you visit the website of the Central Bank there are no press releases about this - Link  http://www.nationalbank.kz/?docid=527&switch=english  Every second news article, especially by Fud Desk is about banning Bitcoin, if you keep believing what mainstream media tells you then Crypto is not for you.

I would expect a full month payout to have been more. Regardless, it's a joke. Even with the ""mine"" at full capacity, you're going to be lucky to get $20/month per 1000 tokens.  I cashed out my ROCK2 a few weeks ago and put it directly into XRP, and I've already made back what I lost to this ICO plus more. I think it's a smart move to cash out of this while the price is still at $0.30 and invest in another crypto, or directly into BTC. No matter what BTC's price does, you're better off:  If BTC price takes off, then you're better to be invested in it directly rather than ROCK2. You can cash out immediately rather than having to wait months for dividends to pay out. You're not losing 50% of the mining profits to the IRM team.

So lets assume that you manage to install all of them this time and get your average of 13.5 th and you keep them running for awhole month .  so 30x 2928.4 = 87852 seems like a decent amount now lets see how that looks for someone that bought your token in ICO @ what 1usd value ?  87852 devided over 15.7 million tokens that gives me the whopping return of 0.0055956687898089 usd per token per month so it will take almost 200 months to get my money back at this rate you think that's a good deal ? or am I a ""hater"" because I can do math ?  Offcourse this would only happen if that 66.3% would all be paid out but the team takes a cut and 20% for reinvestment so u end up with with a little more then a quarter of a cent per token per month.  Or are you now going to tell me about your crytal ball and that bitcoin will be worth 250.000 tomorrow ? (if this would be true id be better of holding my btc)   Edit my math is actually off more .. Those Fans are sure to use power  the Remodel of that building wasn't Free  did the team pay all of that out of their own pocket I don't think so.",True

I think the main criticism is lack of transparency, and the whole bait-and-switch of quietly dumping the mine and moving to some warehouse. The mine was the whole appeal of your project and you're just a standard run of the mill mining operation now, which happens to be in Kazakhstan.  Especially considering the price of BTC now, I don't know how you can possibly be pulling any profit after factoring in operating costs. The market dump isn't your fault, but it's quite unprofessional how you dismiss valid criticism from your investors as just ""haters"" and you refuse to acknowledge or answer any difficult questions. Not to mention the fact that the project is months late, is not even operating at full capacity, and is pulling extremely poor profits. Maybe when you've addressed those things, then you have earned the right to act smug, if that's the way you want to behave.  I wish you guys all the best though, I would love to see the project be successful, but your behavior was a main reason why I decided to pull out.",True

If BTC jumps to some amazing value like Dias is expecting it to, then wouldn't it be better to just invest your money directly into BTC than in IRM?

A whopping $1.40 per 1000 tokens.     There are people dumping, which is what IRM want, then they will buy back their own tokens using ICO money and eventually there will be around a 80% IRM 20% actuall investor ratio.  Best scam ever seen this one, because they are slow scamming.   Their whole project has been a lie from the beginning.   Dias (posting as PeterK) is becoming unhinged on the chat and cannot help but speak like an admin even though he is pretending not to be.   As soon as anyone says anything remotely negative PeterK (Dias) is flagging admins and they all suck up to him, it is so obvious it is laughable.  You really should join their Telegram if you want a good laugh.  They have about 3 or 4 main alt accounts that lick the IRM boots and any normal regular investors who ask something they instantly become suspicious.   It is a laugh actually, it is like Borat meets Crypto.      They are still paying out in their own shit token rather than ETH as promised in Whitepaper.  They have still not created a proper dashboard or displayed any outgoing costs or their total mined amount each month. They are still not using the cave (They never intended to this was a scam from the beginning) They refuse to answer questions about the ""free"" building they were given (LOL)   On a serious note apart from the obvious lies, any genuine investors out there ask yourself this, if they are really on the up and honest, why does Dias delete every post in the main forum? Because he does not want you to know the truth.   Finally regarding their Telegram it has reached a pathetic state where anyone with a genuine question (That could be seen as negative) like for example ""What if the power company takes back the free building?"" or ""What if xxx scenario happens?"" they need to add at the end of the question a caveat saying something along the lines of ""I trust and believe in IRM"" or ""IRM to the Moon"" so they are not kicked or banned.

We have some great news and information to share with. Please read it fully.‼️  Here is the latest updates about our video and its details;  Second phase with s9's & s9j's become too big for our cave. Our team made a good calculation that cave will only fit 5000 miners inside safely. Because of the funds we raised and the miners cost got reduced as of know in total we have enough funds for 7000 miners. With the re-investment cave would not be sustainable. THIS WAY WE CAN EXPAND!!! There is nothing wrong with the cave and cave is still a good option. But this way our second phase can expand. For 7000 s9's air was too much for the cave.   so good about our new place?  We, like with the cave, have the right to have this place for us for free. It was given us by the electric company itself. Since we will be their biggest costumer, they were happy to share this place with us. So, it still didn't cost us anything 🎉🎉  As you guys can see from the video, the ventilation system is very smooth and also it is high above the ground so, it is very easy to take the air out and let it in. Electricity price is the same as before! The team is more experienced and active than before.   Other news and information;  -We have already ordered 1500 more miners and we are ordering as we go. The reason for this miners cost drops every month. We have no reason to order them at once and also the preparations takes time. So in October we will have 2000 miners in total!!  -In upcoming weeks we will have a Q&A, so please send us your questions privately if you have any(Which we know you must have a lot )  As always ICE ROCKS💪💪   https://youtu.be/0V51w6U4XMA",True

Quote from: fishdogduck on September 21, 2018, 11:32:16 AM If anyone is interested here is my Rock2 profit calculator that I made. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sK-JYICeL34HnVKGDic1l6Meeu3ombLwRrh-ro3l038/edit?usp=sharing (create a copy to edit it)  For the first payment of miners running for 22 days it should be around $0.00116 per token or $1.16 per 1000 tokens (hopefully it's not more than this or it means they are dipping into the ICO fund )  So if that is based on 500 ASICS running that means if someone invested, to make it a round figure $10,000.00 right now it they would get 31,250 ROCK2 which would see them receive a payment of roughly $31.25 each month this next couple of months.    Then assuming they put the other (when they actually order them) 1500 ASICS online that return will increase 3x so they would receive at a maximum $93.75 per month.    That is a total of 2000 ASICS right.   So times that by 5 to bring it up to 10 thousand ASICS assuming they can actually get that many purchased delivered and set up in the next 6 months that still gives you a return of $468.75 per month.    So at that rate, not taking into account difficulty adjustments or BTC price increases/decreases in 4 to 6 months  you MIGHT receive Just under $500 per month.  So minimum of 2 years to break even if at all and even then that does not take into account the difficulty and the halving in May 2020.      That is why I sold all of mine the chances of breaking even at all are next to zero.   You will not get rich because the difficulty as we get closer to halving is just going to explode, and yes that will increase the price of BTC, but even if it does 3 fold from where it is today, why risk maybe seeing some return on  your investment when with that same 10K you could buy just under 1.5 Bitcoins now?   Anyone who thinks they are going to ""Moon"" or get rich with IRM or ANY cloud mining service is kidding themselves.  I was kidding myself for a while but woke up and sold up and now have an extra BTC in my stockpile and about 20 ETH left over, feels good knowing I got out before being duped, although I was for a while luckly I purchased some more ROCK then dumped it again when the price rose.    I believe they are using ICO money to inflate the price as no one would logically pay that price now as an investment it just does not make financial sense.  Also you going to be paid in ETH so all of the mined BTC is going straight to them, they will be using ETH from ICO to pay investors no way would they be stupid enough to exchange the BTC they mine as they like all of us know by the time the halving is here it will be worth a fortune.      All this ICO has done is ensure that the creators become very rich and the investors will be left holding small bags of ETH.      You cannot trust Russians/Kazaks with cloud mining services because eventually they all say.......fuck you to the investors and that is what is going to happen here .    Sell up now while the price is higher and buy some BTC with it rather than risk it with these deceitful people.   ",True

IRM is essentially paying a dividend through mining if you hold their tokens.  In the stock market a 4-5% dividend paid monthly is considered **very good**.  By your calculations initially each token will give 1.16 cents and it will increase when more ASIC miners are added, to 4-5 cents per token. EVERY MONTH.  This is very solid and on par with good stocks that pay dividends.  There is the added bonus of being paid in Cryptos (ETH) too which are depressed right now (BTC is down 80% of its value since Jan 2018) but if the overall market caps increase so will the overall mining dividends you hold paid in ETH.  If your goal was to see a complete return on your investment in a short time then you are dreaming and will be disappointed with all crypto mining companies (none can or have ever  guaranteed this!). I did not see it mentioned anywhere by IRM or in their white paper that this was ever a stated goal to return huge payouts from the first months of operation.  It would be good for everyone to re-adjust their thinking and to be more realistic!  IRM is a long term crypto hold.   ",True

So now IRM investors are angry and rightfully so that on their payment day instead of receiving ETH as promised. They are being paid ROCK2PAY tokens (LOL)   Which they then have to convert to ETH.  This has confused many people and is also another lie which was told by IRM in their advertising and whitepaper.  And to make matters worse, many of the investors are shocked at the payout amounts they are getting.  And if you dare to speak negatively about IRM they will ban you in an instant, one guy invested 30K and received $50 as his first payment.  Given it will take them a few weeks to receive and install the next 1500 Asics he can expect a $150 per month payment when that is completed.   Another a similar amount and was instantly banned when he complained about the payout amount.   So for every $1000 Dollars invested you are currently receiving around $1.85 per MONTH!!!   What a fucken huge SCAM IRM is.  They are also pumping up the price themselves using either ICO money or money from their previous ETH mining operations.  So to any of you still invested in this mess I would take advantage of the fact they are pumping the token price and buying tokens and sell it back to them.    With IRM a small loss is a big profit.   There is a guy in their telegram who is a paid shill either that or the biggest ass kisser known to man named Peter K.  He even reports people who speaks negatively about IRM.  LOL.  So glad I got out of this huge scam.  My advise to current holders, sell now for a profit if you can, things are going to get much worse before they get better, if ""Better"" actually ever happens.    Sell and gtfo out of this scam.    So to summarize, things IRM have done or said that are not right or outright lies.  1.  They based their repayment calculator to suck people in on a figure that was more than double the current BTC price (I was one of those sucked in but got out in time)  2.  They have lied about the payment methods and said the contract will pay you ETH.  That is not the truth and now you get some fucken weird rock2pay token which you then have to try and cash out for ETH.

They have had to un-ban many people after others have said hey he was joking or it was only a question etc.  But overall they do not give a shit about investors.  4.

You people are forgetting a few things:  1. The payout was based on less than 3 weeks of mining, and only 500 miners. That's 10% of the total equipment budget. Based on that, the payout we got was actually much higher than I anticipated. When all the miners have been purchased, the payout should go up 5-10x, and if BTC goes up, it's looking even better. Try to find anything else on the market that will get you that kind of return on an investment. Go invest your money in US treasuries and get a 3% return if you're so concerned.  2. BTC is way down from the day the original calculator was put on the site. That was based on BTC being at $13,500. Obviously those numbers are no longer accurate. The fact that BTC went down and not up doesn't automatically make IRM a scam  3. Rock2pay is actually a good idea. For people with very few ROCK2 tokens, this makes more sense than sending tiny payments that wouldn't even go through due to the transaction fee. It literally takes 2 minutes to transfer these to ETH, why are people so up in arms about this? If you're worried about your funds being being held as an IRM asset, then go convert it to ETH! If taking 2 minutes to transfer to ETH is too much time once per month, then you should probably sell your ROCK2 tokens.  4. IRM is a long-term hold. If you were expecting to make your entire investment back in the first couple months, then you're an idiot. As long as BTC goes up, I think IRM is going to give a great return over the next couple years.

Firstly, I am invested in ROCK2 and have been for a while, and during ICO there were some scam accusations and they slowly built up to a crescendo that we are seeing now.    It was disappointing to see Dias stop answering any questions in here and TBH that got me a little worried, as I stated in a post.   Since joining the Telegram group I have seen first hand the comment's about people being banned and the Telegram locked to new members.  (Also never a good sign)    I personally think the constant FUD, onslaught of questions, the responsibility of both responding to investors and setting up the project was more work than the team had envisaged, and this has put great pressure on them and in particular Dias.    They have adopted a ""Positive Comments Only"" policy in the Telegram which again I think is wrong.   As long as people are asking legitimate questions, not FUD dressed up as a genuine question but actual real questions, then they deserve a right of reply, the same with new investors, if they hear that the Telegram is closed to new members to reduce fudding that in itself is a red flag so they are shooting themselves in the foot doing that.      In my opinion they should welcome new members (maybe they are now I am not sure) and they will soon weed out those there simply to FUD.    But getting back to one of my original points, I think Dias has taken the wrong approach in many ways here, that being that to be defensive one should be offensive, and there is no need for that, but again after months of being called a potential scammer I suppose it got to them and I hope now that the initial pressure is off of the team they take a break, sit back and re-assess their attitude on-line to investors and potential investors.    As for the scam accusations themselves, well I have never believed these guys are scammers, and they have posted videos of both the arrivals of the first lot of ASICS and the installation with an in-depth video in early October, which is a great thing.  So anyone out there wondering if they are indeed scammers, my answer is no, if they were they would have taken the ICO money and run for the hills (or a cave ) but they have not done this and I believe they will follow through with this project and it will be successful.   With regards to the repayment amounts, I personally did not do my own due dilliegence well enough (My own fault not anyone elses) and just looked at the calculator without realizing it was based on an assumption of 14.5K BTC price.     That does not deter me from my investing in IRM because like many I know it is a case of when, not if, BTC will smash through previous records, and as for the difficulty, well that is anyones guess and where investing is similar to gambling right?      I could sell some of my ROCK2 now on exchange as I purchased at ATL as well as ICO, but overall I have faith that IRM are well intentioned and that eventually there will be profits for holders, and obviously others can see it too as the price has been steady for a long time now, and with first payments due end of this month followed by the video and ordering of 1200 or so new ASICS I think each month things will get better and better.    Some of you may disagree and that is fine, I am not here to tell anyone that they should invest in IRM nor am I here to tell anyone they shouldn't it is a personal choice/risk, like any investment but one thing I will say is these guys are NOT scammers, they have just cracked a little under pressure and whilst I have some sympathy for them with that, a more professional/friendly attitude on-line will see IRM earn some respect in the community instead of taking the confrontational approach.    Will post here how the payouts are, what they are like and also how the new Dashboard is and any other updates if anyone is interested.   ",True

Their Telegram is open to the public as far as I can see and the guys there are now a little more chilled and very helpful to anyone with questions, although different people asking the same questions everyday would do my head in, but I am sure every project has that issue.   As far as the miners go and payments they have stated the following in the Telegram -   First payments will be 28/29 September to holders of ROCK2, they are expected to be on the low side as most miners have only been working a few days.    The dashboard will be completed by October but not having it live will not affect payments as they will be done via smart contract, the exact time/date each month is not known at this time but it may be released for the future.    They are making an in-depth video to be released early October, probably answering many of the questions that some investors have.    They plan on ordering 1500 more ASICS which will be flown (not trucked) to the Cave to put them at a total of 2000 ASICS running.    Eventually there will be 12-13 thousand Rigs mining exclusively for IRM and ROCK2 holders, the cave can handle 10 thousand Rigs and I am not sure where the others will be located.      If any of the information I have provided above is incorrect then I am sure Dias will correct it but that is what I have read from the Admin on the Telegram.    So in a nutshell I think this is a very good investment to have that many miners working and exclusively for ROCK2 holders is a big deal, it will start off slow and build up to a big operation.   I think the low first 1/2/3 payments may scare some weak hands to selling, in which case I am ready to pounce as I see this being even more profitable than I first imagined, especially if people start dumping ROCK2 @ under ~ $0.20   So that is about it from me, looking forward to the first payment, whatever it's size and more importantly the new miners arriving and also the video which should clear up some FUD.      Last word, I have been defending this project from FUD for a while now, and I have since decided I am no longer going to do that.  Why?   Because the more FUD the cheaper the ROCK2, the more I can earn so bring on the FUD.     Everything I have posted is my personal opinion only and not official from IRM, but I believe in these guys and that they are going to make it very worthwhile for investors!!!",True

You will NEVER see an ROI for this.   It costs around $1,200 for 1000 ROCK2 and for that for the first couple of months you will receive $1.20 for every 1000.   So if you spent $5000.00 you will get a repayment of $5 for the next couple of months then after that multiply it by 3 when they get 1500 ASICS so your 5 Thousand dollar investment will see you earning a massive $25 per month.

He has his tongue wedged so far up their asses they would need to ask him to remove it to take a dump.      Even funnier the idiot has 20 thousand ROCK2 and he is going to get a whopping $1.20 payment soon, it is so funny watching them in the Telegram talking about how great things are going to be when the reality is they will be lucky to ever see even half of the money they invested back in a lifetime.

As for Dias not answering, well yes, as I said where you quoted me, it is dissapointing to see him not replying to any questions, and there is obviously a reason or reason(s) for that.  Let me explore some possibilities and see if you agree with any.   1.  (Worse case scenario) - What you said is true and they have over valued the ROI for investors on the website and will not admit that publicly and are trying to think of a way of mitigating this problem.  This I do not believe to be the case but of course I am not that naïve to say with 100% certainly that is is not.   2.  They are being silent while they set up equipment and slowly buying back tokens themselves at lower than ICO prices therefore will have to pay out less to seperate holders and also allow those who equte silence to FUD to sell for a lower price therefore ensuring they can pay those that do continue to hold as per the website calculator.    3.  They have mentioned Cindex as their dashboard, the Cindex ICO only started a day or so ago, maybe they are waiting on that, for what reason I do not know, but just throwing it out there.    4.  With the calculations posted by some here those who have posted said calculations have not taken into account that they have a lot of money left over from ICO which can also be used to pay investors/holders while they obtain and set up more mining rigs.       Either way, whatever IRM's intentions or tactics are, the silent treatment is not good and investors have a right of reply, but I do not personally think they are scammers, their names and faces are all over the place and I believe they are going to deliver, that is why I invested.   I will have egg on my face if they do not but I am happy to have an omlette for a face if I am wrong, but it would make no sense for them to harm what they have created.   The ICO finished a while back now and if they were going to run off they could have/would have done so by now.   So personally I am still invested and even bought some more @ its ATL recently so although there is that niggling ""WTF is going on"" feeling, I am going to trust my instincts and stay solid with IRM.    But with that said, Dias, enough is enough man, if you guys are quietly buying back tokens (I sincerly hope you are) then please at least provide us with an update regarding 1st payments and as mentioned above, the amount of payments per ROCK2 held.   Thanks. ",True

Final question, does the amount of ROCK2 held buy investors now, tomorrow or in 3 months time, still reflect what the website dividends calculator says it will?  In other words is that calculator ""dynamic"" as in ever changing or is it set in stone that if you own XXXX ROCK2 you will receive XXXX because that is what the dividend calculator says and said at time of purchase during ICO?

Just to clarify the point above about payments and the calculator on the website, would it be correct to assume then that those calculations on the website are the bare minimum of payouts per tokens held or can that drop below the calculated price?  I understand that when payouts are made if you HODL you stand to profit more, but my question was more so directed at the minimum payouts and the calculator on the site, so in summary what is on the site calculator is guaranteed (for the 3 years), regardless of BTC/ETH prices?

Also a few more questions if I may....  1.  If the exchanges (There is only one that I know of now that being token.store) are to be paid mining dividends according to their balances on the contract, how will it work for those holding on exchange wallets, will it be paid to the exchange or whatever wallet is holding the ROCK2 at the time of payment?  2.  Because there is only currently one exchange, if payments are on a set date/time each month, what is to stop them closing the wallets for maintenance so that people cannot receive their dividends by withdrawing to their own ERC20 addresses?  3.  Given that it is likely that exchanges will receiving mining payments, have you approached any of the larger exchanges and showed them the benefit of holding ROCK2 and that they would be paid ETH for doing so and therefore they should list ROCK2?  4.  Final question, does the amount of ROCK2 held buy investors now, tomorrow or in 3 months time, still reflect what the website dividends calculator says it will?  In other words is that calculator ""dynamic"" as in ever changing or is it set in stone that if you own XXXX ROCK2 you will receive XXXX because that is what the dividend calculator says and said at time of purchase during ICO?

Also a few more questions if I may....  1.  If the exchanges (There is only one that I know of now that being token.store) are to be paid mining dividends according to their balances on the contract, how will it work for those holding on exchange wallets, will it be paid to the exchange or whatever wallet is holding the ROCK2 at the time of payment?  2.  Because there is only currently one exchange, if payments are on a set date/time each month, what is to stop them closing the wallets for maintenance so that people cannot receive their dividends by withdrawing to their own ERC20 addresses?  3.  Given that it is likely that exchanges will receiving mining payments, have you approached any of the larger exchanges and showed them the benefit of holding ROCK2 and that they would be paid ETH for doing so and therefore they should list ROCK2?  4.  Final question, does the amount of ROCK2 held buy investors now, tomorrow or in 3 months time, still reflect what the website dividends calculator says it will?  In other words is that calculator ""dynamic"" as in ever changing or is it set in stone that if you own XXXX ROCK2 you will receive XXXX because that is what the dividend calculator says and said at time of purchase during ICO?  (I just purchased some more ROCK2, probably should have asked this question to you first before doing so )  That's it from me for questions Dias, just want to say you guys have done a good job fighting off the never ending FUD and I hope ROCK2 reaches at least $3 per token after the first rounds of payouts to holders.   Keep up the good work and please keep the information flowing, that is critical.       Edit: A question I forgot to ask, do you know if/when Etherscan will start recognizing the price of ROCK2 from Token.store on its platform?     Hi Dias, as you know I have been a long term supporter of IRM and am financially invested, so could you please take the time to answer my above questions individually?

Buying back tokens at prices lower than what you had promised and stating we have finished budget allocated for this month(which is somehow only announced after the buy back is complete) is just fleecing the desperate investors who just want to get rid of these god awful tokens. If there were no sell orders at the price you had promised at, this is understandable. But you as IRM choose to ignore these and buy back the ones lower than price you had advertised. Some of the admins have put forward the case of having multiple buy backs over several months as the profit from ICO 1 was small. How did you manage to profit off of ICO 1 when you haven't even installed the miners in your cave in the first place? What exactly was done with the money made during the 1st ICO, when you had another round of investments to buy miners, which has somehow taken 2 months to be transported by road from china to your cave.

Okay, I understand the ICO is over, but does that mean all profits paid can only be to one address that was listed?   The reason I am suggesting 2FA even though ICO is over, is it is my understanding it is still relevant and you can change and address if you need/want to?  So from my perspective 2FA is still very relevant and important.  And it is not expensive to install it, drop in the ocean.      Also another question, if you hold ROCK2 at time of ICO or at time of purchasing post ICO, are all holders of ROCK2 paid for mining based on the size of their holdings or is it only those who were registered for ICO, in other words does anyone who holds ROCK2 automatically become a receiver of Dividends,   And if you increase your position in ROCK2 does that mean you will automatically receive more ETH as a result of that purchase from the mining provided you are using the same address as the one registered on your website?",True

So far I've gotten 2 really unclear responses.  One of the Telegram members, who is probably just a member of the board under another name, said it's not the companies fault and the issue was the bitcoin price dropped so they couldn't get the things they needed. If they sat on the coin that was used to buy in and let the price drop instead of using the buy-in to get the mine going that's the fault of the company not the market.  One of the admins said they were not able to cash out the bitcoin to purchase the equipments in the originally intended amount due to legal reasons of not being KYC compliant. Did they never think of this before? They kinda acted like it was a shock to them. If this is the reason the original volume of mining is not gonna be up it's also the company's fault.  These people really need to get their act together. I knew the original approx 19 cent per coin a month was not gonna happen, but I was hoping for at least 8 cents with the change in bitcoin price. Now it looks like it will be less than a penny and the board is fully responsible for that not the market.  If they are holding off for the s11 purchases they should be clear about that and make it known when they will be up and running. The website still has calculations based on miners not being a limiting factor and needs to be updated tho they seem to have no intention of changing it.",True

These have both increased by a factor of ~4 in the last seven months. Before operating costs, now 1 TH/s would gross ~$15 per month at current difficulty if the price was $10000, whereas at Dec's lower difficulty that would have been ~$57. It is extremely unlikely that we will see December level profitability again, certainly in the near future. That anomalous (freak) rate of return was what IR decided to use as typical for the future, with their 357% etc. ROI nonsense. How much each token will receive depends on how much hashrate output is allocated to it, which in turn depends on how many miners are being deployed. With the small amount of mining actually being currently done, any ROI per token will be minimal.  As I pointed out in a previous post (not deleted yet), there is also the question of the 20% operating cost allocation. Whilst miners that consume more than 20% of their output in operating costs (like the S9's do now and will probably continue to do so) are being used, it must be asked, ""Where is the extra money coming from to pay the bills, from what account?"" There are three possible options: 1)From the 20% re-investment allocation 2)From the 50% profit distribution 3)From the Ice Rock 10% retention  If they choose 1) or 2), then they are effectively using (your) previous invested money to pay (you) dividends, which is a classic definition of a P*nzi Scheme.",True

I currently hold no ROCK2 tokens but believe Ice Rock Miming is one of the most promising ICOs for 2018. You may want to do some due diligence before calling an ICO ""a scam"".    Thank you very much, Sir.  Sometimes I think that such a blaming are coming from our loser competitors.  Ive asked you simple questions and u have dodged them with bullshit answers everytime.  1 how much are your running costs .. very simple the answer cannot be 20% because the number 20% is not a constand and your running costs should be to a certain extend. We would need to know salaries maintenance and power costs everything u put under that 20%. You can give the maintentance and power costs Per miner if u like.  2 what will you do when 20% does not cover the running costs ?  Say god forbid BTC goes to 2k what will happen?  3 the Team as u call it will NOT be drawing a salary Next to the 10% they claim will they ?  4 that 20% cannot be a fixed number If u can afford to pay everything when btc is at 7000 for 20% then when it is at 14000 you should be able to Half that and give the benifit to your customers either by buying more miners or better payouts.  So lets have some Clear answers to these no more dodging the numbers if u cannot give those numbers u have no buisness asking for money.  There are a couple of small errors in your whitepaper ill let u slide on for now.  I have been mining for a long time I know what I'm talking about.    Do you have telegram or skype? I will call you.  I am tired of misunderstanding.  Seems we are in that zone where 20% is not covering costs.",True

Under key advantages on the website IRM states:  ""We have built an ICO Advisory team that is highly entrepreneurial and understands the benefit of mining. Our ICO Advisors are offered a generous compensation package to help us grow our investor base, most investors become advisors. This structure allows us to scale our business without incurring higher costs. We gain economies of scale without high capital outlays. We are efficient in all aspects of our operation""  If your official advisors have been so beneficial to the ICO, than also show them the courtesy of answering their simple questions. So I'll ask again:  @Dias, or the person on this forum who posts under the name IceRockMining, could you please answer this question:  ",True

They are immediately available and cheap tho, so maybe the cave will be humming by say early July? (Obv. no June profit= no June payment?) On current difficulty and price, I estimate 30 days mining with 500 X 'averaged out S9's' will return something in the region of $60k gross.  That breaks down as  50% return to investors of $30k 20% retained for reinvesting  $12k 20% expenses $12k 10% IR keep $6k  Three questions: What's the ROI on all the tokens sharing $30k return between them? ""400% annualized?"" Na.....  When do they reinvest the $12k what do they buy, when does it come online and start earning?  At $0.03 per kWh, in 30 days 500 S9's will use about $17,000 of electricity. How does that $17k come out of $12,000 allowed for all expenses, including electricity, staff, security etc.?",True

I had questions concerning the distribution for articles and videos. See my post below.  With thanks. Best success for the upcoming July mining start!   I noticed 30% of 405,000 tokens are allotted for blog and video award or 121,500 tokens.  Yet the instructions say, ""For Posting to your own blog {articles/translations} = 50 - 500 tokens""  Why are video and blog not given ""stakes"" and the entire amount available divided among them?  I noticed on the excel sheet for blog and video  that there are 367 entries.    Of the first 93 only 50 (about half) were ""approved"".  If 50% of all 367 entries are approved then 184 submissions will receive bounty between 50-500 tokens.  This gives a range of 9200 tokens (if all entries get 50 tokens) to 92,500 tokens (if all entries get 500 tokens).    I doubt you will give all submissions the top rank.  So likely much less than 92,500 tokens will be awarded.  My question is what will happen to the 30,000-50,000 extra tokens not awarded but given to you to manage and distribute?  Do you keep them? Are they returned to IRM?  Also, for high quality articles (and videos) and the exposure on websites free for months giving 50 tokens for reposts is very low.   Blog and video should be distributed by ""stakes"" not ""tokens per article"".  If all 121,500 tokens for this bounty are not distributed it gives the perception that you may have bias to award less tokens and keep the remainder (not that you would do this but it could be perceived this way).  I look forward to seeing all the tokens allotted fairly by stakes and the calculations should be transparent and posted for all to see.  Thank you for you efforts managing the bounty, it is a lot of work!",True

They only say that 12 Miners can replace 4284 Miners and has a hashrate of 60.000TH/s and in other part saying 70% less power usage. The Website is in German, no found translation. The Website is not very google friendly, looks like the Company has not so much interest to be found. I wrote them Email ~ week ago and ask for spec. of there Miner, but don´t get answer. The description of the ASIC looks not very don´t know how to say read self, google translator:  A unique patent in the market  Our chip is made up of tens of thousands of interconnected transistors linked by different horizontal planes. These links are both encrypted and rendered unrecognizable by approximately 120,000 binary codes and passwords generated by them. The calculated data can only be decrypted and processed with our specially developed software.  Our ASIC processor is an electronic circuit. This is permanently integrated in the circuit, so that the function of the chip can not be changed. If an attempt were made to copy or decode these codes, the charge in the chip would be altered, which would lead to the burnout of the connections.  For me the Company looks not very serious in the moment, because i can not believe that they really have this Product ready now!  Why?  Company is founded on 20.10.2017 The Company registered purpose Tade with hardware and Software. Maybe i´am wrong, but to make a working product in 6 month, that is so much better then all other Miners on market. Making a ASIC what encrypt the data make no sense. encrypt and decrypt the data need calculation time and ASIC´s must give the result fast or i´am wrong?  here the Website: http://www.bitswiss.ch",True

Here is what the user wrote in this thread who created the first tread about the project- Quote from: aTriz on April 10, 2018, 11:09:42 PM Addressed to all the bounty hunters, DT members, Quickseller & co, and everyone else who lost faith in me  I've been away for the last 3 days as I needed to take a step back to re-think about aTriz, ALU and the future of me on this forum. I've finally returned and I'm ready to start over and fix some issues I've caused to everyone, and a lot of grief I caused people. I'd like to thank the users who've defended me tooth and nail. From the bottom of my heart, I'm sorry.  From this day forth, I've contacted someone who works especially in the ICO scene as a part time manager and full time ETH dev. The user will be validating all my future projects (and ALU's if I am allowed back in) with extensive validation of their smart contract, and my current community mangers and I will thoroughly study the projects whitepaper to prevent any sort of shadiness from happening. I want to be clean as a whistle from this day forth.  I understand that I have made numerous clouded and greedy judgments. Here are the 3 issues that I must solve before moving on  The Bitblisscoin scam and lies Due to my malicious actions that allowed bitbliss to be allowed on the forum, I'll be doing the following.  Refunding any investor, no matter how large the investment their full amount that they have put in the project. I'm currently looking for a DT member to validate their accounts (so I know they actually invested) so I can refund them. I'll be making a thread for these investments in the week. If the total investments do not total the amount I've been paid from bitbliss, I'll be donating the rest of that money to the http://thewaterproject.com/. I'll do a full screen recording of me and the dev's chats and send it to any DT member (preferably Ibminer/suchmoon if they would waste their time helping me) to validate the amount that I've profited from them. From my current estimations and digging through the chat logs, I've profited a total of 0.26 BTC from them.  Chrysos Coin and Snakey The ANN was up for approximately 4 days in which content was displayed. For any users who can prove to me that they found the project via the ANN that was up for the 4 days will also receive a full refund. We can use snakey as a precedent and he provided me 2 vimeo links that were timestamped and where during the time in which the ann was up and a video of his telegram chat with the devs at the same time. He will be receiving his full investment of 17 ETH back within this month. I'll also be making a thread in which you can apply for a refund.  Ice Rock Mining I was purely involved in this project as a campaign manager and was not part of any dev team so I do not believe I am responsible for said project. After the ICO ended and round 2 was about to start a friend pointed out some red flags with the government and I declined their offer for managing their 2nd bounty. After this I also removed the ANN thread.  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2751956.180 And why are my posts removed?",True

It's a cave cut into a mountain. It's cold, but it's made of stone. It's not going to melt. Dias has addressed the humidity issue in a previous post, but I can't recall the specifics.   If someone invest 1000$ 306% ROI per year?! Seems like you are running Antminer coasts of an Antminer is 1200$. What are those 16 people earning 0$ per year. Read the whitepaper. 10% of profits will go to paying employees.   And you pay lifetime? So you are doing this all for your customers for free. Well thats very friendly. Seems like a charity project or the earnings and profits are based on a Bitcoin price increase to 100.000$ then maybe people get paid. This is all very clear if you look at the website / whitepaper. 50% of profits are given to investors, the other 50% is used to re-invest into the company, maintenance, and to pay management. It's incredibly straight-forward. ""Lifetime pay"" is of course contingent on BTC mining remaining profitable.   Cant even get why people are buying these tokens. Maybe based on the story of the project. Maybe people think hey cool website and story ill invest 1000$? How is that different than any other investment? If the story they're telling doesn't meet your burden of proof, then don't invest. I've done a ton of a research and am reasonably confident that ICR is legitimate, though that doesn't mean it's guaranteed to be profitable. There's an inherent risk due to the nature of the crypto market. You just seem to be screaming ""scam"" because you don't understand how this ICO works.",True

A scam implies that they're going to take all the investors money and run. I don't see any indication that this will happen, do you?  I believe that they will begin operations when they say they will and will pay their investors. But the return on investment is going to be highly dependent on BTC value at the time of mining. If BTC continues to tank, they won't be able to afford business expenses, and the ICO is screwed. Everybody investing should understand that.

We would need to know salaries maintenance and power costs everything u put under that 20%. You can give the maintentance and power costs Per miner if u like.  2 what will you do when 20% does not cover the running costs ?  Say god forbid BTC goes to 2k what will happen?  3 the Team as u call it will NOT be drawing a salary Next to the 10% they claim will they ?  4 that 20% cannot be a fixed number If u can afford to pay everything when btc is at 7000 for 20% then when it is at 14000 you should be able to Half that and give the benifit to your customers either by buying more miners or better payouts.  So lets have some Clear answers to these no more dodging the numbers if u cannot give those numbers u have no buisness asking for money.

Firstly this is not new ""News"" the same guy said the same thing in October 2017, but lawyers and financial experts have said it will not be possible to ban ""Mining"" as it is a persons choice to do so using their own electricity at their own private property.   Reference - https://news.bitcoin.com/national-bank-of-kazakhstan-restrict-exchange-mining-cryptocurrencies/   Further to that, the same guy in that very article says ""I do not even understand what Bitcoin is"" so like most, he fears what he does not understand and is only looking at things from a finance orientated centralized banking point of view.   So in order to ""Ban"" mining, first it would need to pass legislation, which it has not.  And I cannot find anywhere where a bill has even been submitted.  So all you are basing your fear on is one persons view.   And if you visit the website of the Central Bank there are no press releases about this - Link  http://www.nationalbank.kz/?docid=527&switch=english  Every second news article, especially by Fud Desk is about banning Bitcoin, if you keep believing what mainstream media tells you then Crypto is not for you.

I am very interested in your ICO and have some questions answers to which are vital for my decision to invest.  I have read your Whitepaper very carefully but unfortunately couldn't find this information    To be fair I asked similar questions in groups of other mining ICOs (don't think it is right thing to name them here since you are competitors)  1) Tokens give share in profits. So I need to know in details all info on the costs.  1.1) What is your estimation of other costs per KW/h apart from electricity (like salary, Internet, repairs, rent)? 1.2) What taxes (e.g. income tax) and at what rates will be paid? 1.3) How can we be sure that you will not knowingly increase costs (salary for example) to make profits zero and legally not pay anything to token holders?  2) You plan to build data center in Kazakhstan  2.1) What is legal status of cryptocurrency mining in Kazakhstan? Is it allowed? What taxes are applicable? 2.2) Which company produces electricity in your region? Do you have an agreement with electricity producer for electricity supply? What power is reserved for you? Can you please provide contract or an agreement of intent? 2.3) You state that the price of electricity is USD 0.03 per KW/h. Please provide support for this price. Is it stated in the contract? 2.4) What happens if you raise all $23 mln on ICO? Will there be sufficient electricity power and area to build such data center?  3) You plan to buy Antminer S9  3.1) Do you have contract or an agreement of intent with Bitmain? In case of success you will have to buy great amount of ASICs. How can you be sure that you will be able to buy ASICs in large amount?  4) You plan to list tokens on exchange in June  4.1) Do you have an agreement with any exchange? 4.2) Your token is defenetly a security token.

And all these spendings will be on IRM side, sitting in the 20% of maintenance fees.We have no rent. But please be sure, in Kazakhstan salaries usually 5 times less than in Europe or USA.  1.2) What taxes (e.g. income tax) and at what rates will be paid?  For now, we don't pay any taxes, because crypto and mining are not regulated in our country, and the second reason is due to our corporate structure. Head company is registered in Nothern Ireland. TAx-free for Kazakhstan. You will be able to watch all the documents in Data Room section on our website.  1.3) How can we be sure that you will not knowingly increase costs (salary for example) to make profits zero and legally not pay anything to token holders?  Are you really asking this question? You think that salary of 10 people will get all the profit? We will make official reports.  2) You plan to build data center in Kazakhstan  Sir, we have a cave.

Can you please be so kind and comment the opinion of Head of Community Support of Miner One?  ""A detailed review of Ice Rock's white paper by our data centre experts reveals shortcomings of the project that are not only uneconomical but, frankly, dangerous from a safety standpoint - such as their belief that a cave with an average temperature of 12C doesn't need massive ventilation equipment. This simply shows a lack of expertise. Without extensive ventilation, the cave will heat up from the miners. This oversight means their cost estimates could be way off, not to mention the safety problems this will create. We stand by that assessment 100% and sincerely hope they will revise their plan to take this into account, including the cost this will add. They need someone on their team who actually knows how to build such a large data centre, including proper ventilation and cooling. Right now they don't have anyone like that. If they had a plan for ventilation, it should have been in their White Paper. Right now their White Paper says nothing will need to be built because the cave has ""natural cooling"" (p. 8 ). So how much cost will this new ventilation equipment add? Where is that discussed? A guy standing in a cave making vague statements about Old Soviet Technology and some primitive pipe doesn't cut it. So, they are even saying their cost estimates assume no ventilation is needed. Sorry, you're saying this company wants to raise millions of dollars from investors all around the world but can't be bothered to hire someone to write a proper White Paper and properly estimate costs and equipment needs? Does that sound serious to you?""  I, as one of the investor of IceRockMining, am now concerned due to the fact that your white paper does not include any sentence about ventilation shafts.

About the ROI on your web. Why do you calculate the monthly income in USD and not in ETH? When mining starts in July, first pay-off will be in August - the price of ETH in August could be 2000 USD but also 500 USD - so if I invest today 1000 USD, I get 1450 ROCK2, I should get 0.3 ETH in August - it could be 150 - 600 USD though!  We show in USD because crypto is very volatile.  We pay in ETH. Mine BTC ==> Convert in ETH. And immediately pay in the end of each month after July. ETH is just method of payment. (ex:    if your profit is 1000$ and the rate of ETH is 200$ you will get 5 ETH) if ETH price is 1$ you will get 1000ETH  2. When quantum computers come to the market there is a chance that all your mining device will become obsolete..of course it will not be in near future, but maybe in couple years - what will you do after that?  We have 20% reinvestment each month. (we will just buy superminers) and will rise the hashrate of our Ice Rock Farm   3. Your contract for the electricity price is for 5 years - what will you do when you get double-price for electricity after 5 years? How can it impact your investors?  in 5 years we will have our own electricity (we just near the dam, the 1st way is to create our own hydroelectric power station, second and third is Solar panels and wind generators.) 5 years is ok to create both.  4. Does the cave have a column? I can only imagine that with 5000 ASICs, there will be very very hot inside and 12°C temperature will not be Hello Sir!  We have a trump card in our sleeve.  The height of the ceilings in the cave is 4 meters. We will use the old and reliable Soviet technology to cool underground mines (coal mines, mines in which minerals are produced by non-ferrous and ferrous metals). Technology calls the Canvas sleeve.  The idea is to deliver outdoor air to the end of the tunnel with a canvas sleeve (very cheap and efficient)  This creates circulation, hot air is pushed out and cool street goes even more so we have 10-12 degrees (it's always cold there)",True

Thank you very much for your question!   At the time when we were engaged in calculations, BTC cost 13,500 dollars. With this exchange rate, profitability was at that time slightly more than $ 30 from 1 miner s9.  But those figures that you see, are made up of your investment and 45% of the bonus because now there is an early pre-sale. This gives you an advantage. With less investment, you get more shares.  1000 $ = 1450 ROCK2 tokens.  It is very important❗️  And as well, please do not look at the price of the BTC in the context of the single day or even one month. Please look at the annual trend. For example, every summer and autumn BTC is at its peak! In summer it will cost much more than even 13,500 dollars.  + to this we expect new equipment with more power for the same money. Therefore, our ROY of 200-425% is quite real and in fact, we expect much more.  I hope I answered your question, Sir!",True

Im convinced you are not a scam, but a real project, but there are some points that need to be clarified.  1. About the ROI on your web. Why do you calculate the monthly income in USD and not in ETH? When mining starts in July, first pay-off will be in August - the price of ETH in August could be 2000 USD but also 500 USD - so if I invest today 1000 USD, I get 1450 ROCK2, I should get 0.3 ETH in August - it could be 150 - 600 USD though!  2. When quantum computers come to the market there is a chance that all your mining device will become obsolete..of course it will not be in near future, but maybe in couple years - what will you do after that?  3. Your contract for the elecricity price is for 5 years - what will you do when you get double-price for elecricity after 5 years? How can it impact your investors?  4. Does the cave have a column? I can only imagine that with 5000 ASICs, there will be very very hot inside and 12°C temperature will not be enough, maybe.  Thanks for your answers.

It's not me posting that address on your website, nor me posting that company registration. The only thing I did is checking streetview/google with the address provided on the website and document. I didn't build the hotel there either, but that's where the search ends up.  I already posted earlier that I would invest in this if I'm wrong about that, and that I would delete all posts about it, because I find this concept interesting as well. But I'm not gonna put money into some company that turns up on the radar as the address of an hotel, and the only counterargument against that is ""your say"" there isn't a hotel there.  Could be that I made a mistake somewhere, well then show me what I did wrong and where I should end up when looking up that address your friend posted earlier.  edit: and yes I have some serious trust issues in ICO's/presales since last year(s)",True

Yes, we are PRO miners since 2013, our Team is very experienced in mining! We also provided the first phase of our ICO and our backers are getting profit from Ice Rock Mining.   IRM (Ice Rock Mining)  – it is one of the few companies going to ICO in September 2017 showing its consistency as a start-up, and already operating a business. We are the only mining company that actually works and profits the holders of their tokens, on an ongoing basis. Now IRM opens the sale of tokens to the second stage of the ICO, to increase the farm's capacity and its expansion.  IRM's reputation speaks for itself and is strongly supported by various facts and by real business (activities) that works every day. By investing cryptocurrency in our project, you can be 100% sure of the reliability of your investments, as you invest in a business with real assets and real people.    ABOUT OUR CEO   The founder of IRM project Malik Murzashev received for his 25th birthday a gift from a friend in the form of Bitcoins. At that time (in the mid of 2012), they cost only 5 USD per Bitcoin. Malik in those years was fascinated by his own successful business in the sale of home appliances and software development. At that time, an interest in cryptocurrency was just emerging, and this present was unusual.  Nevertheless, Malik got the crypto wallet and began to interest in the blockchain technology. In 2013, he began to mine first bitcoins as a hobby. Then, within 5 years, a considerable experience in the field of cryptocurrency has been accumulated and over time it was apparent that it was time to build something large that is bounded with cryptocurrencies. This decision began to materialize into a serious project and a question of own large mining farm arose.  After the debate with one of the business partners, it turned out that he owns a former secret bunker built by the Soviet Union in case of war. This room is located on the mountain and in fact it is a mountain cave. The room could be used for various purposes: it could be used for food stores in case of a military attack, it can be used as a hiding military operations (a shelter). In other words, the room was in fact multi-functional. After that, Malik decided to do his own research on cooling in such ""mountain caves"".",True

If it is a scam and I do my arse well I have only risked what I can afford to lose but something tells me this will be profitable.  Mining is very expensive and the rates they are offering are good.  Maybe too good to be true, but time will tell, will come back with my tail between my legs admitting I was wrong, but ROI in 4 months, that is enough time to know where you stand.

But I have one really important question:  You have a good price for electricity, that's ok. But why you do not invest in renewable energies like solar energy or wind energy? I am not really an expert of these technologies but your location of the mining farm looks very promising for renewable energies. Then you would have no risk with electricity price and take your own energy. That would make this project even more interesting.  Greetings and good luck to the team !",True
