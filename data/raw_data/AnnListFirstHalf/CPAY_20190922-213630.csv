Konstantin, Customer support team-lead is here  I would like to start with an apology.  We indeed have misled you. The office in London is the registered address of the company. That is not a secret and has never been. Unfortunately, our support staff has mixed up this info, bringing the wrong answers to you. But I am here to clear things up.  Small companies use the services of secretaries, corporate assistants and accountants. This is a common practice, as we are sure you know. This role is usually performed by one company, and it always registers its clients at its own address. This way we can receive correspondence from authorities, contractors, etc.  For example, let‚Äôs take a look at the Coinbase registered address. Several thousand companies registered there as well, and that doesn‚Äôt make them a scam company. Here‚Äôs a link: https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/search?q=EC2V+6DN  Once again, I‚Äôm deeply sorry for the misrepresentation.  As for other offices and our employees. We do have two other offices up and running in Lisbon and in Saint-Petersburg. These are fair workplaces for those working there. The management is mainly in Lisbon, while the development team is based primarily in Saint-P. In general, our staff is dispersed between London, Lisbon and Saint-Petersburg, part of our employees works remotely in different places all around the world (from NYC to Thailand).  Having several companies helps us manage the business risks, acquire licenses needed for our business and develop several different products in both regulated and unregulated markets.  Last, but definitely not the least. The product we are offering always is real. We actually had cards available in Europe for a long time with thousands of satisfied, happy customers. And right now we are working to bring everything back on track.  In conclusion, I hope you understand that we never had and never will have any intention to lie. The relationship we have with our customers is built on trust and transparency - this is something that we cherish the most in our business.",False

I‚Äôm up to the moon happy that you‚Äôve accepted our apology! Now let‚Äôs cut to the chase.      1) Here‚Äôs the deal with cards. As far as I understand you don‚Äôt have the whole picture drawn. The Russian card programme is the third card programme we have launched since the company was founded. The first one was launched in 2016 - we started issuing VISA prepaid cards in the partnership with Wavecrest, our main card issuer for this card programme. These cards were available worldwide, not only in Europe, we had clients in Australia, South Africa, South America, New Zealand, Canada and tons of other countries. However, in the end of August 2017, WaveCrest updated their issuing policies in compliance with new VISA rules - from that moment on cards were available only to European residents and residents of countries in the EEA.     We didn‚Äôt want to lose our non-European clients and in September 2017 we started doing business with a new card issuer and developed the second generation of our prepaid cards. Acting as the programme manager, we were registered with the card scheme and certified it under PCI-DSS. The second generation of cards was completely redesigned. Not only did we update the physical design, but we also improved the functionality of the card, and it was backed by a new technology stack.     After a great start and initial roll-out of the new cards to all Cryptopay users in Q4 2017, we were unfortunately forced to shut this programme down due to a disagreement with the BIN provider.     That‚Äôs when we got back to WaveCrest and their prepaid cards. This ¬´first generation¬ª prepaid cards successfully served our users until early January 2018 when lost its Visa license. This canceled cards not only for us, but for almost every other European card provider. And form that day on we were working to bring cards back and continue to do so even now. The Russian card programme was started a month ago and is a first result of what we‚Äôve achieved. We keep negotiating with card issuers and VISA managers to bring cards back to Europe and other territories around the world. Hope this little history throwback will help you understand us better. I‚Äôd also suggest you checking out our ICO landing page https://ico.cryptopay.me/ - you‚Äôll find there the most exhaustive information about us and our products. Also, I‚Äôd suggest you looking through our Telegram chat - people constantly discuss our development there, ask questions and share their feedback: https://t.me/cryptopayico     2) Unfortunately, I won‚Äôt be able to share the direct address with you here. Our offices are not client-oriented and we‚Äôve come to a decision not to post addresses for these offices publicly.     As for London, you‚Äôre not quite right. We do have full-time employees there, of course, due to the nature of several products we are working on currently. Several representatives of our compliance, marketing and B2B relations departments are working there, as well as the director of one of the Group‚Äôs companies Stockflare Securities.",False

It seems from what you say you are tying to re-build after the issues but to make it easier no doubt the $18 million the ICO bought in would make it very easy to do.       2) Unfortunately, I won‚Äôt be able to share the direct address with you here.

Ok  So could you please in your own words explain what the main differences are between your Cryptopay VISA and say for example Monaco VISA as well as other competitors who are launching products.  How would you compare your apps with say the Monaco VISA app and what are the main differences.  It is no secret I think the Monaco Cards CEO wasted 18 months before finally managing to get the cards out just in Singapore an that was after they got $26 million in the ICO. With all sorts of loopholes and clauses in the whitepaper (as well as Founder tokens) the Monaco ""team"" have become millionaires overnight and the ""team"" have used the ICO money to fund their lavish lifestyles by travelling all over the far-east to ""test"" the cards making test transactions. The Monaco team have not declared how many Founder tokens they own and have not stuck to the original whitepaper and I do not like them because of their lack of respect towards investors.  How do you rate your customer services?  Where do you see Cryptopay after 12 months? What will the company be doing and where will the cards be in circulation?",False

All funds we raised during the ICO are used only for the development and implementation of the products which were chosen as the milestones of our ICO. You can read the detailed information about them in our whitepaper: https://ico.cryptopay.me/ico_cpay_wp.pdf When the ICO was in progress, we were issuing our cards within the framework of WaveCrest card programme. So, the card programme wasn‚Äôt included in the milestones. The closure of the WaveCrest card programme was an unexpected surprise for all of us, and in order to avoid repetition of what happened with our cards, we have decided to take the long, tough road to gain full control over our own programme and become Card Programme Manager. It‚Äôs not an easy way, and we have to go through a lot of bureaucracy before we reach the goal, but despite the obstacles, we move forward. Fortunately, most of the work has already been done. You can read about it in the Card Programme Announcement: https://medium.com/cryptopay/card-programme-announcement-10dc4fd4e7a1  As for Monaco, there are a lot of details which make us different. Cryptopay was founded in 2013, and Monaco only in 2016. The range of the services is also different. For example, at the moment they issue their cards only to Singapore. Europe comes next, followed by the USA. We have launched our Russian card programme and are working on the card programme for EEA countries now. We‚Äôll start working on expanding the list of supported countries shortly after.  The customer support approach we use sets us apart from some of our competitors as well. We communicate like people, not like robots. We don‚Äôt want to provide the typical formalities associated with customer support found in other companies. We take every issue our clients face seriously and work hard to make sure that our clients are satisfied.  We‚Äôve even posted the article about our support team and described our principles and commandments here: https://medium.com/cryptopay/how-to-build-a-financial-service-with-a-human-face-d87dd66cddaf  As for the future of Cryptopay, we will continue to implement new products in accordance with the timeline https://ico.cryptopay.me/ and will do our best to expand the list of supported countries and make our cards available not only for the clients from Russia and EEA countries. Our main goal is to make a contribution to the financial world and make Cryptopay services accessible to everyone in the world. We want our clients to use the whole set of wealth management tools on the go and we are going to make all our services as convenient and understandable as possible. So, it will be a busy year.",False

Please never ever offer your card products to those who want them anonymously. Anonymity leads to compliance issues. Recent history and experience have shown what these issues do to the card programme. Scammers often use anonymous cards to perpetrate their scams.

Vesting ensures the founders‚Äô commitment to building the system in the long-term. Founders and the Cryptopay team will have 2 years vesting with a 6 months cliff. Meaning that Foundation retention and CPAY team tokens are locked in a smart contract, which would release them every 6 months proportionally during a period of two years, starting on the 7th month after the ICO. The information in the whitepaper was written long before we even learnt about the closure of the card program, let along planned the launch of the new one, so the dates being close together are no more than a coincidence.

It took ages (a month) for the blocked funds to be available for spending again.  There are two options: 1) if the merchant (the online shop) is trustworthy, contact them (the merchant) and ask them to reverse or cancel the second transaction or 2) dispute the transaction by contacting Cryptopay who in turn will contact the card issuer to initiate a charge-back or a dispute of the second payment. The dispute will take time because Visa will give the merchant an opportunity to defend itself from your requested charge back. A lot of time. Weeks (in my case it took a month). I didn't dispute. Wave Crest told me if the merchant doesn't settle the second payment, Visa will automatically credit the funds back to my card. And they did.  If you want the money credited back to your card ASAP, you must proactively work on the matter by contacting the merchant. The merchant should reach out to their bank and have the second payment cancelled and Visa informed of that cancellation.",False

The current cards are not going to work for sure since VISA has updated their terms on 15 October and they are not likely to reverse the old conditions.

We understand that the verification procedures can be tough and might take a considerable amount of time. We recommend you uploading the verification documents as soon as you can in case there are any issues/additional docs needed. The new card limits will be implemented starting from 17 January.

Check the following list before ordering the card and make sure your country is presented here:  Andorra Austria Bailiwick of Guernsey Bailiwick of Jersey Belgium Bulgaria** Canary Islands Croatia** Cyprus Czech Republic Denmark Estonia Finland France** Germany Gibraltar Greece** Greenland Hungary Iceland Ireland Isle of Man Israel Italy Latvia Liechtenstein Lithuania Luxembourg Madeira Malta Monaco Netherlands Norway Poland Portugal Romania** San Marino Slovakia Slovenia Spain Sweden Switzerland Turkey United Kingdom Vatican City    I have ordered a card which is now USELESS  If you are not on this list forget this Debit Card  When I ordered - it was valid - now its not.  In the middle of an ICO this is totally unacceptable.  Beyond their control they say:  Quote https://help.cryptopay.me/cryptopay-bitcoin-debit-card/general/changes-regarding-our-card-program  Changes regarding our card program   Written by Cryptopay Team Updated this week Due to reasons beyond our control we‚Äôve been forced to stop issuing and maintaining contactless cards on the new card program.  We understand this sounds really bad, but unfortunately we will not be able to provide card service to our customers outside the European territory.  All expenses such as card orders and delivery payments will be refunded till October, 25th.  The good news for our European users is that they can switch back to their old Cryptopay card and continue using it. Both loads and unloads are available now! For those who don‚Äôt have our old card we will reissue it free of charge.  We are looking for a solution for our non-europeans customers and will notify you about it as soon as we resolve this issue.  Thank you very much for understanding.    So just beware before ordering this card - at least wait if you are outside the EU until and IF INDEED they can sort out these problems.   I have withdrawn all funds from Cryptopay until they come up with solutions - ""support"" does not seem to answer questions.   Cheers - usukan",False

They are crooks.   There are still laws about how payments can be accepted by credit issuing organizations, and one fact is that if they accept payment for a good or service, and they can't provide it, then they must refund the money.  No matter how you justify what they're doing by saying that American's are just screwed by our own government, the reality is that this organization is just fine in allowing a person to register and try to verify, where I also identify myself as an American, and then accept money from us and then, immediately, tell me I don't qualify and they're not returning my money.  This is completely crooked.  You can't justify it, and if you try, then you obviously have an incentive to protect said behavior.  I recommend all Americans citizens avoid this company like the plague unless you just want to be taken by them.  The good news is I also filled out an application with Wagecan, and I have already received approval and my card is on the way.  The immoral behavior from this company will also tell you what will happen to you in the future.  One of the tests I use to determine who to do business with is how they act during times like this and the types of policies they enforce.

Because you hope that some people will register and then pay you, and you can keep the funds.  Which is exactly what you did.  If you cannot provide cards to Americans, then you should tell us on the registration page.  Where have you declared this?  No where except if someone clicks into the terms of service and reads the entire thing to find where you've hidden it.  No matter how you justify this behavior, you could easily have your website 'identify' customers from the US and simply turn them away.  Instead, you've chosen a crooked way to do business.   Here's a suggestion, which only takes a couple minutes of your time.  Go to your website and add a line on the first page of the registration, ""Sorry, we don't accept any US citizens, as our card issuer isn't allowed to issue to you"".  Very easy, takes very little time, but instead you're accepting money and screwing as many Americans as you can sucker while we very quickly try to solve a problem for ourselves.  You are preying on people.  You can't justify what you're doing, because it is easily fixed by adding a couple lines of text on your website.  Or you could add a box that says ""I'm not an American"" to allow registration, but instead you're relying on the old bait 'n switch tactics used by crooked organizations.  You didn't identify the issue, and you blame the customer for not reading terms of service about whether you accept American customers.  Again, the ONLY response from you is that you have it in your 'terms of service'.  What a feeble excuse.  Announce your real intentions on your main webpage, so everyone can understand you provide no service to Americans, and stop taking money from people that you can't serve.  This is no different than me setting up a webpage to provide a certain good, and then when you buy it from me, I claim that ""in my terms of service, I said that I cannot serve people from XXX country"", sorry so now I'll keep your money because you didn't read it.   That is a completely unethical way of going about your business.  You obviously prefer this business model, as the VERY FIRST email I received from you, was that statement.  So funny, how quickly you sent that to me, so you could keep the money.  As I said, I'll accept the loss of $70 as my lesson that your company is completely unethical business-wise.

When your agent realized that I was living in China, and in fact I wrote an email to her stating why did they deny me, because I'm living in China, she gave me that unethical response from you.  I wrote an email last week stating:  Also, you do realize that I don't live in the US?  I live in China...  And another email I sent:   Otherwise, you need to refund me for my plastic card, and expedited delivery and for my virtual card. I paid both of these using bitcoin. You will need to refund my bitcoin, so that I can draw this money out.  The response was:  I regret to inform you that we are not licenced to offer services to the US residents or citizens, which is stated in our terms and conditions. That is the reason why we were forced to deny your verification, as well as to suspend your plastic card and cancel a virtual card order. Sorry for the inconvenience caused!  Again, you did NOT refund me after the request.  In fact, you merely stated, again, that you were keeping the money because I didn't find in the terms of service where it stated this.  You trying to convince people that you're not scamming them isn't true.  All of my verification paperwork I sent to you showed and proved I lived in China, and yet you still just used the same excuse.  The reasoning is so you can keep the money.   If you weren't trying to be dishonest, then do a refund to my account and I will confirm it here.  Your admission above that your agents would have 'refunded me' and you trying to say I scammed you with incorrect information is fraudulent.  I can prove what I sent to you is accurate data, and I can prove you haven't refunded me.  The facts presented from you already are:  1.  You don't accept Americans 2.  If the application was accurate, your agents would have noticed and refunded the money  You did none of the above.  You didn't identify immediately that you don't accept Americans, even those living abroad who are NOT in America.  I know the limitation for this, but many of us are living/working abroad and haven't had issues with this in the past.  I know America limits deliveries of these debit cards there, as I was a customer of Wirex for years and they sent my cards to China.  Secondly, my application was accurate, and yet you lied that your agents would have refunded me.  They never did.  I identified to them that I live in China and what was the problem.  When they told me, I asked for a refund clearly, and instead of refunding, you scammed me and kept the money.  That is the truth, there is no exaggeration my part.  I paid you in good faith, I sent you accurate information about me, and you've chosen to simply keep the money.  If you're not a scam, then arrange to have my bitcoin returned to me through your agents.  I will update my posts here if you do it.  If you don't....then everything is exactly as I have stated about you.",False

It is now showing as pending and being processed. I just wanted to ask why the promo code was refused for the second order. I was getting the error ""promo code invalid"" probably because it was applied to the first order which was cancelled.  I ended up upgrading and paying for the card which was supposed to be free for existing verified card holders which was what your co-founder's George's emailed invitation was all about. $15 isn't much and I paid it but I was hoping loyal long-term Cryptopay customers like me would have enjoyed the fee waiver.",False

Therefore I¬¥m not confident that you would receive a Tenx debit card in a reasonable timeframe (I could be wrong on this). On the other hand Cryptopay has been around for a long time and you can probably get a debit card within a few days.  Why have you already restricted your choice to these two options?

And hoping that this will work to buy services online in majestic or in seoclerk. Many thing that i want to do with the debit card..  Yes, you will be able to use the card to verify your PayPal account but the card has to be fully verified. In order to verify your account, you will need to submit 2 types of documents:  1.) A valid government issued ID - high-quality images of the following documents are acceptable: ‚Ä¢ International passport (double page) ‚Ä¢ National ID card (both sides) ‚Ä¢ Driving license (both sides) Important: To avoid delays when verifying your account, make sure that your submitted documents are: ‚Ä¢ Entirely visible (watermarks are permitted); ‚Ä¢ Images of high quality (color images, with resolution of 300dpi or higher); ‚Ä¢ Valid ID documents with expiry date (not less than 6 months left) clearly visible.  2.)

It is there to ensure countries implement the stricter regulation on prepaid cards. At the moment, if a country chooses to relax CDD requirements for e-money, it must still ensure that issuers carry out sufficient transaction monitoring and issuers must demonstrate that the risks associated with e-money are low. This is a way we can still keep higher limits for now. Nevertheless, we strongly advise you to verify your account, because government regulators become more and more demanding to financial services these days.",False

I found it easy to sign up to the site. I noticed a couple of little quirks, no big deal. For example image of a Mastercard but checkbox to agree to Visa's Terms and Conditions. A spelling error or two. So far I have not been able to use the promo code. I can enter it with no problem and a green checkbox appears, presumably to show it is valid, but when I click on ""Order Card"" a message ""Promo Code not found"" appears.  There are a lot of 3rd-party scripts on the order page and I disable them by default until I can see what they do. Chances are one of them needs to run to accept the code but I haven't investigated yet. There are also ten trackers on the page, which I don't allow by default. Most are commonplace, such as Google-analytics or Facebook, but I haven't yet checked them all out.  That's as far as I've got for now. I don't mean to make this sound worrisome - it's just messy, but typical of many sites these days, and of course might contain something that would bother me. I've got to do some real-life stuff for a while, but I'll get back to Cryptopay as soon as I can.  I'm aware that Cryptopay has as much to fear from Internet Strangers like me as I do from them. Wariness should serve us both well, but it slows things down.  Edit: Update - yes, enabling the scripts allows the promo code to be recognized.

Thanks for reaching. Here are more clarifications:  1. There is 2500 lifetime load limit for all unverified cards. This is clearly stated on the product page here: cryptopay.me/bitcoin-debit-card . Lifetime load value is total amount of funds loaded both through Cryptopay and from other sources like PayPal or casinos.  2. Regulations change and sometimes swiftly. Our card issuer has decided to block all third party loads for unverified cards. This new rule has come into place without any prior notice on Monday. That's why many cards has been blocked. Right now, all cards are unblocked and there is some transition period in place untill Dec 1. So, if clients do not want to verify their ID and still accept third party loads, they should seek another provider. Sad but true. We will reach affected customers over the email tomorrow.   In regards to card delivery, it really depends. Contact the support team via livechat on the website and they will help you.",False

We're facing additional restrictions from our card issuer regarding third party loads, like withdrawing from PayPal or online casinos. We're discussing this issue with card issuer, but it seems that they will require account verification for this transactions to avoid fraud. This means, that if you withdraw from PayPal you need your account to get verified.   As per ""No ID is required"", we're happy to clarify. According to AML/KYC rules in Europe, there is no such a thing as anonymous debit card, anonymous account or anonymous payments. This is totally illegal and any operator promoting anonymous financial services is breaking the law and it's management can face prison. What can be achived is privacy. We do not ask you for your ID and residence documents while your account activity is lower that 2500 Euros threshold and happy to have lower limit on card transactions.

Taken from another vendor: Quote All gas station purchases have an additional charge called 'padding'. This is standard practice in the debit card industry - this means that we reserve a hold when you purchase at a gas station, and then once the transaction is completed, we refund the padding amount to your account.   Say you fill your tank at a gas station for $70 USD. Your total purchase value will hence sum $170 USD ($70 + $100). Once Xapo receives the settlement information from the merchant, usually within 24-48 hours, the padding amount will be returned to your wallet.   Padding amounts by debit card currency: - 100 USD - 85 EUR - 75 GBP",False

I only needed to input my card number and birthday and a PIN was assigned.  When I login into my Cryptopay.me I have an US dollar BTC address to send deposits. The deposits are almost instant only 1 confirmation. There is a 1-2% spread or something when it converts to US Dollars from the Bitcoinaverage.  Once my US Dollar BTC balance was loaded I proceeded to transfer it over to my physical card, however it failed for some reason. I sent a ticket and was resolved within a few hours. The second transfer was done instantly and appeared right away on MyChoiceCorporate.com balance.  I drove to an ATM. Tried withdrawing US Dollars but failed for some reason. I then withdrew Canadian dollars and it worked! Surprisingly there are no ATM fees at the machine, I guess its because its a Visa instead of a Debit card.

So i went to nearby visa atm and withdrawn 10000 NRS and i get one message from the BANK of that atm machine that they will deduct 5$ around NRS from my account and i thought it is the withdrawl fee charged by cryptopay as stated in their fee structure after that i get reciept and check my cryptopay card transactions in website. I get shocked to see 6.45$ deducted by cryptopay as fee, 5$ deducted by my bank as atm access fee. And i think there was also 4% foreign currency exchange fee.  Summary of how much i have paid in fee: 110$ x 107NRS = +11700 NRS I got = 10000 NRS in hand and 1.26$ remaining in cryptopay card.  So total fee = more than 1500 = 15$ for 100$ withdraw.

Here is what we typically charge: - 1% loading fee - $2.5 ATM transaction  However, if you withdraw not in card currency (NRS in your case), you were charge foreign transaction fee of 3%. Additionally, the operator of the ATM has charged you a fee for withdrawal, which do not have any association to.  We understand that you are confused, but you cannot avoid some fees, especially if you are doing exotic transactions. In case there is a USD ATM in your country, you better withdraw in USD to avoid additional fees.",False
