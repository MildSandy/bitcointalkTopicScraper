They banned me from the Telegram chat.  They give NO information outside of the telegram chat.    2.  Their marketing has sucked.  3.  This is because they are undercapitalized.    4.  The undercapitalization and subsequent lack of expansion was unexpected before ICO end.  Too late.  ETH in, FYP really illiquid for months.    Thus, I wanted out.  Lost confidence in their ability to expediently expand, and want out.  The dividends are looking like a fraction of a fraction of a penny.  Better to out on the volume.

We have been working tirelessly on the backend of Flyp.me to improve processes and be ready to support higher and higher volumes.  As we make steady progress, we have other great news to share with the Flyp.me community. From today, users of Flyp.me are able to exchange any of the cryptocurrencies supported by the service into FYP tokens. Buying FYP is now much easier thanks to the speed and ease of use of the Flyp.me exchange.  Also, FYP token owners who joined the Presale and ICO using their HolyTransaction wallet can now send, receive and exchange FYP tokens. If buying is the new selling, today is your day.  Last but not least, the team has finished testing the implementation of ERC20 tokens on Flyp.me and is happy to announce that Flyp.me is now ready to start exchanging ERC20 tokens. With this in mind, we will now start a campaign to ask the community which ERC20 tokens should be enabled first on Flyp.me. More details will be disclosed in the next days!

Everyone is talking about the lack of communication.  He only speaks where nobody can actually hear him, and his words can not become “news”. There is no news.    Francesco Simonetti only talks to the “faithful” in his cult.  No twitter.  No bitcointalk, and above all NO FUCKING VOLUME NUMBERS.  Because Francesco Simonetti has stolen all of our money.  He is failing.  He has no intention of trying to fix this, or share volume numbers because NOBODY KNOWS WHAT FLYP.ME IS.  BECAUSE HE STOLE THE MONEY.  He will not communicate here, or on Twitter.  He only talks in his private fiefdom of Telegram, where he can kick out people like me who know the truth.  We got scammed.  That guy stole our money.  Notice he hasn’t talked to ANY Press since he took our money?  Because he is gone.   Hey ThoMoak:  Why is your tongue so far up this scammers ass?  Are YOU HIM?  Or do you just not want to believe he robbed us?  Because the evidence is, he does not communicate here.  He does not communicate on Twitter or any public place.  He only communicates in Telegram, where he can cut out any dissenting voices.  You have lost your money.  Me too.  Francesco Simonetti is a scammer.  I am contacting Interpol with what I can find on this fuck.  I lost $25K. The rest of us lost a million.  We can get Interpol on this.   Quote from: osnk on November 28, 2017, 03:18:05 AM more like a scam project  Yep.  You are correct.  Francesco Simonetti has obviously stolen our money.  Will not communicate.  Kicks anyone he doesn’t like out of Telegram.  RED RED RED FLAG ALERT.   Hey, Francesco Simonetti, when are you going to come clean faggot?  Interpol is coming.  And the SEC, because I’m American and you didn’t screen me.  You sold unregistered securities to an American Citizen.  Oh my.  You have violated the Securities and Exchange act of 1934.  And I didn’t violate anything.  Buying isn’t a crime.  Only selling, promoting, and not doing proper KYC and AML is a crime.  You are a criminal.  Give me my ETH back you fuck.  Or I get 10 times back plus my legal fees in a courtroom.    https://es.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/8613900dab19199f0e12525406306b6f.jpg  Remember the face that took a million dollars and wont communicate our earnings. Because he stole the money.  Let’s never forget that the big marketing tag line of this ICO was “50% profits”.  The reality is, 25% of profits for the public (if this elusive fuck pays) and 75% for Francesco Simonetti.  Let’s never forget how “VOTING” was a big selling point.  But if Francesco Simonetti owns half the tokens, your vote doesn’t mean shit.  Francesco Simonetti issued 50% of the float to HIMSELF.  Francesco Simonetti keeps 75% of the money, and 50% of the vote.  Never forget.  Watch the news.  This is going to be the first big SEC bust of an ICO Scammer.  Because, I know those SEC guys and have been showing them all of this.",True

Lower transactions fees!  Flyp.me, the instant accountless exchange, now supports SegWit for Bitcoin and Litecoin transactions. Flyp.me implemented the SegWit technology to improve the Bitcoin and Litecoin network capacity and reduce the network fees.   What’s SegWit? SegWit makes it possible to rearrange the information in a block, consequently the block size stays the same but contains more information. It makes transaction processing more cost-effective and reduces mining power. As of now, around 10% of all Bitcoin transactions pass in SegWit.

Token allocation between participants vary depending on the amount contributed:  If Soft-Cap is not reached: 50% of FYP to participants, 50% of FYP to Flyp.me If Soft-Cap is reached: 60% of FYP to participants, 40% of FYP to Flyp.me If Hard-Cap is reached: 70% of FYP to participants, 30% of FYP to Flyp.me  Flyp.me is a fully working accountess exchange and the team has an ambitious roadmap. In order to make Flyp.me more sustainable during its evolution, the FYP Tokens assigned to Flyp.me itself are inversely proportional to the participation to the Token sale. In other words, the more contributions to the FYP Tokens sale, the less FYP Tokens are available to Flyp.me. This mechanism and logic, besides making the project more stable and sustainable, will further ignite Flyp.me’s participatory policy-making model.  In this model, each and every FYP will be able to propose new features or coin additions and vote for key decisions. While under the first scenario, Flyp.me has been allocated 50% of FYP, these are being used wisely to ensure the improvement and expansion of the exchange service and that the governance becomes more distributed.",True

The exact wording on page 12 of the whitepaper states ""If the soft-cap is not reached, 50% of FYP tokens will be assigned to Flyp.me and 50% to the contributors"". While page 9 states ""Every three months, the profits will be distributed to FYP Token holders in proportion to their ownership of Tokens.""  So basically, Flyp.me will take 50% of the profits PLUS half the 50% share assigned to token holders (because they own half the tokens).  So effectively, the profit sharing will break down as follows:  Flyp.me: 50% + 25% (half of the 50% share for token holders) = 75% Investors: 25%   As I said, 25% is still good to be honest. It's a lot more profit sharing than 99.99% of other ICOs would ever offer, but I feel a lot of people have invested believing they are getting 50% of the profit share, not 25%.

FLYP.ME is basically securing profits going forward instead of upfront if the ICO revenue doesn't ge to the cap.

What is the ROI of investing in FLYP tokens?  Let's say I invest 1 ETH today, it's kinda low now so 300$.  How much can I expect in month 1, month 2 and so on?    You cannot seriously claim that token holders will get money FOREVER, there is no such thing as ""lifetime support"" for any kind of software or service. This looks too good to be true.   What tends to happen with successful companies is their creator sells them to somebody at some point to cash out and after that it gets rebranded or disappear. In this case I see the likelyhood of the 2nd case, after the ico the exchange can disappear or die as is along with the money we injected into it.  I doubt that this flyp.me is even a company. It's just made by a gyppo like hot blooded kid Francesco whose apparently enjoying the sunshine down in Spain.  So is this a registered Spanish company? How about giving us the VAT number and all other infos before we invest.  As of Holytransaction, their other product it's a river of fail. Don't give us the BS in the whitepaper that it was the FIRST BEST STRONGEST MOST SUCCESSFUL UBER FUCKING ONLINE WALLET of the universe becuase first of all it probably had hundreds of others in the same time, secondly all it was is a phail.  The creators couldn't even afford to pay for an office in Luxembourg or to stay here.  At one point one of their sysadmins emailed all of the customers about HolyTransaction will shut down and they will delete all accounts LOL, whatever userbase they had probably was cut in half because of this (what I srsly doubt that over 1000 active accounts).  I mean storing your money in an exchange is one thing, storing it in an online wallet ?!? WTF is that ever good for. I can only see completely stupid and noob people using online wallets to store their holdings.   https://thumb.ibb.co/m8DiMG/bankerascam.jpg  So just a heads up for all investors, this is BANKERA 2, they most likely want to bank on you   ",True

I am asking what the Revenue/Profit structure will be after the 21st Oct. The reason is, that there are charities non Profit organizations existing, who are actually non Profits but 95% of the donated funds go to luxury real estates and cars, so only 5% are distributed to people in need, but they remain non Profit. Since you will be Holding 50% of the Tokens, you could easily set at any time during the Exchange what % of Revenue will end up as Profit, so that Piece of information is extremely vital and is a projection every Business plan of a Startup must have.",True

You are being transparent and let people know upfront about the hidden costs in every transaction, thus building trust with your future client on a long-term basis, whereas others are clearly out to exploit newcomers to this space.  If used correctly, you can make a clear comparison to Changelly and Shapeshift and show how much cheaper every transaction on flypme truly is.

If OP and flyp.me staff ignore these questions then I would caution anyone from investing here without being very very very cautious.  Quote from: hatuey on October 01, 2017, 01:33:59 PM Quote from: poordeveloper on October 01, 2017, 12:58:47 PM 2 pages before on this thread I asked where they are based on: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1952077.msg22353745#msg22353745  You asked and got some answer. But it was not clear.  https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/YTBRM0zF3c9cUNED0xslDQDtIQI/appointments  Here, you can find HolyTransaction but from the looks and by the definitions of it. Flyp.me is a separate entity right? If it is independent, I haven't been able to locate its registration anywhere.  OR if it isn't independent from HolyTransaction, then wouldn't holytransaction need to be redefined as an exchange itself to avoid legal issues?  There's a few holes in the descriptions here and more information is always welcome when it comes to an ICO.  Quote from: hatuey on October 01, 2017, 11:28:25 AM I would like to see the following information correctly displayed:  1- Flyp.me homepage has nothing to show for investors interested in knowing current levels of investment received. 2- Current staff members that work with Flyp.me (so far only the CEO is listed/employed?) 3- Is Flyp.me registered as a company anywhere? , is it listed on any application with a country to for a licence anywhere? 4- Which developer is responsible for the development and further upgrades of the code? 5- What's the current amount of FYP issued to the public based on all the money received? (since there were bonuses, this number can't be guessed)   As of now this are the most pressing concerns and it would be great if the website was more transparent about these things. Currently FLYP.ME is not transparent about its numbers, staff, or roadmap to the future.   As a point of reference and comparison I'd like to point you to coss.io (notice the difference? - they have all their staff listed, the company is registered and verifiable, and all their references check out. )  I'd love to see the same on FLyp.Me thanks.",True

I'll answer your questions below.  1 - We are working on an update of the homepage to display more information. We already pushed some changes yesterday. During the Presale around 8.5 million FYP Tokens have been created.  The ETH sent through the smart contract is visible on blockchain explorers like etherscan. For the ETH and all other cryptocurrencies sent through the form, the team will need to finalise the data and inject it in the token smart contract. We will provide a link to the token smart contract where anyone could see as the data is uploaded and FYP Tokens are created.    2 - Currently, 6 of us work full time on flyp.me and others are contracted part-time or on a project basis when and if needed. flyp.me is built and managed by the current team at HolyTransaction, the first multi-currency web wallet. The company as been providing its services since 2015. You can find information about the company and its work.  Below are a few articles: - https://cointelegraph.com/news/holytransactions-ceo-explains-new-multicurrency-wallet-features - https://news.bitcoin.com/francesco-simonetti-talks-holytransaction-wallet-supports-multicurrencies/ - https://cointelegraph.es/news/entrevista-a-francesco-simonetti-ceo-de-holytransaction/es - https://news.bitcoin.com/10000-eu-atms-to-cash-out-bitcoin/  In regards to the team specifically working on flyp.me, considering the nature of our business, we don't deem it safe to publish the full list, because this can expose them to personal attacks and possibile corruption from external actors. Privacy and security are key for the team and the platform.  3 - The flyp.me ICO is launched by HolyTransaction LTD. Flyp.me works with different partners depending on the jurisdiction.  4 - The development team is well known. As explained in point 2 we believe for the privacy and security of Flyp.me and its team is better not to disclose that information publicly. The Flyp.me exchange is already working and supporting 78 trading pairs. Also, the Flyp.me API is already available for businesses and developers to accept payments in 13 cryptocurrencies. The code can accessed here https://flyp.me/api  This combined with the knowledge that HolyTransaction is behind this project, we believe should show the level of development.   5 - Please see point 1  The flyp.me roadmap is available in the whitepaper. It's important to point out that Flyp.me is already a fully working exchange with additionally a multicurrency payment API that is already available. The flyp.me ICO is to increase the reserve funds of each cryptocurrency supported, improve the platform, integrate decentralized asset platforms and R&D for 2nd layer solutions.",True

Look forward to reading your whitepaper to understand how these features are implemented.  For #3 though, I recommend changing your language from ""trustless"" to ""minimal trust."" There is still the potential for something to go wrong with your processing system. In that case, the user may not lose the funds, but could face delays and difficulty in getting it resolved. In many cases, payments are time sensitive, therefore this level of trust is not negligible.  Of course, the competition has the same exact issues. That's why a lot of work is being done on interledger protocols with stronger guarantees. They are a ways off still though, so there could be a good window for your product to find traction.",True

Here is the response:  Bitshares was originally trying to get rid of Proof of Work with delegated proof of stake. Additionally, rather than just keeping an IOU ledger of coins, they made it so you can create bitassets. The distribution of dividends from the fees is only limited to delegates that take a cut of your transaction as a fee.  FYP Tokens are using the Ethereum Blockchain to track ownership of Tokens and share part of the profits from the accountless exchange. Flyp.me is designed to enable exchanges with no need to register or to create any account while FYP owners are earning a small percentage as fee from each exchange. 90 days after the end of the ICO, all FYP owner will be able to get the first distribution of their share from the profits.",True

The only info needed to use the exchange is the user’s crypto address so that Flypme has the correct input and output. No trust is needed since Flypme doesn’t hold users’ funds.  In line with its mission of becoming the leading accountless exchange and its value proposition, Flypme has built-in profits sharing mechanisms, adoption-based rewards, permissionless API and participatory policy-making including proposing and voting for new features.  Available immediately, the exchange can be accessed at Flyp.me  Flypme is the brainchild of the current team at HolyTransaction, one of the first multi-currency wallets and the oldest still active. It is built on six main pillars:  •  Uncompromised privacy •  Fastest speed •  50% profits sharing •  Participatory policy-making •  Adoption-based rewards •  Permissionless API   Tokens properties FYP Tokens are ERC20-based Ethereum tokens. Each and every FYP Token is divisible, equal to each other and has exactly the same qualities, properties, and characteristics. After the ICO period will end, no additional FYP tokens will be created.  Each FYP token will equally participate in the profits generated by the Flyp.me’s exchange fees. Owning FYP Tokens will enable the Contributor to also participate in the policy-making of Flypme including proposing new features and voting for key features. More benefits will be disclosed at a later stage.   Pre-Sale and ICO The FYP Tokens are available in two separate rounds divided in phases, the Pre-Sale and the ICO. You will be able to contribute with all the cryptocurrencies supported by Flyp.me.  You can use the Token Sale page or your HolyTransaction Wallet. Otherwise, to prove ownership of the address(es) you sent your funds from, be prepared to sign a message using the private key(s).   Presale Phase I 10th July 2017 (15.00 UTC), +21% bonus, 1 ETH = 4,840 FYP  Presale Phase II 21st July 2017 (15.00 UTC), +15% bonus, 1 ETH = 4,600 FYP  Presale Phase III 6th September 2017 (15.00 UTC), +12.5% bonus, 1 ETH = 4,500 FYP  ICO begins 28th September 2017 (15.00 UTC) +10% bonus before hidden-soft-cap, 1 ETH = 4,400 +5% bonus before hidden-hard-cap, 1 ETH = 4,200 FYP  ICO ends 21 October 2017 (15.00 UTC)  If Hidden-Hard-Cap is reached, the ICO will end 3 (three) hours after the Hidden-Hard-Cap threshold is reached. The exact time for beginning and closing of the ICO period, as for the time of the countdown closing, will be determined in blocks’ numbers of the Ethereum Blockchain. The exact block number for start and end of the ICO will be communicated before the ICO commences. The three-hours countdown when the Hidden-Hard-Cap is reached is counted in 700 blocks.   Soft-Cap is 15000 ETH  Hidden-Hard-Cap will be revealed as soon as it will be reached and will trigger the 3 (three) hours countdown that will definitely end the ICO.   Currencies accepted: BTC, ETH, LTC, DOGE, DASH, FAIR, GAME, DCR, ZEC, SYS, PPC, BLK, GRC   The total (100%) of FYP Tokens created will consist of the Pre-Sale ones + the ICO ones + the ones assigned to the Flyp.me Platform. The percentage of the FYP Tokens assigned to the Flyp.me Platform varies depending on whether the Soft-Cap and Hidden-Hard-Cap are reached by the end of the ICO period.  In order to make the FlypMe Platform more sustainable during its evolution, the FYP Tokens assigned to the Flyp.me Platform and retained by the Platform are inversely proportional to the participation of the Token sale. This means, the more contributions to the FYP Token sales, the less FYP Tokens that will be available to the Flyp.me Platform. This mechanism and logic, besides making the project more stable and sustainable, will ignite a distributed governance model of the Flyp.me Platform. Such model will become more powerful as time passes and the FYP Tokens will be more distributed.   if Soft-Cap is not reached, 50% of the FYP Tokens will be assigned to the Flyp.me Platform and 50% to the contributors. if Soft-Cap is reached but the Hidden-Hard-Cap is not, 40% of the FYP Tokens will be assigned to Flyp.me Platform and 60% to the contributors. If the Hidden-Hard-Cap is reached, 30% of the FYP Tokens will be assigned to the Flyp.me Platform and 70% to the contributors.   Benefits of FYP Tokens 50% of the net profits generated by Flyp.me will be distributed to FYP token owners in proportion to their ownership of tokens.  Owning FYP Tokens will enable the Contributor to also participate in the policy-making of Flyp.me including proposing new features and voting for key decisions. Anyone holding FYP tokens will be able to propose new features. FYP tokens owners with a certain amount of tokens will be able to vote for key decisions. More benefits will be disclosed at a later stage.  Flyp.me will distribute the net profits every three months (aka payout) after the end of the ICO. Following the first two payouts, the timing of the payout will be voted by the token owners in line with our commitment to participatory policy-making.    Flyp.me      ICO Distribution _____________________________________________________________________________   Benefits of Token 50% of the net profits generated by Flyp.me will be distributed to FYP token owners in proportion to their ownership of tokens. Proposing new features and voting for key decisions.  Symbol FYP  Ratio During the Pre-Sale, FYP Tokens will be offered with a preferred ratio. Same ratio applies to HolyTransaction’s users registered on the wallet.  For Sale When the Hidden-Hard-Cap is reached, the ICO will end 3 (three) hours after it.  Emission Rate No new tokens will be created.  ICO Period 28th September 2017 15:00 UTC to 21st October 2017 15:00 UTC   Soft Cap 15000 ETH  Hard Cap Hidden-Hard-Cap will be revealed as soon as it is reached and will trigger the 3 (three) hours countdown that will definitely end the ICO.
