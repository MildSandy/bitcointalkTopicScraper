Here's how we'll do it...  We're going to start by tokenizing our ecommerce store. If you consider yourself a savvy online shopper, you're going to love Xirkle's new loyalty rewards shopping program. In addition to our loyalty points system, we'll also reward fractional XIR tokens to shoppers for holding XIR tokens in their Xirkle store account. Going forward, you can earn regular reward points and fractional XIR tokens for simply shopping on our upcoming Xirkle store. Your reward points are redeemable for discounts off your purchase at checkout. Our fractional token reward component is currently in an minimum viable product (MVP) release, which has room for more improvements.  Within our ecosystem, Xirkle (XIR) is currently a non-security digital token, which was based upon the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) via the federated Byzantine agreement and created exclusively for ecommerce or financial transactions on Xirkle Store and/or its offline and online entities or services. The true value of XIR coin is completely market driven and we do not know if and when its prices will go up or down at any given time.  Going forward, Xirkle (XIR) tokens may serve as a generally accepted all-purpose crypto token for daily usage via other websites, apps, and its corresponding digital products or services on community chat, social media, and online or offline payments. XIR will also serve as a transactional element within the Xirkle systems and/or other digital channels.  Learn more: https://xir.xirkle.com/why-xirkle/  Why is Xirkle (XIR) unique for shoppers and investors?  In a 2016-2017 ecommerce studies, Baymard Institute* concluded that the average shopping cart abandonment rate was 69.23% across 37 different studies. It revealed that most online customers abandoned their shopping carts because of extra high fees (S&H), shopping cart complexity, and account creation requirements. When we combined these elements, it represents a challenging experience for online customers and a loss of revenue for businesses. To curtail those recurring issues, a crypto coin called Xirkle (XIR) will be introduced to customers as an optional form of payment for products and/or services, which acts as a mechanism to incentivize and tokenize their shopping experience. Those findings allowed Xirkle to identify five methods for the acquisition and retention of customers, while increasing customer loyalty and reducing rate of attrition or churn rate. In this analysis, we’ll look at the following five methods: tokenized loyalty reward points system, tokenized ecommerce store, tokenized fractional rewards on non-zero balance, tokenized account sign-up & referrals, and proactive end-to-end shopping incentives (i.e. cart alerts, soft email).

Answer: The store is undergoing a redesign and will be available TBD 2019.  Question: Do you offer free shipping? Answer: Yes, we're currently offering 3-day free shipping to most US states.  Question: Are you an Amazon or other ecommerce websites affiliate? Answer: No, we're not an affiliate of any ecommerce websites. All orders are shipped from six warehouses throughout the USA and Canada.  Question: What type of payment options do you accept? Answer: We're currently accepting MasterCard, Visa, American Express, and Bitcoin. XIR coins will be accepted in a future release.  Question: What's the return policy on Xirkle store? Answer: We have a 30-day return policy. After 30 days from the date of your purchase, we can’t offer you a refund or exchange.  Question: What other products are you planning to add to Xirkle store? Answer: We love natural and organic consumer products. With this said, we're planning to add those curated organic items soon.  Question: Xirkle store looks like a direct competitor of Amazon and other ecommerce stores. Are you competing in that space? Answer: We think Amazon is a great company; however, our main goal is to redefine legacy loyalty rewards program. Our vision is to offer reasonably priced consumer products, while rewarding online shoppers for their purchases with rewards points and our upcoming fractional XIR token. Over time, those XIR tokens within a shopper's account will earn a fixed monthly ""interests or dividends"" on non-zero balances. After its release, most customers will be able to buy products directly on Xirkle store without ever touching their credit cards. Customers can simply use XIR tokens at checkout.  Question: If crypto currencies were meant to be a decentralized peer-to-peer payment system, why is your Xirkle store centralized? Answer: Arguably, crypto currencies are highly technical and generally geared toward investors and/or speculators. We believe there is a missing bridge between mass adoption and general usage under one world economy. Crypto currencies might help bridge that usage gap and we've decided to build that bridge for all.",False

Ecommerce is one of the major drivers of online transactions globally. It's time for online shoppers to get a piece of the pie too!

Generally, we're doing basic press releases regarding our 1st airdrop, and now, we're doing another airdrop for Bitcoin holders. https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/18/04/r11470390/xirkle-xir-announces-1-000-000-crypto-coins-airdrop-for-bitcoin-btc-ho  Currently, we're focusing on completing our XIR coin integration into our Shopify store for all of our products. After this, we'll also release a public Shopify app, which will allow all 300K+ Shopify store owners to accept XIR coin as an optional form of payment to credit cards.  Shopify and its store owners might be the ideal platform for project Xirkle. Ultimately, we want to encourage the usage of crypto coins on all ecommerce stores, while incentivizing users with fractional loyalty rewards such as our XIR coins.   ",False
