Read more in  Whitepaper  And watch our presentation video on YouTube !   Every day we produce a lot of different content: articles, photos, audio, video, 3D models, etc. We want to know and give an opportunity to show who owns it. In our work we faced the lack of simple ways to determine the content ownership. There is no independent, decentralized, universal system for certifying, evaluating and identifying your intellectual property. In cooperation with the news agency NEWS1.ru, we are developing a certification platform ""POST"" based on the best Russian and Western intellectual property protection practices, we will use the technology of distributed registries (blockchain) to certify the ownership of any type of digital content. The main purpose of NEWS is to certify rights for digital content. Our goal is to create a decentralized platform for verification and content processing based on the NEWS crypto token. We enlisted the support of major news agencies in testing and using our technology after the ICO. The number of partners of the ""POST"" verification platform is constantly growing. The list of organizations, which will test and use our platform after ICO includes: 1) Laboratory of Experimental Economics CEMI RSSI 2) National Institute of Business 3) A.I.
