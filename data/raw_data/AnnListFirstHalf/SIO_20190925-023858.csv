I have solid experience in managing of big projects.  There are two goals in project management:  1. To perform assigned tasks with a high quality and meet deadlines. 2. To provide investors with well-timed payments of dividends.  Next week we will release a video review, where I will personally tell you more about our vision of the work and the problems that we solve.  We have a great team of professionals, and there are some more people who are ready to join us after we get the right amount of financing.  Our first client who ordered ICO is a mining company with the prominent name ""4KMining"". We will release the complete Whitepaper in the next few days, where we will outline all the main points of this great project. 4KMining have amazing inventions, which we simply have to scale within the framework of a large mining farm. We will show you the photos of pilot projects, the team, the calculations and provide you with a link to the mining pool where you can see the result of the test rig operation in real time environment. Also, if you want to learn more about it, we will hold a webinar in cooperation with 4KMining to answer any questions, including technical ones with great pleasure.  We have a lot of such clients, but unfortunately, due to the limited funds, we can provide services for only one customer at a time. In case of having sufficient funds, we will be able to process all the projects that send us requests for the help with the ICO arrangement.  Each week we get 20-30 applications for ICO, and the number of them is growing day by day.  We are always ready to answer any questions both on the forum and personally, as we have the office in Moscow.",False
