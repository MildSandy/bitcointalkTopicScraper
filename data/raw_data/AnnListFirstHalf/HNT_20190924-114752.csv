Establish trust network to bust your business credibility.   1.   Introduction Social media it is a new technology, but  will grow, expand and penetrate dipper the market, as poor countries will develop. Right now the overdose of information which flow through social media is overwhelming. Social Media exists and grows. It is an interesting market with the great potential. Currently, data science is being used to reduce the cost of advertising, but unfortunately also at the expense of privacy, creating dangerous predictive capabilities and controlling the behaviour of the entire group, and above all the user in front of the computer, taking his time to activities he had not previously planned to do. Our data is a property owned by us, and our contacts and business connections are at our disposal, but we are giving them away for free, very often even paying for it. True social media such as viral marketing are limited by artificial technological processes and filters, so that the customer must advertise the idea or product through their information system. In turn their template way of transmitting information is extremely ineffective and even partially blocked in turn by private user software. This lack of idea to monetize user activity, rather than encouraging this activity (advertising), is an antisocial element and problem in the business model. A solution to this is Honestis network, restoring the social aspect of social media, giving users privacy and full freedom of mind, that kind of social media functionality will be used. Facilitated and fully accessible natural virals and social activity, building business relationships in a more professional and balanced acceptable way. At the same time having 1 account you can have totally different professional, social and political activity and be perceived as we want by the relevant audience. The intuitive, fast operation and activation of filters, encrusted and personalized business cards offer a number of new possibilities -they are more natural to people and, thanks to their multidimensional nature, they will make contacts easier for users with multidimensional relationships. Trust, respect and transparency with increased security of ourselves and our transactions.
