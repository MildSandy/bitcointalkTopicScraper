These charlatans are most likely looking to launch another ICO with that Encry token, hence why they kept it hidden from the community. The work on that project has started in January.

Is there some one believe that they would be able to get listed in any kind of serious exchange after all these shit ?? I do not. But in the same time do want to loose my money.

We give them time to spend our money, therefore I suggest that everyone also gather and address Sasha Ivan about the return of funds!

There are still ETH investors who haven't claimed their initial investment so I really don't see what the issue is on that.  There are still some key issues that need to be addressed by the team, like major exchange & buy wall, better communication through all channels, the bonus offered to those who hodl through the initial problems, even if they weren't totally the fault of ETT team, and possibly some I missed.

As a result, a re-issue is no longer necessary. 3. The blockswap has been entirely removed from the system. For the moment there is no blockswap solution. 4. Several teams are working on their own. We will reach out and come to an agreement on their use. 5. Investor distribution is essentially ""done"". The quotes are because there are still a dozen tickets in, and another 5 or 6% of investors still have not entered in a withdraw address, or logged on, since end of sale. 6. Bounty distribution will begin later this week. 7.

Secondly, there's a huge difference between a person/account being hacked and a platform being hacked.

As CEO, however, I understand just a ‘thank you’ is not enough, and so would like to reassure you that there will be a bonus for every investor who still holds our tokens. We are naturally keen to resolve all these problems as soon as possible.  Development Our long-term investors do not need to worry about our product timeline. Everything is going according to plan in our roadmap. Very soon you will be able to see the look and feel of our new Investor dashboard, as well as various other exciting updates.  Starting from 10 July many of our new developers will start in our office, at which point we will make a video for our investors to see where we are working.  Waves tokens Since the majority of Waves assets are safe, and the loss will not be borne by investors, you do not need to do anything.  Ethereum tokens Holders who have the Ethereum asset should simply wait and hold their ETT. We will post further instructions shortly.  Sincerely,  Roman Nekrasov, CEO of EncryptoTel  More information is coming tomorrow.",False

The whole ico is one big disaster! Changing plans while sale is ongoing. The ico platform is total garbage. Sometimes we were able to see our ETT amount sometimes not. Sometimes even login was not possible. 2fa was only possible right before the withdrawal and never worked for us. We got the mail with the 2fa code 2 days (YES 2 DAYS) later, i call this bs.  They have to do the withdrawals manually, really?? I guess there are still some investors waiting for their coins, holy.....  I guess the ico plattform is from another provider, but if you want to act as professional you have to be careful which partner you choose. We are a proffesional IT company and if we choose a bad partner with whom we realize projects it is 100% our fault.  Therefore we will never sell or recommend the ETT solution to our customers as planned.  Last i have to say, i'm in crypto since 2012 and we invested in quite some icos. Most of the time we hold the coins for years (SYS for example). Maybe this token will be worth a lot sometimes in future (in crypto you never know) but we just don't care because we don't support such amateurish nonsense.  Anyway, i wish all those who believe in the project good luck and i hope we can get out ASAP, even with a loss  Cheers",False

Quote from: EncryptoTel_Community on June 07, 2017, 05:04:55 PM Hello everyone, an update on recent days, and answers to some questions is below:  1. The display issue is still there. Your funds are safe. They are on the blockchain, which first and foremost is an immutable ledger. 2. Notification is not currently working. So please run through the withdraw setup process once and save your address. Please do not do this multiple times if you can avoid it. 3. If you entered in a wrong address, you can run through the process again to change it, then save it. If you are still in doubt contact us in slack or telegram, and email support@encryptotel.com 4. Withdraws are being done manually for now, to make sure everything is working properly. We are being extra cautious. Thank you for understanding. 5. Withdraws are direct from the blockchain data, not from the broken display. If you feel something is off, feel free to contact us in slack or telegram, or email support@encryptotel.com. We're here to help you. 6. The ETT token exists on both the ETH and Waves blockchain at the same time. It's just one total of tokens, you do not add them together. 7. The Incent bonus is not forgotten, it will be sent out to the same addresses you enter for ETT withdraw. Incent is also a ETH and Waves capable token. It exists on both chains. 8. If you have any questions you can ask them here, but you may get answer faster in slack or telegram. 9. Thank you for your continued patience throughout this process.",False

The very fact they got more investment than their quite frankly modest original asking amount is in my opinion a great thing. It shows people are very interested in the tech they are offering.  Personally I thought the target amount of $3M was too low and the cap had very little bearing on my investment. In fact I was somewhat worried with only $3M they would not have enough to pull off their goals. Although I understand this might not have been the case for some investors.  Encryptotel could easily turn into a $45M+ company or they could go bust. That is (ad)venture capitalism. But I really don't see how them raising more money than they originally asked for is detrimental to investors.,False

If I get back 50% of my ICO investment I will consider myself lucky.  If they had no cap and raised 4.4 million instead of 3 million that would be great but a lot of the money they received was specifically because there was a $3m cap...  Quote from: FandangledGizmo on April 25, 2017, 08:12:16 PM I don't invest in too many ICO's because even if they're good, if they trade quickly and don't have any major developments between ICO finishing and trading you can often pick them for less at the start of trading.  However in this case, there is cap of $3 million which I think will be easily reached thereby creating demand from those that missed out which should mean it will be very unlikely that you will be able to pick up shares any cheaper than now in this good project.  How can serious investors ever trust this project after they changed the key term you need to trust when investing in a project?    How can serious customers ever trust their product for an encrypted phone call? (Part of it is closed source to start I believe) knowing that they sold out their own investors?

We would like to take this opportunity to say a very big ‘thank you’ to all of our supporters for making this project possible.  The EncryptoTel crowdsale is over! The generosity of our investors and some extremely favourable market conditions have meant that we hit our $3 million cap before the formal end of the crowdsale.  Demand for ETT proved overwhelming, and we are extremely grateful for all the support the community have shown us. In the coming weeks and months, we look forward to rewarding your commitment to us by working hard and disrupting a sector we believe blockchain technology has much to offer.  The next step is a thorough audit of all deposits made during the course of the crowdsale, before the EncryptoTel Token is created on the Waves and Ethereum blockchains. You will appreciate that, as a one-off event, this is something that must be done right and can consequently take some time as the required checks are undertaken.  Once this has been completed, investors will be able to withdraw their tokens from their crowdsale accounts. As a Waves token, ETT will immediately be available to trade on DEX, as well as Ethereum’s decentralised exchange. If you missed out on the crowdsale or were hoping to pick up more ETT, these are the best places to buy in the short term. We’ll be looking for further exchange partners and hope to announce additional listings as soon as possible.  The cryptocurrency markets are extremely volatile at the moment, with BTC, WAVES, ETH and ETC experiencing significant movements in price. Due to this factor, it’s likely that the dollar equivalent of the funds collected will fluctuate above and below the $3m mark.

Right now it's a private gitlab, portions will be opened like softphones and blockchain based services.

We are planning to go to market initially by integrating through more crypto-centric companies. We expect to integrate our solution in wallets like Waves first and foremost. Of course we want to expand to all markets, though it is impossible to predict the market share of our company initially, in part because it is one of the fastest growing markets in the world.

Good project.  I don't invest in too many ICO's because even if they're good, if they trade quickly and don't have any major developments between ICO finishing and trading you can often pick them for less at the start of trading.  However in this case, there is cap of $3 million which I think will be easily reached thereby creating demand from those that missed out which should mean it will be very unlikely that you will be able to pick up shares any cheaper than now in this good project.   You should also maybe put the $3 million CAP on the website, because it currently says ICO ends 31st May with no indication it could end sooner.

ETT will be ERC20 compliant, meaning that it meets the standards to be traded on the Ethereum blockchain.

In addition, i feel that those that are on WavesPlatform shouldn't be left out of this. i would like to see WavesPlatform and all those who are part of it rise up together in full force. Not one without the others.  No payment is required. Also, all images used below are CC0 (Creative Commons) a.k.a. free for public use. Mostly from Pixabay.com and Dreamstime.com. And a few of my own. So rest assured  I only asked that you allow me to leave a logo of WAVES in the image you see below and a link to WavesPlatform website and to its recap as well. As you can see, you will not find any other cryptocurrencies here except yours and WAVES. This is done so as to respect your space and the community's attention. for the other cryptocurrencies as well.  if you feel the recap is good enough, you are free to share & tweet the 'Recap"" image below. Remember to add the link above this message to the tweet. whoever clicks on it will be directed to this recap. the link is just above this message, just above where the date is. that link. a small request, add 3 hashtags to your tweets ""#wavesplatform #ico #crowdfund"" if you can. Thank you. For the community, please liked it or retweet it as well.  If you want to ensure that all news and activities are to be included into this recap, be sure to tweet it or blog it. If, however, there are no news for the entire week, i will not post any recap. So be sure to have at least one. news and activities are only inclusive of new information. old, duplicated or repeated ones will be excluded from the recap. However, do not trouble yourself about re-posting an old news. I will be able to find out if its new or not. So leave the work to me. =)  If you only a few news now, it's alright. this recap is not meant to put to shame. But in the future, you can rest assured that i will be covering those many news. If it takes months to build a house, then it will take months. If it takes hours to bake a cake, then so shall it be. Hope everyone understands this.  Thank you and enjoy the recap.    Ride on WAVES!       Last Updated on: 4th April 2017 This is the 1st recap that 'yoyoamigo' has done for Encryptotel. There is no previous recap. The next recap is out!
