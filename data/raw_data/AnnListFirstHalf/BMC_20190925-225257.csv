I think it is the only crypto compared to Melonport and Iconomi that offers a a reserve for token buyout.Very good option to have, but I don't think we will be needing it. Call me optimistic. No but seriously, solid company, and more than making the big buck. I am really excited about their platform. That is what is really exciting, to see something new and fresh. I wish I was there for their unveiling of The Black Moon Lending Marketplace Version 2.0 in New York this year.  I am curious what other roles will be on the platform besides the ones stated on the White Paper. I'm guessing the higher the role the more BMC tokens you will be needing, well I am glad that they will be adding more roles as the platforms demand gains more attention and more expansion is needed. I guess more and more divisions will be created with time. Time will tell. In the mean time anyone who wants to really know more. I always recommend read the whitepaper, it may be a paper but it is a very essential paper with a clear vision in mind. And the difference you ask, well this is one of the very few crypto's that already have experience in this space, they have a portfolio that shows growth of their company since Quarter 3 2014. The team is superb. You have some big partners like Deloitte and Flint Capital just to mention a few, which all by itself says a lot. Overall this crypto hits all the marks for a 5 star rating. But have a look at the whitepaper and you will see for yourself.  Thanks.",False

Only 20% of tokens go to team and creators. 50% to public and the other 30% goes to a 24 months reserve (""downside protection""). At the end of 24 months the amount of this reserve, of course the amount unused, goes to the platform for new developments.  Downside Protection allows token holders to sell their tokens back to Blackmoon Crypto if the price goes down. This protects contributors from potential dumps and decline in the price of BMC token. As said before, this offer is active for 24 months from the end of the token distribution period. The company will allocate 30% of the crowdsale as a reserve for this. The buyback is set at 80% of the initial Distribution Rate.  In other words, should the price go down below $0.8, Blackmoon Crypto will step in to buy back the tokens at $0.8 from anyone willing to sell. This will protect investors from potential dumps in the market..

I wanted a company with some sorta track record or background already, and then came Black Moon Crypto. I was just watching the video Black Moon Crypto Posted on Twitter, I recommend everyone to watch it. One of the things they spoke about is High frequency trading and multi currency trading, these are 2 parts that can, and will create substantial demand, that were not available before and now are with the addition to crypto this makes for a much more complex market. Black Moon Crypto is looking to break that barrier that separates the 2 markets, more liquidity will be produced. This technology should be fairly quickly adopted provided people get the education they need to understand new markets and how it will fluctuate differently than most traditional assets.

The minimum limit will be mostly applicable to Investment Advisors. Anyway the majority of roles won’t have a minimum deposit limit.  The list of available roles will be publicly available on the blackmooncrypto.com website and updated as needed to reflect the current needs of the Platform’s continuous development. One of the main roles will be that of an investment Advisor. Other roles will be Platform promoters, investment analysts, legal advisors, public auditors, GR advisors, etc.  Just for a complete information: to be qualified as an investment advisor on the Blackmoon Crypto Platform, an asset manager must (a) contribute to the company and (b) hold a specified number of BMC tokens in a depository account. The amounts of the contribution and deposit will be case specific, but generally vary from 10,000 to 1,000,000 BMCs. This increases the level of partnership responsibility for the investment advisor on the Blackmoon Crypto Platform and is the final step of the qualification process. Another benefit of this level of participation and partnership with the investment advisors is that it forms a foundation for future self-regulation of the system.",False

There is a section I find to be of a lot of importance. Black Moons Eco System is unique in the sense that it uses these 4 components to run the system fluidly. There are four parts. and I have split them into 2 groups  1)Specialized Players and Scalers 2) Market Movers and Broadeners  So from what I understand the Specialized Players contribute to the crypto ecosystem but are limited to only offer one option/fund to it's users, this is still a function within the ecosystem which does scale internally. Scalers look within the ecosystem as well to take advantage of the existing approaches within the already available resources.  In contrast the Market movers can offer more options to it's investors and drive in more diverse portfolio. And finally you have our Broadeners which use existing solutions to offer a very broad range of opportunities , like Pegged cryptocurrencies and and venture capital funds, commodities.  As you can see the Specialized Players and Scalers work more within the platform and Eco-system whereas the Market Movers and Broadeners are driving in more liquidity and diversification. This mix and match of both is exactly the concept that Black Moon Crypto is trying to achieve from my understanding, that very liquidity of transactions between Crypto and Traditional Assets. I feel that with this system in place Black Moon Crypto will have a lot to offer to it's investors.  In Comparison to many other crypto looking to achieve the similar goal, Black Moon Crypto has many features that other platforms do not. For example Access to Fiat Funds and Reserves for Token Buyout  I myself want to actually use the platform to build my own investment portfolio and perhaps get back into the field I use to be in. From the looks of it The platform should be easy to work with, I look forward with mixed both new and old markets to see the capabilities of the platform and understand how to use it's tools to it's full potential and build a portfolio that generates wealth for me and others. This Crypto has taken their vision and only expanded over the years growing increasingly, it was worth it to have a closer look and see where Black Moon has come from and where they are headed with this changing economy. They have adopted quite quickly considering the rapid growth in such a short time frame. Taking into account that their start was in the Quarter 3 of 2014 and they have only seen growth since then. I think that goes to show you that this team as a whole is a very serious unit and has already shown their capacity to deliver on their word to investors.  There is ample information on their website and whitepaper and I encourage anyone who is interested in this crypto to take the time out and read the whole whitepaper you will get involved in it.

Now this is a discussion that could lead to many different outcomes. The laws in the States are actually quite relaxed compared to those of China, now since China is setting an example this could influence other countries to follow because of one reason. And that is that this entire system is new to every country and rather than one country working alone on tackling this new market , they might be a few countries that team up and join China. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing all it means is that ICO's might be delayed and reviewed before they are able to have a crowd sale. Some aspects of the freedom of running a crowd sale may be limited however in order to have a more fair investment opportunity, at least that is what I think in my opinion. Black Moon Crypto is different in the sense that, like stated before they are more familiar with the legalities as well, so they definitely have a upper hand over other ICO's. Another important factor that many Governments and Financial Security Institutions look into in the stock market when presenting a IPO is a good backing in their portfolio, which Black Moon Crypto has, and a great IPO structure. In This case Black Moon Crypto has a great ICO structure which is the equivalent of a IPO in the stock market. They both help fuel the liquidity in a Company or in this case Crypto to grow even further. You could also compare a Stock's (Shares) to a Crypto's (Coins).  These are just some of my observations.

That limits the ability of U.S., Singapore, PRC persons to utilize BMC tokens and participate in the future development of the Platform as well as in the distribution of proceeds.  At the moment there not seems to be particular problems for US investors, but for now probably Blackmoon do not want to take these risks.  Anyway, based on legal advice and opinions gathered by the company during the preparation process, BMC tokens will not fall under the current notion of securities by SEC based on the famous Howey test. Anyway Blackmoon pays a lot of attention to that matter and is in continuous communications with US attorneys while formalizing its position.  Here is the abstract from the opinion:  ""we believe that current iteration of the BMC White Paper describes a digital token that is not likely to be deemed a security under applicable US laws. We understand that the White Paper may be revised further and recommend that the final BMC token should be structured as follows:  (i) only those holders of BMC tokens should receive compensation from their tokens who are actively using their computational resources, investment advisory competences, and other individual skills and capabilities to enable performance of the BMC tokenized investment vehicles network;  (ii) holders of BMC tokens should receive rights to earn future income by active participation and should not receive an expectation or right to receive passive income; and  (iii) holders of BMC tokens should have a reasonable degree of control / participation over the operations and direction of the BMC tokenized investment vehicles network.""  It is just a precaution because the regulatory uncertainty.

Here is what I find interesting , The Fund Administrative tool is so amazing, it allows you to first of all track all your assets and organize them. Now this tool is primarily designed for investment fund managers and advisors, but this tool could also be used to turn ""yourself"" into a Asset manager, that is what this decentralized world allows you to do and through the Black Moon Crypto Channel you will have all the guidelines to go through all the legalities if you so choose. That flexibility is very important for the platform to gain momentum. The platform also allows you to set up and open up your bank account, and structure how the tokenized funds will be distributed amongst investors.  The Second tool that Black Moon Crypto Utilizes in the Token Holder's Analytical and Management Interface. Think of this as a Trading platform that consists of all your Assets , Currencies, Perhaps Commodities and other investments. This platform allows the Fund investors themselves , example you or me to create our portfolio as we see fit by using the tools provided within the platform itself. Allows users to pick and choose which assets they would like to add to their portfolio and track the performance of your assets. This way you can make well informed decisions on how to distribute your funds within the platform and maximize your wealth over time. I say wealth because that is what Black Moon Crypto is helping Investors to achieve. There is a lot more to dig into , and there will be more products I am guessing added to their pipeline. I love that the team is always well informed in these areas as it is essential when producing such a high end product.

Here is the abstract of the opinion they received:  Quote Based on the above analysis, we believe that current iteration of the BMC White Paper describes a digital token that is not likely to be deemed a security under applicable US laws. We understand that the White Paper may be revised further and recommend that the final BMC token should be structured as follows:  (i) only those holders of BMC tokens should receive compensation from their tokens who are actively using their computational resources, investment advisory competences, and other individual skills and capabilities to enable performance of the BMC tokenized investment vehicles network;  (ii) holders of BMC tokens should receive rights to earn future income by active participation and should not receive an expectation or right to receive passive income; and  (iii) holders of BMC tokens should have a reasonable degree of control / participation over the operations and direction of the BMC tokenized investment vehicles network.",False

I myself was a asset manager a few years back. And I must say we tend to struggle a lot more than we would like to. preparing the right investment fund is not a joke. Especially when your dealing with something you know is a long term investment. Black Moon has really taken it upon themselves to take this mission and conquer it, or I should say decentralize it! Which is exactly what they plan to do. Tokenizing investment fund was inevitable. For Black Moon to catch this idea at its brink is very ingenious. I believe with the way the crypto markets are going, many newcomers will need a solid platform to guide them in this new crypto economy, and shuffling between commodities, stocks, bonds, and god knows what else. Black Moon seems to be a very rewarding and useful platform to allow people to manage their funds in the most profitable way for them, allowing them access to the latest news and current events. You become your own manager, that was the way our economic system was meant to be. But we finally are at the stage where we can make use of blockchain technology. Since Black Moon will be running on the ethereum blockchain this provides asset investors with the security they need as well. So you have your Data, Speed, Security, Analysis all in front of you all tokenized easily trad- able and easily manageable. The future has bright things waiting for Black Moon Crypto Currency, so don't miss out on something that has a solid project and that knows what they are doing. You can see the quality in their work right away from the details on their whitepaper and all the time they have spend in this space. Lets gain knowledge contribute and be proactive in this new economic stance.   One of the biggest advantage of Black Moon is their targeting the best of both worlds. Well what does that mean? Access to fiat currencies not only allows for diversification in terms of value resources and you can still keep all the benefits of being part of the crypto asset world. So while merging or rather transacting only with one type or form of currency, this allows you to take advantage of any fiat currencies as well. It is always good to have more than less correct? well Black Moon is all about that it seems. Giving the manager more options allows for more freedom and transparency in the space. So now asset managers can provide their clientele both fiat and crypto assets as a part of their portfolio. This opens up new doors to the whole world. Plane and simple, this way both crypto investors and fiat investors both benefit from either or economic outlook, whether it be fiat or crypto. The flexibility between fiat and crypto is the key for Black Moon, this is one crypto that invites people who have fiat to come on down, because Black Moon as something for everyone, ultimately leading to a very amazing platform that can sustain wealth for all likes of investments.   I wish the team all the best in their project and I look forward to being a part of Black Moon Crypto.

Whitepaper states: 1) ""Continuous Contributors shall from time to time confirm the execution of their roles on the Platform to keep their status and depository wallets active. ""  Given that both CC roles&figures and required engagement/KPIs haven't been detailed yet, there's a clear issue evaluating this project's demands. What is the general demographic that the Blackmoon project is geared towards?  1) Fulltime Crypto investors and crypto believers, therefore the requested engagement/KPIs are generally high. 2) Mixed demographic, therefore requiring different rates of engagement/KPIs, but also allowing for quite low demands.  Furthermore, are Continuos Contributors KPI evaluated on single funds' specific regulation, or as a whole for the entire BlackMoon platform?  Personally, I believe that the Crypto market could thrive from opening itself onto larger demographics, simplifying its mechanics and allowing for a wider engagement from students and other classes of normal citizens. Depending on the general required engagement/KPI to ""confirm one's execution of a role"", this project could either allow for a larger crowd or a selected niche.  This point is quite important, considering that whitepaper states: ""Continuous Contributors who do not execute their roles may have their status recalled, depository wallet closed, and their deposited BMCs will be transferred to the holder’s personal wallet without accruing any proceeds.""  Illness, holidays, workplace demands can take anyone away from their CC role in this project. Without enforcing the normal employment legislation, contributors could be identified as volunteers and be susceptible of losing their accrued proceeding.  I clearly understand that this project focuses a lot onto users' engagement, creating a community led to work together for a mutually shared gain; and it's totally fine that specific roles with higher KPI may get larger proceedings; yet I believe that enforcing high KPI roles, will destically limit this project's demographics.  If CC roles could allow for normal bounty roles as detailed in the bounty section, this project could attract a larger demographic.  So, overall, is there an official consensus if the Continuous Contributors' roles are geared towards extremely high engagement, or they allow for a mixed demographic with various and limited time to invest?",False

We'd like both average and professional token holders to find a role that matches their abilities. I understand that it's a quite high level description but that's what we really want to achieve. Demographics shall be wide and not limited by any specific parameters.  Quote 1) Fulltime Crypto investors and crypto believers, therefore the requested engagement/KPIs are generally high. 2) Mixed demographic, therefore requiring different rates of engagement/KPIs, but also allowing for quite low demands.  2) is what we are looking for.  Quote Furthermore, are Continuos Contributors KPI evaluated on single funds' specific regulation, or as a whole for the entire BlackMoon platform?   Continuous contributors concept was introduced to help us to develop the entire platform. So it will be associated with the platform itself or all/every fund on the platform. We'll also ask for help regarding specific funds which will be starting at particular moments.  Quote Personally, I believe that the Crypto market could thrive from opening itself onto larger demographics, simplifying its mechanics and allowing for a wider engagement from students and other classes of normal citizens. Depending on the general required engagement/KPI to ""confirm one's execution of a role"", this project could either allow for a larger crowd or a selected niche.  We need as large active community as we can make.  Quote This point is quite important, considering that whitepaper states: ""Continuous Contributors who do not execute their roles may have their status recalled, depository wallet closed, and their deposited BMCs will be transferred to the holder’s personal wallet without accruing any proceeds.""  Illness, holidays, workplace demands can take anyone away from their CC role in this project. Without enforcing the normal employment legislation, contributors could be identified as volunteers and be susceptible of losing their accrued proceeding.  For us it's important that CCs will be active. But when we wrote about inactivity we kept in mind something like a moths of absence of target actions.  Quote I clearly understand that this project focuses a lot onto users' engagement, creating a community led to work together for a mutually shared gain; and it's totally fine that specific roles with higher KPI may get larger proceedings; yet I believe that enforcing high KPI roles, will destically limit this project's demographics.  What we want - an active happy community working together within transparent environment What we don't want - unnecessary barriers for people to participate.  Quote If CC roles could allow for normal bounty roles as detailed in the bounty section, this project could attract a larger demographic.  When I explain that concept in ""I'm five"" paradigm I tell people that they can consider it as a perpetual bounty. So yes.   Quote So, overall, is there an official consensus if the Continuous Contributors' roles are geared towards extremely high engagement, or they allow for a mixed demographic with various and limited time to invest? I hope I answered on that above.  Would be happy if you join us at https://account.blackmooncrypto.com",False

Short answer - the second.  During 7 days after the end of the ICO (the earlier of October 11th or the date when the cap is reached), we will deploy the smart contract that will translate the balance of the proceeds from the crowd sale and translate it into BMC balance. So you get your BMC on rate fixed after ICO.",False

Downside Protection allows token holders to sell their tokens back to Blackmoon Crypto if the price goes down. This protects contributors from potential dumps and decline in the price of BMC token. This offer is active for 24 months from the end of the token distribution period. The company will allocate 30% of the crowdsale as a reserve for this. Effectively it is a put option granted to the token holders by the company.  How does it work?  Blackmoon Crypto will put aside 30% of all funds raised in the crowdsale. These funds cannot be used for the next 24 months for any purpose other than the buy-back of BMC tokens. The buyback is set at 80% of the initial Distribution Rate.To put it simply, holders of BMC tokens, who are willing to sell their tokens in the next two years, could do so at $0.8 per token. Blackmoon Crypto will buy back these tokens using the reserve created after the crowdsale. All purchased BMC tokens, if any, become the property of the company.  In other words, should the price go down below $0.8, Blackmoon Crypto will step in to buy back the tokens at $0.8 from anyone willing to sell. This will protect investors from potential dumps in the market and also serves as our vote of confidence in our solution.  Transparency of the reserve  The reserve will be created from the proceeds of the crowdsale and stored in the diversified portfolio of major cryptocurrencies. The information on this portfolio will be publicly available on our website to provide investors up to date information on its value and structure.  The reserve will be held for 24 months. After that, the funds will be returned back to the company to fuel its development.  The defensive nature of the BMC token  BMC tokens receive proceeds from the funds that operate on the platform. Thanks to the wide variety of investment funds with different investment objectives on the platform, such proceeds will be highly diversified, since the funds will invest in both crypto and traditional assets. Because of this underlying value, BMC token is considered to be a defensive asset, resilient to the declines in the crypto market.

Recently we received a number of requests from our community regarding our security policies. It is no news, that some blockchain crowdsale projects have faced hackers’ attacks. These attacks resulted in temporary disruption of the fundraisings and sometimes in stolen money. The goal of these attacks was to change the project’s wallet addresses to the those in possession of the intruders. This could be achieved by:  DNS phishing or ownership transfer. The operation when hacker funnels the users to the website under her control. Content phishing. Hacking the project’s server to substitute the website contents. DDoS (distributed denial of service). Inability to access target website.  We address these challenges by investing time and money into proper infrastructure because we don’t think that this is the area to cut corners and pinch pennies.  High-end Amazon infrastructure  We use industry-grade high-performance Amazon DNS servers. It is highly unlikely that hackers would be capable to perform a successful DDoS attack on the Amazon infrastructure. The cost for such an attack would be prohibitively high.  All our domains have explicitly switched off transfers what makes it impossible for domain ownership transfer.  The access to the administrative tool is well protected. Firstly only the limited number of users is privileged to have access. To access it, one needs to have a unique URL-address and know the machine-generated user name. On top of we apply two-factor authentication.  In fact, two-factor authentication is mandatory for every team-member at Blackmoon for every application, including email and slack clients.  This functionality is built into your account at Blackmoon Crypto. We encourage you to opt-in two-factor authentication (2FA) as well.  Server security  Our servers are placed to dedicated and isolated VPCs (virtual private cloud) and have no direct access from the Internet. The servers communicate exclusively with trusted nodes and balancers. There is no direct SSH access to the servers. VPC’s service discovery uses private DNS zone, so there is no chance to fake internal endpoint to external networks.  In the case of the penetration attack, i.e. increased failed login attempts on the server, the automated monitoring system will block such clients and shall inform devops. If the attack is confirmed, the access point to the infrastructure will be temporarily terminated and replaced. There will be no impact on the functionality of the running services.  In the normal course of business, we routinely apply autoscale mechanics to boost productivity when the load increases and scale down, when needed.  Every single service is protected by Amazon Shield™ anti-DDoS filter and WAF (web application firewall).  No Blackmoon developer has direct access to production servers. We are using automated deployment system and infrastructure orchestration solutions: CI & IaaC (Continuous Integration and Infrastructure as a Code).  Disaster recovery  We have a contingency plan for unlikely scenario of such an attack that brings down Amazon security. It would take us about minutes to set up from scratch a new AWS infrastructure and switch to it. Data loss in the worst case scenario will be less than a minute.  Thanks to the distributed ledger of the blockchain, we will download the history of the transactions.  All the necessary backups are stored offline under gpg encryption in three copies.  Security of funds  No server stores private keys of the wallets in either text, or photo, or any other format. We use Trezor hardware for multi-signature wallets. The backups are securely stored in bank vaults. Yes, sometimes it’s good to be fiat-guys.  As a result, should the wallets be compromised, intruders won’t be able to transfer funds.  Personal security tips  Keep your wallet’s private keys safe, check the “lock sign” in browser address field that means trusted SSL connection and correct SSL-certificate to a website.

430,msg20977385,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2075919.0,,24664,Announcements (Altcoins),2017-08-18 06:28:00,Pumpkin,Full Member,151,100,,[ANN] Blackmoon Crypto Platform for Tokenized Investment Fund,"What is BMC token explained by Sergey Vasin, Investment Director.  Blackmoon Crypto Token (BMC) is the token of the Blackmoon Crypto Platform. This token plays an instrumental role on the platform:   — BMC tokens linked to accounts of a Continuous Contributors receive all the Platform’s fees from the funds creation and operation on the platform;  — BMC tokens are required to perform certain high level roles on the platform, including that of the investment advisor;  — BMC tokens give the right to participate in the platform’s decision-making process.  The number of BMCs is fixed and no additional creation is possible after the distribution period.  Based on legal advice and opinions we gathered during the preparation process, BMC tokens would not be deemed as securities by SEC based on the famous Howey test and should be considered as an utility tokens of the Platform. We pay a lot of attention to that matter and are in continuous communications with US attorneys while formalizing our position.    1. Distribution  The Distribution period starts on September 12, 2017 at 01:00 pm UTC and will go until October 11 or until the cap is reached. All available BMC will be issued during the Distribution period. This will be a one-time operation and no additional issuance is available for BMC tokens. The total number of BMC to be issued will be calculated at the end of the Distribution Period according to the formula: amount of BMC sold during the Distribution multiplied by 2.   — 50% of the BMCs will be allocated to the public contributors who participated in the Distribution process including bonuses provides to contributors during the promo campaign.  — 30% of the BMCs will be allocated to the Company reserve and locked for a minimum of 36 months. This reserve is a source of the Company’s income after the Distribution Period.  — 20% of the BMCs will be allocated to the founding Blackmoon Crypto team and advisors, locked in a smart contract with a 24-month vesting period, and six-month cliff. Some BMCs from this pool (but not more than 5% of all BMCs) will be allocated to non-operational advisors and will be locked with a six-month cliff without vesting. Up to 3% will go to subcontractors and bounty campaign members without vesting.   2. Continuous contributors  Continuous contributors are the BMC holders who perform specific roles related to the platform development. One of the main roles that will be available is that of an Investment Advisor who manages tokenized investment funds created on the platform. Other roles will include platform ambassadors, promoters, investment analysts and voters, legal advisors, public auditors and GR advisors. A full list of roles will be publicly available and updated as needed to reflect the current needs of the platform’s development.  We plan to introduce more than ten different roles to provide both common and professional holders with the means to participate in the Platform’s development.  To register as a Continuous Contributor the holder of BMC tokens can choose the role that she/he is willing to execute as a contributor to the Platform and deposit BMC to the depository wallet. The registration will be available on the website before the first fund is started.  3. Proceeds.  BMCs holders registered as Continuous Contributors to the Platform and who have linked their BMC to respective accounts will receive a share of all Funds’ tokens that operate on the Platform in exchange for execution of their roles.  Continuous Contributors will receive a distribution of Funds’ tokens from the first Fund created on the Blackmoon Crypto Platform without having to wait for the company to reach breakeven. The sources of the proceeds are:   — Structuring and promotion fee: 0–10% from the amount of the issued fund tokens. On average 2.5%  — Maintenance fee: This can differ from one fund to another, but on average it may be equal to 0.5% per annum paid daily in fund tokens via a smart contract  — Transaction fee: This fee occurs upon transferring fund tokens from one wallet to another in the amount of 0.25% from the token amount paid in fund tokens via the smart contract.  4. Downside protection.  We at Blackmoon are strong believers that our solution to create and manage legally compliant tokenized investment funds is the future of the blockchain-enabled asset management industry. We will personally start several funds on the platform to leverage our expertise in alternative fixed income and venture capital. In addition to that, to protect contributors we introduced downside protection: To protect contributors from dumps the Platform will buy back BMC at $0.8 per token from anybody who is willing to sell. We’ll reserve 30% of raised capital for that in a portfolio of cryptocurrencies. We will keep it working for 24 months.

Thanks for your questions! Regulation is a growing concern for the crypto industry. Currently, investors in tokenized funds are at best in Terra Incognita. All investment funds will be reviewed and approved by our legal advisors to ensure they are fully compliant with existing laws and regulations. This will improve investor confidence and provide necessary sustainability of the investment process.  BMC tokens are the tokens of the platform, nor the funds on it. BMC tokens will not be pegged to USD. Blackmoon Crypto Platform will be a game changer, that will bring in a much needed standard IT and legal infrastructure to create and manage legally compliant tokenised investment funds that will invest in both fiat and crypto investment opportunities.  Blackmoon FG was incorporated in Ireland.  Regarding your third question, 200k spent incorporates hiring more people in 2018, their medical insurances etc. Please have a look at our whitepaper for more info and please let us know if you have any questions: https://blackmooncrypto.com/bmc_whitepaper.pdf?1.10",False

We don't disclose our CAP due to the following reason: market volatility is too high. We have to leave ourselves a room to adjust before the distribution starts. If BTC will go down to 1500-2000 then a cap that makes sense at 3000 won't work anymore. But we are reasonable while calculating cap. Our main aim is to ensure growth of tokens price since we keep 30% for the company reserve and 20% as a motivation for stakeholders.  We target in between 15 and 30 mil dollars. The exact number will be revealed in September. Given all the volatility of the markets nowadays, I assume you'd agree that this is a reasonable strategy.  We have to leave ourselves a room to adjust to a market situation. Therefore we'll fix the cap 24 hours prior to the main sale in a rage $15-30 mil. And we are going to issue exactly 2x more tokens than we sell. It means if we sell for $30mil and we issue 60 mil of tokens. So 30-60 mil is an accurate approximation of total amount. Maybe 25-65 to have reserves on both ends. Thank you! Let us know if you have any other questions!",False
