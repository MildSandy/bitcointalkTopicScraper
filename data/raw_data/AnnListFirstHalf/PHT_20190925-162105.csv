Based on this we realize that successful conduct of the Token Sale and implementation of the product in its original form (using cryptocurrencies and PHT) is in jeopardy.  The team will continue to work on the project without the Token Sale. And, possibly, the product will be implemented without the use of cryptocurrency. It is also possible that we reconsider carrying out a Token sale in the future, when the product is in the late stages of completion.  We would like to express our sincere gratitude to our community and Token Sale participants. We spent a lot of time to study this issue, consulted our advisors and made this difficult decision. We value our reputation and therefore PlayHall is the first project ever to make an independent decision to fully reimburse all the invested funds to our Token Sale participants. Hence, we bear all the campaign costs ourselves.  The funds will be reimbursed to the wallet, that you specified while registering:   0x104a020e542271002ff5fe14ac21e71bf515a6b0  In case you wish to have your funds reimbursed to another wallet, we kindly ask you to provide us with the wallet’s details in a reply to this letter within 5 days since receiving this notification. After these 5 days, the funds will be automatically reimbursed to the originally specified wallet. PHT tokens are frozen on your wallets (all transfers blocked).  This is not a public announcement yet. The public one will be made later.  Sincerely,  Eugen Kaufman  CEO, Founder PlayHall Platform  Tekegram @eugen_x  PLEASE CLARIFY THANK YOU",False

What lessons your have learned from the previous gaming projects.    Hi Larks, why is our project better? I think it is important everyone does their own research. However, PlayHall sold out very fast during the pre-sale. The reason for this is because it's popular and already has beta games in play, as well as the short amount of time towards the launch of 20 extra games will be a great addition to players being able to play the games! You can stake cryptocurrency in skill-games (PVP), so you can earn tokens by playing your favorite games and improving your skills.  Moreover, PlayHall already has over 200,000 members on the platform. Whereas many ICOs simply have a whitepaper. Hope this has helped you, feel free to learn more at https://playhall.io and https://playhall.com.",False

You can look through the topic back and see that many people wrote that there will be first launches of games in the second half of the year. By the way, they promise 4 pieces.  I am more curious to know what games are launching on the platform, they shouldn't be like those 2D arcade games made by Indie devs just trying out how making a game works PLAYHALL will definitely release the great number of games with the use of best graphics which can help the platform to attract so many gamers towards the project. Developers will make the project best gaming platform.  As said PlayHall is still in early stages at the moment & 20 games are launching August 2018 indeed. As for more advanced (graphic) games, I will ask more informatoin about this at the team and get back to you!",False
