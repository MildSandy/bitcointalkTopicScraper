The advantage of early diagnosis is thus better care, that is to say, of course to increase the chances of curing, but also to limit the sequelae associated with certain treatments.  The two means of action to enable early diagnosis are, on the one hand, screening when it exists, that is to say, the practice of surveillance examinations in the absence of symptoms, and on the other hand identification of warning signs as soon as they appear. The problem with this type of diagnosis is that few people take the time to go to see their doctor or are not aware of their first sumptomes.

Our lungs, apart from the respiratory ones, also have a secretory function (for example, the smell of alcohol from the mouth).

For these impurities, a well-founded preliminary diagnostic conclusion can be made.  The diagnostic principle itself - gas analysis - has been well studied in medicine.

Your question is very relevant and appropriate. The diagnosis of high glucose levels using the Health Monitor device is really based on the detection of high concentrations of acetone in the exhaled air. The products that is part of ketogenic diet lead to acetonemia and obviously this volatile substance will be released during respiration. Acetone will be register by the device.  But in the case of ketogenic diets there is one nuance: a person already knows that he has diabetes and that there will be high concentrations of acetone in the exhaled air.  We primarily focus on those people whose diabetes is just beginning and who do not yet know about their condition. The main task which the device is designed to solve - early diagnosis.  Therefore, if the Health Monitor reveals high levels of acetone in the breath against a background of complete well-being we recommend that you contact the doctor to clarify the diagnosis.  People with an already established diagnosis can also use it if sugar-reducing drugs are used to correct the sugar level (ketone diet is not suitable for everyone).  P.S. Since the ketone diet is used for the treatment of other diseases, for example epilepsy, your question is very useful and will help us develop more detailed recommendations on the use of the device.",False

With all due respect to you, I do not want to say ,that trade will not develop  further than trede on Etherdelta exchange .  The question was about the first exchange, and I put forward the assumption, where the token will appear for the first time after ISO.   I'm talking about buying . I personally know several speculators who bought tokens at a price of X2 from the ICO price on Etherdelta, and after some time the token cost becomes X7.7 of the ISO price. What I want to say is about people and their nature, someone needs money urgently, and they are forced to sell tokens. In this variant, the first exchange on which they will appear will be Ezerdelta. And there will appear people who believe in the project and are ready to invest money. And they are able to buy after ICO.

The price of the token will depend on the capitalization of the company (investments that were received on the pre-ICO and ICO and profits from the sale of devices) + you, as the owner of the tokens, will receive part of the profit from the sale of services. Here the details:https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-QBdFrWXGeAdnRQaHlUbV9QNm8/view  You are a token holder. If you have tokens $ 100, and the company's market capitalization is $ 100,000, when Cap will go to 10 million $, your actions will cost 10 000 $.+ you will recieve profit from sales. It's pretty rough, but I think you understood the general idea. The range of application of the technology is very wide and I am confident that there will be new developments and the company's capitalization will certainly grow.   If the company will recieve hardcap on ico, and other things will go well, i think, that tokens will be listed at any good exchange, such as Bittrex or Poloniex.  The first exchange, where you can buy or sell tokens, is obviously EtherDelta exchange.(in my opinion) You can add the tokens there and set a price for them. Usually this is the first exchange.

For more than 25 years, S.Aututov worked on lasers, not only in Russia but also in other countries  The idea of creating this device was based on the high sensitivity of the laser to the surrounding gases.  First of all, our apparatus is a gas analyzer. The present invention does not require the presence of third-party carrier gases or markers necessary for regulating the spectrum of each gas. High selectivity makes it possible to reveal the spectra of any gases, despite the presence of water vapor in the exhaled air.  These characteristics can also be used for industrial purposes - on production, for detection of hazardous substances, narcotic substances, etc. There is a direct link between exhaled gases and diseases. That existing devices have a number of drawbacks, namely: they are highly specialized and work with one or more of the substances being tested, similar in their properties. In addition, the technologies for their manufacture are too expensive and difficult to produce, as well as difficult and inconvenient for their operation. All of this limits their practical use and mass implementation.   The advantage of our gas analyzer is that there is no need for external gases, bulky equipment, etc. At the same time, it is possible to obtain spectra of more than 600 gases. Spectra of 23 gases have already been obtained  Having learned about this development, we have optionally made a series of studies on the basis of the Biotechnopark Koltsovo (Koltsovo Biotechnopark is a project, for creation of scientific production platform, which accumulates developing companies, research and production in the field of biotechnologies and fields close to it (such as information technologies)  and clinic, in cooperation with the some doctors, members of the Russian Medical Association  Several months ago, these gas analyzers went on sale for private use. Despite its high cost, the device is in demand not only among diabetics, but also among ordinary users, for daily testing of their health status   Recently we came to the conclusion that this vending machine will be successful. Heath Monitor is not a certified medical device and can not replace a medical examination in the clinic. Health Monitor can not be used by a medical professionals as it is classified as an electrical appliance and is subject to CISPR 24 \ EN 55024 certification.  Heath Monitor is used only for the purpose of preliminary diagnosis of possible diseases and can not diagnose or replace a visit to a professional doctor. If you find any gas in your breath that indicates possible disease, you should immediately go to clinic for an appropriate examination.  The attraction of funds through crowdfunding gives a more rapid start, which will help to maximize the popularity of this device, because This vending machine can be installed in thousands of number. If investors do not invest in ICO - we will continue to install the devices at their own expense, but not so fast  The business model of the project is successful, and brings a high profitability. The low cost of one text for such a primary diagnosis will give a positive dynamic.  The problem of timely diagnosis is always relevant. We hope to help people pay attention to their health, having spent only $ 5 We intend to undergo medical certification and install equipment in medical institutions. It takes time, thanks to the vending business, production will be already adjusted and time will be spent with advantage We believe that this invention will help in primary diagnosis, signaling to a person about the need to go to a doctor.",False

Basically you telling me that if I go and conduct 10 tests within same day all of the results will be different (dependent on when and what I ate, drank, smoke etc). Some of them may indicate that I'm ill, some may say I'm healthy.  Imagine this - I'm in airport between flights, saw your device and decide to use it. I can't just insert 5$, spend a minute to get fast and meaningful result. Instead I need to read your instruction, educate myself, prepare for test, conduct test and after that STILL receive inconclusive result that suggest me to visit a doctor, who won't even accept that test results as medical test, because device is not certified and I will again have to go through similar testing.

A more detailed report from the Research Institute of Physiology and Medicine fundamental RAMS requires a translation from the Russian language.  Clinical trials of the proposed technical solutions conducted at the Research Institute of Physiology and Medicine fundamental RAMS. The tests involved three patients, two of whom had diabetes for 10 years, was the third in the initial stage of the disease compensated insulin deficiency in the body.  Before each measurement shot emission spectrum of the ambient air, which was taken as a reference. Further, blood test was performed to determine the level of glucose in the blood of each patient. Analysis of blood sugar in the blood was carried out on the device Yellow Springs Instruments. Then the patients were asked to simply breathe in the volume of pre-treatment of the sample to achieve a desired flow of air in the test line of the selection device samples. These tests were performed for all study patients on an empty stomach before breakfast. Only two patients of the patient and one patient were tested with no diabetes.

Before each measurement, the emission spectrum of laboratory air was recorded and taken as a reference. Further on, we performed blood tests in order to find the glucose level by using a “Yellow Springs Instruments” glucometer. Then the patients breathed into the chamber for sample pretreatment until a desired air flow in the receiving part of the setup was reached. These tests were performed for all patients on an empty stomach.  Three patients participated in the trials, two of whom were diabetic for about 10 years, the third was at the initial stage of the disease with a compensated insulin deficiency in the body.  4. and 5. You can see it in patient or in the article. The main result is that the breath acetone level measured by proposed method and device declined linearly with the amount of the blood glucose concentration of all persons examined.  By means of this result we can set the reference point of acetone level in exhaled air level for healthy person and diagnose diabetes for all person with higher acetone level in exhaled air.

I'm asking uncomfortable questions - yes, but I'm nowhere near aggressive. All I did asked was error margin of the device, how accurate it's results can be interpreted by the user. I'm trying to see value in this device for end user, but for now I fail. I see lots of comparison with glucometer here but it's different. Healthy people rarely buys glucometer since it's needed to monitor preexisted condition, rather then diagnose. This one is opposite - it's going to be marketed to crowds in public places, where most of users expected to be healthy, therefore results of those tests should become initial basis for decision making. What reasoning will drive customer's intention to spend 5$ for a test? Perfectly healthy individual won't go near this device because they feel fine.  Those who concerned will actually try it, but will be greeted with sign saying ""This is not medically certified device, we don't take any responsibility for what conclusions you draw from that."" So this device won't give you much more than illusion of being informed, and you will practically give it 5$ just to receive paper that says what you already know - ""go visit professional, you got some shit in your lungs - it could be anything or nothing"".  So what is the market value of this device and service? What is customer value?  Btw, I'm not even saying this is bad idea - but imagine how different it would sound if there was at least some certainty after use. For example if it was like that:  ""Acetone in breath is an anomaly that only appears in organism of people who have one of the following diseases A,B,C,D. We promote a device that can within 0,002% error margin detect acetone in your breath. If you have some we will strongly advice you to seek medical attention, because even though we can't diagnose your condition we can say beyond reasonable doubt - something is not right"".  However Acetone in breath can occur in healthy people as well as in breath of sick people. It's concentration heavily dependent on person's mass, ration et.c. meaning that same concentration in breath of different people can (and should) draw different conclusions for them. Yes it is marker but it's just one marker and having this marker is nowhere near enough to take vast responsibility to visit a doctor. I would see this on shelves like glucometer, or installed in pharmacies or clinics, where targeted people need to check special marker without paying too much, but aiming at crowded places is really bad idea.

The threshold sensitivity of the proposed device at the discharge noise level is about 10 ppbv (0.01 mg/L), which makes it possible to detect the disease at an early stage, when it is still possible to avoid the use of lifelong insulin therapy of diabets.  This information is from a patent https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=RU&NR=2597943C1&KC=C1&FT=D  Each gas has its own spectrum at its own frequency. Therefore, if we add another gas, it will change the spectrum on a different frequency. If you drink alcohol, for example, then just add the spectrum of ethanol. It will not affect the spectra of other gases.  I think Nikolay will now write what will happen if a person drank alcohol or something ate, but we will determine the content of gases in his breath with an accuracy (0.01 mg / L).  Out of 100 patients with diabetes who have exceeded the level of acetone in their breath, the device will confirm the presence of diabetes with a probability of 100%. But if in the breath of a person there is acetone for another reason, the device will not be able to find out its origin.",False

The device allows to keep track of low acetone admixtures in patient’s exhaled air. It is comprised of power supply source, spectrometer, discharge cell, sample selection line and process unit. Health monitor is an electrical accessory, which is to be used with 12V direct current nominal voltage (inclusive). In case of instrument’s failure, voltage (on condition the circuit is broken), multiplied by measured current (which is meant to flow through the circuit with the possible defect) is not more than 15 volt-ampere. The monitor is constructed of non-toxic materials, sans the ionization radiation. The device is isolated with no impact on the environment, as well as on the vital activity of any organism. Once an exhaled air sample is drawn, it goes straight to the sample selection line, where the discharge is to be initialized in the discharge cell. Process unit stands for the registration of an exhaled air emission spectrum, with the subsequent analysis of it. Upon that, in order to decrease the exhaled air pressure in a discharge cell, a purge pump is used. Discharge initialization is conducted with the low pressure. Analysis of an exhaled air emission spectrum is to be done by means of spectrum intensity normalization, (rationing with the water vapor concentration in an exhaled air). Hence, water vapors have no impact on the measuring accuracy. To conduct measurements, blowing the monitor’s tube for a few seconds is enough. All the following processing is automatically accomplished. The main work principles of the device: 1.   An exhaled air sample is drawn, and carried to the sample selection line. 2.   With help of adjustable valve, the exhaled airflow through the sample selection line is easily regulated. 3.   The air is passed to the discharge cell, with low air pressure (10 – 100 torr), kept up by the purge pump. 4.   On condition the process pressure is reached, a glow discharge is initialized in the discharge cell (with constant current, varying from 5 to 20 mA). To maintain the glow discharge, a 1500V and Imax = 20 mA power supply is applied.    5.   Further, discharge’s emission radiation is passed to the spectrometer through the fiber-optic cable. Spectrometer’s signal is registered and processed by the processing unit. 6.   The device’s software analyses the exhaled air specter and compares it to the surrounding air specter. Based on this comparison, various impurity gases concentrations are calculated.  The device could be used for measuring the blood sugar level, as well as to detect the infancy of lung carcinoma, stomach ulcer and diabetes. It experimentally finds, the acetone concentration, measure by Health Monitor, is linearly proportional to the blood sugar level. Presence of the certain impurity gases does well indicate a probable disease, even though the device does not find the precise diagnosis. Such a medical test results may accent the necessity of the full medical examination. Moreover, technical facility, described above, could serve as a detector of pollution and impurity gases in an environment air, such as mercury, xenon, methane vapors, narcotic and explosive substances in the air, etc.",False

It is a some theory here: https://breathtecbiomedical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Diabetes_1.pdf  And the doctor on the basis of a  glycated hemoglobin establishes the diagnosis.

I already understood that your device is bad enough to be unable to provide actual medical diagnosis, what I'm trying to understand is how bad it actually is.  Say 100 ill people uses your device 10 times each. How much of those 1000 measurements will result in recommendations to visit doctor? and how much of those will be missed?  Say 100 healthy people  uses your device 10 times each. How much of 1000 measurements will result in recommendations to visit doctor?  What happens if I smoke, eat, drink alcohol 10 minutes before testing?  Was such tests ever conducted? and if yes, was results documented? and if yes can you share those documents with your investors?   This is important because 1% error margin (99% accuracy) means that out of 10 000 uses (just 50 000$ in revenue priced 5$ per test) you can expect 10 people who will be false-positive/negative. Say 1 of them will actually visit doctor what will happen?  Imagine this - I'm going through test with your device and paying 5$ for recommendation to visit doctor. Then I'm going to doctor who charge another 100$ for actual diagnosis and tell me that I'm absolutely fine. So basically I just got burned for 105$ and some time. And this is if it's just false-positive. Would I be pissed enough to write a complaint to nearest health regulator? Absolutely. Will it result of your vending machine removal from the location? Probably.    In false-negative case consequence will much MUCH more worse, because based on negative result someone may not visit doctor in time, not get diagnosed in time and eventually (best case scenario) sue you, or at least make sure your reputation will be totally screwed, not at single location but globally.  In either case investors loose everything. This is why there are little to no vending machines offering you automated health testing. Nobody want to throw money away really.  It's unimaginable that health-related company never thought about possibility of such outcomes. And this is exactly the reason why everything half-serious medical-related have to be licensed/certified inside out and again.  At this point I'm not sure what I'm more worried about - you running away with your investor's money or you honestly delivering untested broken device that have potential of bring real harm to the health of real people, while investors pays for it.",False

The device allows to keep track of low acetone admixtures in patient’s exhaled air. It is comprised of power supply source, spectrometer, discharge cell, sample selection line and process unit. Health monitor is an electrical accessory, which is to be used with 12V direct current nominal voltage (inclusive). In case of instrument’s failure, voltage (on condition the circuit is broken), multiplied by measured current (which is meant to flow through the circuit with the possible defect) is not more than 15 volt-ampere. The monitor is constructed of non-toxic materials, sans the ionization radiation. The device is isolated with no impact on the environment, as well as on the vital activity of any organism. Once an exhaled air sample is drawn, it goes straight to the sample selection line, where the discharge is to be initialized in the discharge cell. Process unit stands for the registration of an exhaled air emission spectrum, with the subsequent analysis of it. Upon that, in order to decrease the exhaled air pressure in a discharge cell, a purge pump is used. Discharge initialization is conducted with the low pressure. Analysis of an exhaled air emission spectrum is to be done by means of spectrum intensity normalization, (rationing with the water vapor concentration in an exhaled air). Hence, water vapors have no impact on the measuring accuracy. To conduct measurements, blowing the monitor’s tube for a few seconds is enough. All the following processing is automatically accomplished. The main work principles of the device: 1.   An exhaled air sample is drawn, and carried to the sample selection line. 2.   With help of adjustable valve, the exhaled airflow through the sample selection line is easily regulated. 3.   The air is passed to the discharge cell, with low air pressure (10 – 100 torr), kept up by the purge pump. 4.   On condition the process pressure is reached, a glow discharge is initialized in the discharge cell (with constant current, varying from 5 to 20 mA). To maintain the glow discharge, a 1500V and Imax = 20 mA power supply is applied.    5.   Further, discharge’s emission radiation is passed to the spectrometer through the fiber-optic cable. Spectrometer’s signal is registered and processed by the processing unit. 6.   The device’s software analyses the exhaled air specter and compares it to the surrounding air specter. Based on this comparison, various impurity gases concentrations are calculated.  The device could be used for measuring the blood sugar level, as well as to detect the infancy of lung carcinoma, stomach ulcer and diabetes. It experimentally finds, the acetone concentration, measure by Health Monitor, is linearly proportional to the blood sugar level. Presence of the certain impurity gases does well indicate a probable disease, even though the device does not find the precise diagnosis. Such a medical test results may accent the necessity of the full medical examination. Moreover, technical facility, described above, could serve as a detector of pollution and impurity gases in an environment air, such as mercury, xenon, methane vapors, narcotic and explosive substances in the air, etc.",False

The device allows to keep track of low acetone admixtures in patient’s exhaled air. It is comprised of power supply source, spectrometer, discharge cell, sample selection line and process unit. Health monitor is an electrical accessory, which is to be used with 12V direct current nominal voltage (inclusive). In case of instrument’s failure, voltage (on condition the circuit is broken), multiplied by measured current (which is meant to flow through the circuit with the possible defect) is not more than 15 volt-ampere. The monitor is constructed of non-toxic materials, sans the ionization radiation. The device is isolated with no impact on the environment, as well as on the vital activity of any organism. Once an exhaled air sample is drawn, it goes straight to the sample selection line, where the discharge is to be initialized in the discharge cell. Process unit stands for the registration of an exhaled air emission spectrum, with the subsequent analysis of it. Upon that, in order to decrease the exhaled air pressure in a discharge cell, a purge pump is used. Discharge initialization is conducted with the low pressure. Analysis of an exhaled air emission spectrum is to be done by means of spectrum intensity normalization, (rationing with the water vapor concentration in an exhaled air). Hence, water vapors have no impact on the measuring accuracy. To conduct measurements, blowing the monitor’s tube for a few seconds is enough. All the following processing is automatically accomplished. The main work principles of the device: 1.   An exhaled air sample is drawn, and carried to the sample selection line. 2.   With help of adjustable valve, the exhaled airflow through the sample selection line is easily regulated. 3.   The air is passed to the discharge cell, with low air pressure (10 – 100 torr), kept up by the purge pump. 4.   On condition the process pressure is reached, a glow discharge is initialized in the discharge cell (with constant current, varying from 5 to 20 mA). To maintain the glow discharge, a 1500V and Imax = 20 mA power supply is applied.    5.   Further, discharge’s emission radiation is passed to the spectrometer through the fiber-optic cable. Spectrometer’s signal is registered and processed by the processing unit. 6.   The device’s software analyses the exhaled air specter and compares it to the surrounding air specter. Based on this comparison, various impurity gases concentrations are calculated.",False

A Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease has gotten most widespread – almost 80% of people with more than 5-7 years length of chronic bronchitis have this diagnosis. Other than that, over the last decades a growing amount of researches deny the direct correlation between COPD and smoking, since a remarkable share of ill people (around 40%) had never smoked before. Unfortunately, it’s not always possible to eliminate the negative influence of the environment. However, by means of Health Monitor, one can detect the symptoms of early stage pulmonary pathology and make preventive moves. At the beginning of the process, classic methods – fluorography,  X-ray plain film, CT and MRT will not detect anything. Lungs auscultation, though conducted by experienced doctor, would diagnosticate bronchitis. Spirography fails to distinguish a little changes. And only after several years have gone, when the bronchial tree had been permanently injured, COPD is clearly seen on x-ray film and easy to detect with auscultation. Unhappily, a full regression of this pathology is out of reach yet. More: https://presista.tumblr.com/post/167226413458/diagnosis-of-chronic-lung-disease",False

The most methods are the use of X-ray - fluorography, overall radiogram and CT. They are based on the difference in tissue density: the denser the tissue, the lighter image on the film/monitor screen will be. Against the background of the full lungs air, the picture is quite contrast. But if the tumor originates from the same cells as the lung parenchyma, then its density will be the same as the normal tissues and then nothing will be seen in the picture. And of course, any of X-ray examinations give the organism a harmful radiation load. Blood markers are promising, but the accuracy of the study still leaves much to be desired: mistakes in both directions happen quite often. But the spectrum of the exhaled air always changes if someone suffers from any pulmonary pathology. The device allows these changes to be observed, measured and registered. Metabolism of cancer cells significantly changes and they begin to synthesize a number of volatile organic compounds. And the device will detect them/ Do not expect the Health Monitor to establish the type of tumor and its stage. No, the device has another area of application - screening diagnosis of lung cancer.

The reason is the long asymptomatic period during which a sick person infects more than 10-15 healthy people. But hepatic pathology is accompanied by an increase in the concentrations of a number of marker substances: •   Ammonia NH3. •   Monooxide of nitrogen NO. •   Sulfur compounds  dimethyl – sulphide. •   Butanone or ethyl methyl ketone. •   Pentanone or diethyl ketone.

To administer a classic urease test it is required to drink urea labeled with a radioactive isotope of carbon (13C).

The device allows to keep track of low acetone admixtures in patient’s exhaled air. It is comprised of power supply source, spectrometer, discharge cell, sample selection line and process unit. Health monitor is an electrical accessory, which is to be used with 12V direct current nominal voltage (inclusive). In case of instrument’s failure, voltage (on condition the circuit is broken), multiplied by measured current (which is meant to flow through the circuit with the possible defect) is not more than 15 volt-ampere. The monitor is constructed of non-toxic materials, sans the ionization radiation. The device is isolated with no impact on the environment, as well as on the vital activity of any organism. Once an exhaled air sample is drawn, it goes straight to the sample selection line, where the discharge is to be initialized in the discharge cell. Process unit stands for the registration of an exhaled air emission spectrum, with the subsequent analysis of it. Upon that, in order to decrease the exhaled air pressure in a discharge cell, a purge pump is used. Discharge initialization is conducted with the low pressure. Analysis of an exhaled air emission spectrum is to be done by means of spectrum intensity normalization, (rationing with the water vapor concentration in an exhaled air). Hence, water vapors have no impact on the measuring accuracy. To conduct measurements, blowing the monitor’s tube for a few seconds is enough. All the following processing is automatically accomplished. The main work principles of the device: 1.   An exhaled air sample is drawn, and carried to the sample selection line. 2.   With help of adjustable valve, the exhaled airflow through the sample selection line is easily regulated. 3.   The air is passed to the discharge cell, with low air pressure (10 – 100 torr), kept up by the purge pump. 4.   On condition the process pressure is reached, a glow discharge is initialized in the discharge cell (with constant current, varying from 5 to 20 mA). To maintain the glow discharge, a 1500V and Imax = 20 mA power supply is applied.    5.   Further, discharge’s emission radiation is passed to the spectrometer through the fiber-optic cable. Spectrometer’s signal is registered and processed by the processing unit. 6.   The device’s software analyses the exhaled air specter and compares it to the surrounding air specter. Based on this comparison, various impurity gases concentrations are calculated.  The device could be used for measuring the blood sugar level, as well as to detect the infancy of lung carcinoma, stomach ulcer and diabetes. It experimentally finds, the acetone concentration, measure by Health Monitor, is linearly proportional to the blood sugar level. Presence of the certain impurity gases does well indicate a probable disease, even though the device does not find the precise diagnosis. Such a medical test results may accent the necessity of the full medical examination. Moreover, technical facility, described above, could serve as a detector of pollution and impurity gases in an environment air, such as mercury, xenon, methane vapors, narcotic and explosive substances in the air, etc.",False
