Thanks for your question! BACE tokens are utility tokens, in the future there are more possibilities, but regulations are holding these back at the moment. Beside the expected potential price increase of BACE, there are several other types of advantages. You don't get any trading discounts, you trade absolutley free for 3 months on a fiat exchange, which is unique on the market. For all non ICO participants, there is an option to buy BACE tokens to reduce and pay their trading fees, which is also unique on a fiat exchange. Beside that, there will be an ICO marketplace where investors can directly invest in choosen projects with BACE, in BACE Token paid services like subaccounts for investment firms and fund managers  and more features to come in the future. Beside all this, only ICO participants can run an affiliate program on the exchange, what's also unique.",False

Please read our Whitepaper for detailed insight   The BACE Exchange Project Our Team has a vision of an Exchange which allows both new and expirienced traders to trade their Assets on a safe, fast and easy accessable Exchange. While we are convinced of the success of pure crypto exchanges, we see a predominant and unsolved problem in this sector: For interested parties who are not educated enough about the requirements of digital currencies (e.g. Bitcoin) in a differentiated way; there are very limited possibilities to invest in smaller projects e.g. ERC20 tokens. What brings us to the next point ;    What distinguishes us from other Exchanges •   Easy Fiat access A large number of prestigious Altcoin exchanges offer only the exchange and transfer of Bitcoin and Altcoins. Investing fiat directly in assets or withdrawing profits directly from a bank is currently only possible for a small minority of exchanges.  •   FIAT / Asset trading Currently, no exchange offers the opportunity to buy smaller currencies or ICOs without detours using fiat (USD). For sure BACE will also enable Bitcoin/Asset trading.  •   Vision to weaken dependency from Assets to Btc The majority of Blockchain projects and alternative digital currencies are in a one-sided dependency relationship with Bitcoin. Especially smaller currencies or starting projects are exposed to the partly enormous effects of Bitcoin performance. This can be attributed to the direct trade between Bitcoin and these currencies.     Exchange The engine of the BACE Exchange has a processing capacity of more than 1,000,000 orders per second. We also add advanced APIs, FIX, Binary and Web Socket and custom APIs. There will also be Sub-accounts for asset managers to manage customer capital in the digital currency market. BACE will have over 20 advanced order types.  https://i.imgur.com/SToyl6g.png  BACE Token and ICO As with a few other exchanges, we will create an ICO token explicitly developed for the BACE Exchange (BACE). This is an ERC 20 token, which serves the financial security of the BACE Exchange in addition to the functions already mentioned.    Advantages and Facts •   3 month free trading phase for ICO investors •   Run an affiliate program with rewards, ONLY ICO investors will get this feature, limited feature •   By buying the BACE token (Not in the ICO), traders will get reduced trading fees •   Opportunities to invest directly into ICOs with the BACE Token    Supply, Allocation and Phases Total Supply : 100'000'000 BACE 70%    ICO participants 20%    BACE Team 10%    Angel investors 1 ETH = ~ 1800 BACE Pre-ICO is from 02.04.2018 18:00 – 16.04.2018 17:59:59 (CET)  1 ETH = ~1800 BACE (+20% Bonus) ICO is from 23.04.2018 18:00 – 28.05.2018 17:59:59 (CET) 1 ETH = ~1800 BACE  https://bace.io/static/fund-usage-graph.777ecf99.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/ouPXSru.png   Roadmap https://i.imgur.com/qVnUP6H.png     Bounties http://Bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3124329  Links Official Website www.bace.io  Twitter https://twitter.com/baceexchange  Telegram https://t.me/baceexchange",False
