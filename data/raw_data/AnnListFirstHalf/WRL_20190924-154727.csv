This is the on-demand computing that the cloud has promised for many years.  The transition to on-demand computing offers huge benefits -- in terms of lowered costs and faster time-to-value -- it is still a nascent field. There are lots of technical hurdles, and currently, no established ecosystem.  Whoever is able to create this ecosystem will own the future of computing.  Wireline — a startup based in New York and founded by veteran software infrastructure engineers with advisors from Google, IBM, Amazon, and Salesforce — is developing this platform using proven foundational technologies and currently deployed by businesses around the world.  Wireline's Token Sale will establish the largest open source developer fund to seed this ecosystem.  The Wireline Solution  Wireline's suite of solutions unlocks the full potential of microservices.  A revolutionary aspect of the product is the Wireline marketplace, an App Exchange where best-in-class microservices, components and professional services are traded in a frictionless environment.  Beyond providing a frictionless ramp to IT organizations Wireline will democratize the use of powerful new technologies — from AI to Predictive Analytics to the Blockchain — by providing an interface for them in the modern enterprise.  Token Sale  The Wireline Development Fund (WDF) will mint a total of 3 billion WRL tokens (1 USD = 10 WRL); no additional tokens will be created after this first issuance.  Token Cap: At launch, Wireline will mint 100% of the tokens. No further tokens can be created. Release Schedule: Wireline Inc. will drawdown no more than 2.5% of outstanding tokens every three months from the WDF. The tokens will be allocated by Wireline to independent developers (and other participants) who are working on core parts of the ecosystem. Post-Sale Liquidity: Tokens are locked for trading until the platform reaches general availability  Team  We have an all-star mission driven team from New York City    Bounty Campaign  We have a very motivating bounty campaign being released soon. irfan_pak10 will be managing the campaign. Please direct questions to him.    ",False
