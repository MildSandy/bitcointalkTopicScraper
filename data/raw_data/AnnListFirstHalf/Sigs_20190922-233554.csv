Spectiv is a dedicated VR media platform where users can stream their VR video experiences to the world, and where others can enjoy those experiences from the comfort of their homes. It is a niche streaming platform similar to Twitch, but with a focus on VR content. Learn more about it here. Signal Tokens will be used on Spectiv's platform to directly connect advertisers with attention influencers. This is achieved through Spectiv’s “Ad Campaign Smart Contracts” which advertisers can use to directly reward viewers, publishers, and curators for driving attention to their ads. Every ad view and click that occurs on the ad is communicated to the Ad Campaign Smart Contract which then autonomously rewards Signal Tokens. The Signal Token Protocol is not limited to the Spectiv platform; it is open-source. The protocol is designed for any media platform to adopt and implement. Spectiv brings integral value to this protocol by acting as the pioneer and first use case, providing a foundational layer for other media platforms to benefit from and build upon. This pragmatic approach to token creation could bridge the gap between blockchain theory and real-world utility.   https://coinidol.com/virtual-reality-ad-tech-ico-spectiv/",False

BOINC has been around for 15 years. GridCoin has been around almost 4 years. They have been associated with BOINC the entire time. Although moved to the current DPoR model in 2014.  Neither SONM, or the shard of it (drugdiscoveryathome), have been around as long. If anything, drugdiscoveryathome tried to create a BOINC project of their own. But there were ""goings on"" between them, and SONM, where they started out, but then got kicked out.  But my point stands. GRC is not ETH based. Has never been ETH based. And has been around LONGER than ETH.  One tried to absorb BOINC. Probably not realising GRC was already so well established. The other tried to create their own BOINC project as a SONM prototype/test bed. They were part of same team (probably, it all looks a bit shady) at some point. None of it worked out in the end. The BOINC people were not very impressed with them. BOINC is not driven by profit. Never has been. It's driven by science enthusiasts, and always has been. GRC is seen as a nice bonus by some of the long standing BOINCers. But most are more interested in the science than the money. They ran it for free for over 10 years without any incentive ....  Maybe you can't see or understand that, but that is how it is. Money isn't everything to everyone.  Thread on the BOINC forum here discussing the demise of drugdiscoveryathome here: https://boinc.berkeley.edu/dev/forum_thread.php?id=11747  All very off topic as regard to Spectiv. But you're still mostly wrong on this one.",False

Initially.  Their token is a content promotion/propagation/reward mechanism. That's the cryptocurrency part of this.  Technically, the VR part is not required. They have chosen to build a VR platform to apply their content promotion token to. It could just as equally be applied to any other digital content. There are already other projects out there doing similar. (Curation/promotion/advertising tokens that is.)  That's what puts me off this one. The VR part is expensive, technically difficult, has a questionable size of user-base (who can use YouTube to view the same type of videos - and YouTube is pre-installed on pretty much every phone on the planet), and is not really related to the token in any real way. It's only VR because that's what they've chosen to attach it to. Lots of extra expense which is of little real benefit to the token. And they are not looking like being first to market with the promotion part.  In case you hadn't already guessed, I won't be investing unless something in their business plan changes radically between now and the ICO starting.  And I'm an early VR adopter.

BOINC has been around for 15 years. GridCoin has been around almost 4 years. They have been associated with BOINC the entire time. Although moved to the current DPoR model in 2014.  Neither SONM, or the shard of it (drugdiscoveryathome), have been around as long. If anything, drugdiscoveryathome tried to create a BOINC project of their own. But there were ""goings on"" between them, and SONM, where they started out, but then got kicked out.  But my point stands. GRC is not ETH based. Has never been ETH based. And has been around LONGER than ETH.  One tried to absorb BOINC. Probably not realising GRC was already so well established. The other tried to create their own BOINC project as a SONM prototype/test bed. They were part of same team (probably, it all looks a bit shady) at some point. None of it worked out in the end. The BOINC people were not very impressed with them. BOINC is not driven by profit. Never has been. It's driven by science enthusiasts, and always has been. GRC is seen as a nice bonus by some of the long standing BOINCers. But most are more interested in the science than the money. They ran it for free for over 10 years without any incentive ....  Maybe you can't see or understand that, but that is how it is. Money isn't everything to everyone.  Thread on the BOINC forum here discussing the demise of drugdiscoveryathome here: https://boinc.berkeley.edu/dev/forum_thread.php?id=11747  All very off topic as regard to Spectiv.

Anyway.  I'll chip in with something more relevant to the project itself.  This part of the announcement makes most sense in relation to the video interview I watched the other week.  1) It confirms one key point which I seemed to be picking up, but no-one else was.  2) BUT .... it also contradicts one of the key points of the entire model.  I'll address 2) first as it's a simpler question.  The SPEC token (now defunct by the sound of it) was never a crypto token. Your rationale behind this being that it was for micro-tipping and thus need to be stable and ""small scale"" (for want of a better description). Removing it from the equation is a considerable change to the model you were proposing around tipping and how it generates income. Are you doing a simple swap here? So SPEC tipping is replaced by SIG tipping? But the stability element around buying that is now gone? There was also flipping between the two mentioned at a couple of points, is that no longer the case? Will it be tip direct with SIG or covert to SPEC first? Or deal in small fractions? Tips seemed to be a revenue stream for content creators. Ads were the only other income stream I was aware of for them. So how does the system work now? Big chunks of the current white paper are gonna need a re-write here ....  And the biggie (for me) is point 1) ....  What you're basically saying here is the token, the bit people will be buying, is not dependent on VR. This was mentioned in the video interview, and seemed like a pretty damned major point to me! But no-one else was mentioning it?!?!? (too worried about their bounties?)  This is a MAJOR point. Why? Because you will be using a LOT of the funds you get to build a platform for VR video. To take on YouTube. In the mobile market. It will cost a lot to build. A lot to maintain. Has huge bandwidth and/or storage requirements.  And yet ......  None of this is actually needed for the token itself.  It could just as equally be applied to any other, established, platform. As you are now confirming.  So, anyone investing is taking a HUGE risk as VR is such an emergent/new/small/niche (all are applicable currently and who knows how long it will stay that way) market. That risk would be reduced massively by simply focussing on producing an attention token. Which is what you are actually doing. In crypto terms. There is nothing really decentralised about the VR part. Seems like a lot of unwarranted spending and risk to me ....",False

There is a market for that kind of token (plus other projects already trying to do that so there will be competition).

There are stacks of them.  It's an emergent market.  If you meant ""are there any other CRYPTO VR projects"", then no. Not that I'm aware of.  But, you people do realise, the token itself has little to nothing to do with VR really. They have chosen to apply it to a VR platform. It could (in the words of the CEO from the interview with him I watched. Link is a few pages back. I can easily find it again if need be) just as easily be applied to any other platform you wanted to push content for.  It's an ""attention"" token. Not a VR one. They are simply applying it to a VR platform.  For me, this is what makes the least sense about this ICO. They are basing it on two things:  1. Expected/hoped for exponential growth of the VR market. 2. Their ability to build, host and stream a VR video platform. Which they will then apply their attention token to.  But doing point 2 is difficult, expensive, and VERY speculative.  Developing and marketing an attention token in it's own right (which RefToken - another upcoming ICO - sounds like it's doing) would be equally valid (I guess you could say BAT does this, but it's use-case is a lot more specific). But without all the difficulty and expense of a VR video platform behind it.",False

Just looked it up.  It's a music marketing/promotion hub as far as I can gather. That has decided by recreating AltSpaceVR (a social VR platform that is cross platform, does exactly what they are describing - sit in a virtual space with other virual people etc etc, and has existed pretty much since Rift + Vive launched - also works on mobile) would be a good way for said musicians to promote their music.  Much like this, I really don't see why they need VR for this. So they're gambling on VR becoming the dominant platform.  Which it might. I suppose. In a few decades .....  Much like this, it sounds like it would make more sense to try and partner with someone like AltSpace who already have a good foothold in the market, rather than re-inventing the wheel for the sake of it. Which is what that reads like to me.  They have a beta coming soon. I'll be interested to give it a try and see how it compares to AltSpace.  (Just waiting for the gaming one now. Then they can try and take on Steam/Oculus Home + Rec Room   )  I'm aware I sound like Mr Negative in my response to all these VR ""offerings"". But, as a VR user, they all look they took something already out there (YouTube 360, AltSpaceVR etc etc) and bolted a crypto onto it for the sake of it. None of these things really feel like they need crypto, or offer me anything new or innovative so far.",False

Here is the latest update of crowdsale terms.   Quote from: SpectivVR on July 05, 2017, 09:21:26 AM ANNOUNCEMENT  Updated Whitepaper  Spectiv Crowdsale Update  SIGNAL TOKENS PRICE: $0.50 / SIG  NEW SIGNAL TOKENS RAISE CAP: $40M USD  NEW SIGNAL TOKENS RAISE MIN: $2M USD   Updated Pricing and Bonuses    Due to major fluctuations in Ethereum, we've gotten feedback from the community and our advisors to state our max cap in USD rather than ETH, adjusting the ETH receivable to fit the USD equivalent. Additionally, you will notice that we have materially raised the max cap.      WHY THE CAP HAS BEEN RAISED   The Spectiv platform and Signal Token are built for large-scale interacting networks, which means it is important that we welcome a wide community to join us in the project. We modified the crowdsale structure to allow for more people to participate.  Higher-level funds raised through the crowdsale will be used to support major platform backend needs and outreach efforts. Most notably, this will include data hosting and online marketing. These are fundamental variable expenses that could scale dramatically depending on Spectiv's adoption rate.

I appreciate that there will be little to no ad revenue initially. And going forward? Who knows. No-one can say. Including you guys. You can make estimates, sure. But this is online advertising we're talking about here. Income from this is far from a given. And uptake may be slow. As in, years slow. You can't assume the number of people using the internet, or playing consoles, just now will automatically translate to the same numbers for the VR market. Sure, it will grow I believe. But how big and how fast? I suspect our estimates there may be slighly different.  Which again takes me back to the value of SIGS. As this is what ICO investors are actually buying.  Sale price - $0.50.  Used solely by creators to propogate content via personalised links.  OK.  Like I say. I work for a tech company. We make EPoS. Biggest in my country. With some presence in the USA. We run loyalty programs. Loyalty programs are a similar system to your signals. At the end of day, they are personalised links to promote content (in my case - offers, in yours - VR videos). In my case, the companies we service use them for mailshots, sale-point discount, repeat buyer discounts, etc etc. Some of these loyalty campaigns contain millions of (uniquely identified) users. My role in all this to stress test the entire setup. The company I work for employs several hundred people. Has it's own dedicated data centres. I work with both dev, test and infrastructure teams. I have to in order to understand what they're doing so I can stress the correct parts of the system.  And we don't have to store and stream VR standard videos! That is a MUCH higher server demand than anything we host. (And we host a lot. Not just loyalty stuff.)  I'm just making the point that this is a BIG technical undertaking you're going for here. Snopes (the fake news website) has estimated running costs (they have an ongoing legal battle going on at the moment so have financial problems) are estimated at $100k per month. I can see costs for a VR streaming site of any sort of size being considerably higher than that. And thats an established site. Without additional revenue, I can see the ICO money getting burnt through pretty fast just on setup, never mind running it.  So where does the value in the token come from?  You sell them at $0.50 during the crowdsale. A curator uses them to ""curate"" (advertise, whatever ..... they share a specialised link generated through using the token). OK so far. This is where I start losing the track. The white paper then goes on to say that they earn ""interest"" based on the uptake generated through their signal posts. Right? So where does that interest come from? I see part of the ICO fund being held to pay early curators (again, in the white paper). Personally, I don't like that model. As it means ICO money could end up being used to pay people for uploading and spamming rubbish. (Moderation of interest is mentioned. Not sure how you plan to do that though. I reckon I could pretty easily set up an automated system, that switched exit nodes via a VPN or something so it looked like unique users, and create a whole bunch of fake interest from my own link ...)  But new users also get a 30 SIG bonus on sign up. And a free google cardboard.  So far, all payments to anyone, be they new users, curators, or whatever, appears to be coming out of the ICO money. On top of all your other setup and running costs.  Lots of costs. But little guaranteed revenue post-ICO.  But the white paper also states that ""The interest that users earn on Sigs they deploy is distributed as a share of the ad revenue generated from the content they signaled.""  Although, you said (in your reply I have partially quoted) that SIGS do not have to rely on the site being profitable to make money.  The statement above (from your white paper) implies the exact opposite. If the site is not generating ad revenue. Then once the money from the ICO is burned through, how do you pay them if the ad revenue is still low?  And I still don't see how any of this causes the token itself to gain value? Besides, as I mentioned earlier, ignorant market speculation. Thats hardly a stable base to build a business on.  Why does a SIG gain value? If, after the ICO money is gone, the only revenue to SIG users will be through (hopefully) ad revenue?  Also, if the SIG token does gain a LOT of value (although we're still not sure if they'll end up on an exchange - this detail isn't nailed down yet either), will this not prevent new ""curators"" from staking them? Why risk a $100 (for the sake of example - I'm not saying they'll ever hit $100) to promote a link you may get very little return on. You'd be better off selling it on an exchange. But, conversely, as a buyer of token as the ICO stage, I want them to go up in value. Problem is, I'm still failing to see why they will! I mean, if they DON'T end up on exhanges, why would they ever be worth more than the $0.50 ICO price? In fact, why does it need to be a cryptocurrency at all? The SPEC token isn't. As you say it needs to be a controlled price. As a curator using the SIG token, I would rather not be at the mercy of the insanity of crypto markets to determine whether it costs me $0.50 or $50 to promote a link. Why not make that one controlled as well? Except then your sole link to crypto, and investment money - which you'll need to run the thing, is gone.  Apologies for seemlingly asking the same question constantly. But that's only because I've yet to see an answer that tells me where the value comes from. And, unlike a lot of people buying crypto (the ""crypto = lambo"" idiot crowd), I actually do my research. I'm an analyst by trade. I'd rather not throw my hard earned cash away!  As it stands, as a VR user:  1. Would I try your site? - Yes. 2. Would I continue to use it? - Maybe. Impossible to say without seeing at least some sort of demo. But VR video is low on my use list. Even if I did continue to use it, it would not get much of a proportion of my VR time. The whole point of VR, for me and most of the people I know who are into it, is INTERACTIVE immersion. VR video is immersive. But not interactive. I see it a bit like Oculus before it got Touch. Half the system was missing. It's the main reason I stuck with the Vive over it (I had both at one point). Even with Touch now in place, their tracking system is not quite so good so I'm still happy with my decision to back the Vive. Although, the Oculus closed market system is fucking stupid and the LAST thing a small emergent market like VR needs. But thats what happens when you let Facebook pull the strings. 3. Would I invest in your token? - At the moment, no. See above.  (PS - the other potential problem I see for this is bandwidth. From the user end. You're talking about starting out with users offering live VR feeds yes? How many people do you think have the upload bandwidth to upstream decent quality VR video? I would burn through my mobile allowance in minutes. To do it live, requires a live data connection. So unless we want to watch some guy sat in his VR room, that data connection needs to be mobile. Or else you're into record and playback/stream at home territory. Not live. Look at the feeds on Periscope. Their quality is massively variable with lots of dropout, freezing, bad connections, etc. And VR will have way higher upstream requirements ...)

Not a bounty hunter.  Why?  Why are they going to increase in value? Where is the revenue going to come from?  Adverts. That's it.  That's the answer the CEO gave in the YouTube interview I watched. (and linked to a couple of pages back)  And when the site launches, how many advertisers will it have? Zero. So, in effect, it will be worthless.  So, besides ignorant speculation (such as with Numeraire), where is value going to be added to the token without any money going into the business?  As I keep saying, I'm a VR enthusiast and early adopter. I actually WANT to like this project. But as a business venture, it leaves a lot to be desired.  The token itself has little to do with VR. And could be applied to other sites/ventures. (Again, straight from the CEO interview. His words, not mine.)",False

I think the team should change this rule since it's not fair. It's not a matter of the bounty hunters being interested either in the project or in the reward, it's a matter of not changing the rules in the mid of the play or - if you have to change them - then doing all what it is necessary not to end up screwing anyone. Some bounty hunter could have decided to promote this project for a certain time, having in mind some other use for their signature after a certain date, or others just wouldn't like to put all their eggs in one basket - which is what you'd do if you support a single project for a very long time - if that project would fail, you'd have lost months of other opportunities, while working on many short projects means diversifying risks and opportunities. So if the rules have been changed the team should give the chance to anyone to leave without losing their little stake which they have earned till that moment. Of course, it's also advisable that the team raises the bounties proportionally with the rise of the campaign duration, since the value of the ICO doesn't necessarily increase by happening later. If people would wear the signature for twice the time declared initially and then get the same reward of a shorter campaign, they would simply have been given half of the promised money - which basically would be cheating. I am really intrigued by this project and I see all its potential, and I'm totally into futuristic visions too, so I'm not saying that I will necessarily leave this campaign. But the choice must be given to everyone since what people have agreed on is apparently not any more valid in the same original terms.",False

Not to be a sour patch worm, But my signature is worth quite a lot with ICO's coming and going in a weeks time. I'm also a very active user here on bitcointalk (making over 100 posts with Spectiv Sig) So i have to say this delay is really concerning for someone like me who has been involved since the biginning (4+ weeks) and have a significant amount of stakes. I understand you would increase bounty.  My question.  Would you be ""OK"" with a user removing there signature and still retaining there stakes under the condition that they return for at least the amount of time they originally wore it? (In my case, I have wore it 4weeks. So as long as I come back when the new ICO terms are released and use the sig. for another 4weeks I will get credit for previous use)  Because lets face it. The current sig. is worthless now, it says the wrong crowdfund date. I think it would only be fair to let participants remove them for a time while a new one is created while still retaining the previous rewards.   I hate to say it, but I have missed out on a lot of opportunities because I have faith in this project/crowdfund and wanted to participate early. I would like to promote your project, but the length of time your asking is becoming far too long, and I feel I have done my fair share of posting the signature around the BCT forums.

I guess I understood wrong. I thought you were stating 60days from the initial starting date. So basically it's being delayed about 4.5-5 weeks. Can I make a fair assumption that the ico will take place before October?  Essentially a 40% increase in length for a 50%-100% increase in rewards... and the sig is 50% of the pool?

They're focussing on the (potentially) profitable part of this. While you're messing around trying to take on YouTube and hoping people are going to pay to watch some guy run around his garden streaming footage from a cheap 360 cam. If you can even get that running. I just tried a Google Jump (another competitor) 3D VR video at max quality on YouTube and it needed a big chunk of bandwidth. (Approx 15 Mbps) If you want to be taken seriously, I'd want to see some costings and estimates on your storage and bandwidth requirements. As you will be looking at some BIG numbers here. (I performance test networks for a living) A vague ""oh, we'll probably use Amazon S3"" doesn't cut it. I use AWS cloud machines to swarm test networks. I have to provide detailed costing on the instances, what type they are, how long they'll be in use, why I'm using one region over another, etc etc. And I'm one guy working for a decent sized UK tech firm. You are supposedly a team of experts, but are providing no detail worth seeing.  You're talking about a highly technical project here. With some BIG technical requirements if it's going to work. But giving virtually (no pun intended) no detail.     I am the easiest portion of your target market. A VR enthusiast. Nothing about this project has enthused me so far. Sorry.  I'll keep watching this. Out of interest. But I have the feeling I'll either be watching a sinking ship, or a team scurrying off with a load of ICO money they have no intention of following through on.  (And if the beta/preview/whatever version fails to appear before the ICO, then I'm calling scam on this. It's all WAY too vague and unrealistic. But you've said it will appear, so that won't happen right?)   PS .... I hope you prove me wrong. I really do. Because I'm a VR enthusiast, and an early investor in the technology. I've spent a fair chunk of cash on it already and I want it to succeed. But this whole project sounds like it was made up in the pub one night ....",False

I'd just like to point out that none of the big streaming platforms (youtube, twitch, etc.) was focusing on profit at the beginning. Getting userbase is always first. I don't know what kind of content Spectiv will be offering on the platform but I hope it wont be 360 of some guys garden footage. I see you are sceptic about it and that's a good thing - you bring lots of valid points. For example I also wonder about bandwidth and storage costs as VR videos can be huge - SpectivVR can you elaborate more on this matter?

Stop the clock.   I wasn't in a position to watch videos earlier today. Only read and post.  So everything I've posted on here up to now, is 100% based on reading. I read this entire thread. I looked for ICO DD's on it. I looked on Reddit. I googled. A lot.  That formed my opinion up to this point.    I'm just finishing watching this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhLlXfdbN3I    My opinion has changed.  I'm not quite finished watching it yet. But I already changed my mind on one point.  I don't think this is a cash grab/scam.  I'll post fully what I think once I finish the video ....    For reference.....  I'm probably double the age of the guy in the video. (Either of them)  I do due diligence on anything I'm going to put money in. ICO madness has not affected this guy.  Been into IT since I was at school. Studied it. Worked in IT for 20+ years. I mainly do non-functional testing. I stress infrastructures. Networks. Websites. Databases. Etc etc. Basically, people give me software, services, whatever ... and tell me how great they are. And then I break them. First dozen years or so in financial services. Last few years with a large EPoS manufacurer.  But I'm also a gamer since the Atari days.  And been into/around VR since DK1. I have a Vive now. A dedicated rig for it. A dedicated room in my house for it. And a BoboVR for dicking around using phone-VR.  So this ICO interested me. I had noticed it via the ""bounty hunters"". (They worked on that front. But MAN they can be annoying with the constant shit-posting in this thread ...)    Anyway. Gonna finish watching that interview .....",False

I stick with my post above. I don't think it's a scam.  But .....  I still won't be buying in.   First thing. The interview itself was pretty bad. ""Cool. Cool."". ""Absolutely. Absolutely."". The interviewer was .... ummm .... pretty bad.  But that's incidental.   I admire the enthusiasm for VR. I suspect I agree with a lot of your thinking there. Broadly.  But as a business/investment?  Nope. It's blue sky thinking. And little more.  The concept was not clear. Why you need crypto is not clear. It doesn't sound like you do. We run loyalty programs at work. Clients use custom URL's (online) and it routes back through various EPoS (which are connected obviously) and other online endpoints. I know what it takes to build and manage a system like that. I break ours on a regular basis. We don't use Crypto.  ""Having an token you can use in VR just made total sense. You don't want to be putting 16 digit numbers in and stuff ....""  Um. No. You buy you in game tokens. You go in video/game. You use your tokens. As you even said in the video! Buy up front. Use in game/video (this chopped and changed a lot throughout). How do you get the crypto? You buy it. When? With what? Crypto didn't seem to serve much purpose. Lots of ""we could do this"", ""yeah we could try that"", ""we're thinking about that"". But nothing concrete. What are we buying into here? At one point you say the signal token could used on any other platform. VR is just what you want to do it with? So ..... surely the signalling system is the actual crypto part? VR is actually incidental here?  The other token (Specs?) is not crypto. Because it needs to be controlled. But then your sending it to ShapeShift. And then someone else is processing it for you. As fiat? But then giving you money back. And you put it in a user account. But you don't handle any transactions? And then I'm sure at some point you turned it into Signals .... to pay content providers or something? As there would be no ad money early on? How is all this happening?!?!? Everything is turning into everything else? WHAT?!?!?!?  So I'm investing in a crypto that could be used elsewhere. A (maybe?) non-crypto tipping token? Some sort of platform that is not a DAPP (thank fuck .... Ethereum could never support something on that scale just now) that sounds like a VR bastard-child of YouTube and Periscope. And maybe Twitch. But you already said yourself they claimed the gaming streaming space. Why wouldn't they just start doing VR too?  Initial content? Very limited.  Exclusives? The guys you mention who make videos. Who are currently on YouTube. Will they be dropping YouTube and becoming exclusive to you?  With no ""too mature"" content.  That you guys will build, manage, moderate, expand and maintain to the point you become the defacto VR landing spot.  I think.   Holy shit.   And there is where the real problems start.  Nothing is costed. Or estimated. Because you don't quite know what you're trying to build yet.  Revenue? I don't see where any comes from when it goes live? (Not ads - as you admit) People buying to tip? Why does the ERC token have any value? Why is it even an ERC token? How will it gain value? Why? I'm still not clear there after reading everything I could find AND watching that video. But you have a slushfund from the crowdsale? Which you could use? What?!?!? So we're investing to pay some guy with a devaluing token to upload shitty videos? You kept talking about quality, but then about people submitting their own stuff. The two tend to be polar opposites. ""Maybe"" partnerships or exclusives in the future. ""Maybe"" live VR gaming watching. Or sharing a theatre. Some in VR. Some not. What is this?!?!? Make up your mind!  You're guessing about advertising techniques that barely exist but talking about $100k ads in your white paper?!?!?  This is clearly VERY early stage stuff.   So nah. I admire your train of thought. But you don't even have a fleshed out concept. Reason I can't get detail out of you is that you don't have any.  I'll wish you luck and watch to see what eventually comes out of it. Maybe you will prove me wrong. Who knows.  I'm not THAT risk averse. I have a bunch of money in crypto FFS! But this one really is spinning a coin and hoping it stops on it's side if you ask me.  (I actually did that once. So it's a totally valid analogy. I KNOW how fucking rare it is ...)   ",False

(And are now paying $50m to encourage content creators)  http://uk.businessinsider.com/r-facebooks-virtual-reality-unit-oculus-shutters-film-studio-2017-5  What make you think this could work instead? I've been involved with VR for years. The demand for video is not big. The bandwidth needed to stream it to a lot of people is huge. The costs of licensing any sort of big sporting even are also huge. Go look up how much FIFA sold the rights for the 2018/2022 world cups for!  I just don't see how this can work. It doesn't offer anything new or make anything better.  They offer 360 videos. Home made ones. And maybe a free google cardboard style viewer. That seems to be about it. I'm into VR and this doesn't interest me at all.  YouTube already does everything this wants to do. For free. And comes pre-installed on pretty much every phone on the planet (and one of their main ""partners"" already has a channel on there full of 360 content). And these guys want to take that on?!?!? Why would anyone go to the trouble of using this over YouTube? (Or Vimeo, or Facebook ..... who also offer 360 video .... I imagine there are others too.)  And there is almost no technical discussion in this thread. Or talk of tie up deals. Just loads of people chasing bounties ....   The few technical questions I could find (I have now read this entire thread) got either ignored, or got vague meaningless answers. Without a beta platform, some decent technical detail, and a shitload more info on who they are trying to partner with (and how they will host and support this .... all I could find was ""probably Amazon S3""), you're buying into nothing much here.  I'm into VR. And I'm into crypto. And I work in IT. And nothing about this ICO appeals to me. That seems wrong given my interests.  I would be interested to see some decent detailed comment from the actual team, rather than bounty hunters shooting this down simply to try and prop up their bounty payments.  They mentioned on 15 July a ""pre-alpha"" demo should be available within 30 days. So that should now be available before the ICO right?  Also, I saw several replies from the team saying they had no plans to get this on any exchanges??? They would leave that up to the community. Why? That doesn't make any sense to me. As it stands, they will have a big pile of Ether (which they can cash in) and you will have a token you can't trade anywhere?!?!? And will have to petition to get it on exchanges if ever want to trade it. Can the team explain why they are not dealing with the exchanges themselves?",False

As an early adopter of VR, this interests me and I've been reading through this thread (although WAY too much of it is about bounties and worries about prices/Aug 1st etc. Not enough about the actual project itself!). I quoted this post as some sort of beta I can look at pre-ICO would be a ""must have"" for me.  Background: I work in IT. Have done for 20+ years. Fair amount of development experience. Lots of non-functional testing experience. Mainly load/performance/network testing and test automation. Have been involved with/using VR since Oculus DK1 stage. Currently own a Vive. Had a launch version Oculus as well, but sold that as I prefer Vive. Also have a phone adapter type headset (a BoboVR - one of the better ones on the market).  So, how do think this weighs up as an ICO?  Sorry, but I have HUGE doubts.    Taking it mainstream? OK. Fine. Already trying to do that are: Steam, Oculus (backed by Facebook), Samsung, Sony, YouTube, Google etc etc. There are already a LOT of big players pushing this. What makes me think an unknown crypto can do a better job? Nothing.  Platform. An indy VR platform. OK. There are already a few of those. And they are pretty well known in the VR community. Plus Steam already allows homebrew software and YouTube allows any user supplied content. Google Play store has plenty indy VR stuff for the phone headset market. Again, some big, established, players you're going up against.  360 degree video? Is a niche within a niche. I have VR. Have done for a long time. How much do I use 360 vids? Almost not at all. Quality is king. Will be people be interested in user submitted content? (Which is no different to YouTube), no, not really. Highly unlikely to pay for it. Also, streaming it will require major bandwidth. Things like football and major sporting events? Yeah. Great. But the licensing and rights to stream stuff like that is a hugely expensive area dominated by MASSIVE global players. To stream stuff like this legally, I don't see this having much chance. If you can provide some concrete proof of partnerships in this arena, that might give me some hope, but just saying you plan to in a white paper? Not enough for me. As you say yourself, license agreements like that require good user numbers (which means BIG bandwidth requirements to support it). But how do you get the user numbers first? Not with home-made 360 vids, I can tell you that. VR users have had to endure months and months of homebrew shitware just to get where they are now. Their appetite for more of the same is ..... lets just be nice and say ""very low""!  Free headset? At best, it's going to be a junk version mobile phone type set. Anyone thinking these compare with Oculus/Vive/PSVR .... nope. Sorry. Not even close. I don't see this as much of an incentive to anyone.  A lot of the things mentioned in here - porn, games (obviously), interior design, medical applications, are already either in development or available elsewhere. I struggle to see how this will offer anything over the established markets.  The advertising numbers in the white paper seem HUGELY optimistic to me. $100k for an advert on your platform? Who on earth is going to be paying those kind of numbers!  End result, much as I love VR, and expect and hope it will grow in coming years, I don't see how this offers anything new and it will be going up against some established players in an already niche market. The tokens themselves don't seem to server much purpose to me, and the dual token only makes it more confusing as to where the value lies.  I'll keep watching this, but I won't be buying into the ICO. I suspect, at best, it's a huge long term bet ....",False

Here are the problems I have:  -Users are going to have to buy VR headgear to use your software.  I personally would not go out to buy VR gear just to use this platform even if the VR gear only cost $20.  This also creates another barrier for someone to use your website.  -You talked too much about youtube/twitch.. and the way you answered questions sounded like it is a dream than you actually having an actionable plan.  -Your token and coin point system is too confusing and seems unnecessary.  -I don't believe you are going to be able to draw viewers to your website.  People also are not going to magically start using your website even if your successfully pull everything off.  You cannot suddenly steal viewers from twitch and youtube and I think your USP is too weak to succeed.  -This one was the deal breaker for me. Your max cap is way too high.  Sure there have been ICOs before you with nothing built and getting a lot of funding, but things are changing and asking for $40m with just a mockup on your website is just insane.  To me it sounds like you are asking for $40m to start a fun school project of yours.  Lastly, VR is always going to be interesting, but from keeping up with the thread and also watching the interview.. I just don't believe you are going to be able to execute.  Also you should have practiced not saying 'like' 'like' before the interview.",False

How can you launch the final version by Q2 next year?

But there is no indication that either of these were successful and why you stopped both of them?  -Your team is quite young.. what preparations have you been making in seeing this project is a success?  -Lastly looking at the team it looks like you are going to have to hire a lot of outside programmers to the team which I think will definitely slow down development.

However this does not take away that you are still trying to raise $14million for this ICO based on an idea. Also you are planning to hold onto $60million token which if valued the same will be worth $9.6 million. So all in all you will,be potentially in charge of $23.6million... Let's be honest you hope to have operational costs in the future, your negotiations for licensing could stall or hit a wall... what then? Will you return the money...? Nope doubt it.  I don't mean to piss on your ICO but like I said, such greed and money grabbing attempts will make crypto seem like a sham and cause a bubble. If you fail to deliver a working product this will be called a scam. Personally as an investor I would invested if you had your ICO a bit further down your road map when more critical elements of the platform were in the bag. But even then how would I know I can trust your info.  So FOMO will not guide me here...

Spectiv will act as the first adopter for this protocol, generating real-world application data to support future adoption by other media platforms.        Virtual Reality Streaming         Alpha Platform  (Launch: Week 1 November)  The Spectiv VR Alpha V1 will be a fully functional VR streaming platform that will allow users to upload content, view content, create channels/accounts, subscribe, and more. This Alpha V1 will be technologically advanced by industry standards, supporting Rift / Vive VR viewing directly through web browser. This is all in addition to our desktop and mobile headset functionalities. We have partnered with several VR content producers who will be porting a wide selection of quality content to this Alpha, and we are excited to share these experiences with our supporters.                       SIGs will be publicly sold through an open token sale event. The sale will begin on 12/08/2017 at 2:00PM (GMT -5) and will run through 12/29/17. The number of SIGs sold will determine the total number of SIGs created. The public token sale will be capped at US$40MM. The sale will end immediately if the max cap is reached. The crowdsale will be hosted at www.spectivvr.com. Any amounts sold through the presale, private sale, and early access sale will not count towards the $40MM cap. These amounts will also be made public on the token sale portal the day of the sale.  SIGs will be sold at a fixed price of $0.50 each. Early crowdsale participants will have the opportunity to buy SIGs at a discount to this price, based on the timing of their purchase. SIGs will be sold through 4 levels, with each level representing an early bird bonus opportunity. The earlier the purchase, the greater bonus that can be expected. This system essentially rewards buyers in extra SIGs for showing early support and engagement. Additionally, if you subscribe to our email list at www.spectivvr.com, you will have early access to the token sale and an exclusive 60% token bonus. These is to reward our supporters, and ensure they are all able to participate in the token sale. This       Pricing and Bonuses    Presale: August 27th-Sept 4th  The Spectiv presale was executed in partnership with Sutton Stone exclusively for early supporters of the project. Presale participants were required to pass qualification screenings in compliance with OFAC and other KYC checks. All presale participants engaged in a personalized SAFT with Spectiv, LLC. All presale transactions have been audited and verified by global public accounting firm, Baker Tilly. This presale was conducted with a pioneering standard for security and regulatory consciousness. Proceeds from the token presale have recently been released and are being used to build the platform alpha and raise awareness for the project.  The amounts sold in the Presale are as follows: 3,548 ETH, 32 BTC, and $58,000 USD                                       Additional Contributors:  Ned Scott - Founder of Steemit  Ned gave us insight into his experience with Steemit’s Steem Token. Talking to Ned helped us hone in on the economic behaviors and attention dynamics that will drive Spectiv’s Signal Token. Ned is not actively advising for Spectiv, but our meetings with him helped us shape our direction for the Sigs protocol.  Joe Urgo - Co-Founder of District0x  Joe was one of the most important earlier contributors who assisted us in fleshing out the Spectiv Token Model. Joe was a key advisor in suggesting the idea of attention markets and the value that they could bring to the Spectiv platform. Based on the feedback that Joe provided us, we eventually came up with the idea for rewarding content curators and created Signal tokens to do this. Joe is not actively advising for Spectiv while he is currently hard at work with District0x. As we move forward though, we do expect to have further discussions with Joe and possibly bring him back on board as an advisor.       At the most fundamental level, we are implementing an escrow that will oversee and regulate release of funds – all crowdsale funds will be received to a multisig wallet controlled by 3 independent actors:   1. CoinVault ATM CEO, Sheldon Weisfeld 2. Sutton Stone 3. Spectiv Virtual Reality, LLC.                                 Participants should be confident that payments made for SIGs are directly attributed to benefits on the platform and the provision of better and more exciting experiences. With that said, the Spectiv Company has established assurances and transparent policies that will directly govern the revenues received through the token sale.   Spectiv’s first level of token sale security will come from the smart contract itself. The second level of security is via multi-signature for the release of revenues.  At the most fundamental level, we are implementing an escrow that will oversee the release of revenues – all revenues will be controlled by 3 independent actors, as follows:  1. CoinVault ATM CEO, Sheldon Weisfeld 2. Sutton Stone LTD 3. Spectiv LLC  Revenues received through sale will be locked in an escrow wallet until the Spectiv Company’s audit process has been successfully completed and distributed to all purchasers. Once SIGs have been distributed, escrow actors will be able to approve the release of token revenues to USD where they will be held in either Spectiv LTD or Spectiv LLC. The receipt of moneys in Spectiv LTD shall be used to account for Spectiv’s Mauritian team and the rest transferred to Spectiv’s LLC account evenly over two separate disbursements, contingent on the achievement of predetermined milestones tied to the benefit of the community.  The disbursement schedule is outlined here:  (i) 1⁄3 of revenues will be transferred immediately following the distribution of SIGs purchased through sale for payment of the smart contract build for the token sale process. This will be used to cover long-term development and updates for the Signal Token protocol. These revenues will also support development for the Spectiv platform – specifically in driving exciting, high-quality VR content to the site. A minor allocation will be used to support general business operations and infrastructure setup for the company.  (ii) 1⁄3 of revenues will be transferred upon launch of the beta platform. These revenues will be used to fuel the next stage of token development and expansion. This will include bringing in other media platforms to build attention economies on the Signal Token protocol using Spectiv’s use-case data. Additionally, these revenues will be used to optimize the Spectiv platform, build a user base, and reach licensing agreements with mainstream organizations to broadcast popular events. These revenues, amongst other things, shall be used to support the long-term business operations for Spectiv, including development and platform maintenance expenses.  (iii) 1/3 of revenues shall be retained in the Mauritian entity to be used for content production, administration of the community, global events and the like.

There is a max cap of 45000Eth, so if that is raised, the crowdsale will close early.  SpectivVR, more than 10 weeks before the crowdsale end date and i think that your requirement to do 10 posts per week for so long time is too high for bittalk users. I recommend you to review this condition and reduce the number of posts per week to attract regular forum participants.",False
