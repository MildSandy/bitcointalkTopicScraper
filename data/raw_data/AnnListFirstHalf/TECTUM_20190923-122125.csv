Cryptectum does not offer such a gain like Ethereum or Bitcoin did last year. Our efford is to bring the real estate investment to all people and profit from, also to have a secure and stable investment in their portfolio. Cryptectums return is a little bit less but a real estate`s value is nearly impossible to go to 0$.  Early investors are able to make higher profits, because if token holders agree, more tokens will be created and sold at the actual price of token, so Cryptectum will grow and Tectum token has than the chance to get more liquid.  I agree it would not be easy to list on exchanges with a low supply, but investors will always be able to sell/buy token if they want to because of decenteralized exchanges like etherdelta.com  Jakob Hürlemann",False

The Cryptectum uses blockchain technology to refine a highly proven investment strategy in Switzerland - the investment in real estate. Rental of real estate in Switzerland has been an extremely lucrative investment with up to 8% return per annum for a very long time without interruption. Unfortunately, the minimum investment amounts required to buy a property are very high, as, for example, 3-room apartments in a city already cost over one million Swiss francs. This is where the Cryptectum comes in and, with the help of blockchain technology, allows small investors to profit from the rental of real estate.  Via crowdfunding Cryptectum collects funds, acquires a property and rents them out. Blockchain technology in turn helps to distribute rental income to investors in the simplest and most cost-effective way. In addition, the Cryptectum maintains the acquired property, which is a big plus for the investor, since he does not have to worry about it.  With Cryptectum, investors get the opportunity to benefit from the Swiss real estate market for as little as $ 1 investment. Investing in Cryptectum is a solid investment with a relatively high return and low risk.  ICO period: Pre-ICO on the 27th Mai 2018. Duration until 17th of June 2018 Blockchain: Ethereum Token name: Tectum Price of Token: 1$ (To be paid in Ethereum, conversion rate will be set in the beginning of the ICO) Distribution in ICO: 85% How funds are held: Multisignature wallet Role of Token: Profit sharing and voting Minimum investment goal: 150'000$ (Pre-ICO 125'000$) Maximum investment cap: 80'000'000$ (Pre-ICO 1'000'000)   We have a very fair token distribution:   Different rentability scenarios:    The Smart Contract  Cryptectum is based on a Smart Contract on the Ethereum Blockchain. For every dollar you contribute you receive a token. With that token you are entitled to the income stream of the rental fees and/or the increase of value of the assets that are in the hands of Cryptectum. The distributions of rental fees is done by buying and burning tokens on the exchanges. If no tokens are available to buy, Cryptectum reinvests the rental fees. With the tokens you can also vote on investment decisions. Without consent of the tokenholders, no properties are bought. Furthermore you can vote about capital increases. So without the consent of the majority of tokenholders, no further tokens are issued.    Our timeline for the ICO:    The Team:    https://www.cryptectum.com",False

We are not existing? All of us can be found on LinkedIn etc., we are not ghosts.  Maybe you are used to see ca. 50 people for simple projects, but if you need more than 1-2 people to program a Smart Contract, the people are useless and incompetent. And the remaining 3 people are sufficient to run a small real estate company. Don't forget, we don't create a new blockchain technology, we use an existing blockchain (Ethereum).

We intensively discussed that thing...  Cryptectum will start as a small company, getting bigger a little bit slower, but more wealthy. The ICO is planned to be just the beginning of a real estate fund, that gives good profits to the investor over a long time. So we decided to break down the team of what it really needs, holding salaries as small as possible in the beginning. The funds to be rised are low 1250000$ that is enough to start a real estate company and buy a real estate for rental income but not that much that you need a lot of employers.  Cryptectum offers proposals in their smart contract so while the company is running the investors can vote about a capital increase. Out of that Cryptectum gets bigger and will need more employers but right now we are convinced that helding the team small, will get more profit for the investors. Our target is not to get rich quick with an ICO, rather building up a real real estate company which is still here in 5 or 10 years.
