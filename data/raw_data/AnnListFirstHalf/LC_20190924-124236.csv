In the gameplay I can see no big changes. Its the opposite, atm. no elite monsters, dragons, clan runs available.  I showed Lordmancer to my mobile games addicted friends yesterday and they said: ""Nothing changed till now, the same bugs as monthes before, would never play this boring game.""  This is serious and you will make a big error, if you don't play the game by yourself.  1. You should play the game by yourself. 2. For Level 50 players the game makes no sense since weeks, because they can't get experience and quests are senseless. 3. You need urgently a bug reporting system! 4. Change the menu at windmill and watermill. If in the game is a delay and you tap on the crystal item, you loose crystals instead of gold. 5. The new UI has two  new buttons for Autoplay ""Auto"" and ""End Turn"", when fighting. These buttons overlay some fields on the game, playing impossible.. So you can't tap on the game field. This is a big design error, would not happen, if the coder would play the game. 6. Teleportation doesn't work, you only can go 1 field, instead of teleport. 7. No ""SELL"" button in the shop, only ""BUY"" is available. 8. Daylie task bug is still not fixed. You have to rejoin the game, to get the proper task view. 9. BUY-SELL bug is not fixed. You have to rejoin the game, to see a recently selled item in the shop. 10. If you want to buy an item in the shop, you dont see, how many crystals or gold it will cost, you have manually to click on the item. With hundreds of items, this will be very exhausting. 11. Chat menu: No possibility to delete user. 12. Tap bug: You sometimes have to tap 3 times still the game reacts. This alone was the reason, why my brother uninstalled the game after 15 min. of playing. 13. On talents tab the ""Lv.40"" text f.e. is sometimes not well to read, in general the proportion of the text font and the color arrangement is not optimal. 14. Colors in the chest are not optimal. Green for buying and brown for getting free, it should be the other way round. 15. If the bag is full you get no notice, like the red alert circle before. 16. Heavy disbalances in the game, but maybe this comes from the updates, because if I am lvl. 50 now and had played from the beginning with the new items, maybe I would have better items.   Suggestions: 1. The map should be scrollable in the game. 2. Create different enemies, you can choose an archer f.e. and all archers beside with the same Lvl. include the same armies. 3. In the bag there could be an additional filter which hides zero balance items. If you have no Durable cord f.e., I often want to hide it.   I dont wanted to be rude, but I fear if you dont listen to the community and some suggestions were made several times, you will not achieve your goals. The game have to be good, the interface to crypto will not be something special in the future, because every game producer will add them fast in the future. I am also aware, this is beta version, but some of the bugs are reported monthes ago and nothing changed.",False

But isnt it a little bit boring, that all items have the same properties? The graphics are nice, but it doesnt matter, if you have a helm or a hat or a cap, all have the same properties. Only the color of the items brings a little variety into the game. You should really play yourself the game for a while, then you would discover some very annoying things in the handling of the game. Withdrawing things, f.e. magic dust, from the storage with the +sign is very long-lasting and typing it with the smartphone keyboard is long-winded, the slider was much better.

We understand that you are waiting for LC to be listed on some big exchanges. But the answer is that now we have enough money to complete the development, but the amount is quite small for really big exchanges. So our focus now is to develop the game, to publish it, to develop the in-game market and then Lord Coin will be more fetching for exchanges.  So my answer is: if we try to list Lord Coin on any big exchange now, we will spend a big part of our investments on it and in that case, we will be very limited in development - as someone said creating a game requires a lot of money. And obviously, it won't lead to token price growth. So we need to complete the game at first and then it will be easier to list Lord Coin on new exchanges.

You cant mine coins in the game. And I think this is a big failure in advertizement. Everywhere I can read ""A game where you can mine cryptocurrency"". You can't mine, because all Lordcoins are already mined. So people who play this game for the first time are frustrated, because they have to buy coins and can't get them in the game.  In my opinion it would have been better, if the mining process would be in the game, like you can collect gems at ""mineguards"".

Thanks for questions! My answers are below.     There will be a special service on the site in which you will be able to transfer Lord Coins to or out your game account. You will have three ways to buy Lord Coins: 1. Directly on crypto exchanges (the cheapest way) 2. By using a special web service with fiat money (but you will have to pay a fee about 5%) 3. By exchanging Crystals to Lord Coins inside the game (the easiest, but Lord Coin price will be the hightest due to comission of Apple or Google)   If so what is the incentive for the people to purchase with token rather then crystal or gold?  Crystals and gold don't have a real worth outside the game, and Lord Coins have.    Mechanics of the game are good and i can see people getting into it and a nice crowd base growing..

Lordmancer II is a big MMO RPG title on mobile, something like World of Warcraft which uses cryptocurrency to let its players earn real money while playing. Our goal is to create a game where virtual values have their real worth. It means that time spent in the game will be rewarded! It is a dream of all players.  Games of this kind have a huge lifespan, easily 5 to 7 years and more. They make good money, too. The whole gaming market was $100 billion in 2016. Two top grossing games of 2016, Clash of Clans and Clash Royale by Supercell saw 2,3 billion USD in revenues, combined.  Last year Lordmancer II was selected among only 10 indie projects by Global Top Round, a U.S.-based gaming accelerator, into their program and received a round of VC investment from them. It was a fierce competition since GTR looks at indie projects worldwide, but we made it to the finals.  The game is almost ready, it's in its open beta and can be downloaded from the website for both Android and iOS.  Now we are taking our token sale in order to polish the game and launch it worldwide. We already have raised $200K in 3 days, it is enough to finish the development. We strongly believe that our project will be among the very few ICOs that will really deliver their product to the market.  Bonus stage one ends in just one day. You have a chance to purchase Lord Coins at 20% discount. Join now!  http://lordmancer2.io",False

Should make it so you can LITERALLY mine the altcoin, like with a pickaxe and what not inside the game, kinda like runescape, and make it so there are different pickaxes that you can obtain throughout the game by completing quests or w.e and each pickaxe can mine at a certain speed.  Should also make it so that there are rare, ultra rare, mythic rare, common and uncommon items/weapons/pickaxes in the game, the common ones being easiest to obtain and any noob can easily obtain them, BUT the mythic rare items are very hard to obtain and can only be obtained by completing a certain amount of quests or after reaching a certain level/rank, or by purchasing the item from another player. Should make 1 item in the game be SUPER ULTRA MYTHIC RARE and make it so that there are ONLY like... 2 in existence. these itemz will fetch a very good amount of money/crypto since they would have AWESOME stats, and since there will only be 2 in existence and those 2 that are in existence will have to be obtained by reaching a certain level or completing a lot of quests, this will also make it so that hella people will be racing to be the first to obtain these SUPER ULTRA MYTHIC RARE items before anyone else, which will make people obsess over the game till they obtain those items. Once they are obtained no more will ever exist, ONLY 2....and will then have to be acquired by trade alone. If you create a SUPER ULTRA MYTHIC RARE pickaxe for mining, you can make it so that it mines HELLA faster than any other pickaxe. or something.  But by making only a few of each super ultra mythic rare items it will make it so that those items are collectible, and I can see it now, I can see some people trying to obtain one of each super ultra mythic rare item for their collection and cause their characters would pretty much be considered GODS after obtaining all the super ultra mythic rare items...HAHA. You should actually add that to the game also to make people want to collect one of each item in the game, make it so that whoever obtains at least 1 of each item in the game will become a GOD and their character will have ""GOD ____"" as their label by the character. I am picturing this game being sorta like runescape where people from around the world can all be playing in the same virtual world with each other. i guess that is what an MMORPG is huh..lol.  But yeah. should definitely consider these ideas to add to your game. And if you do make sure to give me some credit for coming up with the ideas Thanks.  Haha.   ",False

Perhaps we could in the future have some epic quest lines, bounty hunter quests (with an NPC in town that would ask you to kill a rondom mini-boss once per day and this mini-boss could spawn in long intervals.)  I also miss some kind of unique faction quest depending on your hero faction and class. This is a great opportunity of some real memorable quests. Like the mage quest could be to restore and old library, collecting forgotten books troughout the maps to get some special item and also to know the lore of the game world. Warriors could have a quest to retake an old city taken by skeletons and zombies, and they would have to roam all the maps searching for supplies and the schematics of the city.  Another thing that I miss is a regulamented PvP. For example, cities could have colisseums and arenas where you could fight other players without losing your troops at the end. The battles could award  rank points making a gladiator carrer something possible (you guys could even add arena-exclusive talents that could be bought with arena points).  Speaking of rank, I think that ranks for fighting other factions armies could be interesting too. It could follow the same aspects that I mentioned above, turning it into a faction war career path.  I have to compliment the size of the maps, it's really good. But I also think that the addition of instanced regions could also be insteresting. I know we have dungeons, but we could also have caves and underground maps. These would not be like the dungeons and would not require keys to enter, they would be located around the maps and could mean an increase in the total map size without adding more ""weight"" to the map itself. This would open good quest possibilities and even some new factions in the future like undead and demons.  I'll keep playing and taking notes of things that I think would be good ideas.

RPG and tactical games are our passion. Our mission is to bring ""classical"" game mechanics into mobile platforms.  Lordmancer II is a free to play massively multiplayer online game for mobile devices. One of the main activities in the game is turn based battle like the ones in Heroes of Might and Magic, King’s Bounty, and others. Other activities include discovering a huge fantasy world full of castles. Also, there are clans and crafting. For each player, the game is a never ending story. They can be either a “loner” or join a clan. The ultimate goal for a clan is to dominate the game world by seizing castles and building up military power.  Main game features expandable open game world - hundreds of lands tactical turn based battles (like ones in HoMM) synchronous player interaction including PvP 5 races, 3 classes in each race tens of available units strong RPG model clan wars for Castles  The game is already in open beta test (soft launched on Android in Russia and CIS).  The APK (installation file) for Android devices is available under this link: https://yadi.sk/d/85zAOVhI3ErXSr To receive an iOS version, it is required to install TestFlight application first (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664?mt=8), then send us a request tojoin the testing group using this form: https://vk.cc/6WVSbl  Lord Coin  Lordmancer II encourages using of a cryptocurrency token named Lord Coin (LC) as a payment method for player-to-player trades, facilitating sale of a unique or rare game content. LC tokens can enter the game economy only after being purchased at a cryptocurrency exchange. They can be taken out of the game later and sold for a cryptocurrency. Game developers will provide players who are not familiar with cryptocurrency world with convenient ways to purchase LCs for fiat currencies.  Scheme of token turnover:  Players will be able to trade on an open game market for LCs. When an LC transaction occurs, the game takes a commission of 20%. Half of it is burnt and the other half moves to a special Ethereum wallet named ""Game Funds"". Game Funds tokens are used by the game developer to support operations: server costs, player support, marketing activities.  Burning of a fraction of LCs with every in-game transaction provides for: Constant demand for LCs on the open market Bullish price pressure on remaining LCs.  Scheme of trading between players:  Token sale information  We have issued 20 000 000 units of a token named Lord Coin (LC). The token is ERC-20 compatible, based on Ethereum network.  2 000 000 tokens will be distributed among co-founders and the team 2 000 000 tokens will be held by the company to fund future game development and expansion 1 000 000 will be used for Bounty program and advisers 15 000 000 will be available to ICO investors. All of the unsold tokens in this category will be burned after the ICO is finished.  Intended use of Revenue: Development - 30% Operation - 20% Marketing - 50%  Pre ICO started on the 21th of August and lasted 5 days. 334 ETH were raised. 2'000'000 LCs were sold out, each cost $0,05.

There is the beta version already released. Lordmancer II was selected to Global Top Round game accelerator in Aug 2016 and got $40K seed investment. It shows that we are able to finish the project.  Why is it ""II""? In 2008 the team launched Lordmancer I. It was one of the first online games on Java featurephones! It was a free-to-play game with the same main features: synchronous PvP, an expandable game world, open market, and clan wars. And the most exiting fact is that Lordmancer I is still alive! lordmancer.com  When does the croudfunding campaing start? The Pre ICO round starts August 21th, 2017 at 6:00 am GMT  How to participate? Tokens will be distributed to crowdfunding campaign backers, use any Ethereum client of choice (Geth, Parity, Mist) or Myetherwallet to send ether to a crowdfunding contract address that will be announced on the day campaign starts. Make sure you keep your private keys for the address you used to send ether to the contract safe and secure, this will be the address that also holds your LC token balance. Please do not send ether to Lordmancer crowdfunding contract from wallets hosted by exchanges, make sure you always have your private key.  Can US citizens participate in the token sale? The sale is not open to US citizens. Crowdsale participants must digitally sign a statement that they are not a US citizen. Our token LC will be tradeable after the sale. Interested US participants could buy them on the secondary market.  Why I can't see my LC tokens in my wallet? To see your LC balance in MyEtherWallet and Mist you should manually add it to your wallet.  When LC will be listed on exchanges and which ones? LC will be available on secondary market after campaign ends. We can’t yet announce which ones. While the token sale is still open it wouldn’t make sense to trade tokens anyway, since LC is available to everyone from the crowdfunding contract directly and exchange rate to eth is the same for everyone.  What if all LC tokens are burnt? As 10% of tokens are burnt in each transaction, the token amount will constantly decrease. LC token has 18 decimals and can be splitted. It is calculated that the game will have enough amount of currency for more that 5 years. When the total number of LC tokens will be dramatically decreased, we will issue a new token and offer to exchange remaining LCs for that new one tokens.   .▄▄▄▄▄▄▄      ▄▄▄▄▄▄       ▄▄▄▄▄      ▄▄▄▄▄▄▄ ▄▄▄▄▄▄▄  █░░░░░░░█    █░░░░░░▀▄   ▄▀░░░░░█    █░░░░░░░█░░░░░░░█  ▀█░░░█▀      ▀█░░░░░█  ▄▀░░░░█▀      ▀█░░░█▀ ▀█░░░█▀    █░░░█        █░░░░░░█ █░░░░░░█       █░░░█   █░░░█     █░░░█    ▄▄  █░░█░░░░█░░░█░░░█       █░░░█   █░░░█     █░░░█   █░░█ █░░██░░░░░░██░░░█       █░░░█   █░░░█    ▄█░░░▀▄▄▄▀░░█▄█░░█▄█░░░░█▄█░░░█▄     ▄█░░░█▄ ▄█░░░█▄  █░░░░░░░░░░░░█░░░░░░██░░██░░░░░░░█   █░░░░░░░█░░░░░░░█  ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀▀▀▀  ▀▀  ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀     ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀    Lordmancer II — MMO RPG where you can mine cryptocurrency      ■■■ Pre ICO: 21.08.2017 ■ WhitePaper﻿ ■ ANN﻿ ■ Bounty ■ ICO: 23.10.2017 ■■■    Website﻿ ~ Telegram﻿ ~ FB﻿ ~ Twitter",False
