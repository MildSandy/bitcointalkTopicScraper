Strange question though, for starters, China in 1960s was declared the poorest country in the world, and if you look at how they got out of there, they did it with exports. Actually the acceleration of China’s growth in the 1990s is directly related to the emergence of their Chinese e-commerce giants.  You say (and I agree) “Countries are different”, yes, but if you check with economists they will confirm that exports work in every economy, country differences in growth are not related to exports but on what it is exported. Same as the Chinese e-commerce giants, we are not selective on what it is exported.  Then this statement about launching in countries that don’t have a strong economy. Are you sure that this is not an advantage? Would you prefer that they have a strong economy? How urgent or important would a service like UTEMIS be?...  Regarding case studies: we have the best case studies, we have a list of our current customers, businesses that have already signed with UTEMIS. It’s a verifiable list and in a few days we will announce a new batch of customers. We have businesses in Latin America ourselves, and customers are flocking to our service because, precisely, they want a way out of the hard life that they are having.",False

There are two ways of conducting an ICO. You can either invest in Marketing & PR and FOMO a lot of people or you can build a strong Business Plan and execute from the ground up, build momentum and work hard.  We believe that we are creating a different way of conducting ICOs, not based on big advertising campaigns and 'FOMO-ing' people but instead on projects that work and that have impact.  We are witnessing too many projects that have questionable ideas get funded just because of marketing, this is deleterious to the Cryptocurrency industry in general and to those that want to have meaningful impact.  Our view, is that 220 ETH without any significant investment in Marketing is a terrific success, it's the strength of the project what is convincing these investors.  And these are investors that we are talking to every day on Telegram, they are not every kind of investor, they want to increase their wealth of course but they also want to see positive change in the world.  So, thank you for your question, all we can promise is that we will 'outwork' our ICO, we promise!  UTEMIS Management Team",False

When it comes to Business to Business (B2B) platforms there are two models to follow: In one model companies have insourced distribution and they manage it themselves, this is extremely expensive and operationally extremely intensive, it takes decades to master this model; Amazon is a clear example, note that the company needed many years and more than 6 billion dollars in Venture Capital. The Chinese or Japanese e-commerce giants, opted for adding strict mechanisms of control when it comes to managing the product cycle but the products are ultimately shipped by the seller. We have opted with this model because it’s faster and it is more compatible with the Chinese e-commerce giant that we want to emulate. In fact this system together with the escrow account (a system that guarantees payment and refunds in case the seller underdelivers) is exactly the way that this Chinese e-commerce giant is conducting business nowadays.  If you have more questions please don’t hesitate to ask, we are happy jump at every opportunity that help us explain the UTEMIS’ business model better.",False
