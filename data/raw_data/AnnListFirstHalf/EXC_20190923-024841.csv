In addition to the new partnership, Eximchain also has released a new private testnet, an alternative blockchain used to experiment with its artificial coin. The testnet includes 250 machines across 14 regions globally and has already gone through 8 rounds of trial. Eximchain’s supply chain will help prevent businesses from losing trillions of dollars of potential revenue. Last month, Eximchain closed a successful funding round, raising $20 million from strategic contributors including FBG Capital, INBlockchain, and Hashed.  On YOOsourcing’s mobile app buyers can perform sourcing inquiries directly from a supply company’s profile and reward the positive experiences with a rating system. A crowdsourced factory verification is built into the platform to ensure validity to a displayed businesses identity. By partnership with YOOsourcing, suppliers using the Eximchain platform can monitor their inquiries, promote new products, and grow their reputation to garner future business leads. Eximchain’s blockchain network will serve to increase the trust and accountability of data and agreements shared between buyer suppliers on YOOSourcing’s platform.  The company’s private testnet (https://github.com/eximchain) ensures privacy, scalability and security to the user. It is a public permissioned network with a quadratic voting based governance mechanism to manage consensus participants. Usually, ‘distributed’ testnet systems, and the tools to manage them, operate in simulated, small, local contexts, posing a problem for enterprises and protocol developers who should require decentralized networks to be scaled elastically through a security hardened service to actually test how the distributed systems they have built will perform a larger, global networking scale.  Eximchain’s platform is user-friendly, allowing businesses and enterprises to seamlessly integrate its solutions into existing business processes and applications. Eximchain streamlines supply chain processes by reducing barriers, increasing coordination, and instilling trust in cross-border transactions. Current blockchain technology does not meet the supply chain industry’s needs, including public transaction data, uncertain network security, and advanced IT knowledge of the system configuration.  Eximchain showcased a live demo at two events in April; GMIC Global Blockchain Summit in Beijing on 27 April 2018 and World Digital Assets Summit in Singapore on 1–3 May 2018.",False

It is estimated that shareholders lose over $5.2 trillion in potential revenue each year due to the lack of transparency, connectivity, and agility in the global supply chain.  A group of MIT graduates thinks there’s better solution. The Eximchain project started in 2015 at MIT with the mission of providing blockchain-enabled tools to transform the global supply chain by integrating SMEs and increasing transparency. (They received valuable mentorship from the MIT Media Lab, made it to the final round of MIT $100K Accelerate Competition, and completed the Plug And Play Fintech Accelerator.) After graduating in June and publishing their whitepaper, the team began searching for their first use case in Asia, where SMEs are heavily concentrated.   With the goal of powering the supply chain of the future, Eximchain will create a smart-contract-based ecosystem that allows companies to quickly build customized, end-to-end supply chain solutions with data privacy. Different participants can derive different values from the ecosystem: sourcing platforms or rating agents can use the Proof of Existence (PoE) functionality to demonstrate data ownership without revealing transaction information, suppliers can seize early payment discounts from downstream buyers to improve working capital, and logistics partners can automate the reconciliation process across different systems to save time and reduce cost.   Eximchain’s first large user base comes from Trade Manager, a Big Data platform that helps buyers find suppliers based on their transaction records. A pilot is scheduled to make blockchain-based Supply Chain Sourcing solutions available to over 50k SME users on the Trade Manager platform. The $20m Eximchain is raising this round will be used not only to build out the product but also to empower the SME community and to set a new standard for enterprise use of blockchain solutions in the global supply chain.
