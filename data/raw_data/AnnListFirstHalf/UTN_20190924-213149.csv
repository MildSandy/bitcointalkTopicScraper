Today Universa is incredibly happy to announce another one from the series of hidden projects that have been developed behind the doors during the last months. It took about 4000 man-hours of hard work to build it, but now it is publicly available on Github (https://github.com/UniversaBlockchain/U8): meet U8 (https://kb.universablockchain.com/u8_home/150)!  What is it? In short, it is a runtime environment for running the Universa networking systems, be those servers or clients. Ubot servers (https://kb.universablockchain.com/glossary%3A_ubot/208) will be running on U8. Universa nodes (https://kb.universablockchain.com/glossary%3A_node/177) – may appear too (and a test implementation is available in the published code already). Some future GUI-enabled smart contracts may run on U8. Parsec-server will be working on it too.  Why is it? We’ve started Universa initially as the Java-focused development, enjoying the performance of Java, its safety, and simplicity for the developers. But the recent (Java 8 and higher) changes in the JDK licensing by the Oracle made it harder to ensure the Java stability in the production for Java users – they either have to always follow the very last major upgrade of JDK (happening about each 6 months), or purchase a commercial license. So we need a runtime environment and the programming language which have the high performance, the language safety and the programmers productivity all at once.  How does it work? Now, when it is done already – it looks so easy and obvious… C++ high-performance backend, containing the low-level (and high-speed) implementations of key and most important Universa-specific parts (such as, but not including, the networking and the cryptography primitives). On top of the C++ backend, works the V8 (https://v8.dev/) JavaScript engine (known for running JavaScript sources heavily optimizing them, and for supporting the latest JavaScript standards and syntax sugar). On top of V8, run the Universa-specific and business-logic-containing JavaScript sources. You get the convenience (and the safety) of the latest JavaScript, and the performance of C++. All at once.  Note this is a Work-In-Progress yet, for your early access. It may be a duckling yet – but no more an ugly duckling; and now you can see with your own eyes how its gets the strong wings and takes off.   … But this is not the only or the last one of the projects to surprise you, so stay tuned and wait for even more even surprising news. We’ve faced the problems with the heavily centralized process of Java development – and built U8. We've faced the problems with the heavily centralized processes of regular Internet DNS domains purchasing and owning, as well as of the HTTPS certificate signing by the CAs – and by now you are probably wandering, what does that “Parsec” word means from several paragraphs before?..",False

Quote A year ago, in 2018, when the crypto-currency market was experiencing a monstrous deficit, our company engaged in copywriting received an interesting, albeit unusual task: “whitewash” the reputation of a man - Alexander Borodich. To do this, we had to do a surprisingly large amount of work, because at that time he was associated with several high-profile problem cases, including with comrade Lipatov. The scandal was so loud that it even wrote “Vedomosti” (https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2018/07/26/776644-universa), and here (https://finside.ru/unversa070318/) the original post of Lipatov with all the “fried” details is given. ... In addition to writing articles about how Holy he is and how great his blockchain is, there was a war in the comments, all mentions of his name or his company were tracked, dialogues were instantly started and so on. In short, was created by private industry trolls Borodich... Here I would like to make a small reservation: the fact that we are in the course of its activities seriously followed all the events around the life of Borodich and the Universe, and knew that no blockchain is really not in sight, and all that is described on the website of the project - pure fiction... Realizing that the probability of getting your money tends to zero, we decided to “roll back” all the work done. It is obvious that the fraudulent lifestyle of Borodich involves constant travel, meetings and promises, which, of course, will never be fulfilled. For example, domain Universa.io doesn't work anymore, what a coincidence. But the project attracted 28 million. Where is the money, Alexander?",False

Still believing a bit in some success of project mainly just because there is almost no other reason to keep this charade playing except the reason that the team at least WILL to make things happen. All other (fraudulent) possibilities bleed with time, the last probable fraudulent possibility is to create a false alibi and run unsuccessfull project (unsuccessfull on purpose) to convince the court that it was a bussiness fail and not an intention. However this risk is still real if we consider some factors ...   You are hinting at too unbelievable possibilities. Universa is a real project with a real long live plan. HODL + implementation in nearest future + long term partnership will affect the price.  Yep. One of the reasons I regret selling mine too early. They are a great project with a great team and development.",False

How do you keep check and balance? How do you know the tokens company’s buys are bought from free and fair from exchanges? How do you know the tokens are not played by two wallets from the universa wallet just to p&d ? There are more questions then answers as the time flies.

There are some situations where the ""soon"" or ""maňana"" or ""пóзжe"" doesnt exist. Not because its crucial for project itself but because its crucial for its any credibility. What to think about a team which doesnt react flexible enough. That they will not react flexible enough when a different kind of problem occurs? For example when something stucks whole network? Will they publish similar kind of statement that ""soon it will be considered to be solved""?

They operate on the basis of only being a ""company,"" who works with other companies. That's it, nothing else matters to them, even then they fail miserably with B2B negotiations.  Universa does care about their investors. That's why we are present on all social media and answer the questions you may have. As for negotiations, we already have many partnerships and pilots.  Quote The best piece of news that's coming for Universa (in over 1.5 years) is their publicly (yes publicly) funded hardware wallet, set to launch at the end of this year. Users don't even have a usable software wallet and yet the team is trying to create the next ledger.  We expect the wallet to be ready in September. We also plan to launch a software wallet but after the launch of the hardware wallet.  Quote They claim price will increase again because of all the pressure from the few community members that remain, but based on what? Based on Bitcoin going back to 20k? If Universa's price increase, it will be pumped and dumped, because it's based only on momentary hype bursts from useless, non-functioning partnership.  You must be mistaken because the team doesn't comment on the price. Again, the negotiations are in place and we will share the details after we have final results. We have also mentioned many times that UTN(-P) is not a coin, it is a token, which price is related not only to the market, but also to it's demand. And demand itself is going to increase by multiple factors.  Quote Don't invest in this coin, there are many, many other projects that have gone above and beyond what the Universa team has done or is trying to do, with greater efficiency, transparency and technological capabilities, while caring about their community dearly. Because they know, a good crypto doesn't derive value on false promises, missed deadlines, lack of transparency, inadequate development and non-existent marketing.  You may have a wrong perception about our technology. It seems that you were concerned about the fact that the recipient has to confirm the receipt of the tokens.

In spite of your claims about our job being 'bad', we managed to deliver, maintain and improve the product and its functionality (beta.mainnetwork.io). Have you got any specific concerns about its work? 2. We do care. Otherwise, the chat groups and other media would not be administrated and the community would receive no news at all. I am glad that it is not the case.  >They released a beta swap and whe have people stuck utn tokens almost 7-8 months that is not acceptable at all , and the team does not even considering refund at all saying they will get double up it will be fixed bla bla soonn come 7 months are you kidding me also they are main reason you did find the bug and fixed it DUUHHH It is funny you should bring that up, because many of those issues already got resolved. Let alone some of the users decided to swap all at once, albeit seeing the initial swap order failed, and, therefore, got all of the orders failed. Some tried to use both web clients simultaneously for whatever reasons. And everyone was warned about the beta test nature of the new client (hence, 'beta' in the web address) implying that bugs may be expected at the early stages. By the way, no 7-8 issues were encountered later on. At least, no issues attributed to the work of the mainnet. Some issues have not been solved, yet the team members are constantly working on it.  >they promised a second AMA end of year 2018, still not been done almost 5 months in overtime ceo saying he is busy  come on nobody is so busy almost 5months and dont have a 1 hour to do a AMA with the communit , feels like Ceo is running away from the AMA because he does not have the answers right now and is not telling the truth to the community. We did promise the second AMA session. And we did get delayed. One may feel whatever one wants to feel and speculate on the bits of information as much as one is willing to. The CEO is, indeed, occupied with significant tasks - he only recently returned back to Russia (after negotiations, of course). By the way, have you notice that Alexander often pops in the group chats on Telegram for little talks?  >Nodes is almost 1 year in overtime people signed up and was going to run nodes but still waiting and no they are saying that ther are no eta at all on the nodes. As it was mentioned earlier many times, we are currently sorting the application forms.  >Hold wallet they promised is also still pre-order since start of the project ceo expecting to come out in september 2019 this really means february 2020 maybe lol. The pictures of the original models were disclosed on Telegram.  >they have explorer wher everthing is closed, no open explorer wher you can check tx or what happenins in the mainnet and which company who used it, so token holders whould not see anything at all. Yes. Was anything different explained in the White paper? Page #5: ""Sensitive business data is not stored flippantly and unwittingly in unknown reaches of the globe, it is encrypted and regulated by strict organizational security practices (ISO 27001, 27002) making it finally possible for enterprises to trust a blockchain with sensitive or private business processes."" I reckon you could check on the Internet what ISO 27001 and ISO 27002 are.  >many thing was promised and not delivered dissipointed as i expected universia whould be a game changer but does not look like it if the team and the ceo change tactic and care for the community i higly doubt with their attitude lately. Indeed, you are correct. Many things were promised and not yet delivered. Nevertheless, the wild space of DLT technologies and crypto assets is rather new, and it appears to be no surprise why some milestones get delayed. I believe it is crucial to encounter and accept that the overall progress of Universa is thriving.  Thank you for sharing the opinion and challenging our objectives.

""Is it possible to migrate database to universa platform ?  And is there any method to create a contract from the old database once it’s been Migrated?"" A.M.: ""The database purpose is to store data; the Universa’s main purpose is to store the validity of the data (though, when using systems like SLOT1, it could store data as well); let’s imagine we are building some Universa-based system to validate the records of the existing database (to be sure they were not tampered with). First and foremost – what kind of database that could be? By default, some would consider to mean RDBMS only, a relational DB, like those regular PostgreSQL/MySQL/Oracle/MSSQL. But that’s not necessary, in fact; and if we consider some other, NoSQL database, then... the document-oriented NoSQL databases (like MongoDB) could be considered a perfect match for Universa! In MongoDB, you store a document, which internally contains some structured data in a JSON-like format; – but that’s actually exactly what is stored in Universa’s smart contracts! The MongoDB “document” can be directly mapped to an Universa’s smart contract. Just decide where you put the document parts into the Universa’s unicon (what goes into the definition section, which is immutable; what goes into the state section; are any extra checks/validations required and should be added). There maybe minor incompatibilities (like, between the types supported by MongoDB’s BSON format, and Universa’s BOSS); but with a simple convertation layer, the types could be mapped bidirectionally. So, basically speaking, some MongoDB’s document in a collection like “car_passport”, with a structure like {""vin"": ""123456"", ""model"": {""brand"": ""Lada"", ""code"": ""2101""}, ""mileage"": 15}, may appear in the Universa’s smart contract, which will have: definition.car_passport = {     ""vin"": 123456,     ""model"": {""brand': ""Lada"", ""code"": 2101} } state.car_passport = {     ""mileage"": 15 }""",False

Now you can actually see the true behaviors of 80% of exchanges out there. It's quite revealing and should be informative to some of you. There are many exchanges like this throughout crypto and almost every crypto is probably bloated by fake volume, especially Bitcoin and most top 30 cryptos. It's really an interesting topic, very little coverage in news and amongst crypto enthusiasts. But, this will be a bigger topic in the future when someone actually wants to take the time and effort to really dig deep, and really find out what a true metric of ""volume"" represents. It's a pretty in-depth and interesting subject. (btw, look for sinusoidal markets ""stable markets"" this is one of many indicators a market is ""faked"")   As for Universa, AB did pay for this. Fake volume doesn't just occur, neither is it offered for free. It was wrapped into the sum he paid for the listing on this exchange, unknowingly or knowingly, that's the real question. I believe he does know, given the circumstance and past efforts to also ""pump up"" the volume on Coinbene (HitBTC prob too), and that was half a mil for 2 months, a service that's not offered lightly or free. Logically, yes he did know for IDCM, because he knew for Coinbene and probably when it was listed on HitBTC aswell. I haven't taken the time, nor do i have records about the HitBTC listing volumes/txs, but it looks pretty fake from CMC, especially that 1 day in may 2018 when the volume went to 0(bot or payment failure), then after the fake volume promo ended on HitBTC (vol went basically back to 0), then a desisting occurred all-together 1-2 months after due to no demand at all for Universa's trash.    I've seen the contracts/agreements of other cryptos and exchanges i've had ties with in the past, who've been offered similar services, by third parties, to ""give them volume on your exchange."" Similarly, most new ICOs are offered such services, but usually under NDAs or unwillingly pay for them in the initial exchange payments. To the extent this goes, i'm not too sure. But, if you're actually buying fake volume, then you'll do your best to hide that secret, because it will destabilize any market. Anything can be bought for a price, never settle for any bullshit telling you otherwise.

Thank you for your questions.  >When at last tokens will be swapped to native coins First, I have to highlight that there are no native coins of Universa. We have got UTN - Universa Mainnet native tokens and UTNP - Ethereum-based tokens. Strictly speaking, UTNP will never be swapped with UTN entirely, since there are always some users who leave their assets for a long while or even forget about them forever. We cannot delete UTNP from the Ethereum network either and no-one can.  >our blockchain will be working and have at last some using? Our blockchain has been working for quite a while. Please, have a look at access.universa.io or beta.universa.io. What kind of using are you seeking? The team and the CEO himself target b2b and b2g sectord of business. However, it takes time from forming a partnership or signing a contract to full implementation or integration. I hope we all understand this.  >The team is doing something or no?

In our opinion, the biggest and the most important misunderstanding of the project (which actually might be the main reason of this preconceived negative point of view) is that you keep using such terms as ICO and coin.  Universa team has claimed many times: we had TGE - not ICO, we have only tokens and never ment to launch a coin.  Unless you are the one of those people who just keep looking for profit instead of joining us as a partner/active user and actually using blockchain for any kind of purpose you may come up with, for now there's no objective reason for your discontent.  Universa is not a scam project for one very reason: you could have withdrawn all your tokens (unless it's 50 free registration tokens) shortly after the TGE on ~x5 basis. No-one forced no-one to chose UTN and wait for the swap to sell for low price. The team cares about community members, which can be proved by simple fact, that either admins or devs (or even CEO himself) are in touch almost 24/7 for you.

IDCM is a fake/scam/shit exchange, it's obvious if you ever looked at any coins, including Universa. 90% of all volumes are faked, it's very very obvious.  And i recommend any of you to look at any market, any order book, any volume transaction. If you understand the basics of what information is presented to you on exchanges, then you will come to understand IDCM is a scammy exchange.  Btw, this isn't the first time AB paid for fake volume, when Universa got listed to another fake/scam/shit exchange Coinbene, they paid (or got) for fake volume there aswell. That was also very obvious by the significant increase in Vol overnight, then when it expired, Universa went to a natural state of around 10k usd volume. Volume doesn't suddenly drop from half a million, to 10k in 1-2 nights, it's virtually impossible. In addition, that volume lasted from September 1st to November 1st, exactly 2 months on the dot. Amazing. Therefore, that's a 98% drop in total volume over 1-2 nights, after exactly 2 months of listing! Not even scamcoins undergo this extreme transformation... fake volume. IDCM will exhibit similar behaviors, but it's obvious by just looking at the order books.       So what does that mean? AB paid/got fake vol for Universa once before on Coinbene, but this ultimately means nothing really. It does show how miserable the demand was for Universa in Q3-Q4.  It does help Universa's appearance to the novices who know little about crypto (which is about 80% of all people who trade/invest in crypto), but most of the real volumes have dropped off significantly and continue to do so; Cobinhood is a reflection of that. If Universa gets pumped again, then there will be an additional marketing aspect to it by appearing in Gain/losers on CMC, by reaching the 50k minimum threshold (ofc faked).  Thus, Universa is in a worse condition then it was prior to IDCM listing.  This should raise more red-flags though, about the manipulative efforts AB is going through to show progress, to show Universa has ""real value."" If he's willing to do this on the markets, then what other major efforts has he taken to fill Universa with hot air? Thus, leading into the very critical nature of all my posts.   As i've stated multiple times, Universa team is made up of amateurs, run by Alexander Borodich, who's a good businessman and talker, but, knows little about cryptocurrency as a whole. I don't necessarily blame him, because it takes many years to truly understand cryptocurrency and how to maintain a coin. He has failed time and time again, and bringing in real talent, real people in crypto from his local/russian environment to help him build this increasingly shitcoin.      edit: If you want to understand how exchanges behave, and to give even more weight to my claims, i suggest reading this excellent article by CMC, the bits about exchanges is about 75% down the page: https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2018/11/27/according-to-coinmarketcap-2018-edition/",False

One man show is not what helps in this field. Universa is more like a Fyre Festival , With lots of NDA  and partnerships hype but  not a single proof . Not a single announcement that has said successful pilot or successfully project launched on universa platform. For that reason the market price proves it . All those who are trying to argue for universa has to snap a finger and wake up to the  real world., Come with more convincing evidence then just cheering for something they can’t explain. Btw, lots of Universa Team here trying to convince but none of the able to give a convincing comment. The day, universa can make another video from Alfa saying they have received mvp and it’s satisfied with the results and is going to use universa ,Till then no one is impressed or ever gonna have confidence. The updates from AB hype lasted less then 16 hours. This shows how confident are the investors.",False

And before we get accused of ""trolling"" we are trying to tell you guys something, this ""trolling"" is the only way we have now to communicate due to the arrogance and negativity towards people who criticise.  Lets be clear here for the 100th time, I want Universa to succeed, but if you cannot progress by AB travelling the world, at least put more effect into the website, developer community or other aspects of the business.  There is so much Universa can be doing, but doesn't.  This has been said before over the past year and the answers are always the same.  We are here ""trolling"" because the frustration of Universa. It is very simple.  If I hear another NDA has been signed... then our comments mean nothing and all is lost.  And to be honest, when AB himself tells the world about these NDA's I lose faith. Not even Donald Trump says ""We have signed a million NDA's"" Its means NOTHING. All it does is make me think AB is ""smashing the cash""... our cash!",False

I am surprised nothing was said earlier to be honest.  Here is my take.  Two points I want to start with.  I invested in the ICO sale of Universa from day 1. I want Universa to succeed.  Ever since day 1, I look at Universa website, Universa Twitter and this forum on a daily basis, and over time, my impression of Universa has fallen to the point that I think @tk808 has reached.  First of all, I respect @tk808 for spending his time writing his posts, and everyone should to.  Due to the fact how close I am to the project, I have discovered, in my opinion some terrible decisions and quite frankly rudeness from the Universa team.  Sometimes, I feel Universa has forgotton that people have invested their hard earned money into the project... In a sense they have the right to question Universa. Sometimes the responses from Universa are very defensive. To the point, that the defence causes offence.  I have also noticed that milestones have been fudged in at the last moment... also to the point that I feel you have literally added a paragraph about something and then ticked the milestone. It feels like to make it look like you have done something of value, but in reality, its literally nothing... but yet the that tick gets ticked to give you ammunition to defend against anyone willing to question the project.  Also, it is all well and good AB travelling the world, but it doesnt mean shit. Investors look for results. So far, there are NO results.  You cannot get angry at people for questioning this. At the end of the day, you have no results.  It is also quite rude to keep telling to ""wait.. next year"" It is NOT FAIR to your investors to tell people this. If you do not understand what I mean... then it is obvious Universa has no concept of keeping good relations, or care about investor opinions.  The website... come on guys.. at least make the website pretty... It looks like something from the 1990's. I am fed up of AB's face. What does his face bring to the table... what value does his face bring? NOTHING. LOSE THE FACE.  Community... completely shit. No community.  Telegram. A mobile only forum?? WTF. This is TERRIBLE.  StableCoins.... WTF. So this looks like you cannot get any deals done, so just plucking ideas to bolt on. TERRIBLE  I could go on, but I am getting angry.  Basically, GET YOUR SHIT together. THIS IS NOT HOW TO RUN A BUSINESS.  This is turning into a pathetic attempt.. Take any longer and your fast transaction speed (the one bit of value you have) will sink.  And yes, I expect a shit response from Universa, but your failure to take criticism is the least of your worries.  I hope you see the emergency you are in. And please sort it out!! I have invested, and I want success.  But if you are going to reject my points, then AB - Enjoy your money, your hotels, your expenses, your lovely meals, your sponsorships for your family and all the rest of the benefits the ICO has brought you. Its on us!  ",False

(4) The content of the deals. Many users raise the same questions. 'What is this partnership and that contract is all about?' Undoubtedly, it is one of the most reasonable ones. In fact, me or other admins have got virtually nothing to share with our users. Indeed, there is a lack of information and relatively low level of transparency. Yes, you were correct here. My point was (my personal apologies if I happened to miss it) that we know this, but it is just the way it is at this moment. We took the opinion of yours as well as of many other users, and will attempt to fix it later. For now, all the updates and pieces of news are all reasourses we can get relevant information from.  (5) It seems I answered about that.  By the way, are you being stereotypical, racist or what?  >Constantly obscuring and manipulating. The Russian way. >The only 2 projects that made contracts, where the 2 scamcoins above, run by Russians ironically.    >I'll be back in 6 months boys, and we'll see if if the team still looking for more useless partners then too.

You have the right to choose in which direction to swap. Some prefer to do UTN->UTNP swap but there are those who do in other direction. It depends on your goals. If you wish to use the mainnet then only UTN can be used.  - Userinterface is in misery, with 2-3 access points to go into the wallet, and do various of tasks.  We tried to improve the interface by launching our beta version of the client. Many were pleased by its interface and said it was an improvement. Please, let us know how we can further improve it if you have any suggestions. We listen to your opinion and try our best!  - UTN is useless, does not function anywhere outside of the system designed for it, we are still trading ERC-20 Tokens  Yes, UTN can also be used within the platform. That was meant from the start. As for exchanges, we will work on this, although now the development seems more important to us.  - Transacting UTN is a very cumbersome, un-friendly and virtually unusable. When is the last time you gave someone a file (containing 100 USD), and they had to upload it to redeem it? Never, again useless system.  This was asked not so long ago and discussed in our exchanges Telegram chat from January 3. Alexander Myodov gave an excellent explanation. You can find it in the developers chat as well. We encourage you to read it if you are interested.  - Team continues to explain to the community about B2B, their essential focus, we've only seen 1 deal made in more than a year, and that happened recently with some internet provider in Tunisia. Sure, great, but only a momentary brief candle light.  We have more partnerships that can be checked here: https://universacommunity.com/cases  - Team continues to argue against marketing, even updating simple information, such as removing ""ICO Has Ended From website, and even here.""...  We mentioned many times that marketing is not a priority at the moment. But we don't say that there is no work being done in that direction. By the way, the roadmap on our website was updated.

They have recently made an announcement in thier official telegram chats. You may want to check this if you are interested in thier development.  - Team is desperate to bring us new information, by giving us not updates about their project, but updates about the most useless pieces of information. Case-in-point, their latest tweet. https://twitter.com/Universa_News  There were numerous updates apart from that. For example, check web client updates from Telegram channel, where you can see updates about the project mainnet client.  - Team doesn't want to market their project anywhere, team has no focus or priority to bring on other teams to develop smart contracts. They expect people to stumble apon their project, and create for it. That process only works, if your blockchain is visible in the first place, leading me back to volume of the coin.

Just the people who were dumping realized that the price will not go lower due to some new impulses and everyone is now hodling and waiting, the price switched to new level because sellers simply vanished. They bought fast back what they were dumping and now the price will stay higher and wait for some momentum. Btw in my older replies i proposed that after bottoming will follow a fast growth making bottom harder to predict and bottom buy-in hard to realize, i think that most of enthusiasists bought in many smaller buy-ins every month and the current price is approx. their average buy-in price. Now will happen a short growth and then a long stagnation, probably slightly above the ICO price level. At ICO levels the price may stand some time because luckers who bought for 0.0002 will probably cash out some of their profits and they will ""fight"" with institutional investors buying at ICO levels and still happy to buy - there are not so many projects you can buy for ICO price more than an year after the ICO when time already has shown that the ICO was no pure scam and you just got this proof of time for free...  Btw if you want to predict the closest future, its not so hard, again look at NEM(XEM) graph which is VERY similar to UTN because the projects itself are in some ways very similar (fundamentally - XEM was an unique way of blockchain 2.0 like UTN is unique try of 3.0 blockchain). Currently we are in the same phase like XEM was after bottoming. It has grown fast from bottom 33 sat to 330 and stand here for some time until it got fully mad with releasing some other important features (and hitting the 2nd crypto-mania timings being based during the 1st one). UTN looks like an absolutelly unique way how to make a blockchain 3.0 ecosystem (XEM was unique 2.0) and it looks that it will have similar timings, its very probable that the development will fill the time between 2nd and 3rd cryptowave and hit (or create ) it. If UTN will succeed the 3rd cryptowave may be also the last one ever happened (because its ecosystem may solve many of the reasons why the crypto-bubbles actually happen, even it cant solve human greed and delusion). However this is just a crazy prediction. Nevertheless:  Blockchain 1.0 correlated with a bubble in 2013 Blockchain 2.0 correlated with a bubble in 2017 Today we have many unique blockchain 3.0 developments... quo vadis, crypto? 2021?",False

Would you kidnly explain what you imply by ""UTN is pretty useless atm""?  >But, if you guys sent UTN, it's really pretty stupid. You basically sign a file of the UTN's over to someone, and they have to physically upload that file to claim their UTN. Speaking of transactions of assets within Universa Mainnet, you can simply use private chats in order to transfer anything without sending files over.  >Coinciding with all this, they have 2 wallets. Access and Beta Universa, one is serving the function for swaps, the other is serving an actual focus for creating contracts? Like it's beyond me at this time, again it's pretty messy. As it was mentioned earlier, those are not two wallets but two clients for the same network. Yes, the beta.universa.io web client is served as beta test for the swap option in particular, yet both clients enable creating contracts, etc.  I do not know too much about their future goals when it comes to their blockchain, but AB loves meeting business men trying to solidify B2B deals, which is great, but there's a lot of missing puzzle pieces. Instead of talking about what Universa has achieved and will achieve, AB talks about what can be achieved. I need to beg your pardon, the phrase seems quite queer to me.

Correct me if im wrong but no competitor has released a fully working product yet. Universa is one of them. I would ask, is there any competent prediction how long really the development process and debugging until Universa 1.0 release will take? Year? 2 years? Debugging may be longer than development itself - even after that, most serious bugs will appear way long after oficiall release - they are just not predictable because you cant fully beta-test a real network in a lab almost if you are doing so big step forward, i worry a bit about the performance itself, not from hardware, AMD is releasing great computing power for good price, it may be a great synergy, i will buy a threadripper as soon as it will have any sense, but from the internal software and ""software engine"", there will be many sw hiccups and cache / network issues after launch and these problems may be crucial, almost for semi-pro and pro purposes. It will require a good trade-off between security, stability and performance (every one thing diminishes the other twos).

Back in March this year I had cause to point 2 projects to support@universa.io for further details on how to launch their projects on the Universa Blockchain. What happened was that back then I was very upbeat and vocal on twitter about the capability of the chain and it caught the attention of many of my followers, some of which responded by asking for more information. Five months on I think the chain have progressed tremendously (several features it lacked back then are now fully functional) thanks to the handwork of Mr Borodich and his team. But somewhere along the line I stopped talking about Universa. I can remember one incident. I read an article on TechCrunch where the writer remarked a disclaimer at the end of his piece,  stating that he ""owns a small amount of Ripple which was sufficient to gain an understanding but not enough to change his life"". Guess what. I traced him on twitter and this @mentioning his handle: ""Hey @X you can gain a good amount of understanding and change your life if you own a small amount of $UTNP"". At other times when some whales tweet about their present bags,  I was always prompt to reply ""Add $UTNP. the fastest Blockchain so Far"". I can't tell why,  buy I know I stopped these 'little' tweets.  I know a lot of us have similar stories too. You see,  its not the chain but us.  We are the ones failing. Universa is still faster than 97% of other chains out there, and have in fact developed many other features and capabilities we are yet to find elsewhere, but we,  the community that holds 100% of the chain's tokens, have relented on our efforts. Instead we want the dev team to do a 100% of the work, so that we can reap a 1000% on our investments. This is a wrong approach, and I know we can change it.  So, right now some of us members of the $UTNP holders community are coming together to mount a coordinated front whose only purpose is to push our beloved Blockchain from within. We want to project our Chain. We want to motivate other entrepreneurs to come build on it. We want to make it irresistible to other investors. I know you probably wanna dump and run away to other projects, have really asked yourself what project will be up there among the very best a year from now? I bet you haven't.  Instead let's do our part in support of the Chain we've grown to love. To be honest, the  community push thing hasn't taken off yet. We are at the stage of putting things together. Calling in more volunteers to help out. If you got any ideas or experience that can help,  your most welcome. When we're through putting our acts together then we'll table our plans before the UTN Foundation,  and launch thereafter.  Pls join us here:  https://t.me/joinchat/Dztddg_Yr1b0Moqp5-KuTw",False

Dont ask me why but this scheme repeated at all similar serious projects (e. g. NEM, ethereum, ... )... The price started somewhere at 1-3 percetnt of final price when trading with unfinished project started, dumped slowly down to promiles and decimals of promiles and then started to rise to peaks and the bottom was usually reached short before the price started to arise fast. The problem of current dump is that the market feels that nothing big will happen in closest future so even long term investors may speculate and  they are just watching the red candles or trying to dump the price to rebuy even lower. As the situation will come closer to expected bottom, the cheap UTNS will suddenly disappear and we will see a chaotic market.

One of biggest risks except technical conditions (security, network) i see is the number of staff, the team doesnt seem to be big, its very similar to 2014/2015 and NEM project in these years however it turned into extremelly successfull project even trough the zero marketing with its tiny team by its hard work. But it was still a gen2 crypto. Universa can be a 3rd gen ""NEM"" if it goes the same way - good product and working network. The comparison with NEM is very fittable because both started with really innovating ways how to improve blockchain technology and brought a big step ahead for crypto. And they had (and have) similar problems - some delays, permanent postponing, but still having a clear way where to go. I personally will hold my universa until it goes to 10+ USD or 0.000000001USD.

Universa team is working hard and swap with UTN will, hopefully, be available in July.  Quote from: hvezdasmrti on June 27, 2018, 11:50:40 AM Another flash crash happened, today at cobinhood, where the hell come the huge dumps from? They are kinda fishy like someone melting down all his holdings...  But why?  UTN > UTNP from ICO has been converted for people that really wanted their money. We can therefore guess they have sold it. Everything is explained in : https://medium.com/universablockchain/important-update-on-the-utn-smart-contract-token-distribution-and-future-swapping-of-tokens-dd3a1f4bb8df  I quote: ""Our Community and Tokens  We believe that our community can be seen as a collaboration of two groups. On the one hand, there is a group of people who are (active) traders, while on the other hand there is a group of people concerned with the long-term development of Universa and what the project can bring to the world. While our focus is on the second group of engaged community members and we do not encourage speculative behavior, we do respect the first group as well, since they are also part of our community. To remain as close as possible to “the first half of June” with making tokens available to our community, please read the following paragraphs.  We expect this first group of people to choose to swap their UTN for UTNP for trading purposes, while the second group is most likely to either want to swap UTNP for UTN or hold on to their already purchased UTN. To smooth the process for the first group, we have provided the community with, and will do so for the coming days, a Google Form that will reset their withdrawal form at check.universa.io so they will be able to choose UTNP instead of UTN. Hereby eliminating the hassle for them to swap from UTN to UTNP.  The first batch of those UTNP tokens to be distributed will start on June 17th. This possibility is offered in the following structure and with the following conditions; •Only tokens that were purchased during the Token Sale or earned through participation in the Bounty Program can be withdrawn. People who have tokens solely from registering an account or from referral bonuses are not eligible for this option. •The minimum amount to withdraw is 1000 tokens. •If a person has not filled in his withdrawal form yet, he can do so at check.universa.io after login and choose the option to withdraw to UTNP. •If a person has previously filled in his withdrawal form and chose “all to UTN”, through filling in the Google Form, the withdrawal request previously submitted will be removed and reset. He/she can now choose to withdraw to UTNP. •If a person chose to withdraw some amount of tokens to UTN and some to UTNP and he/she has not received the UTNP tokens yet, the Google Form can still be filled in to reset the withdrawal form. •If a person chose to withdraw some amount of tokens to UTN and some to UTNP and he/she has already received those UTNP, we cannot reset the withdrawal form in order to maintain important data. What we can do, is sent the UTN remainder in UTNP to the exact same ETH address as used for the previous withdrawal to ensure the safety of our community.  Please find the mentioned Google Form here; https://goo.gl/forms/D3CDtnMvjKehL4RK2  etc. etc.""",False

Smart contracts on Ethereum operate with a limited set of metadata. Neither of the two blockchains can cope with the simple task of linking a fixed amount of money to a smart contract in the currency required for a specific business at the moment – euro, dollars, or rubles. Universa allows to create and transfer existing currencies as well as the new ones through the contract. Universa provides a gateway for services that automatically accept input electronic documents (electronic money, obligations or agreements, intellectual property, excises, bids on auctions and tenders, id or electronic passports) and creates standard output documents based on the rules and provisions of “smart contracts.” The implementation of Universa makes the transition to electronic commerce very cheap – for example, by using the Universa ready-made communication service, one can buy electronic materials from individuals (for example, photos or articles), trade all sorts of goods, provide loans, exchange or sell securities, and operate with other financial instruments as well. The legal entities receive a convenient tool for working with excise, tenders, auctions, transaction passports, customs declarations. Almost any tasks are conveniently and easily automatized by applications and smart contracts of the new Universa blockchain.""

Instead, we suggest new cheap and easy way of creating smart contracts, which can act as cash substitutes, in a somewhat original way.

With Universa this means you have to stake 1 million UTN (1.000.000 UTN) in order to start a master node. Next to that, information has been given out on the technical specifications of running the master node and, unfortunately, this can't run on your calculator or Raspberry Pi.  The masternode requires 16 cores and 32GB accompanied by a 256 GB SSD. Whether it are 16 cores or 16 threads (8 physical cores and 16 threads through hyperthreading) is not yet known.  This means the initial investment for running a masternode is quite steep as 16 core CPU's can't be bought at the local supermarket. In order to get this running you have three options:  1.Renting a dedicated server at Amazon AWS, Google Cloud or Azure or similar.  2.Building your own system/server/rig and keep it turned on 24/7 in your house.  3.Building your own system/server and co-locating it in a data center.

During a discussion at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Skorobogatova suggested that the emerging technology still requires improvements. According to her, the technology has not yet been applied on an industrial scale, except for its use for cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. The Deputy Governor focused on security and scalability as key issues that still need to be resolved before industrial-scale implementation can take off. Skorobogatova divided blockchain applications into two major use cases. Firstly, blockchain systems that offer a distributed settlement infrastructure, such as Corda and Ripple, that can be used for banks’ payment processing. Secondly, blockchain platforms that provide smart contract functionality such as Ethereum and Hyperledger. ""Technology for the sake of technology is pointless,” Skorobogatova said, adding that 2018 would be the year that Russia and the international community would come to “a pragmatic understanding” of the purposes for which blockchain is beneficial, after which they would transition to tackle industrial scale realization. Skorobogatova has previously spoken of blockchain as “a revolutionary technology [that] certainly needs to be invested in,” while highlighting that understanding the associated risks and how to manage them was essential for the mainstream financial sector. Fully-controlled integration would require “seven to ten years,” according to her estimation in June of last year. Just this week, the news was released that the country’s first officially regulated ICO would be tested using the Russian central bank’s newly-established regulatory sandbox, with major state-owned Sberbank acting as the project’s anchor investor.

Talking about this, after all the conferences, negotiations and interviews AB made recently I reckon next report is going to be very promising. The market is in a bloodbath, UTN release may or may not have a further impact on price. I`ve read some analytics (sorry, haven`t kept links) bulls are expected back sometimes during Q3-Q4, while as seen from an article I quoted above next 6-9 years are needed for wide adoption of valuable projects as Universa without sheer of a doubt is.

Since, In Universa, proof-of-state (not to be confused with proof-of-stake) mechanism is used instead of a more commonly implemented proof-of-work system. A change in state change is verified by a trusted actor and approved by consensus in ten milliseconds or less. Each separate contract maintains its own chain of state, so a contract can perform actions asynchronously without affecting other contracts. The combined changes of state form a directed acyclic graph, which makes up the blockchain itself.  The proof-of-state system and the licensed nodes can be perceived as moving away from decentralization. This mechanism is meant to develop a convenient business solution in a broad sense, which can ""break the very philosophy of the blockchain.""

If you like news, ideas, and developments I'm providing please do not hesitate to reward me with some merit as I need to level up my status. Kindest thanks in advance for your cooperation.  https://medium.com/universablockchain/stupino-will-see-the-creation-of-crypto-park-9635b756eda0  CHALLENGE  More bots and AI automation systems implementing exponentially in different business spheres leaving more people without work and salary which will soon increase the social tension drastically.  ANSWER  Launch of the stable coin national cryprocurrency on fair initial distribution basis backed by national currency in circulation allowing to citizens invest each month in ICOs. So people become stakeholders of new businesses and having income in the form of project's tokens create the future in which they are interested.  SOLUTION  Digital economy can be created on the basis of existing economy by emitting national cryprocurrency on the Proof-of-Citizen algorithm using Universa high tech blockchain platform.  PLAN  We want ot make pilot project in one of the Russian regions for first national cryptocurrency - criptoruble (CRUB). Here exist status of Individual Entrepreneur with 6% tax, and we want to improve the law by adding Individual Crypto Entrepreneur status (ICE) allowing to accept CRUB during ICO with 5% tax which will be lower by only one percent, but much more smarter as it will be on smart contracts. We will launch CRUB market like USDT on partner exchanges. RACIB is the association under which will be created self regulating organisation responsible for legalizing crypto in Russia. Our head of advisory council is Herman Klimenko - advisor of President Putin. So we have enough power to make everything happen in the way which will be good for all cryptocommunity.  DATE  On 20-21 February 2018 Crypto Congress will take place in Moscow on which Universa present the solution to issue national cryprocurrency to Russian government and governments of other countries which will be invited to Moscow for starting dialogue between governments and cryptobusinesses. We are going to make in Moscow Crypto Davos.  CONCLUSION  The platform which will be the first national cryprocurrency operator has more chances to become interstate national cryprocurrencies platform.  What we are looking for?  First it will be good to present the idea in the form of visual content for the site - clear schemes or short animated video will be great.  After we will create landing good to spread news about site in cryptomedia. However right now we can start from short interview.  In general we want to promote the project globally under slogan ""Get ICE status and launch ICO legally!""  If you have any ideas welcome!",False

At firstly - this article is a total nonsense, without any proof, and devs and admins overthrown this bullshits few days ago on telegram. 14000 in there is pretty a lot of people - by the way Bankex has about 6500 people and is good, solid project which listed on Okex(currently top 1 vol24/h)  https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/volume/24-hour/ while Electroneum has 48000 and price is still little above ico(0.01$) now is 0.025 so as you see, amount of people in telegram is not very important    At secondly - there are few interesting new big projects which was below ico price or still below, for example - Bankex(ICO price - $1,48) now is $0.50. Crypterium(ico$0.70) and was below ico by 2 months(feb-apr) and now is about $0.80. INS(ico$2.54) now is $2.09 and at beginning april was about $0.90.

Now there is a publicly accessible blockchain where developers of distributed applications can use more than 20,000 transactions per second, which allows them to easily create and transfer tokens simultaneously with signed documents and implement any functionality — from smart money to a universal passport of a citizen of the planet.  Nevertheless, it is just a beginning. It will take another two-three months to finalize and release basic smart contracts that will manage the decentralized network.  Universa Team will do everything to make our blockchain not just the fastest but also the most convenient to use from anywhere on planet Earth.  We are already working on Universa Blockchain implementation in many countries — China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Kazakhstan, Russia, Finland, Spain, Italy, Turkey and Tunisia. We will continue to expand our geographic coverage and increasing the number of local partners that help our team to enter new markets.  In the nearest future we expect to announce new projects launched on the Universa Blockchain, not just in the area of FinTech, including intrabank payments and p2p remittances, but also in Supply Chain Management, government registry digitization, issuance of non-forgeable and verifiable IDs, diplomas and certificates that can be used anywhere, from controlling counterfeit products in retail to education and healthcare ministries.  Congratulations to all of you, and a heartfelt thank-you to everyone who helped the today’s event come true. Thank you for your support and for believing in us and in Universa Blockchain!

As you already know from the news, we in the RACIB create the Cryptopark in Russia and are extremely interested in the development of a high-tech domestic blockchain platform, so we will fully support Universa, facilitating the receipt of orders from corporate clients and governmental agencies.  Especially for us is very important the launch of a cryptoruble prototype and smart taxes working on smart contracts. Here I will provide short information from the Cryptopark presentation:  "" The Cryptopark will create special conditions for the formation of a global crypto industry center in Russia - from anywhere in the world it will be possible to pass KYC and become a resident of the Cryptopark for companies and individual entrepreneurs, with receipt online status of Individual Crypto Entrepreneur (ICE)  In the cryptopark, a special experimental taxation system is introduced in the form of a 5% smart-tax. During the first 5 years, the smart-tax will be used to create the infrastructure of the Cryptopark and will be utilized by decentralized community itself (with the receipt of project tokens) in the following areas:  1% [living]  1% [food]  1% [health]  1% [transport]  1% [platform]  As a platform for the Cryptopark, a prototype application is developing based on the UNIVERSA blockchain platform. The pilot project of Cryptopark in the field of transport infrastructure development is McFly project with the further placement in the GDPQUADRAT industrial zone production of Bartini airmobile. ""  Another important news is that the management of the Huobi exchange came to the RACIB congress with whom we are currently coordinating the terms of the partnership in Cryptopark:  "" Right now RACIB is started works for preparing Governmental approval to set up Cryptopark in Russia for legalization of crypto industry on one of the most competitive conditions in the world (5% smart-tax to be used by crypto community for digital infrastructure building).  Cryptopark will be launched on UNIVERSA blockchain platform, which developed application prototype with ALFA-BANK - one of the leading banks in Russia.  Currently we are looking for partner leading exchange for Cryptopark, and will be very glad to enter into partnership with HUOBI! ""  Due to the fact that the platform is a partner of the association in Cryptopark, we can recommend to Huobi listing of UTNP, and UTN after the main network will start work as the technological basis for launching the cruble market.  Since I do not always read this chat, who has access to promising projects or regional authorities pm to me and I will add to the related chat.  As for the main community, it is obvious that practically everyone has the opportunity to expand the information about the prospects of the Universa.

If you, like many others, have not yet noticed, carmakers already invested half a billion dollars into VTOL developers like Bartini (in the McFly Incubator), Dubai aviation authority already tested the air taxi system, Uber already eyes roofs to control retail outlets for passenger flight. The time flying cars are coming — is now!  We are grateful to Alexander Borodich for his enthusiasm, support and so much trust in us. Therefore for this community there will be a 5% bonus to the rolling ETH—>McFLY rate during the current token launch phase. BUT! For those, who transfer ETH before or on the 10th of April the bonus will be 15%.  Getting the bonus is easy. After sending ETH to McFLY’s address from your wallet (http://mcfly.aero/token), just send an email to iloveuniversa@mcfly.aero and put your wallet address in it — the wallet from which you made the transaction. Your bonus tokens will be sent to that address.  I will be happy to answer questions in PM or our community will help —> http://t.me/tomcfly",False

Universa has great potential and progress of course, but now is bear market so even when will be Mainnet, it's will be to hard crossed $0.05 at this bear market, especially with this exchanges(cobin, hitbtc) So it's need to wait on some top exchange and bull market of course and then Universa will fly to the moon for sure  I see that UTNP keeps still quite strong at this bear market compared to most other and more popular ico's as like INS or Crypterium which are below ico price. I think in summer will be beautiful bull market again and then BTC maybe reach to $25,000-30,000, if that will happens, then Universa could then reach $0.40 or even more. Now its great time/great price to buy more/accumulate UTNP. Worth be patience at this golden investment  Currently the reality of the cryptomarket is still that if Bitcoin goes up, most altcoins also goes up, and if Bitcoin goes down, most altcoins are also going down. Bitcoin is still such a pulling horse for almost all cryptocurrencies, thats why I am pleased with the optimistic forecasts of Jack Dorsey(founder of Twitter) and Tom Lee(he predicts Bitcoin to reach $91000 by March 2020 based on performances after past dips) about the wonderful future of Bitcoin and in generally technology blockchain. Growth price/popularity of Bitcoin will be very positive effect for blockchain technology and for most solid altcoins with potential. Look at the past peak of bull market when this amazing growth BTC January was caused mainly by the fact that Bitcoin was entering to american futures contracts, being reached $20,000 and therefore almost every altcoin reached the moon also This show that Bitcoin has a still huge influence on almost all cryptocurrencies. That is reality of cryptomarket today.  https://cointelegraph.com/news/tom-lee-predicts-bitcoin-to-reach-91000-by-march-2020-based-on-performances-after-past-dips  http://www.businessinsider.com/jack-dorsey-bitcoin-will-become-the-worlds-single-currency-2018-3/?IR=T",False

An other personal thoughts/idea is that eastern europe (russia etc.) hasn't adopted bitcoin and cryptos as much as the US and western europe. I know there is a large crypto community in Poland for example but I don't think it's representative. There will be a more massive adoption as time goes by.

But life does not stand still. Immediately after the first sanctions on the Chinese model, the first Russian payment system was launched, on the cards of which wages have already been transferred to almost all state employees. At the same time, our specialists are working to create alternative channels for interbank cooperation. Our banks are already considering the launch of such a system using the Russian blockchain-platform. And our mathematician, the teacher of Moscow State University Alexander Borodich came up with it. He is now called the creator of the first Russian blockchain platform. The very one that allows you to conduct over 20 thousand operations per second and allows you to instantly make a large number of transactions, which is so important for the economy.   In his recent message to the Federal Assembly, President Putin talked about the need to use the latest technologies in the banking sector based on the principle of a blockchain (a distributed database in the form of a ""chain of blocks"" that exist independently of each other). The use of such a scheme can significantly help the Russian financial system in case of disconnection from the SWIFT banking system.  This is especially true on the eve of the World Cup, which is going to come to tens of thousands of fans. Most of them, of course, will pay for everything with their cards.

US President Donald Trump has already approved these plans, as a result of which Russia may expect to be disconnected from the SWIFT system, which will make it difficult to transfer money to foreign accounts, the media note.  The danger of restrictions in working with the SWIFT system became known at the very beginning of the sanctions wars in 2014. In fact, Russia had four years left to find an alternative system or even develop its own. As it became known after another portion of threats from the US on the strengthening of sanctions, Russia is ready to immediately switch from SWIFT to the new UNIVERSA system.  The system is developed by domestic specialists and uses blockchain technology, which makes it less vulnerable to hacker attacks and increases the reliability of all transactions' cryptographic encryption. In a world where all payments are gradually becoming electronic, the issue of security and protection against hacking is fundamental.  The creator of UNIVERSA is the Russian Alexander Borodich; now he is completing the testing of the system, participation in which takes many leading banks, not only Russian.  ""It's good that Russia has had these four years and the financial bloc managed to prepare,"" said Ilya Grashchenkov, director of the Center for Regional Policy Development. - Of course, disconnecting from SWIFT is a serious blow to the banking system of the Russian Federation. Roughly speaking, the possibility of making payments from Russia to the European Union, the United States and other countries may be in question. In such a situation, when you intend to continue to survive under sanctions, and they are obviously for us for a long time, the only way out is to develop your system.  Yes, now UNIVERSA is basically the eastern direction, such countries as China, Malaysia, and soon Korea, India will join it. This, of course, will mean an ""eastern"" turn of the banking system from Western banks operating in the SWIFT system. However, it is possible that gradually it will be possible to establish contact within the framework of the new system, first with the Balkans, Turkey, and then with individual EU countries. After all, technologically, UNIVERSA, built on the principles of blockchain, is a more advanced system, in contrast to the outdated SWIFT. ""  Let us remind you that SWIFT is a society of worldwide interbank financial communication channels and making payments. The owners of the system is a cooperative society created under Belgian law, owned by more than 9,000 banks from 209 countries, the office is located in Brussels.  After the events of September 11, 2001, the CIA, the FBI and the US Treasury got access to the financial information of the SWIFT network in order to be able to monitor possible financial transactions of terrorists. As a result, SWIFT was heavily criticized for its insufficient protection of customer data.  Annually through SWIFT passes 4 billion payment orders.""

It's one of the purposes of the Waves DEX, being able to trade in other currencies.  Competition is good.  Currently Waves is the fastest in real blockchain transactions on decentralized nodes, with very low requirements to the hardware (VPS can do the job).  If Universa delivers, for sure it can do more tx/s. The (master)nodes will not be fully decentralized and need larger servers to keep up but that may work perfectly. It's just a different approach.  I like new technology, doesn't matter if that's Lisk, Waves, Universa, Factom, Ethereum or Vechain. These are exciting times  ",False

First of all, the tokens will be given to the owners of the accounts, whose data have been checked and did not cause any questions or problems. As it was announced earlier, we asked to pass KYC holders of accounts with more than 1 million tokens. In addition, proof of identity is necessary for the owners of accounts that caused any suspicions in dishonesty or fraud. Some accounts can be selected for verification randomly. · The information needed to add a token to ERC20 wallets: - Smart-contract address: 0x9e3319636e2126e3c0bc9e3134AEC5e1508A46c7 - Number of decimals: 18  ATTENTION! The specified address is the only correct one for our tokens. We became aware of several smart contracts, which are called by the creators as UTN, UTNP or Universa. Because there is no register of names for smart contracts, the creator of a smart contract can name his contract anyway he likes. Or even do not give it any name. Universa can not affect or change it. The address of our smart contract is 0x9e3319636e2126e3c0bc9e3134AEC5e1508A46c7. · We did not announce the placement of our token on any exchanges. Therefore, we do not give any comments with regard to exchanges (including decentralized ones). · IMPORTANT! We can not help you if you purchased tokens with a smart contract address that is different from 0x9e3319636e2126e3c0bc9e3134AEC5e1508A46c7. Be careful! The name of the smart contract is not an indicator of its belonging to Universa. Always check the address of the smart contract.",False

First of all, the tokens will be given to the owners of the accounts, whose data have been checked and did not cause any questions or problems. As it was announced earlier, we asked to pass KYC holders of accounts with more than 1 million tokens. In addition, proof of identity is necessary for the owners of accounts that caused any suspicions in dishonesty or fraud. Some accounts can be selected for verification randomly. · The information needed to add a token to ERC20 wallets: - Smart-contract address: 0x9e3319636e2126e3c0bc9e3134AEC5e1508A46c7 - Number of decimals: 18  ATTENTION! The specified address is the only correct one for our tokens. We became aware of several smart contracts, which are called by the creators as UTN, UTNP or Universa. Because there is no register of names for smart contracts, the creator of a smart contract can name his contract anyway he likes. Or even do not give it any name. Universa can not affect or change it. The address of our smart contract is 0x9e3319636e2126e3c0bc9e3134AEC5e1508A46c7. · We did not announce the placement of our token on any exchanges. Therefore, we do not give any comments with regard to exchanges (including decentralized ones). · IMPORTANT! We can not help you if you purchased tokens with a smart contract address that is different from 0x9e3319636e2126e3c0bc9e3134AEC5e1508A46c7. Be careful!

The guys are creating a new blockchain. Their ICO was held on their blockchain not on the Ethereum one as do 99% of ICOs. Why does it take so long to distribute utn-p? I think if the wanted just to issue utn-p, it would have taken them about several days max. Then what is the problem? you ask.

It was my personal appraisal really. And way I dished figures in my post may have made it sound like there was some quantitative approach to my guestimate. Sorry, there wasn't.  But look at this: Ripple started out flaunting 2000+TPS. Then, they scaled that up to 10000+ transactions per seconds, and today they hold the bragging rights of matching VISA speed for speed in transaction processing. But it took them 3yrs to get to this impressive 56+K tps, and I doubt if VISA is impressed enough to adopt XRP just yet.  You see, Universa is starting out at a massive 20,000 tps by the time they develope the chain some more they could easily hit 40K to 50K or more, and leave all other chains biting its dust. They may not list at my price just yet, but I believe the market will take it far above $1 very soon",False

The inspiration behind the project is Alexander Borodich, a technology investor, the founder and managing partner of VentureClub, the former head of marketing at Mail.ru group, Russia’s largest IT company. Universa presents a number of overriding advantages over Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.  1. Universa introduces a new generation unique blockchain technology.  Universa was originally being developed not as a cryptocurrency, but as a distributed system for executing smart contracts. Therefore, the Universa platform does not depend on mining, which results both in high speed and transactions low cost, with a distributed consensus model providing the same level of trust as in the existing blockchain protocols. The consensus in Universa is the consent of 91% of the network nodes. Forging becomes practically impossible at this level of consensus.  2. Universa is 1000 times faster than Bitcoin blockchain.  Universa nodes do not require mining and are responsible for verifying the transactions and smart contracts that customers submit onto the network. Waiving mining opened a way to increase network performance by hundreds of times. The Universa blockchain simple protocol is supplemented by the highly developed declarative and logical language of smart contracts. Such architecture made it possible to reach the speed of 10,000 transactions per second on the network nodes.  3. Transactions in Universa are 100 times cheaper than in Bitcoin.  Due to Bitcoin’s volatile and speculative nature, microtransactions in the Bitcoin blockchain deem economically meaningless. It is not economically reasonable for a business to pay $3,5 for a few cents worth transaction, processed by the network for about 10 minutes, on top of that. Universa make a favorable difference if compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, by allowing its users to make hundreds of times more transactions per second, and at a very low price.  4. In the Universa protocol, smart contracts are smart indeed, which broadens their implementation in real business significantly. Universa smart contracts are more than applicable for programming all kinds of applications, both intracompany ones and those operating in a public blockchain.  For example:  * Vehicle smart key / CarSharing, attached to the compartment, which creates an owner-vehicle-contract provisions chain. An owner can temporarily associate another key (valet mode, service mode) or hand over all rights to another owner (sale). If GPS system is installed in a car, it is also possible to issue a key that operates within a certain field (valet, service). In such case, a phone or a smart key chain can act as the key;  * Hotel, shopping mall, gym, SPA. Universa smart contract can create a unified room and locker key; SPA and fitness pass card; purchases from vending machines, accessing parking lots, etc. The key can be a RFC Tag as well as a smartphone, with or without NFC. All resources can be limited in terms of time or available credit;  * IoT; smart things for home. Smart contract associates the purchased item with the customer. Universa allows smart things to work together and provides a simple mechanism for managing different users’ rights without Internet access. It also provides an easy mechanism for handling rights over one side to the other at selling transactions;  * Smart home. It allows to associate home with the owners and guests using their ID, to manage roles and rights, and to operate without Internet (provided a special node is installed) after the handover of rights;  * Gas stations, toll roads, parking lots. A phone with the Internet access can operate as a transponder. A customer receives an inquiry to his or her phone through the Internet, when approaching gates, the phone sends a confirmation request or checks the approximate coordinates, and then authorizes a payment;  * Warehouses, transportation, cargo delivery. Smart RFID seals, using QR codes contracts.    5. Universa is real “smart money“.  Business-logic of the bitcoin-blockchain is limited by wallets and their balances. Smart contracts on Ethereum operate with a limited set of metadata. Neither of the two blockhains can cope with simple task of linking a fixed amount of money to a smart contract in the currency required for a specific business at the moment – euro, dollars, or rubles. Universa allows to create and transfer existing currencies as well as the new ones through the contract. Universa provides a gateway for services that automatically accept input electronic documents (electronic money, obligations or agreements, intellectual property, excises, bids on auctions and tenders, id or electronic passports) and creates standard output documents based on the rules and provisions of “smart contracts.” The implementation of Universa makes the transition to electronic commerce very cheap – for example, by using the Universa ready-made communication service, one can buy electronic materials from individuals (for example, photos or articles), trade all sorts of goods, provide loans, exchange or sell securities, and operate with other financial instruments as well. The legal entities receive a convenient tool for working with excises, tenders, auctions, transaction passports, customs declarations. Almost any tasks are conveniently and easily automatized by applications and smart contracts of the new Universa blockchain.""   https://news.bitcoin.com/pr-five-advantages-of-universa-blockchain-over-bitcoin-and-ethereum/",False

Correct me if I'm wrong. 1) Total Token Supply: 15 Billion UTN Reference: https://www.kickico.com/campaigns/38941/universa-blockchain-protocol  2) After the Token sale ends, you can choose either to transfer your UTN-P token to your MEW or any other ERC-20 wallet or wait for the UTN wallets to be released. UTN-P ratio to UTN is 1:1. Let's wait for further announcements.  3) Well, this will be useful for some people in having fast transaction. It's still optional if you will use it or not. All people has their own preferences.  4) Good for them.  5) Most of my tokens came from bounty but I will not dump them. I'll hodl them for a very long time.  6) First of all, UTN is not a coin. It's a token. Acc to the whitepaper, it can be a token representation of everything. So, there is no ICO, there is a token sale.  Did you read about licensed and authorized nodes? Have you read about training software developers and programmers? Universa has the potential to rule out the world in the future. There will be a blockchain academy and lots more.",False

Yes it was a good investment but could it be completed in the last 12 days? Is this 33k eth soft or hardcap?  The soft cap of the project has already been collected and it is $ 10 million, as it is written in white paper. Also you can see the whole development process there, depending on the amount of fees for ICO  Is it known who actually contributed those $10 million and are they in a publicly known address or could it be a move to just attract more people? There's is no way they can manipulate to attract more people because Universa make sales via ICOBACKER and KICKICO",False

Powered by successful Swiss international Job Platforms Jobstoday.ch; Jobstoday.de; Jobstoday.at; Jobstoday.pl, Global Jobcoin ICO has become very popular among cryptocurrency investors & enthusiast within a few days.  It is not a surprise since Global Jobcoin ICO is backed by an established & successful company. The Job platforms are already in the market since last 3 years & have already more than 5000 clients & 1 Million + users registered on their platforms.  On the market, there are many ICOs being announced daily but most of them don’t even have any company structure, no product, no prototype or the team has no experience in product & business development. Global Jobcoin ICO has ticked all the boxes for a successful ICO. It is apparent from the presale & extremely high interest in the crowd sale. Independent ICO rating agency ICObench.com has rated Global Jobcoin 4.7 from 5.  “The fact that any investor can check that we exist since 2014 & have a working successful product in Switzerland, Germany, Austria & Poland, gives them confidence that their investment is safe with us”, said Sanket Deshmukh, Co-founder & CEO of Jobstoday & Global Jobcoin. He further added, “We receive daily at least 100 mails from our potential investors who like our ICO & are pleased to invest in it. Today’s ICO investors are smart, intelligent & they see the potential in ICOs with working product. Distribution of tokens is very important factor in deciding about the ICO. Global Jobcoin founders only hold 10% of total tokens, so the manipulation of the price is not possible. Lots of ICOs are keeping a lot of tokens for themselves so that they can manipulate the price. We have been very transparent with our investors from the beginning & that makes a big difference. Besides that, we will only have a circulating supply of 70 Million tokens & we will also invest 10% of our global profits in buying back Global Jobcoin tokens from the market.”  “Cryptocurrency investors are pushing the technology to its next level. ICOs are here to stay & the ones with successful products will give the investors a good return in short or long term”, said Lukasz Ochnik, Co-founder & CTO of Jobstoday & Global Jobcoin. He further added, “We hear about various scam ICOs daily, I personally never invested in any ICO which doesn’t have a legal company structure, experienced team & at least a prototype. Another important factor is whether the company address is revealed on the website & they can be found in company registration directory of that country. I don’t understand how people should invest in an ICO if the company does not even want to reveal its address. We spent 2 months in planning the ICO with our great team. We looked at various factors & how we can guarantee our investors the return that we promise. Our token holders not only benefit from our rising token price but also from the 20% dividends that they receive from our worldwide profits.”  The Global Jobcoin presale is currently in progress & minimum investment of 10 ETH is accepted, tokens are guaranteed through a SAFT agreement during the presale. The public crowd sale will start on October 28. The hard cap is set at 200,000 ETH, which is approximately $60 Million.  About Global Jobcoin  Global Jobcoin is an ERC20 decentralized token to pay for services related to employment. Using the Ethereum blockchain, this token is created for employers & employees worldwide. Global Jobcoin will be used on all Job platforms of Jobstoday in Switzerland, Germany, Austria & Poland. As the company expands its operations worldwide, Global Jobcoin will become the essential choice of payment on all the platforms around the world. Jobstoday is also collaborating with other partner Job boards to offer integration of Global Jobcoin into their platforms. Global Jobcoin & Jobstoday Platforms are products of Sunny Look Media LLC, registered Swiss company since 2014 in Wollerau, Canton of Schwyz.  Jobstoday Management  Sanket Deshmukh is the Co-Founder & CEO of Jobstoday & Global Jobcoin. Sanket brings 20 years of experience in Software & Business Development.

Each separate contract maintains its own chain of state, so a contract can perform actions asynchronously without  blocking or affecting other contracts, and the combined changes of state collectively form a directed acyclical  graph  (“DAG”) that makes up the blockchain itself""",False

For fast transaction speed, isnt there already Ripple coin? They have clients like Standard Chartered. What clients does Universa have? Bank of Liberland? If I am not wrong, Ripple does not depend on mining as well, what adv does universa have over Ripple ?  If you could buy Ripple or Universa, both have fast transaction speeds, but Ripple is being used by major banks. Why would anyone choose Universa over Ripple?  For transaction history, if i am not wrong Universa coins do not keep the transaction history so that the transactions can be done faster.

The two level procedure ensures that:  - Parties involved have checked the contract and found it OK  - The network has checked the parties agreement, the contract rules and permissions and found it OK  After the second stage the contract is either stamped and approved by the network consensus (explained below), or rejected.  LEVEL1: LOCAL CONSENSUS  This is a state when all parties related to the new contract state approve it my digitally signing it’s new state.  Universa parties are by default completely anonymous holders of the private keys, whose public key are mentioned in the contract. In the simplest case it’s a party who creates a new contract, or current contract owner. The contracts could be really complex and require many parties to confirm some sort of changes, in this cases all related parties must sign the new state with their private keys. When all required signatures are added to the contract, it is the local consensus.  LEVEL2: NETWORK CONSENSUS  Once the local consensus is found, the contract is being sent to the universa network for the approval. Every node of the network receives the copy and perform a thorough check of its logic, restrictions, permissions, signatures and state of referred contracts. Then each node publish its local decision: either positive or negative, and inform the network about it.  In the case 11% of nodes will make negative decision, the negative consensus, the voting will be cancelled and all nodes will write down in the ledger the rejection of the contract’s state.  Otherwise, as soon as 90% of the nodes will make positive decision, the positive consensus, all the nodes will write to their ledgers the approval of the new contract’s state.  Each node has it’s own copy of the Ledger and stamps the time when new contract state was presented for approval.",False

Alexander Borodich, a creator of Universa platform, explains why this can happen in the nearest future. “Today, the dependence of blockchain on highly costly mining process resembles the dependence of gold coins on the price of gold. Instead, we suggest new cheap and easy way of creating smart contracts, which can act as cash substitutes, in a somewhat original way. If the invention of a bitcoin can be compared to the discovery of gold, then Universa is a new stage, symbolizing the arrival of paper money to the market of mutual settlements,” he says.   Five Key Advantages of Universa over Bitcoin and Ethereum   1. Universa is a pioneer of the new generation blockchain  Universa has originally been developed not as a cryptocurrency, but as a protocol creating and operating chains of smart contracts. Therefore, Universa platform does not depend on mining, which results both in high speed and low cost of procession operations, in terms of the resources required.  2. Universa is 1000 times faster than user familiar Bitcoin  Universa nodes do not require mining and are responsible for verifying the transactions and smart contracts that customers submit onto the network. Waiving mining opened a way to increase network performance by hundreds of times. The Universa blockchain structure is based on the language of smart contracts, developed from scratch. The well-thought-out logical structure and language hierarchy made it possible to reach the speed of 10,000 transactions per second on the network nodes.  3. Universa transactions are 100 times cheaper than those in Bitcoin  Today, it deems absolutely unreasonable to charge $3,85 for a few cents worth microtransaction. Yet, on the Bitcoin platform, this price is a current money transfer fee, which accounts for the speculative nature of Bitcoin exchange rate, and its high volatility. The smart contacts system on Universa platform allowed to decrease such fees by hundreds of times.  4. Universa offers an entirely new smart contract system  Various smart contract chains can be created on Universa platform.  These smart contracts can be implemented in almost all business fields. Universa smart contracts can be applied to programming both intracompany applications and public ones. For example:  Vehicle smart key Fitness and SPA pass card IoT - smart home elements working together Payments at parking lots or gas stations Logistics, cargo tracking    It will be possible to implement all of the above mentioned and many other ways of Universa smart contracts applications, in the nearest future.  5. Universa is real “smart money”  The Universa platform significantly simplifies the transaction processes in the field of e-commerce. It will make it possible to accept payments in any currency in automated mode in any currency in automatic mode and formalize the transaction document with a smart contract on the spot. Along with everything else, Universa will simplify the process of applying for loans in the Internet, electronic currency exchange, and filling in customs declarations to a great extent.  There is no doubt that Universa will soon become one of the key blockchain platforms and will be widely present in different business spheres. Alexander Borodich is very open about his ambitious plan to  attract at least $ 100 million during TGE. Today, Borodich, the former Mail.ru Group top manager, is the most active venture investor in Russia and the founder of Venture Club crowd investment platform.   SEE WHITEPAPER FOR MORE DETAILS      In short: Universa defines a set of data formats, protocols and entities, which enable smart contracts owned and controlled by services, organizations and persons, with a decentralized notary cloud that certifies each transaction.  Each smart contract comes in a heavily protected, packed representation, the capsule, signed by at least one party (the owner) and optionally by any number of other parties; the capsule contains an unencrypted public, and optionally an encrypted private part, with multiple-key access. For example, the contract owner may not have access to the encrypted part, and several other parties may independently have access.  Each capsule has a unique ID, by which the notary cloud can confirm and revoke its approval of the respective contract. A capsule approved by the notary cloud contains a smart contract, valid for all purposes declared in its public part.  A party that has the necessary rights (e.g. keys) to perform one or more valid actions under the respective contract can perform those and validate the results, e.g., transfer some e-currency from one owner to another, vote with a public or privileged share, receive dividends, or do virtually anything else.
