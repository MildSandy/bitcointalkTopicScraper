We kindly ask all Worldcore customers to withdraw remaining balances to bank accounts before February, 25.  Withdrawals are allowed only to the name of the account holder at Worldcore. Please be informed that Third-party transfers are not available anymore.  Since this day, bank transfers will be unavqilable and impossible for unknown period.  The list of force-majeure reasons is very long and we share it with our customers with full transparency as we always did.  The company started it’s operation in the end of 2015 and we already reached around $100 Million annual transaction volume in 2017. Worldcore was built without attracting venture funding or any other third-party investors.  We built strong team of over 30 experts in all fields required for operating successful and rapidly growing - developers, marketing team, sales department, legal& compliance department, KYC department.  We build a lot of partnerships by the end of 2017 and Worldcre almost reached break-even point first time in August 2017, while having almost 150,000 Euros average monthly operational costs.  In the end of 2017 we lost our 2 key financial partners - Rietumu Bank and Wave Crest Holdings. Rietumu was used by Worldcore as main operator for bank transfers and Wave Crest was the card issuer. We had the highest ATM withdrawal limits on the market and everything worked like a clock in both directions until these institutions got into problem with authorities. For example, Rietumu got fined for 80 Million Euros in world-famous French AML case. Wave Crest lost it’s license with Visa and got tons of restrictions for MasterCard card programmes.  Initially, we didn’t think that such situation can ruin our well-established company, we had around 5 more backup bank accounts for operation and we immediately started looking for new card issuer to resume issuance of debit cards as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the company has lost almost 90% of it’s monthly revenue due to these force-majeurs and got a lot of reputational losses, while being under informatioon attack, which we reported every month and hired experienced lawyers to fight with hundreds of mass media, which published false and paid materials blacking our repiutation.  Overflood of such content about our company became a one more non-breakable wall to build new partnerships with card issuers and banks because every compliance team does it’s own due diligence with google search results as well.  Morerover, almost every next month after November, we lost our backup bank accounts one by one. In accordance with EU payment services and banking laws, banks has no right to close or not to open an account without a reason, but all of them did it this way and it’s absolutely illegal from their side.  Many time we were asking for assistance from our regulator Czech National Bank. They were are always totally passive to this situation, even when Worldcore and other Czech payment companies submitted collective dispute for illegal actions and ignorance of FinTech by banks. Reaction of regulator to any of our (or other’s) requests usually takes months and in most cases doesn’t bring the expected result, which has to be backed by the law, which we always followed.  By summer 2018 situation with banks became critical and we were unable to process withdrawals of our clients, we had no other choice than to open an account with similar payment company to process people’s transfers, and we succeeded with it. In accordance with the European law, payment institution can hold client’s funds in credit institution (bank) but not in another payment institution. This so-called violation from our side was confirmed with Czech National Bank because otherwise thousands of people will have no access to their funds in Worldcore accounts and will send them millions of disputes that Worldcore doesn’t process payments.  Meanwhile, since September 2017 to December 2018 Worldcore was under the strongest information attack initiated by criminal group from CIS countries to discredit company and involve in BlackPR war of 2 criminal groups. The reason for such attack, which costed us million Euros of losses (direct losses, neverending legal fees to communicate with mass media and submit 1000s disputes for deletion of Black PR articles against Worldcore.  All this period the monthly operational loss of Worldcore only grew because by the time of 10/2017 it was a large established business with high revenue, high transaction volume, visibility and popularity on the market.  A lot of our colleagues which we communicate with are close to business closure due to complete shock of what’s happening on the market and how almost all banks violate the law of working with payment institutions and providing accounts for them.  When we started obtaining required codes for direct connection to SEPA network and process EUR transfers without using banks and with providing dedicated IBAN account for each customer, all three providers of such facilities (Banking Circle, Central Bank of Lithuania, SolarisBank) answered almost the same - they can’t allocate sufficient resources at the moment to onboard Worldcore. The law doesn’t allow to block access to banking services for Fintech companies now, but according to current reality, professional bank lawyers now just started linking to their internal technical issues and impossibility to allocate resources for providing access to banking services for fintech companies.  Please also note that each answer from every organisation starting from regulator and ending by card issuer is a very slow multi-weeks or in the worst-case multi-months chat where nobody cares (except our team) about our monthly operational losses, which we couldn’t even reduce because the whole infrastructure became too big by the end of 2017 and was build step by step while the company and load to employees was rapidly growing.  Unfortunately, we are already out of physical and financial resources to keep fighting and breaking 10 non-breakable walls the same time, waiting and hoping for the best while dealing with almost every organisation - banks, regulator, card issuers.  Such combination of barriers and total passiveness of regulator in all of these cases is a headshot with guaranteed death to any fintech business. Our team spent over 5 years to build this project from the scratch to the state, in which you currently see it, we have been working day and night, there are hundreds of thousands lines of code in Worldcore software and the same number of hours of legal works. Since 2017 our life turned into hell, we didn’t give up but we are out of power and finances to keep waiting for something better and miracle from this industry according to what’s going on in 2017, 2018 and 2019 with regulations, authorities and relationships between banks and fintech companies, if this horror can be called relationships.  Worldcore team sincerely hopes for everyone’s understanding, we did all that we could and this measure is forced by large number of circumstances where chances to survive for the company are close to zero.  Please withdraw your unspent balances from accounts before February 25.  Withdrawals are allowed only to the name of the account holder at Worldcore. Please be informed that Third-party transfers are not available anymore.  After this date it will be impossible to be done yourself in Worldcore accounts because we cannot continue finance large Amazon technical infrastructure to continue supporting payment system.  We apologize for inconvenience caused by all of circumsances listed above and we are proud to say that we did our best to delivery the top quality financial services in accordance with mission of our project.",False

I'm not the support, but I'm not intimidated by what you're saying. Yes, it went down like all the others. It finished its rise after the ICO in full swing where the BTC reached 20K. You have to count like all the others after ICO, there is the bubble and the dive. And then it's after that that we start the fall of the BTC. This is therefore a double slap directly to all finished ICOs in these date fields. Then it's not a token utility, it's a token that serves as an income in ETH. So it is quite useful when it is low too. Because it is the quantity that is most important in an income system. It's not about prices. Even if we earn more by one day removing the tokens above our purchase. This is the same problem as Jarvis Edge in the middle of the current ICO. It is an income token and not a token utility. It's a very good project, but the token doesn't attract speculators.  Yes, we will see in March 2019, if a sufficient number of the more than 29,000 holders who are satisfied with wanting to increase; then the price will rise, to take more for 2020 pro rata. For the rest, you or I know how to manage a portfolio, a management fund. I am in the field, I know the risks of management. I have a lot of investment if I count all the places where my business is run. Between the world of the traditional market and on crypto or equity shares.  I am also an investor as a shareholder of a company. I have had daily follow-up since last year before we started talking in public. I know the work and the slowness of the regulations. And so is all team management. I have a more in-depth image than a new person. When Worldcore announces a regulation to be made, I understand the coding of the work better than anyone else.

We'd like to mention that Worldcore payment platform is an industry-first PCI DSS compliant wallet for cryptoassets with wide range of payment products for FIAT transactions, checkout solution for websites and API for mass payments.  In February we've got a problem with Worldcore cards because MasterCard became unfriendly to all crypto-related projects. As a result, we were forced to stop issuing the debit cards and immediately started looking for the fastest solution for issuing Visa debit cards. Unfortunately, due to the highest level of bureaucracy in the industry and slow speed of applications review it took a few months to get the initial approval of the application, which was finally received this week. Now we are moving forward with further setup of card program to resume the issuance of debit cards. Thank you so much for your support! Have a wonderful weekend! Stay tuned for next updates!",False

I also greet Ukranian scammers as well as other salo+gorilka driven individuals whose neuron chain has been severely damaged resulting in IQ loss.  There are WRC tokens in my investment portfolio as well as few dozens of alts and ERC20. I actually did swear not to log in till Dec 2018 while waiting for next bullish rally. Anyway i did actually check my possessions status lately, got upset and headed right to bittalk ) While running through token threads i discovered that 190 pages scam accusation topic by Marina Uni. Good luck my russian is fluent enought to get that #axyлeбля bullshit mess going on there. I took some time to check and learn facts provided by both sides. I also took time to contact some of my friends in several structures to check provided info. Well, my conclusion is that current low price of WRC token is 90% fault of ukranian scammers and their hired paid poster - Marina Uni running her endless accounts.  I asked Marina a few questions that were ignored in russian thread. Those questions are quite simple:  -If you were paid by ukranian scammers and spent like a year on providing black PR activity over russian project  resulting in its token price and trade volumes drastically fall -are you ready to compensate those losses to investors since it is your direct fault?   -You have bought some property, started a business with those money you received from ukranian scammers, so why don't you compensate investors losses by buying their tokens even at 0.25 price? It is fair. You ruined the token -ruined investments, but you received those money from ukranian scammers -use them for good.   I asked several of her accounts out there and never got an answer.   Anyway there is a group of investors intended to get their money from scammers that actually almost ruined the project. Gennadiy is among them. He is now heading to Ural to check things up and communicate with local patriots about scammy ukranian money and paidposters who almost ruined russian project. Message me if you still hold the token. Marina was deanonymized, there is full info on herself and her strap on hubbies possessions, as well as family possessions. Those will not cover all the losses, but at least some of them. Patriots of syberia and ural are ready to help us. You cant't even imagine how ukranian scammers are hated out there by those severe men who make their living among endless snowy dales and forests inhabited by russian bear being usually asleep, but if occasionally woke up -pizdets is surely going to happen.",False

The reason for current few days delay is explained in a newsletter in our previous message.

We are always open and straight talk about everything, including delays and their reasons. They happen in almost all industries from construction and automotive to IT developments. This is nothing more than the working situation, almost unavoidable in the process of creation of something new and complicated.  We were working till night yesterday and released on production server the Exchange. Now access to it is available only for the team and it's protected with password.  The explaination is that it's not a homepage, it's the product that involves a bunch of server applications, databases and many other technical aspects of security, therefore established identical to the stage-server infrastructure needed some configuration, and admins were working on it till night yesterday.  We held a meeting and made an objective decision to postpone the launch due to the following reasons:  1. Without Tether (USDT) to let it go live is undesirable, and rather even meaningless, because given all the volatility of the cryptomarket, people just need to fix the profits in the FIAT and reenter in the fall. For the integration we need around 1 week.  2. We also identified some solvable difficulties with the issue of commissions for withdrawal of ERC20 tokens. We already started applying some corrections to get it sorted out.  At the meeting, the marketing department and the management decided to setup marketing campaigns with Google Adwords and to order press releases in blockchain-media before the launch date because of delay between order date and publishment. Otherwise, this opening will be technical as the first days of the restaurant for its owners. This will be nothing more than a demonstration of the performance of our team of developers (which obviously should not be in doubt, seeing how much updates we were rolled out after the ICO and what was done before from 2015 to 2017), rather than the full start of a serious product with an instant filling of the database by traders and global multi-channel marketing campaign.  Today we are starting set up Google AdWords and will order press releases on a multiple resources with rewrites of content in different languages for a wider coverage (example-translation of PR to German for btc-echo.de).  We understand that we will face a number of dissatisfaction due to start delay, but it is foolish to deny that this is a complex product, in which you have to consider a lot of things in order to make it successful. The product that we developed from scratch and developed in a rather short time, considering that the Department of Development of the exchange is not yet packed with dozens of people like development team of our payment platform.  We think with foresight and think like businessmen with huge experience in IT and finance and global vision.  We sincerely hope for understanding that this decision is logical and objective to make everything correct for the quick and bright launch as needed.  The new date of the official start of the exchange with all the necessary lighting in the media and the launch of traffic on several channels - June 1, 2018.  The day after tomorrow will release a new version of the Android application, which is like a browser account, and now the IOS app will support purses for tokens with graphs.",False

That will only play out like a pyramid scheme and a lot of people will eventually lose. The focus should be on the team, the actual product! The tech and what they set out to achieve is the reason why people should invest. As without a tangible product, it can hold no lasting value. It will just be a bubble that will eventually burst and fade away.

Few people know Worldcore, and the telegram group is only more than 2000, which is a bad result compared to the project of the same period last year.  In the encrypted world, marketing and hype are necessary. If bitcoin is not publicizing, then bitcoin will not be known by hundreds of millions of people in a few short years. It can be seen that marketing is a key force for the success of a project.  I think the team needs to work hard to promote marketing in the future, so that more people will know about WRC, otherwise the exchange will not have a large number of users at the beginning.

Pessimism is replaced by optimism and so all the time. Many laws to regulate the blockchain will affect the growth this market in future. Here is the latest CCN news: Quote Liechtenstein PM Proposes Friendly Crypto Regulation With New “Blockchain Act”  Liechtenstein is one of many small European nations establishing itself as a blockchain hub over recent years. With a population of just 40,000 people, Liechtenstein is the sixth smallest country in the world and is home to more businesses than actual citizens due to the low tax rate. Liechtenstein is particularly attractive to blockchain businesses due to the extreme ease with which they can set up – it’s not necessary to open a bank account to start a company, and the whole process can be handled with Ethereum or Bitcoin following the country’s leading financial institution Bank Frick accepting cryptocurrency directly. Aeternityblockchain creator YanislavMalahov recently set up shop in Liechtenstein, telling Forbes “they’re making it really easy to incorporate a cryptocurrency business”.  Crown Prince Alois is even interested in using blockchain for administrative government uses as well as stating his family’s interest in cryptocurrency investment, among the richest royal families in Europe. With all that in mind, it’s no surprise that the nation is planning to take it very easy on blockchain regulation in their upcoming legislation known simply as “The Blockchain Act”.  Prime Minister Adrian Hasler states that far from simply regulating the spending, tax, and issuance of cryptocurrency, the law aims to “provide the necessary legal framework for a wide range of new services and business models relating to these technologies”, saying that it “goes much further than the blockchain legislation of other countries” in his speech at a Finance Forum in late March.  Liechtenstein is one of many small nations punching above their weight in the blockchain space, perhaps capitalizing on the inherently slower regulatory efforts made by larger countries. Switzerland is another rising blockchain hub with cryptocurrency adoption widespread in cities like Zug, while the Prime Minister of Malta personally welcomed the proposed relocation of Binance HQ to their small island, while announcing his support for blockchain technology and calling on other EU leaders to join him “on the frontline in embracing this crucial innovation” and create the “Bitcoin continent of Europe”.

This situation exists primarily because there is no easy way to cash out your profits into FIAT whenever we wish to.  There is a long procedure. You have to first sell your cryptos into BTC, transfer that to Coinbase for instance, and sell it at Coinbase running rates, then send that money to your account. Don’t forget the fees you have to pay at each transfer.  It’s a pain.  WorldCore, our pick today, aims to solve this issue along with bridging the gap between crypto and fiat.  BACKGROUND: Cryptocurrencies have just started to pick popularity. Granted that bitcoin has been an household name, in theory, for sometime now, people have just begun to realize how big this space really is and its true potential.  As more and more people come into this space, the demand to convert fiat to cryptos and cryptos to fiat will grow. There is, at this time, not a viable solution available in the market.  WorldCore aims to change that.  WorldCore is a company with 40 employees, been rated number 1 in Czech Republic, had its company valuation completed by one of the Big 4 Accounting firm (EY) before they went onto the ICO, burned the tokens that were not sold in ICO, they burned over 750 Million out of 1 Billion tokens, leaving total supply at 250 Million.  So far, they have been doing everything they promised. That is a good sign, especially, when your goal is to change the crypto-fiance space forever.  WorldCore not only offers transfer to one recipient but they also offer group transfers. This helps both individuals and corporates alike.  Cash can be picked up via a physical locations (like Western Union), received into a bank account, opt to receive a debit card, etc. They offer multiple choices.  Those who don’t want to transfer anything can also use fiat currency to invest into various crypto-assets with WorldCore.  Their target audience includes individuals, corporates and e-commerce space. They also have plans to issue both physical and virtual debits cards.  Token holders will get 30% of profits generated on March 31st each year. TEAM: According to their whitepaper, Alexey Nasonov, CEO was listed in Europe’s 100 list of change makers. Their markets and public relations officer, Sean Patterson, has experience in various roles with Apple, Porsche, etc. Their general partners include bitpay, BioID, Armor, etc.  Their whitepaper alludes to the fact that they have over 40 employees taking care of design, production, development, customer service, compliance, legal, operations etc.  COMPETITION: We have not seen other companies in this space with existing company, verified by reputable accounting firm, with a profit sharing model and extensive business plan.  We expect more and more companies venture into this space as it can accommodate lot more players who offer different advantages to the customers.  CAVEAT: Hopefully the profit sharing model does not force the company to comply with securities rules. We do not know how Czech Republic treats it, although, we anticipate that WorldCore has looked at this aspect.  Their plans are grand, have a decent team in place with experience in the industry. Even if they disrupt the crypto-fiat-crypto space, it will be a huge deal, as long as they execute on it. And that is the biggest caveat.

WRC token is now also added to CoinMarketCap. We are currently working on both creating new products and launching global international marketing campaigns for further token promotion and multiplying it's daily trading volume to let you enjoy the trading and meet your expectations.  According to terms of ICO, we had to destroy all unsold tokens as well. This is finally done and may be easily verified on Etherscan. Over 750 million tokens have been successfully burned and total supply is now less than 250 million WRC.  We are currently working on listing on one of the major Asian exchanges, which is expected to happen within 3-4 weeks. More exchanges from TOP-10 will surely list WRC token before March as we have to show the token performance and it's growing volume to start the listing procedure there and this is what we are currently working on.  Our developers have also finished development of the website for token holders, which is currently available at https://wrc.cab domain name. Just sign up and verify your Ethereum address to be able to participate in voting, submit marketing reports or view financial statistics of Worldcore business  in case you hold over 500,000 WRC tokens in your Ethereum wallet.  What's going to be added to Worldcore platform next before 2018?  - Worldcore mobile app for Android will be added to PlayMarket before the end of this week (iOS app was presented in November already)  - Wallets for ERC-20 tokens with statistics, charts, alerts and analytics tools will be presented next week  We wish to thank everyone for participation in Worldcore ICO and we will do our best to deliver the very best results to our token holders and clients!

Good news!  In September Worldcore has ordered technical audit last by DataArt, the global technology consultancy with expertise in the financial services, travel & hospitality, healthcare & life sciences, media, telecom, retail, iGambling & IoT industries. Founded in 1997, DataArt employs 2000+ engineers across its 17 offices in ten countries, including the UK, US, Russia, Germany, Switzerland, Argentina, Poland, Latvia, Bulgaria and Ukraine. This was required to make sure that our technical infrastructure is ready for fast scaling.  We worked hard to optimize the entire software and database to provide the highest possible speed of responses to any requests of our customers like submission of transaction, filtering statements, passing verification and other technical-related requests.  DataArt experts deeply reviewed our software and completed all required tests - Stress Test, Load Test and Long Period Test. It's great to notice that DataArt performance report confirms that our infrastructure can operate normally even if the load on our servers will be up to 43 times more than today. According to current statistics (26,000+ clients), Worldcore can easily handle up to 1.1 million accounts with no need to upgrade software and hardware. This is one more point for Worldcore's software quality and security.",False
