It is not about only tracing the cases of unauthorized usage of your creation in internet or offline. So simple, but still not understood: protection starts with registration! As many IP litigators and experienced authors repeat all the time: claim your copyright prior to any publishing. This is absolute rule, no exceptions even for blockchain-based services. So many startups on IP field appeared recently. They have really promising solutions for copyright holders. Indeed, blockchain is a technology aimed to facilitate the process of copyright examination, data encrypting, tracing and many other issues but first one should register ownership through the real personal identification. Anonymity have nothing to cope with this. That is why udiar.io will be always few steps forward - it is real IP agency rooted in legal terrain and using future technologies as fertilizers for generous growing.

Indeed) We need them to overcome 2 main limitations (or to say, features) of blockchain. First problem is the data volume limit. Second â€“ anonymity. Anonymity is couldnâ€™t be implemented fully in case of recording the copyright since we need a real identified person to be vested with a right for intellectual property) and unchangeability of recorded data. We will use 2 different blockchains for this purpose. First â€“ the private one which will record complete information essential for convenient copyright fixation: 1).the object (it could be text, music or image files, 3D-model or scheme), 2).the description of the object (text notes from creator about what is about and/or what is it for, what is it made of or any other necessary information which could describe the object and 3).personal ID data of the author. Once the depositing (timestamping) is completed, the generated hash will be recorded to the public blockchain (the second one) and therefore accessible for everyone. Thus, private blockchain enables us to record a large volume of data, and public blockchain gives a transparency and excludes the risk of any retroactive changes and falsifications.",False

Let's make it clear. 1. What do you mean by different wording? Description of the deposited object or text object inself? Since the system behaves authomatically, both objects will be deposited. But, if the  object is same so the authorship will go to the earliest one (as anyone will see in timestamp). Regardless to any different descriptions. Because description is not an object - it is just accopanying option. So if there would be any disput or suing, the earliest will win. 2. In case of illegal usage of your intellectual property you should apply the system for certificate (real watermark protected paper with crypto stamps). This particular servise is chargeable but really low - 1200 Rub, which is now abound 20USD). This paper is an evidence, a good tool for your lawer.  Actually to reserve rights you need no jurisdition because it is global by it's nature as Berne Convention says (this is the main worlwide document for IP protection wich was ratified by around 190 countries including Russia and US)  The issue is an international recognizing of approval documents. That's why we launched ICO - to overcome this bureaucratic barriers. We want to use blockchain for protection and transparency. After we want to initialize some disput cases to start approving blockchain as an approving tool. Once we succeded (the precedent) - blockchain wiil gain an absolutely new level as a globally recognized approval of.... anything!",False

They have working depository with thousands of IP objects. What they really need is funding for international expansion and blockchain. They use Russian CryptoPro System as of now which is recognized by the government but still not decentralized. So ICO for them is real need and obvious decision. Two thumbs up to this preject.
