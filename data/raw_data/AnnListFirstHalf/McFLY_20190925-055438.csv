Token Launch Phase I,"   One of the fundamental risks of any project engaged in aircraft manufacturing in this new industry is... Let’s put it like this. There are 15 private and not very large aircraft designer companies. When they release their VTOLs to public, they will at once find themselves among giants like Uber, Boeing, Embraer, Airbus, Bell Helicopter, etc. - all these are large companies with their other side-businesses, with which they can subsidize their research in the same field, pushing us away from the market. So everybody of us, everybody of these 15 companies, require venture investments. Venture investors always say - you know, our risk in your business is that the margin in this market will not be yours to enjoy. Passengers will be paying trillion dollars for the flight, but you’ll get nothing from it, because giants will simply push you away.  Respectfully, the first emergency for us is to arrange for our direct interaction with the market of customer flights by means of the shared economy with a ridesharing decentralised network  instead of the centralised management. This is how we want to see the future. To make this future real, our main task should not be just to make a VTOL, but to make it generally available for you and me and everybody to fly. And here comes blockchain implementation, which becomes inseparable from the task of producing VTOLs.",False
