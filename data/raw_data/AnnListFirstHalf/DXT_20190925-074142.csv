In order to solve this problem, Datawallet has announced a new product, the ""Bot or Not protocol,"" to cut down on the prevalence of bots on ad networks. The company has developed the product in partnership with another startup, Enigma, which focuses on keeping data private in blockchain-based smart contracts.  The two companies announced a partnership in August, to be coordinated with the launch of an initial version of Enigma's ""secret contracts"" protocol on ethereum, which was initially scheduled for the end of the third quarter but has since been pushed back.  Datawallet also has yet to launch its platform, but is targeting the fourth quarter, according to Engel. Still, the two companies are proceeding with a test of the Bot or Not service. Engel said they would ""pilot this as a sandbox"" for three or four months, with a ""full rollout"" coming as early as next spring.  Here is explained how they will collaborate. Enigma have 47 mln marketcap (and had 600 mln AHT) and Datawallet have only 3 mln. I think this is very undervalued project ",False

Given the regulatory uncertainty (and the currently tightening regulatory environment) we cannot give you a specific date of a possible exchange listing. DXT is a utlity token powering data exchanges within the Datawallet platform. By actively creating a secondary market and even announcing when an exchange decides to list our token it may be seen as an effort to converting it into a security - which it is not. Speculative secondary trading is against the spirit of the DXT token and Datawallet project. When having conversations with exchanges we have to make sure that a listing would not change the DXT status and that everything complies with current regulations. This is all just to help you understand that the whole process is not as simple as the technical integration. Further, also just as information, a friend of mine from OKEx (currently the biggest cryptocurrency exchange by volume) recently told me that all throughout 2018 they are so far receiving about 40-50 applications a day of projects wanting to get listed - and from those half are basically scams and the others they review. Afterwards, it's a long process of due diligence, NDAs, technical tests, etc. - and lastly, it's debatable if paying 3-5% of token sale proceeds to get listed on a single exchange yields the best long-term value for stakeholders. I hope this explains a bit why we can't tell you ""big exchange in x days"".",False

DX Research is Datawallet’s development research platform. Data shared via this exchange will be used to create anonymized analyses that will help us further develop the exchange side of our platform. Everyone participating in DX Research will earn up to 10 DXT per month, depending on the data sources connected. No personal identifiable information will ever be shared with anyone looking at an analysis from DX Research. This data exchange will give users of the Datawallet app another way of earning DXT for sharing their privacy-preserved insights, with some geographical restrictions currently still enforced. While allowing the Datawallet team to better build the next iteration of our platform.  We are at this time completely revamping our proprietary analytics platform DX Insights with the goal of making it more scalable and to more easily onboard enterprise clients.

When the backend infrastructure is finalized we will launch we will launch more exchanges with our partners that are already in the pipeline. We are excited for these exchanges.  We also finalized the payout flow of DXT. As we previously said, the goal for the was the end of April.

Here's one from a community member you guys may find interesting, and of course Yannick's response    'Hey guys, I read with interest your projection that data brokers are expected to sell data worth $7,600 per year per American internet user by 2022.  Is there a reference somewhere th'at backs this up and/or describes the current composition of this revenue?  I've looked up the current revenue of companies like Experian and Axciom, but these are pretty small compared to the projection you've described'  And Yannick's answer:  Hey, this is a very interesting question indeed. Of course it's very difficult to predict and cases like the one with Facebook & CA now are also likely to have an impact on this as it will influence regulations, public opinion and thus solutions. There are different estimates that widely vary, but one that we often cite as the basis is the following:  A special one year investigation into the Data Brokerage market— led by Senator Jay Rockefeller IV and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation—estimated the total market size of Data Brokerage to be $156 billion in 2012. This means that the average American citizen would have made roughly $1,600 that year. That is a 2.8% increase to the median household income.  Due to their relatively higher internet consumption, millennials between 18 and 29 would have made $2,600 per year if they were receiving the proceeds of Data Brokerage. These proceeds will become even more substantial given the exponentially growth of this asset class. A staggering 90% of all data has been created in the past two years. If we do a simple forecast of the Data Brokerage market based on a weighted growth factor collated from research presented by EMC and the growth rates of publicly listed data brokers (Acxiom, Equifax, Experian, and Alliance Data Systems), we  find that this market stands to grow about 27% per year. In the year 2022, the potential proceeds of an individual’s data will have grown to an average of $6,700 per American internet user per year, with millennials standing to make around $10,900 per person.  I hope this gives some insights into the calculations, but as I mentioned this will widely vary depending on depth & amount of data, target audience, etc.'  Make sure to join the discussion here https://t.me/datawallet",False

Related, let me tell you something that we're even more excited about---a user download data flow, where users download their own data and then upload it to their Datawallet profile.  We understand this requires a little more effort from the user, but the download processes are normally straightforward and the upside is huge. This user download data flow will allow users to create a richer and more valuable data-profile because they can onboard data sources that do not have other access points, such as an API. [however] the only current automated (and simplest) data capture flow is through email. We are working on different solutions and we did prioritize the Gmail pipeline as it's widely used and the most requested e-mail connection.!",False

We're working with several marketing agencies globally to address this. Again, please keep in mind that we have spent nothing on marketing so far and there are still a lot of people who have never heard of DW.

We have just posted our first community update after the token sale. It's meant to function as a weekly recap as well as what's to come in the following week. We have a lot of exciting developments coming up - so this is a starting point for us to update you on everything going on!  In the post we go a bit more in detail on the current state of the app as well as a more points, including:  Our more detailed road map is already in the works and will be released next week — we’re really excited for what’s to come.  We will be deleting all KYC data of people that did not participate in the token sale. Due to KYC/AML legislative requirements the data of participants is kept on file in a secure offline environment.  We are further updating our website post token sale. The new version will be pushed out soon.  Our Biz Dev team is accumulating an impressive deal pipeline for the Datawallet platform. Updates about partnerships will be announced as they happen.  We will release information on exchange listings as they happen. We cannot release any information on this prior. Listing platforms are free to add and remove the DXT token from the listing independently from us. You can also track news and updates on the listing sites to see what tokens they have available.  Datawallet partners with Indorse - the decentralized network for professionals.  Datawallet partners with Kochava - the pioneering adtech platform and their OnXCHNG program  Also the rest of the core team will be more active in here in the coming weeks as we ramp up our operations - I know this is something that a lot of you have requested as well.

It's part of the article shared above, but here is the excerpt  The referral status inside the app  We will be ending the current referral system (scheduled 2018–02–19 Mon) as we are overhauling our permission-based data marketplace and app infrastructure. In the current referral system, users were awarded DXT for setting up their profile within Datawallet and inviting friends, which served as a way for us to test for user behavior and bugs within the app, and allow users who were not able to participate in our tokensale to nonetheless own DXT.  With our tokensale having been completed, we are now switching our methodology back to a enterprise-driven payout system. This means that all payouts within the app will come from the different data exchanges. Currently the primary revenue driver will be our enterprise application, DX Insights. DX Insights will stipulate participation requirements within the Datawallet app. Those requirements are set forth by companies utilizing DX Insights. This means that during one week, companies may be looking to analyze anonymized spending habits of people in New York City, while another week (the same or different) companies may be interested in social media topics from Indonesia. Who can participate in DX Insights and who will get rewarded in DXT will be based on those different requirements. We are working on integrating a new referral system via the DX Insights platform. Needless to say, all referrals and DXT earned so far will awarded.  We will have a separate post in the coming weeks detailing how precisely DX Insights works and how payouts are structured based on company requirements, as outlined above.",False

I have only two major concerns after reading whitepaper*  1) You mentioned Acxiom (and other Data Brokers) as your main competitors. Since they get all data for free and are well established (Acxiom has more than 4000 workers). They must be efficient with data preparation etc. and selling big packages of prepared data to companies. Companies will be able to get these data for much less than from DTX-Exchange and they are able to get big packages of data fast. So for companies to get Consumer Data from DTX-Exchange will be costly and time-consuming. --> So how do you think to solve this issue, to make it for companies more attractive to get Data from DTX-Exchange than from your competitors? I know that your main argument will be Data Quality (which these competitors don't provide) and here comes my second question.   2) Who and How does one ensures that the informations the Data Providers (Consumers) provide to Data Requesters (Companies) are real or true? I mean everybody can make up a story to earn some money... And in many surveys people just make random statements... --> So, is there any mechanism that ensures Data Quality from Data Providers? -->And how can companies be sure that they get Quality Data? -->What are the incentives to provide Quality Informations for Consumers (other than DTX-Tokens in exchange for answering Data Requests, we already know that)?  What I personally would like is if Data Providers could be also incentivized (earn more DTX-Tokens) to confirm true/false information data of other Data providers, but since it is personal information its off the table :/   Looking forward to your answers. Thanks in advance!   *maybe I missed something, but that's why I am asking you",False

The data-sharing economy is also dysfunctional for data consumers, with issues that can be understood in terms of the silo, quality and ethics problems. The silo problem occurs because data is collected across a variety of websites and platforms. Because the data collection occurs in separate “walled gardens”, data consumers are forced to piece together disparate pieces of information in order to produce a profile of an individual, which can lead to inaccuracies and models that are generally incongruent with true online engagement. This contributes to a quality problem. Finally, the ethics problem is clear—data is acquired and monetized by corporations without informing data creators. DataWallet solves these problems by creating a new data market which utilizes blockchain technology, creating a transparent systems that can simultaneously give data creators back control over their data while providing data-informed businesses the highest quality, ethically sourced data.  Datawallet is on a mission to give personal internet users ownership of their data and in the process put $300 billion back into their pockets. Right now, companies called Data Brokers scrape the data we create behind our backs without us being able to see what data they are sourcing, control what happens with this data, or claim any of the profits made with our data. Datawallet provides users with a self-sovereign wallet that puts them in charge of their data, and allows them to monetize as well as utilize an asset that is rightfully theirs. It empowers developers to leverage a completely new data universe to build the most advanced applications ever. And it provides companies with insights that will boost their operations on a never before seen scale.  2. Once accounts are connected to datawallet we can see all the history and informations and compare it to the normal, average, data profile, etc. The Datawallet Search Agent helps data providers find requests that are relevant to their data profile.  In order to do this, users release data directives to the Search Agent, which includes demographic information or any other data points that will help the Search Agent find a relevant data requests. Once a provider finds a request that they can fulfill the terms of, they accept the request and a smart data contract is initiated. The contract posting is saved to the blockchain. In order for the smart data contract to be completed, both parties need to fulfill their part of the agreement. For requesters, they need to post the DXT offered to an escrow account specific to the contract. For providers, their data needs to be verified before the exchange can be completed, to ensure they are providing the requested data and meet the demographic requirements.  In addition to helping providers find requests, Search Agents help verify that users can provide the data promised in a smart data contract. Search Agents use the relevant data directives of the provider to attempt to verify that the provider can meet the terms of the smart contract. If they can, the exchange can be initiated, otherwise, additional communication and coordination between the Search Agent, the smart contract, and the providers Data Profile is necessary to decrypt the relevant data points and ensure that they conform to the smart contract’s specifications.",False

Nice, thank you for your support! We’re not directly competitive with Facebook and google because they don’t necessarily sell Your data themselves. They utilize their data within their walled garden to show more relevant ads to you. But you can’t Go to Facebook and say “give me data about population segment x” and you pay them cash and in return get data. What we do with Datawallet is create a feedback loop between companies and users in Facebook. So if you are a company and you want to sell water to people who like, say, Fiji water then you can go to Datawallet and ask those people who like Fiji if they would give you access to data about them So that you could learn how to best tailor Your product around them. You can then take the content you created and more Meaningful engage with people who like Fiji through a data driven feedback loop. So we effectively help companies utilize Facebook better — which is in Facebook’s interest. We are, however, directly competitive with companies such as Acxiom who scrape public Facebook data and sell this data off. Those companies sell and asset that they don’t own, and due to the fact that they can only access publicly available information, this data only touches the surface level. They can never access all the data you create on Facebook (and other platforms) — So whenever you give companies the choice to buy data about you, there is no single data broker that could offer better data about you. You have the monopoly of the best data about you. That is why companies such as Acxiom Will go out of business and that’s why in the future you will be the I t supplier of data about you.",False

By 2022, data is expected to be the most valuable resource on earth. Data, contrary to most resources, is entirely personal: its ownership is clearly attributable to the individual that created it. The data we produce is slowly but surely becoming the most valuable asset we own.  A staggering 90% of all data has been created in the past two years and this market is predicted to grow 27% per year. In 2012, the Senate Committee of Science, Commerce, and Transportation estimated that the Data Brokerage market was valued at a staggering $156 billion. This is more than four times the revenues the entire casino industry in the US generated ($37 billion) and higher than the GDP of roughly 70% of the world.

DataWallet gives you a save way of storing personal data, that you can sell to parties who may be interested in that data. DataWallet itself doesn't 'shield' you like a VPN can. That is a whole other topic.  Quote from: martincic on November 23, 2017, 10:51:36 PM What are the profits in your project?  Well, with DataWallet you can collect your personal data and sell this to interested parties. The economy will be based on DXT (the data exchange token). You will earn DXT by selling your data.",False
