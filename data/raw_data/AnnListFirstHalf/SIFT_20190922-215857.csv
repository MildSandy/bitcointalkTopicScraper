Be sure you use a low gasprice (0.5 GWEI) else transactions can become very expensive.  Problem is sending all to Etherdelta or from Etherdelta to an empty wallet. You can not set gaslimit in Etherdelta. You have to do it via Myetherwallet and interact with the ED smartcontract.  EtherDelta does not support setting the gas price directly. The best option for this is to use MyEtherWallet.com to directly access the EtherDelta smart contract to withdraw your SIFT.  You can use MyEtherWallet if you have a Trezor, private key, Ledger or recovery seed.    You must use the same wallet on MyEtherWallet.com that holds SIFT on EtherDelta – for example if you authenticate at EtherDelta using a private key, enter that key in step 9 below.   Once you have your wallet to deposit SIFT in to follow these instructions.  Please note your wallet will need enough ETH to cover the gas cost.  At 1Gwei and 2,500,000 of gas used that will be 0.00025 ETH.  Likewise if you decide you want a much quicker transaction and want to pay 10GWei for gas you would need 0.0025 ETH.   1.       Go to MyEtherWallet.com  2.       Navigate to the Contracts tab  3.       Enter the EtherDelta contract address of 0x8d12A197cB00D4747a1fe03395095ce2A5CC6819  4.       Press “Access”  5.       When “Read/Write Contract” section appears select “WithdrawToken” from the dropdown labelled “Select a function”  6.       In “Token Address” enter 0x8a187d5285d316bcbc9adafc08b51d70a0d8e000 (the address identifying SIFT itself)  7.       In “Amount” enter the balance of SIFT you want to withdraw from Etherdelta  8.       Select how to unlock your wallet (i.e. private key, Ledger, Trezor, etc.)  9.       Complete any actions in the right hand side that appear to unlock your wallet (clicking Connect to TREZOR, Connect to Ledger Wallet, Connect to MetaMask, selecting a wallet file, entering your private key, entering a mnemonic phrase, etc.)  10.   At the top right of the screen there are three drop downs – one o fhtme says “Gas Price: XX Gwei” (where XX is the current number).  We recommend changing this to 1 to reduce the transaction cost.  11.   Click “Write”  12.   A popup will appear.  When prompted enter “2500000” for the gas limit and leave “Amount to Send” as 0.  13.   Click “Generate Transaction” and the transaction should be generated.  You may have extras confirmation steps here with hardware wallets, etc, but if you’re happy with everything confirm any more popups that appear on your hardware wallet / on-screen.  14.   A transaction will be generated – follow the link to EtherScan.io to observe it.  Once it’s finished (may take a few minutes or even a couple of hours with 1GWei price) you will be credited SIFT in your wallet.  15.   You can then use MyEtherWallet.com to send the SIFT from your ED address to your normal wallet – or just keep it in this wallet.  If you want to send it all to another wallet you’ll need to send it with 3,500,000 gas limit at a recommended price of 1gwei   Once you’ve made your first SIFT withdrawal from Etherdelta you can withdraw again to the same wallet relatively easily to withdraw further SIFT to.  The gas price drops to 60k withdrawing some SIFT from ED to a wallet that already holds it and therefore it becomes possible to just use the EtherDelta interface for future withrawals.   ",False

The product is called Smart Trader, originally known as Pipbuilders.  There's a very large thread on ForexFactory that details this from 2009 onward - from its early beginnings to a commercial product.  Feel free to read through it to get a sense of the product, customer and feels as the product has grown over time: https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=157629  2. Only in profitable months, no fee when month itself isn't profitable.  An averaged return of 4% per month is viable based on our algorithms and past trading history.  We've been sharing trades over the last week as they happen in our Telegram room - calling them out as soon as spotted and follow to close.  The dividends only take half of the profits each month which means the rest is still invested to grow the fund.  3. No US exchange - yes.  This leaves a few options - the obvious being non-US exchanges.  We don't really want to get involved in day to day trading (as we don't want to market-make our own token) but we have developed a smart contract to act as an exchange for SIFT holders to buy/sell and use the contract itself to escrow the trades.  If this does become a significant problem the fund is ultimately backed and stored in fiat.  If we are being told by investors that this becomes a significant issue in the future we would propose a vote for a decision on whether to continue the fund as is or to vote to wind-down trading operation and cash out payment (we could exchange funds into ETH, or other as decided by SIFT-holders).  As we've said in answer to other questions we're happy to carry this fund on indefinitely but if a majority of holders want us to wind down operations gracefully we would.  This isn't throwing money at us for a product that doesn't exist to trade on revenues that don't exist - it's trading with funds held in trading accounts and regularly audited.  That means the funds are there to back the value of them regardless of listing on US exchanges.",False

I wanted to try and respond to the points you've raised.  1. Domain privacy service. We do indeed use domain privacy.  Those of you that register domains know the huge amount of spam and service offerings that are received.  I've posted my LinkedIn profile publicly - it's in the Whitepaper and refered from almost every article about us.  I've also included links to my personal YouTube channel, Twitter feed and my university research profile.  James doesn't use social media publicly but did open his feed up to Smith & Crown to publicly verify his identity.  I'd hope that provides some degree of personal identity.  These links are on pretty much every post written about SIFT and on almost all listings.  From a personal perspective I've promoted SIFT within my LinkedIn feed - a network of people I've worked with over a decade and built up long-term contacts from.  We've got people investing that I've worked with and established long relationships with.  I appreciate that you don't know that but from my own perspective I've put my personal identity and reputation behind this so I very much want to show that.   2. Years of experience.  This is referenced a couple of pages into the whitepaper with URLs in the footnotes including a link to a thread in ForexFactory that started back in 2009 going through the product in its various evolutions from Pipbuilders to Smart Trader and SmartVSA.com and the other services that have been offered related to it (Trade Relayer, etc.).  The ForexFactory thread is about 450 pages long and mostly covers the period of 2009 to 2012 when initial client base was built up.  There are also G+ and Facebook groups that discuss it further as well as a few Smart clients that have joined our Telegram room.  I appreciate you reference that ForexFactory hasn't got much activity - later on - it's mainly promotion - but it does initially and if you search for the history it's not exactly hidden online.   3. Website standards. I appreciate the site isn't as whizzy as it could be - actually there's a new version we're working on aside from all this but with a focus on delivering the products and no major issues that have come from it our focus has been on development of core functionality rather than marketting assets.  For one of the best delivering funds take a look at their website http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/ - shiny web standards that become outdated very quickly are a representation of nothing more than a small spend focussing on that area.  We do plan a relaunch of a site, probably in 2018, when we release some major new changes to our volume analysis - but it's not been a priority.   I'd highly recommend joining our Telegram room - we've been posting trade analysis from our systems as we've had it come in over the last few weeks.  This has included us announcing our exit criteria and price levels.  We've then been posting again with corresponding signals in real time following the trades on.  Even if you doubt our history (of which there is plenty) then the trade and chart analysis we've put out during the ICO has been completely accurate so far - we've detailed expressly when we would not be trading as well even in a market that seems like it would support it, rather than just riding the recent highs.  There are a tonne of ICOs out there that cannot deliver this or show any proof of product.  You can go and purchase ours today - you'll also get a tonne of help setting it up and using it if you do (not for Crypto but for forex) and if you want to see where we are with crypto then our Telegram can show that.  The parent company was registered for the ICO specifically to be based in the UK and to move IP there as a USA comapny base (which is where the original product started) would be highly inappropriate.  This is the case with almost every ICO, it just happens in our case it's a relocation.  I do appreciate your concerns and if there's anything practical I can do beyond pointing all this out - I will.  In the interim regardless of this we've got a fully functional product that we're showing off on a daily basis rather than a product we promise to build in the future or that will be ready once the ICO is complete.  From our perspective this immediately puts us in a stronger position than many other ICOs.  If anybody feels this isn't the investment for you I understand, but I'd hope this can alleviate most people's concerns.  If you've got further questions come and talk to use directly and engage with us on Telegram - we'd love to hear from you https://t.me/SmartIFT  Thanks,  Guy @ SIFT",False

Payouts are the first Monday of every month where there are profits.  The structure is as follows: 1. Trade profits for the month are all added together 2. A management fee is charged at the lower of 1.5% of entire fund value or 15% of that month's profits 3. The remainder is client-profit 4. 50% of client profit is paid in dividends as ETH 5. Remaining 50% of client profit is reinvested into the fund for future trading  If there has been no profit, there is no management fee nor is there any dividend payout  When the fund first starts a maximum of 15% of invested money is taken as operating expenses for the fund.  To ensure shareholder value this is repaid to shareholders before any management fees are taken.  A full breakdown of fee structures can be found at an example calculator assuming a static monthly return (obviously it's much more variable than this, however this is an average from our backtesting) at this page https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16BQS3VPRp_lAyYuOw2sXyZHk8NIE_F5Xz-XXPVXyiZk",False

The ICO is now open until September 15th, 2017.  Smart Trader is a software product that was created in 2007 after a discussion on one of the world’s largest forex trading boards.  It uses market volume and range data to determine what the largest investors are doing before the rest of the market has reacted.  This is an advanced technique that we call Smart Volume Analysis which has its roots in volume spread analysis and isn’t often used by retail investors.  Since its creation, Smart has developed its own unique signals which have allowed thousands of traders to reliably and consistently make money – In fact, many of these traders rely on Smart as their primary income stream.  Smart Trader has been significantly improved and upgraded in the past year and as a result it is able to predict movements in the crypto markets with a high degree of accuracy.  Our algorithms use artificial intelligence to build a complete picture of a market’s trends over time. With the huge one-day fluctuations in crypto values over the last couple of months Smart has proved itself with most signals returning between a 75% and 100% hit rate depending on the signal and currency.  Smart is now launching an investment fund with funds raised via an ICO for Smart Investment Fund Tokens (SIFT).  SIFT can be purchased at a rate of 0.01 Ether via a smart contract and the total amount of SIFT that can be raised during the ICO is unlimited.  The amount raised will directly relate to the initial fund size – the more raised, the larger the trading balance.  At the end of the 45-day ICO the fund will start trading following a number of rules and risk-mitigation techniques that are detailed further in our whitepaper.  Once a month, half of profits will be returned to investors in the form of dividends (paid in ether via a smart contract) whilst the rest of profits will remain in the fund so that the asset value grows.  Having completed a significant amount of testing, including multiple simulations based on historical trading data, we believe that returns on investment of 40% per year are realistic and expressed by both dividends and asset appreciation.  SIFT is supported by five different smart contracts at launch that are detailed further in our white paper.  In addition to managing the token and ICO, contracts exist to allow shareholders voting decisions in the future direction of the fund, to pay dividends and to expose transparency information about money held by the fund.  Bank account balances and trading fund account balances will be published to the blockchain daily with read-only API keys made available where possible.  Once per quarter these figures will be externally audited and the results of audits made available immediately.  Smart Investment Fund itself will make money by a management fee applied to the fund.  This fee is only charged when the fund makes a profit and the fee is capped to never exceed a percentage of gross profit.  A full breakdown of the profit calculations is detailed further in our whitepaper.  We’re really excited about bringing the benefits of our proprietary Smart Volume Analysis to crypto-currency trading.  There’s a lot more information in our white paper for additional reference and we’d love to answer any questions that you may have.   Founders James May started his career as a trader in the 1980s working in Wall Street.  After several successful deals and working with many IPOs he retired from trading before he was 30 and became an early investor in Netscape at the start of the web.  Over the past twenty years James has worked with numerous internet-based startups and grown the Smart Trader business.  Having developed Smart as a product initially for forex markets, James adapted the trading algorithms to crypto currencies in 2013 and has been working towards this product launch ever since.  Guy Powell has worked as a software developer and architect for some of the world’s largest technology companies as well as launching businesses in the music and retail sectors.  His work has covered everything from mobile apps to architecting security systems for government agencies and everything in-between.  For the last year he has spent his time working with James on the launch of the Smart Investment Fund and undertaking a PhD in robotics and artificial intelligence.  His interest in crypto-currencies started in the first days of Bitcoin and he has been writing software that integrates with blockchains since 2012.
