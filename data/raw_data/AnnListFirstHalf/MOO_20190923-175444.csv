We are grateful to everyone who believes in us and the great support from our community despite the current market conditions.  This update will answer some of the questions that you have for us.  Update 1: Token Sale Amount Raised  We heard you.  Our total raised amount stands at US$12.3 million and we remain committed to delivering what we promised.  Update 2: Regarding the Hard Cap  As retail investors shy away from the current crypto markets, our efforts to nail down incoming strategic partnerships and investments proved timely and beneficial. With these developments, it became clear that reducing the Hard Cap from US$30 million to US$15 million is in the best interest of our investors and company. The following paragraphs will explain this in detail.  #1. Those who have been following us since February will know that we delayed our public sale as we were trying to obtain the Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) that would have allowed us to accept contributions from American MOO enthusiasts. However, as a result of the SEC‚Äôs aggressive stance on ICOs and its 80 subpoenas on various crypto companies, we chose not to pursue that avenue to protect existing investors from any potential complications.  #2. We remain confident of delivering our plans as promised on a smaller budget. This is because of the cost savings that the strategic partnerships have brought us. In short, we are getting assistance from partner companies who are able to deliver more for less. It also means that we will be standing on the shoulders of giants.  #3. To improve the tokenomics of our token sale, Cloud Alliance will burn half of all other token allocations (company, founders, advisors, etc.) to reflect the halving of the hard cap.  #4. We genuinely believe that the cryptocurrency market will recover and stabilize in the near future.  The token sale will continue to run until 30 April 2018 and we will burn all remaining unsold tokens from the public sale.  Additionally, we have achieved 82% of our new hard cap as of now.  We have several partnership announcements coming up real soon, and we will continue to provide you with regular updates.  Game On.",False

Please read!  Link: https://medium.com/@Cloudmoolah/key-update-making-moo-available-for-all-b254e3470d6  Dear MOO Community,  Ever since we announced our exclusive Unity partnership in Southeast Asia, we have received overwhelming interest from investors all over the world. We are very encouraged by such keen interest and support as we know having a strong community is crucial to our business.  It is precisely with this focus that we have decided to postpone our public sale to 30 March 2018. The primary reason is that we have received strong unsolicited interest from organic contributors from various countries that require additional compliance to accommodate. We are currently in discussions with our external legal counsels on the possibility of extending the token offering to include such contributors under the Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (‚ÄúSAFT‚Äù) which is regulated under SEC Regulation D.  Given that the US market is teeming with active and vibrant Unity game developers, it is an important market for our business and ultimately one where we should build a community for our ecosystem. Furthermore, given the keen interest in our project from US investors (whom we currently do not market to nor accept any contribution from), we realize the only way to accommodate US accredited investors would be to apply for the SAFT under SEC Regulation D ‚Äì our lawyers are already working hard on this.  If we are not able to secure the SAFT in time, we do not intend to delay the crowd sale any further than 30 March 2018.  In the meantime, we will extend our current pre-sale period until the start of the public sale, or when our pre-sale is sold out, whichever the earlier.  Our pre-sale is filling up fast with strong support from strategic partners. Nevertheless, we want to accommodate the MOO Community to participate in the pre-sale as far as possible, so please register your interest for pre-sale participation (minimum 50 ETH for 25% bonus) soonest with us at tokensale@cloudmoolah.io.  Whitelisting process for crowd sale is also underway, so if you have not submitted your details please do so before we close the whitelist. You can go to our website and click on ‚Äúwhitelist‚Äù to submit your details.  We are also very excited to share with you some amazing developments on our business! Do look out for the announcements very soon.  Game On, The MOO Team",False

Just a few things to add-  The MOO token is a utility token that provides a practical use case for BOTH gamers and developers, which include but are not limited to the following,  for gamers: a conversion bonus to CMP, as mentioned a single universal in-game currency that can be used for all games in MOO store full access to content, items, events, etc. of the top mobile games Made in Unity a secure and instant way to transact in-game, e.g. trading, crowdfunding  and for developers: access to a full-suite of publishing services in SEA at discount (including receiving incubation support from Cloud Alliance) full SEA monetisation coverage once integrated a secure and instant way to transact in-game, e.g. sales of in-game items and promotion of in-game content.  Some context, also, so that it is easier to understand what we're offering in terms of convenience and utility for developers - in Southeast Asia, it typically takes a developer up to six months to integrate with each individual payment partner. This is six months of non-stop work for developers just to manage payment integration. Aside from the above use cases, what we are offering streamlines the payment integration process, and developers benefit the moment they are integrated with our platform.",False

About CloudMoolah and the MOO Token  CloudMoolah is a payment system which enables game developers to collect in-app revenue from gamers who use credit cards as well as those who do not use credit cards. In Southeast Asia, the credit card penetration is less than 3%. To access this market, a game developer used to have to take months in integrating multiple payment SDKs. Now with a single CloudMoolah SDK integration, it takes less than 10 minutes for game developers to access more than 100 million gamers in Southeast Asia from more than 500,000 retail point of sales.  The MOO Token is a new cryptocurrency which aims to support the development of the MOO Store, an app store which will be jointly developed by Cloud Allaince and Unity Technologies. The MOO Store aims to strengthen the gaming ecosystem in Southeast Asia by enabling game developers worldwide to access more than 100 million gamers in Southeast Asia more easily, and will explore the use of blockchain to make game transactions more secure and efficient.  ‚Äî Useful links:  Website: https://www.cloudmoolah.io  Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/cloudmoolah/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/Cloud_Moolah  Telegram: https://t.me/cloudmoolah  Bitcointalk ANN: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2819734.new#new  Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/CloudMoolah/  Whitepaper: https://docsend.com/view/8n3qizs  Email: tokensale@cloudmoolah.io",False

Based on what I understand, initially it will be MOO and CMP, where CMP is nothing about blockchain, just a virtual currency, while MOO will be the token that investor buy, and can be used to buy CMP with a bonus.  To be honest, this means MOO only value is backed by its ability to get bonus CMP. The CMP and its bonus are all centrally controlled by CloudMoolah company. Even after the phase where you guys put CMP on blockchain, it will be an ERC20 token, and it is already 2019, no one knows which standard is better and suit your needs by that time. If CMP will be on Ethereum, not sure what will happen to Ethereum on 2019, but currently Ethereum is not reliable as a payment method for average people. To transfer CMP, you need Ether, and after the transfer, you cannot return/refund if it is sent to a private address.  Google and Apple are doing ok with their payment system. Right now, imo, the only benefit in using blockchain is the lower cut for develop's revenue. If only CloudMoolah can give developers close to 100% of revenue, which I doubt it would be possible because business, then only blockchain is in good use.  Without debit/credit card, SEA people can use MolPoint or some other similar services. Beside, not sure who will switch from Google Play Store/App Store to CloudMoolah anytime soon.",False

Traditionally, to access this market, a game developer used to have to take months in integrating multiple payment SDKs. This enables game developers (you) to collect in-app revenue from gamers who use credit cards as well as those who do not use credit cards. Details about our local payment partners can be found on the whitepaper, litepaper and website.  We are also launching the MOO store. Unity developers will be able to launch their games out of the Unity Editor and directly into the MOO Store, where developers can use the MOO Token for:  (i) full-suite publishing services into Southeast Asia at a discount (including receiving incubation support from Cloud Alliance),  (ii) full SEA monetisation coverage with a single integration,  (iii) secure and instant in-game transaction,  (iv) Efficiency and immutability‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäBy incorporating blockchain virtual currencies, we aim to eliminate chargebacks and reduce the risk of fraud,  (v) incumbent app stores typically charge 30% in fees, the MOO Store aspires to lower this fee significantly by using blockchain technology.
