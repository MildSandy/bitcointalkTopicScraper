I'm just your average investor, and hold a decent amount of Enigma. The admins in the Telegram (https://t.me/enigmacatalyst) and Discord (https://discordapp.com/invite/SJK32GY) channels are far more knowledgeable than me about the project so if you'd like more in-depth information on the project please follow those links. This project is definitely not easy to understand the first time reading through, but after a couple read throughs the whitepaper and visiting the Telegram channel you'll come to understand Enigma more and more each time you read about it. The more you understand about the project the more use cases you'll see Enigma having.  I should start by saying Enigma and their team are not scammers. The CEO, along with some other team members, are MIT graduates and are backed by a well known professor Alex Pentland as well as other respected members in the cryptosphere and finance industry. The project was based on Guy Zyskind thesis statement and you can find his MIT media lab profile here ( http://web.media.mit.edu/~guyzys/ ).  The goal of the Enigma Project is to store data across nodes (yes Enigma will have masternodes in 2018) and allow users to purchase and run computations on the encrypted data without ever actually seeing it. As you can imagine, data is very valuable and every industry uses it so in essence the opportunities for Enigma's protocol are endless. The beauty of Enigma is that is blockchain agnostic and can be used for to increase scalability of the blockchain.  One last thing I wanted to touch on is the confusion with Catalyst. Catalyst is a dApp created on the Enigma protocol and is not the project itself. It's a tool for Enigma investors to use to get their feet wet in the Enigma EcoSystem to understand the project better and it is not the end goal.  Again, I encourage all interested investors to join the social channels and read the whitepaper over again to further grasp the applications of this project.",False

Enigma is an off-chain peer-to-peer network that enables different parties to jointly store and run computations on data while keeping data completely private through the use of secret contracts. Connecting Aion with the Enigma secure multi party computation platform enables users and developers to process sensitive data, computation and storage from the Aion ecosystem in the off-chain Enigma network.  Through Aion’s powerful bridging protocol, which allows for transacting with multiple blockchains without involving a centralized integration mechanism, the overall accessible network of the Enigma platform will be securely enhanced. This would allow Enigma’s secret contracts — smart contracts that keep sensitive data encrypted at all times — to be available across the Aion network. https://blog.enigma.co/enigma-bringing-their-secret-contracts-to-every-blockchain-with-aion-partnership-2e96dee11a3b",False

I'll make it simple:  a) I didn't invest. I was going to b) What you're saying is nonsense because as I've already outlined if Enigma didn't pull that move of increasing their market cap by a whopping 50% on the day of the ICO you: 1) Would not be down on your investment today as the tokens would have cost 40cents each if I'm correct. Right now that 50% extra was taken from you for no reason and practically went to the pockets of the ENG team at your cost. & 2) People wouldn't have dumped and gotten out had they not pulled this move. Enigma ruined their reputation and pissed everyone off with their irresponsible actions. No one wants to invest in a project like this as you can tell and current people holding wanna get out (generally speaking). I'm saying the way the team acted, the decisions they made were as unprofessional as can be, a total slap in the face of early token holders. Enigma had a potentially great thing going and they royally screwed it with greed. It's business and if they acted like this in the beginning I don't see how they have the know how to properly execute in the long run. Their incompetence has been highlighted in more ways than one. If you like I can also elaborate why I certainly wouldn't trust the founder as he's displayed a lack of technical ability. Another member once mentioned the worst attributes in a team you're investing in is incompetence and greed. And honestly I have never seen any other team that excels in both those characteristics more. I'm not speaking out of my ass either. I'll gladly explain this further if you like. c) Clearly this has nothing to do with expecting a pump and dump or needing time. Enigma is down 30ish% directly because of their actions, nothing else.  I still think you'll probably make a profit. But it is going to take a lot more work and time now. If I was you I'd hold and see what happens in Q1 2018.  edit: typo",False

Since ENG is utility token the main purpose is:  Primary purpose: ENG is used to access data sources on the decentralized Enigma Catalyst Data Marketplace. Payment is on subscription level. Secondary purpose: ENG tokens are used for incentives to grow and ensure stability of the network. ENG tokens are used to create demand in the data marketplace: Reward tokens are provided to quants with winning strategies. This incentivizes more quants to come on the platform and consume data to refine their strategies and gain an edge.  I do not find this as a sufficient motivation for long term investment. Is there other mechanism for ENG token to gain value over time.  4)   Will some of the ENG Tokens collected via subscription be burned?  How the ENG Tokens collected via subscription is redistributed. 5)   Jurisdiction where entity holding ICO is incorporated and name of the entity.  I appreciate your clarification. I noticed that some of the seasoned crypto investors I am in touch opted out from ENG Token purchase I hope that clarifying the points above will help to the rest of us to make up our minds.,False

What does this mean?  - For each email address, we will look at the timestamp of your first submission to our whitelist. We will then use the most recent Slack and Telegram info you provided to verify your community account. - This means if you submitted your whitelist application multiple times, you do not need to worry. You will keep your priority from your first submission.  Why did we decide this?  From the beginning, Enigma has had two primary goals: building a strong, committed community and holding a broad, fair, healthy crowd sale. This is the fairest model we have been able to determine for rewarding our committed community while maintaining broad participation. We’ve used other successful token sales, such as 0x, as a model in determining how to handle our crowd sale and whitelist.  What next?  There is nothing you need to do at this time. Enigma will reach out this week (but NOT today) to individuals who have been whitelisted. These individuals will then be asked to reconfirm their interest and will be informed of their individual cap. We will announce across all channels when we have sent this communication. After whitelisted individuals confirm their interest, we may upgrade members of the waitlist to the whitelist.  Remember, you do not need to be whitelisted to participate in our crowd sale. After the whitelist participation window closes, the Enigma token sale will be open to all. There will still be ENG tokens available after the whitelist window.  Thanks for your patience, and please await more communications later this week.",False

I am writing to address the recent attack on Enigma and its community, as well as to share a few important announcements.  As many of you know, earlier this week, a well-coordinated phishing attack was launched against our community. This attack joins a long list of other similar attacks plaguing the crypto-community, which are often targeted at high-potential token sales and crypto projects. We have addressed the vulnerabilities that the attackers exposed and are taking other measures to ensure that our community is safe and our token sale is successful. While I and the entire Enigma team, our partners, and friends from the community are all still hard at work, I need to personally share my thoughts with our community.  First, these past days have been extraordinarily challenging for everyone — for the victims of the phishing attack, for Enigma, and for our community at large. In this time, Enigma is immensely grateful for the actions of our growing community. Within minutes after the attack started, and throughout the days following the incident, our community took the lead. Good people with nothing personally to gain stood guard against new attacks, worked to shut down new scam sites, educated the community, and helped us secure ourselves. Still today, dedicated members of our community are working with us around the clock, out of their own goodwill, in an attempt to trace the scammer. These efforts have already allowed us to successfully lock some of the stolen funds.  But regardless of everyone working together and doing their best to mitigate the effects of the attack, the perpetrator was still able to steal approximately $500k in funds from some members of our community. To us as a company that values community above all, and to me personally, there’s nothing worse than having people who join our ranks with the hope of supporting the next big wave of innovation, fall victim to a malicious act. All of us at Enigma have contributed to other projects at one point in time with the hope of helping them become the next big thing. Having that privilege, as well as the substantial funds, taken away is not something that anyone should suffer — especially those that put their trust in us.  So we are taking responsibility. We are deeply sorry for the pain experienced by those who lost funds to the scam attempt, and we want to make sure that no one in our community that was a victim to this well-coordinated phishing attack is financially hurt. We will restore funds to everyone that lost money in this recent scam attempt after our token sale concludes. We’ve already been in direct contact with some of the affected parties. If you lost funds and have not yet contacted us, please reach out to tokensale@enigma.co with information about yourself and your transactions. We will work with our community on a case by case basis.  This week has been an important lesson to us all. We’re actively working, both internally and with experienced partners, to ensure that the token sale is secure end-to-end. Our token sale system is being deployed by Element, our friends and partners in this journey, who have already ran several high-profile token sales successfully and securely. We’ve also put in place company-wide policies regarding data sharing and password management, along with other strict security measures. Also, to remove any doubt about information shared during our token sale, we plan to live-stream our token sale on September 11. We at Enigma stand behind our project fully, and this step should go a long way in connecting our digital identities with real world identities. This way, you can be sure the sale is proceeding as expected and double check all communications.  In addition to these stringent security mechanisms, Enigma and several leading partners in the space are collaborating with an investigation led by a special cyber-crime division. We’re taking every step we believe necessary to not just recover funds but protect all future token sales from similar malicious attacks.  Despite the attack, we are very fortunate that our community and supporters continue to stand behind the Enigma project and our token sale. As of yesterday, we have completed and closed our presale for accredited investors after reaching our $20M contribution cap. Our presale was significantly oversubscribed, and we have had to turn down additional interest in order to ensure the full participation of our community. Our attention has fully turned now to our crowdsale on September 11 as we strengthen our security and work to reopen our Slack channel.  For further updates from the Enigma team, please follow our Telegram announcement channel and our Twitter.  Thank you all again for the support you’ve shown us in these trying times. The pain that’s been caused is terrible, but I’m now more convinced than ever that with your help, we will continue to build a great project and community. Together we will create a powerful system that millions can benefit from. Let us explore new boundaries, and boldly go where no one has gone before.  Sincerely, Guy Zyskind Enigma Co-founder and CEO",False

The logic is, that investors funds have been given away as incents to potential investors, probably to us residents, what was not agreed before the initial coin (securities) offering. Before i invested, there was no information about any funds will be given away to potential investors or bailing out any loss of funds by potential investors.  Its not written or mentioned anywhere in the prospect, that funds collected from investors for marketing, development, legal, operations after the pre-sale, or before the sale of the coins (securities), nor after the sale of the coins (securities), after the phase of collecting funds from investors, will be used for compensating potential investors for lose of any funds during the pre-sale, sale. There is nowhere mentioned to return funds, potential investors may be losing because of tried participation on the sale of the coins.  If there would be mentioned that this coin sale will ensure refunding potential investors funds, who lost it in the process of the ICO, I would make other decision.

It is linked here:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BGWbfCesFr_WKNArxnf9P4X8prV9LF79D1le2ln7g4g/edit  Here is the text:   What is Enigma? What is Catalyst?  Enigma is building a decentralized, open, secure data marketplace that will change how data is shared, aggregated and monetized to maximize collaboration. Catalyst is our first product and the first application running on our Enigma protocol. Powered by our financial data marketplace, Catalyst empowers users to share and curate data and build profitable, data-driven investment strategies.  When is the Token Sale? How long will it be?  The Enigma token crowdsale begins on August 21, 2017 and runs through August 31, 2017.  What is the hard cap? What is the token price?  The hard cap is $30M. 50M ECAT tokens are being sold at a price of $0.60. There are 100M total ECAT tokens.  When is the Presale? How do I participate?  The presale is ongoing. Minimum buy-in is USD100K or equivalent in ETH. If you are a US citizen, you have to be an accredited investor otherwise you are fine if you can meet the minimum amount. We are giving 20% discount if you are willing to lock 50% of your tokens for 1 year or 10% discount if you want to get the tokens right away. The discount structure will change in time. We can take fiat or ETH. Please email can@enigma.co for more presale details and to participate.  Is there a minimum investment amount for the crowdsale? Are there discounts?  The minimum investment for the crowdsale is $60USD, or 100 ECAT. There will be no discount or bonus offered during the crowdsale.  When will ECAT come to market/exchanges? Do we have partnerships with exchanges yet?  We are already in conversation with some highly respected exchanges. We can’t disclose any details at this time, but rest assured we are doing everything in our power to get listed. It's in our best interest as well as the community's.  What is the difference between Enigma and Catalyst?  We further explain the relationship between Enigma (the company and data marketplace) and Catalyst (our product) in our recent blog post series. Read more here - https://blog.enigma.co/beyond-catalyst-enigmas-vision-for-the-future-of-data-22fbb5845556  Is Enigma VC funded? Are there people working on it full time?  Enigma has backing from major VCs including Floodgate, Flybridge, Digital Currency Group, and others. We have 5 full time employees. Our team and investors can be found on our homepage: www.enigma.co  Is the bounty program still running? How can I sign up? How do I know if I got accepted?  We have a social bounty program and a content creation bounty program active. If you’re interested in joining our social bounty and receiving ECAT, please read the instructions in the social bounty program thread - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2057194. If you’re interested in creating blog or video content for Enigma in exchange for ECAT, please contact tor@enigma.co with a description of the content you intend to create and details about your platforms and audience.  What are the Enigmarines? How can I join?  The Enigmarines are an elite group of social promoters that earn additional ECAT for spreading the word about our project and token sale. If you’re interested in joining, please message @tor on the Enigma Slack - slack.enigma.co.  Is your project open sourced?  You can view our code at www.github.com/enigmampc.  How is Enigma MPC affected by the SEC decleration?  According to the legal advice from our excellent lawyers, ECAT is a utility token and it does not constitute a security. We have complied and intend to comply with all guidance from regulatory bodies. For more information refer to our lawyer Marco Santoni’s tweets on utility tokens.  Is the token sale open to US investors? Is the Presale?  Yes.  Where can I get help setting up the Alpha?  You can get help from our team and from other traders and developers in the #dev channel on our Slack. If you’re not a member already, visit slack.enigma.co.  How do we get on the whitelist for the ICO/PreSale?  The whitelist guarantees access for the first hour of our crowdsale. It is only open for members of the Enigma community - those of you who participate in our Slack or Telegram groups.  Can we purchase a different amount than what we selected for the whitelist?  You are only guaranteed ECAT within the range you selected for the whitelist. If you need to change this range, please resubmit the whitelist form.  How do we connect with Enigma on social media?  Please follow us at @EnigmaMPC - www.twitter.com/enigmampc or on Medium.",False

Beyond Catalyst: Enigma's Vision for the Future of Data How Catalyst will help us build a next-generation data marketplace  Some people in our community have asked us how Catalyst — a platform that enables anyone to start their own crypto hedge fund — relates to our original Enigma vision of creating a safe and open data marketplace. It is important for us to clarify our direction for the community as we approach our token sale on August 21. We want you to be our allies and partners in achieving these goals for the future of data.  This is the first of a two part blog post explaining the connection between Catalyst and Enigma, as well as shedding some light on our grand vision. The second part will discuss our data marketplace protocol in more detail.  Data as Value  Over the past decade, data has become the most valuable digital asset. Some of the largest companies in existence base their core operations, not to mention revenue, on the consumption and analysis of massive data sets. Companies like Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters have built an empire of companies around data aggregation: the two companies have combined revenue of more than USD20 billion.  There are numerous very successful companies that are built on monetizing data their customers produce. In the financial realm, Yoddle and Plaid are great examples. Elsewhere there are location-data driven companies like Foursquare, not to mention tech giants Facebook and Google, which primarily collect and monetize data.  But, despite its significant role in our economy, data remains consolidated in the hands of a few large organizations. For anyone but those entities, it is not fungible or tradeable.  With the introduction of the Enigma whitepaper back in 2015 (at the time, a research project at MIT), we’ve set a single goal to break down data silos and enable data sharing. We believe that to achieve this goal, a single, open-source protocol for a decentralized data marketplace needs to exist, where data can be openly exchanged in return for incentives.  We are not alone in this belief — within a couple of months our whitepaper has been downloaded more than 100,000 times, earning it press coverage in esteemed news outlets. Further, we are fortunate to have some of the best VCs in the world supporting us in achieving this vision, including Floodgate (early investors in Lyft, Okta), Flybridge (early investors in MongoDB), Digital Currency Group and Pantera (top investors in the blockchain and cryptocurrencies space).  This is a lofty goal, one that will take years to fully materialize. But if done right, here is what we could achieve: * More open data will be available for research. * More people and organizations will reap the benefits of selling and controlling their data. * Data’s value would become explicit, as opposed to implicit (which is the case today). * Data sharing could be revolutionized in the same way Bitcoin has revolutionized payments.  Getting to the Future  At Enigma, we’ve spent a long time discussing how we can achieve our mission, both internally and with our community. It became clear to us that building a technology alone, while intellectually stimulating, is likely to fail. This is a recurrent theme we have seen in the crypto space — projects with impressive technology spend too little time thinking about building a useful product and getting mass adoption. This is risky, as token prices right now are driven mostly by speculation, instead of generating real value. Value is what is necessary for the crypto market to become self-sustainable.  Since technology in and by itself is not enough, we needed to come up with a product that people would love and use immediately — one that intrinsically requires a data marketplace to function. Historically, financial data is the most valuable data. Top hedge funds like Citadel, Two Sigma and Renaissance spend tens of millions of dollars every year on high-quality data. That’s partially why two mammoths in this space, Bloomberg and Thompson Reuters, have grown to such prominence. Furthermore, these funds employ primarily data scientists and create their edge through data and research. Our contributors and advisors have lived and flourished in this data-driven environment. While data- and research-driven quant trading has been the winning formula in traditional markets, such robust tools do not yet exist for the crypto market.  This is how we came up with Catalyst — a platform that gives quants all the tools and data they need to start their crypto hedge fund — which people can later invest in. Being a nascent field, crypto data today is not standardized. While most of it is open, it is scattered, hard to mine and very time consuming to obtain. This problem spans beyond quants and encompasses the entire ecosystem. For example, at MIT we had several ongoing research projects around usage of cryptocurrencies, which required many weeks of data collection. We often wondered why no easily accessible data-sets exist.  We have so far interviewed around 40 quants from top shops like Citadel and Two Sigma. More than 70% of people we spoke to are extremely interested in applying their quant trading know-how to crypto but just don’t have robust tools to do so. We have advisors who run their own active crypto-trading hedge fund. It took them six months to build a product that they felt comfortable using to drive the fund’s investment decisions. We believe this difficulty remains a significant barrier to entry. Tying together all these pieces, we are convinced we are focusing on a real and immediate use case.  We hope this also explains the reasoning behind our naming. Enigma was, and still is the name given to the decentralized data marketplace protocol. It is also the name of the company behind it. Catalyst is the first application to encourage adoption of a decentralized protocol that we hope would one day hold the long-tail of data on the web. As the name suggests, Catalyst is meant to speed up the adoption of this protocol.  Finally, ECAT (Enigma Catalyst tokens) is the protocol token that is linked to sharing and exchanging data. In the early days, ECAT would also be used to incentivize adoption, but longer-term the token would extend beyond the Catalyst application and would be used in all applications serving data in the decentralized data marketplace.  We hope this post was helpful in alleviating any confusion some may have had about how Catalyst interplays with our big vision — to build a data marketplace for the web. This is an ambitious mission, but with the support of our community, the guidance of our advisors and a stellar team — we’re confident we can achieve great things. In the next part, we’ll discuss the data marketplace in more technical details. Until then, we welcome everyone to join our Slack and Telegram and post any questions, comments, or discussions you may have.",False

It is a platform that empowers anyone to build their own crypto hedge fund and participate in the coming Renaissance of the financial ecosystem. Our vision is to enable developers to build winning investment strategies, a strong track record and attract investment from community investors. Catalyst is a playground where developers, quants, and experienced traders can easily build, simulate, and eventually live trade cryptocurrencies using sophisticated programmatic strategies. Regular investors can then invest directly in winning strategies through our system. With this, we’re hoping to make smart-investing in this new emerging asset class accessible to everyone.

Some of the largest companies in existence base their core operations, not to mention revenue, on the consumption and analysis of massive data sets.

WHO WE ARE  We are a team of MIT graduates, advised by professionals with decades of experience in the finance, technology, and trading industries.  TEAM                         The ENG Token - Catalyst's native token  We believe that to be successful, native tokens should have real utility — you should never create a token just because you can, and you should not invest in any token whose purpose you can’t understand. It is important to us and to our community that ENG serve a critical and transparent purpose for all stakeholders. Most generally, Catalyst tokens are used to reward creation by and for the community (e.g. trading strategies, data sources) and are consumed when community members access premium services on the platform.    Right now we are focusing on the following token dynamics:    Primary: ENG is used to access  data sources on the de-centralized Enigma Catalyst Data Marketplace. Payment is on subscription level.  Secondary: ENG tokens are used for incentives to grow and ensure stability of the network. ENG tokens are used to create demand in the data marketplace: Reward tokens are provided to quants with winning strategies. This incentivizes more quants to come on the platform and consume data to refine their strategies and gain an edge.   Please follow us on Twitter and join our Slack or Telegram to stay informed!
