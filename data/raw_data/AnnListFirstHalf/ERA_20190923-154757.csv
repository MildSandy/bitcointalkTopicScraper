Please read the above articles if you have not done so yet. We are confident Gift Cards will be more fungible than ATM's will ever be, just because of the 'Gifting' idea behind them.  As for your other remarks:  1. Token holders 'get' a portion in the form of burning 1% from the 6% fees. Together with an ever increasing demand and value, the token will also be used on our future platform to receive various advantages such as most exchanges are doing lately. We are open to discuss any other advantages for tokenholders with the community, all ideas are welcome, here or on any (social) platform you can find, so please share whatever comes to mind that might increase our goal of global cryptocurrency adoption! 2. We cannot disclose any countries before we are sure we can/will sell gift cards there. At this moment we are not reaching to individual stores since we have to be sure of some form of legal insurance in every country we will be selling gift cards. We will however enclose all needed information in every gift card sold to make sure every buyer or receiver of our gift cards will always comply to local regulations. 3. The cards are planned to reach the stores the same way as for example Google Play or iTunes cards, distribution will be discussed with the same companies responsible for distributing these existing cards.  In order for us to be able to roll out as fast as possible (and as secure as possible), we came up with the idea of performing an ICO to raise needed funds to be able to pay for this whole process. These funds will be spend as can be found on our white paper and/or website, but in essence it will be for starting legal conversations in countries world-wide (perhaps/probably based on country interest in our ICO), paying for at least a part of the development of our online platform: the exchange, the API connections needed, our mobile app , ... Also the initial production and distribution of our Gift Cards will be paid from these funds (slowly evolving to being self-sustainable thanks to the fee asked for every gift card).  We are always looking for ways to improve our future product so any form of advice, feedback, criticism,... is appreciated!  Please let us know if there is anything else unclear!",False

And given the (current) market fluctuations, we are confident this fee will be insignificant considering we estimate that more than 50% of the cards won't be redeemed within a month after purchase. We will of course constantly look into new coins to add to our platform and perhaps even add them as a separate gift cards, next to our current Bitcoin, Ethereum and Etcetera cards. Community input will be very important here.  As for taxation etc.:  we will look into every country separately, as Ief (@crynvestor) said, we can't disclose any information regarding this at this moment, but we will of course start with the countries most eager to accept and allow cryptocurrencies. Legal talks will go better in one country than the other, but we will update our community transparantly upon official (contractual and legal) agreements and we will of course follow world wide regulations closely. A quick google search will get you just as far, but here are some of the latest regulatory articles regarding cryptocurrencies we have been following: https://www.crypto-economy.net/the-ico-regulations-worldwide/?lang=en http://www.businessinsider.com/blockchain-cryptocurrency-regulations-us-global-2017-10?international=true&r=US&IR=T https://www.coindesk.com/2017-in-review-how-the-world-regulated-crypto/ https://news.blackmooncrypto.com/cryptocurrency-regulation-cross-country-analysis-67452f1df80e  As for the markets we're targeting: cryptocurrencies and ICO market combined with the gift card market. I guess the market for cryptocurrencies will not have to be explained here at BitcoinTalk, but as for the gift card market we have shared this article on our social media platforms not so long ago: http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/3352089/  Please let us know if you have any more questions!",False

I am Brasseur Pepijn and one of the founders of Etcetera.  After long discussion, we decided to let the burn process continue indefinately. This means that we will continue the 1% burn, regardless of the amount of tokens in circulation. The tokens will be minted whenever a contribution to the ICO is made, when the ICO ends, only the minted tokens will be in circulation, together with the tokens reserved by Etcetera for operational purposes, bounties and affiliates. Should this for example be only 10m tokens, the burn process will still be in place. We made this decision to give the participants added value to the token in the long term, regardless of the amount of success the ICO will bring. This together with the demand we will create through our offline card sales should bring a high value for the Etcetera token.  We do not have a KYC in place, and we are only prohibiting the US and China to participate in the tokensale, this is described in our terms & conditions.  Anyone can register on our website without a KYC process, and contribute to the ICO and they will receive their Etcetera tokens after their contibution.",False

I am Brasseur Pepijn, co-founder of Etcetera. I will give you all the answers you need! We will start with the remark about the softcap, this remark is partly true -> We failed to notice that it was not clearly mentioned on the website. But there is in fact a soft-cap in place equal to 900ETH - $1.000.000.  The reason for this is that this is the ABSOLUTE minimum amount we need to get started with distribution of Etcetera cards. Because we are a startup, we have no bank guarantees, especially not since we trade/broke cryptocurrencies, so every card sold will need to be backed by us. This in combination with the cost of development of the platform and legal aspects we calculated that $1.000.000 is the absolute minimum for us to get started.  Secondly, the KYC process. Every country has different rules surrounding KYC. We clearly stated that we will try to be operational in every country where regulations permit. This means for countries the following : most countries don't demand KYC as long as the amount of purchase is beneath a certain limit. This we will tackle by selling cards of different values in different regions, based on that countries specific regulations. We are aware of our position, and did the necessary research, but of course, USA is not yet within our reach. But we are 100% certain that there are multiple countries who or 1. have flexible regulations surrounding KYC, or 2. have no regulations in terms of cryptocurrencies. Both scenarios is a precursor for us that we can operate in those countries. Of course, we understand the doubt, being an American, where regulations are a lot stricter then Europe, Africa or some parts of Asia. But rest assured that we are one hundred procent certain that we can roll out in multiple countries. Our initial countries will probably be Belgium and the republic of Georgia, and depending on the success of the ICO we will add more countries to the list that we can handle/manage with that amount.  In terms of the ICO in the US, shoud regulations not permit us to sell bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, we will just sell the empty wallets together with a code that they can use on our website, just entering their personal details and they will receive the value of their purchase on the card. This way we will still reach the potential customers, even in the US, ONLY if this is our last resort.  Furthermore, you need to take into account that, because of those regulations, every MAXIMUM purchase amount will be limited per customer per sale, exactly to avoid/circumvent the KYC rules/restrictions.  Thirdly, we already made contact with distributors, who are in charge of payment systems to inspect and check if the infrastructure provided makes our project possible. And it is, in most countries. India for example is a difficult country to achieve this, but in Belgium to start with, it is perfectly possible. We are not in need of a ""partnership"", since we will be contracting them, not teaming up. Those discussions have been started, and we again are certain that we CAN distribute the cards through their channels, which actually are exactly the same as Itunes cards get distributed. Our initial distributor we talked to distributes those cards together with multiple others to their independent salespoints. The largest distributor in Belgium for example distributes those to over 5.000 salespoints.  Lastly, i can in all honesty tell you that our team is involved full time, and we did our research, but in the end, yes, until we get the funding, it is just a well formed and investigated idea. So i certainly welcome you to ask more questions or even contribute to our ICO!  You can contact me at pepijn@etcetera.ltd!",False

We will accomplish this by opening up the cryptocurrency market to the general public on a massive scale. We will make buying and using Bitcoin and Ethereum (and more later) as easy as buying a gift card in any store with any payment method. These cryptocurrency gift cards are meant to make Etcetera known worldwide, as these gift cards will be our 'kickstart' project; other ideas and cryptocurrency or blockchain sideprojects will be presented and worked out in due time in the future, but for this we want as much community input as possible when we get there.  The Catchphrase:  The time is now: Cryptocurrencies is everywhere, except in the pockets of the masses. The vast majority of people don't have access to cryptocurrency yet. They've heard about it, they want to be a part of it, but often have no idea how and where to get started, or lack the technical know-how.  Etcetera will bring cryptocurrency to the masses, through gift cards sold in stores, worldwide. Thanks to Etcetera, anyone can simply walk into their local store or supermarket, pick up an Etcetera card, pay the cashier, and walk away with Bitcoin or Ethereum in their pocket. It's that easy.  The Whitepapers:  Whitepaper (EN) Whitepaper (RU) Whitepaper (KA)  The Promotional video:   YouTube-link  The Platform:  The Cards: Physical, offline cryptocurrency wallets printed on a durable card, with the familiar look and feel of a giftcard. The card holds the public wallet address and QR-code, as well as the private keys (and QR) securely protected beneath a scratch-off layer. The Etcetera cards will be made available in stores worldwide. Every card comes with a card-sized booklet with easy, step-by-step instructions on how to download the Etcetera app and start using their newly acquired cryptocurrency. Initially, Etcetera will provide 3 types of wallets/cards. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and of course, Etcetera. Learn more    The API: The Etcetera API is the heart of the Etcetera Platform, connecting cash registers in stores worldwide with the Etcetera exchange. Our API interfaces with existing solutions already used in stores for selling and activating gift cards, cash cards, prepaid cards,... When a customer buys an Etcetera card in a local store, the cashier scans the card and the register will communicate with the Etcetera API. The Etcetera API will pass the sales information to the Etcetera Exchange and confirm the transaction within seconds after scanning the card. In background, the purchased cryptocurrency funds will be deposited to the scanned wallet. Learn more    The Exchange: The Etcetera exchange will handle and execute all offline transactions received via the API. It will automatically place the appropriate market orders, manage the Etcetera reserves, and finalize transactions by depositing the purchased cryptocurrency to the Etcetera card address. Online users can buy, sell and trade cryptocurrency on the Etcetera exchange, enjoying high liquidity levels driven by offline card sales in stores. Initially, the Etcetera exchange will be limited to the same three cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum and Etcetera. Of course, more cryptocurrencies/tokens may be added to the exchange later on. Learn more    The Mobile App: Etcetera will provide an exceedingly user-friendly mobile wallet app, allowing users to import their offline (card) wallet and start buying, selling and trading cryptocurrency straight from their phones. Users will also be able to buy cryptocurrency directly in-app using online payment methods or bank transfers, sell their cryptocurrency and receive fiat through bank transfer, exchange to other cryptocurrencies, send/receive cryptocurrency, make direct payments,... Learn more      The Etcetera ICO:  The Etcetera ICO starts on February 1st and will have a maximum of 5 different stages:  ICO starts with a 24 hour 'angel investor' period with a 40% bonus of purchased ERA tokens at 9AM GMT on February 1st.     Followed by a 7 days investing period with 15% bonus of purchased ERA tokens starting at 9AM GMT on February 2nd.     Followed by a 7 days investing period with 10% bonus of purchased ERA tokens starting at 9AM GMT on February 9th.     Followed by a 7 days investing period with 5% bonus of purchased ERA tokens starting at 9AM GMT on February 16th.     Followed by a last 20 days investing period with 0% bonus of purchased ERA tokens starting at 9AM GMT on February 24th and ending at 9AM March 15th.   Total investing period of 42 days!   Token Issuance:   The Etcetera ERC-20 tokens will be sold once during the ICO period and can be traded freely afterwards on any ERC-20 token accepting exchange. There will be a maximum of 30'000'000 Etcetera tokens of which 27'000'000 will be sold and all unsold tokens will be burned.  The other 3'000'000 are reserved for:  The Etcetera stakeholders: 500'000 tokens The Etcetera Team: 750'000 tokens (with a 6 months vesting period for 50% of these tokens and 12 months vesting period for the other 50%) Bounties: 750'000 tokens The Etcetera operational reserves: 1'000'000 tokens   Funds distribution:      Funds raised will be used to develop and deploy the Etcetera platform, make the Etcetera cards available worldwide, and fund the Etcetera cryptocurrency reserve. Our main costs will include, but not be limited to, legal support, marketing and development.  Because Etcetera aims to be active worldwide, and regulations around cryptocurrencies are not always clear or in favor of cryptocurrencies, 5% of the collected funds will be reserved for legal support. For marketing a projected 20% will be reserved, considering that Etcetera's initial success will rely on the amount of influx received through the sales of our cards. Etcetera aims at deploying television commercials worldwide, as well as targeted marketing campaigns and high visibility of our cards in stores across the world. For development of the Etcetera platform and production and distribution of the Etcetera cards, a projected 25% will be reserved to develop a stable and secure platform upon deployment (the Etcetera exchange, mobile application and API), establishing a secure production process of the Etcetera cards, contracting distribution channels, and so on. To establish the Etcetera cryptocurrency reserves of Bitcoin, Ethereum and fiat currencies; 45% of the funds will be allocated to these reserves. They will be used to ensure fast, reliable and secure deposits through the Etcetera API and the Etcetera platform as a whole. A projected 5% will be allocated to a research department which will focus on developing new Etcetera products, like the Etcetera cryptocurrency debit card and others, but for this we will ask community input for what they would like best.

Who am I? I'm part of the official Etcetera Team as developer and researcher. I will also take some marketing for my account as this will be the most important aspect up untill a successfull ICO. I've been a cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiast and fanatic since I first heard of it a bit over 4 years ago. It actually took me a few months to get acquainted enough to how bitcoin and its blockchain actually works before I was sending bitcoin transactions all over the place (bear in mind that these transactions didn't cost nearly as much as they do now). After Bitcoin, I started to get to know Ethereum and soon after my portfolio would be more diversified than I could actually remember.  The start of Etcetera So when late last year I got the opportunity to join this project I was instantly sold on the 'fairly easy' idea of selling cryptocurrency gift cards. After all, what gift is easier than a gift card? Add some cryptocurrency and we have the next big thing right? Well, not quiet yet... Most of you are by now probably already thinking about the legal issues that will come along, or perhaps about how secure this system can be, given that we're constantly working with 'hot' wallets: wallets connected to the Internet... So a long brainstorm session short; in order for this project to roll out globally and as fast and efficiently as possible, we need to use already existing services, contact and hire specialised legal support and find some software security experts and/or ethical hackers to (stress-)test our infrastructure before releasing them. Add to that the initial purchase and design of all gift cards that will be distributed initially, aswell as having the actual (crypto-)funds at the moment someone buys a gift card; we quickly came to realize that this will not be possible without a crowdfunding to pay for these initial costs. And what better time can there be to find investors for just such an idea! Our head developer is almost ready with the smartcontract that will take care of the whole ICO and token distribution (including team (+vesting periods), stakeholders and bounty tokens). Once tested and found fully functional on the local network, we will test it on a to be determined testnet and if possible, we will announce this fairly up front in order for anyone to be part of it should they so desire!  What's happening now? - At this moment we're spreading the word of our Etcetera project at all possible channels possible, we are putting together a bounty campaign for which 750'000 tokens are set aside. We're talking to various marketing teams about several marketing campaigns in order to be able to reach as much people as possible and hopefully convince them of the initial easy 'idea' of having cryptocurrency gift cards to get your friends and family involved in the emerging crypto-industry. This bounty campaign will start on January 15th and last untill the very end of our ICO. More details will follow in the relevant thread. (Can't wait to spread the word? Please have a look at https://etcetera.ltd/b/) - The smart contract is close to be ready, we will be testing it in the following days and as mentioned above. The smart contract is build with the openzeppelin framework.  The future (of Etcetera) Our future main customers (or atleast the people buyin our gift cards in store, or the persons receiving the gift card), will probably have not (the slightest) back-ground in trading and using cryptocurrency. This is why we will provide an easy-to-grasp booklet with every gift card sold, aswell as show and actually 'teach' the whole process of blockchain technology in order for our future buyers and investors to actually understand what the power of blockchain may, can and problably will eventually have. But lots of things are happening daily in cryptospace and for the average person, it is just too much of a hassle to keep up-to-date with everything happening with every coin. Aside from providing an easier way to get involved in the money of the future, we will provide various crypto-tools to keep its users up-to-date at the times that they have time to get up-to-date. Of course community input is here of uttermost importance, which is why we will provide our investors and users of our token and or platform, with the possibility of voting for the next (crypto-related) tool that would be nice and handy to have at our future All-In-One cryptocurrency platform.  We have put up 4 unique selling points in favor of our product: - Our effective selling points (our Points-of-Sale) will be the first to sell gift cards to which cryptocurrency will be send, upon payment at the register! - Our offline buyers of gift cards can choose any top-currency (bitcoin and ethereum at first, more later) or our own ERA-token to buy in any local store, with any payment the store accepts - The combination of our future API, exchange en mobile wallet will be the entry point for millions of new crypto-currency buyers and holders! - Because we will constantly follow and choose what top-currencies to add (or in the future perhaps delete) from our platform, we will also profit from the fact that we're providing these top-currencies.  But...  This project will never succeed without you, the initial cryptocurrency and blockchain investors. Do you want the people of next year to have even easier access to cryptocurrencies? Just by giving the gift of cryptocurrency will inherently give the receiver enough incentive to learn what exactly cryptocurrencies are and teach himself the way of the blockchain, and isn't that knowledge exactly the knowledge you want to share with your relatives and acquaintances?  Enter Etcetera, the intermediairy coin between fiat and crypto of the future!",False

I really like the idea of this project.  The only two items that are keeping me back from being a day 1 investor (as opposed to post-ICO) are the token utility and the 6% fiat conversion rate.  If I purchased 1,000 tokens, I do not see what that would get me or why I need Etcetera tokens.  I was thinking about this the other night, and if 5.5% of the rate went to Etcetera and 0.5% went to token holders (staked or not), that would alleviate both of those concerns, and make the Etcetera token one of the most desirable on the market.  I do like that part of the tokens are burned and that its not a large supply.  Really looking forward to this project and hope it is smooth sailing for each of you!",False

This will certainly make it easier for the general public to get into this space.  I'm a bit worried about the 6% fee, however.  I think this may break adoption as it is much higher than other entry points into the market.  I understand the convenience and familiarity aspect of buying a ""gift card"" containing BTC and other currencies, but what's stopping any other big exchange from offering the same product at a lower rate?  Coinbase for instance charges 4% for credit card payments and have already established an exchange.  They would also not require an intermediate coin for the transaction.  What do you think?",False
