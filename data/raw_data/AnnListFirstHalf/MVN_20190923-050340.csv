It is important to understand that in fiat terms you keep the exact same amount as you had before.  1 ETH was 30'000 MVN tokens (without bonus) at pre-ICO. This was changed to 1 ETH = 100 MVN tokens, so 1 MVN is now worth much more compared to the pre-ICO rates. But as said, the net amount in fiat was kept.",True

Mavin has proven to be the most productive technology for investors and a heaven for brands and nano-influencers.

Mr. Drake’s investments currently have 50+ global directors that maintain relations with institutions & family offices with $1.5 trillion in assets.  Mr. Drake is seen as a leader in cryptocurrency and in evaluating ICO’s. Mr. Drake saw the value of digital assets when everyone was avoiding it. It all started in 2011 when Mr. Drake collaborated on the JOBS Act to create new laws underlying all fundraising in the U.S. for all ICOs. His crypto hedge funds hold crypto, ICOs, and fintech equity as seed investments to help new coins to be made via ICOs.

There are now also full time MCO staff employed to manage their public channels to assist and answer questions.  You need to go to the main https://mona.co webpage to check out the basic MONACO CARD product and what it offers (Even at face value the interbank exchange rates blows away the competition, this is a US $500 Billion market).   You can see ""VISA"" on the cards and even more than that they are a ""VISA PROGAM MANAGER"", this gives them more ability to work productively with their customers, manage their product with benefits.  Due to this there is a big difference with other crypto cards that state that they too have Visa but are not project managers and as such do not have the same ability as Monaco to be responsive to their clients.  Currently they have their debit cards approved but next year they have stated they will be moving onto credit cards as well.  To join Slack you go to the contact section at the bottom and email contact@mona.co if you want to join.  For other updates, aside from Telegram, Reddit you can also subscribe to Monaco Twitter or the twitter accounts of either Kris Marszalek or Bobby Bao.  There are some recent updates to video's on the Monaco card youtube channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOMprzxakZOqmY23LYIawmg where you can see recent video's to the new card packaging that will be sent out with the cards.   Also there are historical video's that address a lot of the FUD and incorrect rumours that were being pushed out at ICO time and earlier on in the year.  Currently MONACO have BTC, ETH and MCO as supported coins but this will grow, they also have 7 fiat currencies for perfect interbank exchange rates but this should grow to about 23 and possibly more into the future.   There is no fee to get a basic blue card (FREE).  If you want the greater benefits the platinum cards bring then you need to buy the required MCO tokens, allow them to be held for 6 months (sort of escrow) and then you own the card outright.  At the end of the 6 month period you get your MCO back.  You can sell the MCO after than for BTC or fiat if you want, no ongoing yearly fee's, no other commitments or costs for having the card !  At present they are in a very good place and still moving forward.  First cards etc going out soon to Singapore, then Australia, other parts of Asia, then Europe, then USA next year.   A new video on the marking of the Monaco App will be coming out early December, more than 3 new exchanges listing Monaco in December, new product features, reviewed new iteration of the asset contract and lots more.  Unlike many competitors MONACO have taken their time to set in place the best foundations for success over the past year or so.  Aside from the Team having been business professionals prior as well as having ex Visa and ex MasterCard executives employed they have liaised with the top contenders in their respective fields to assist in preparing the groundwork for their exceptional product.  Some of their partners include;  GEMALTO - Great cards (Premium metallic design) -  https://www.gemalto.com  WIRECARD - Payments processing - https://www.wirecard.com  METALABS - App development - http://metalab.co  HOFFMAN AGENCY - Marketing (Proper) which will occur soon with a dedicated MCO team ready - https://www.hoffman.com  Like a coiled spring MONACO currently has 27,543 persons registered on their ""onboarding app"" from basically word of mouth alone, without real marketing having been commenced yet.  Monaco management have stated that they are not interested in short term token prices and are intent on building a long term sustainable business with massive growth potential.  They have publicly stated that they view their competition as being banks like HSBC, JP Morgan, not crypto cards like TenX, Tokencard etc.  Why have they been able to place themselves in this position to succeed?  A lot has to do with a very different approach they have token from the outset which was not to rush to market with products but to take their time with due consideration given to the current international responses we are seeing with ICO's, regulation and classing of various tokens as securities.  From their mantra of ""Compliance, Compliance, Compliance"" MONACO'S prudent approach is set to pay dividends with no impediments in any of the impending regions they intend to market to.  Stay tuned.",True

This has led us to rethink our fundraising approach before officially starting our public ICO.   The path we started in July 2017 with the ICO is not working anymore, the costs of marketing spends for ICO’s exploded in the last 2 month and are absolutely crazy at the moment.   We planned with a marketing multiplier of at least 10-15x return for every dollar spent, but after the first weeks of the campaign we saw, that the market has changed and our factor would have been significantly lower we decided to stop our efforts. With our marketing budget of USD 200’000 we risked not reaching the minimum goal of ETH 3000.   Thanks to an angel investor we are still able to develop the Mavin Platform and can follow our roadmap as planned, nevertheless we still are continuing our fundraising to bring mavin to the full potential it deserves.  The new fundraising which will be launched in January 2018 will be based on a multi-tier affiliate program with interesting commissions in MVN tokens and ETH, which will help us to reward real influencers for their marketing efforts for Mavin and reduce the amount of marketing in the totally overpaid crypto market world.   The fundraising and affiliate program will be open until the launch of the Mavin platform in Q3 2018. This way we can launch the app and have the token distribution event at the same time allowing a strong demand of the token from the Mavin platform participants from the very first day of issuance and avoiding speculation on secondary markets (e.g. exchanges).   We are going to limit the initial bonus tokens to 10% only, so every early investor like you will keep the current bonus level if you decide not to withdraw your funds.   We would be happy if you keep backing us but if you wish to be refunded, we will honor your request*.   Please stay tuned to get more information about the new evolutions and developments of Mavin.   Best Regards,   Team Mavin Everybody is an influencer!  * Refund: Send an email to ico@mavin.network using the same registered email used in the login and the destination wallet address for the withdrawal request.",True

Explanation of the rewards for verifiers:  Every user of the app can be both influencer and verifier and to be honest to be verifier is much easier :-) You don't have to have any friends (hopefully not) and just a little bit spare time.  You can just open anytime our app and check if there are verifications pending. For each verification you will be rewarded with MVN Tokens, so it's a very interesting way to make some money. Since a verificator has no verification limits per day (an influencer has) there is quite a lot to gain from this kind of job.  This is a 100% crowdsourced project, influencers and verifiers are normal people. And the more we have of them the more brands we can attract.  This is quite revolutionary IMHO.",True

These points can be generic or category specific.  An influencer can use them to invest them into specific skills to improve his sharpness or in so called challenge campaigns these points can be used to pay the entrance fee.  Since we are thinking globally there is a big problem of reward and pricing because an influencer in switzerland has other expectations than an influencer in india. With MVN this is not a problem because the brand will pay whats correct for his country, but the points are globally the same amount.  Since there is also the option to convert some these points in MVN token we will then use the big mac purchase power parity index to calculate the rate of conversion.  An influencer can decide if he wants to convert them or to collect them to improve his skills and also participate on certain high value campaigns.",True

If you have 100 friends on instagram, its ok for us, you have 1000 it's ok, you have 10000 it's ok, more it's ok We want that everybody can participate and make money with social media and the good thing is: we prefer people with lower number of friends because the engagement rate is higher.  For example:  1000 Influencers using our app and posting the same campaign, each of them has only 200 friends that means a reach of 200'000 persons. With an engagement rate of about 50% you have targeted 100'000 Users for the sponsoring company  If you where just a big influencer with 200'000 Followers you have only an engament rate of 5%, that means you reached only 20'000 Users.  You see thats the big difference, between a scalable influencer network based on blockchain and others.",True
