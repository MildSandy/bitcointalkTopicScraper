Recommended MEW and Ledger wallet.  Quote from: Münzpräger on January 01, 2019, 10:42:40 AM    what airdrop are you referring to? there has been no mentioning of an airdrop from the OP if Im not mistaken.   We are distributing NIOX tokens to NIO holders at 1:2 ratio over a period of 1 year. It works as hold  to for airdrop model. To receive airdropped NIOX tokens, existing NIO holders will be required to lock their holdings for a continuous time period of 338 days, with rewards issued at given milestones, after periods of: 23, 45, 90 and 180 days. NIOX airdrop amounts will increase exponentially over time; meaning that for the first 23 days, users will receive 5 NIOX for each 100 NIO, which will then scale to 10 NIOX and so forth. After nearly one year of lock-up, existing NIO holders can expect to receive 50 NIOX for each 100 NIO locked.    The airdrop process will be enacted through a token holder snapshot taken by the NIO team, which will gauge which addresses receive NIOX tokens. In the event NIO is moved from a snapshot address, that address will lose the benefit of receiving further NIOX. Locked NIOX tokens will be airdropped to the original NIO holders upon completion of the NIO lockup phase. This ensures users have the ability to choose what happens with their own tokens, and retain control over them at all times.  We are expecting snapshot of  NIO for NIOX airdrop will be held  this month,We will inform you all exact date of snapshot well before it.",False

As our beloved community already knows, Autonio is undergoing a significant number of (important) changes in every aspect of our mission. Several community members have been inquiring about changes in our advisors, management, partnerships and future plans. We responded by presenting some of our team members and partners in a series of AMAs on Reddit, with two being left for the weekend (advisors & management). To the extent that any ambiguity still persists, I am presenting the collective decision of Autonio stakeholders, hoping that this announcement leaves no room for any speculation.  First and foremost, complete list of current partnerships can be seen on last week’s reddit post (https://www.reddit.com/r/Autonio/comments/8a3pho/meet_our_team_day_4_ama/). We are proud to have partnered with 300Traders, CryptoBridge, AlgoShare and CryptalDash. These are, for the time being, our only partners.  Secondly, we will very soon introduce our new advisors. We have the chance to welcome on board seasoned professionals with great experience in the blockchain industry, who will undoubtedly help us achieve our goals and keep us striving for excellence. As many of our community members know, prior Autonio partners consisted of ICO Crowd, NewsBTC and Embermine. NewsBTC partnership is being renegotiated, and we’re happy to say that we will be retaining them as our media partner. With specific regards to Embermine: while we are grateful for the support they provided, and I personally had and still continue to have wonderful relationship with many of their team members, Autonio as a business has to end the official association with Embermine. Autonio believes this is in the best interest of it’s investors and users. To come clear on some misunderstandings often brought up in the telegram group chat:- Autonio is not involved in any of Embermine airdrops. They were neither initiated by us nor under our control at any point of time. Any exchange listing mentioned by Embermine is also beyond our control. Please note that Autonio has not initiated any talks with the any Korean exchanges to list NIO.  We deeply appreciate your continuous support. Our team is working extremely hard to bring you the best. We will be providing many exciting news during this month. Stay tuned.  https://medium.com/@AI_Autonio/partners-exchanges-airdrop-2aa545c0339e",False

Two AI have been almost done coding.  1. People interest, Google search volume AI  2. Social media sentiment analysis AI    1. People interest, Google search volume AI:  Our Autonio AI will traverse the internet and google search volume to see if the particular crypto/ keyword is in high demand or not. If it talked about much by people AI will come back with a suggestion to buy and Autonio app will place the buy order, if there is less interest among people our AI will tell us to sell the holding. You can assign separate weightage for AI to make decision of buying and selling(from 0 to 100) 0 being less interest and 100 being people are very interested. AI will be listening to the general landscape of the crypto/keyword and make decision after our input. This is the first component of AI and Machine learning we are about to complete development and doing testing.   2. Social media sentiment analysis AI:  Our Autonio AI will  go through the live social media feeds to gauge the interest of people and return three results. Positive, negative and neutral sentiment. Based on which the buy and sell signals will be generated. AI will check social media feed for the crypto every 20 minutes once and return with the sentiment Positive, negative and neutral sentiment. This duration can also be changed so the AI gives signal based on that interval.  The above two are part of hidden markov model where all of these hidden states contribute to predictive nature of things unfolding and price prediction through real time AI. After this we will develop many first ever Machine learning AI components for crypto trading.",False

Lots of major things to look forward to!  I've been completely swamped with managing examinations and so haven't been active with communication, posts and updates which should change in two weeks time. Until then here's a short update:  Blockchained AI will be a major area of focus for me especially considering I've worked extensively on it before and mainly because that's what NIO was envisioned to be if you followed us during the ICO phase.  We will be working with ESLCoin to provide our AI services that will lay the foundation to grow from, as we believe in getting as much as we can done in whatever resources available. This adds another utility to NIO and everytime our AI services are used part of the fee may be burnt as an incentive to NIO holders. We haven't worked out the breakdown and details of that yet but we will get to it, the main thing to note is that it will be aimed to add more value to Nio. (more information on ESLCoin, led by the Amazing Andrew) We're negotiating with more companies and projects (quite popular and old) who are interested in using our AI services, once finalized we will announce them.  Chinese and Korean versions of the app, relevant documents and community support are being worked on. More information on the specifics will obviously release but at a later time.  I have talked about our affiliation and partnership with AlgoShare before in Joint Venture called Prosperism. It has been taking shape and is gaining major influential support, it's a major socio-economic initiative with a potentially heavy impact. There's a lot of information regarding it on Medium that interested folks can see, as things develop and something major happens you guys will know.  I will be attending at least one blockchain event this month I've been invited to which means we may have some significant partnerships working out, but it all depends on what's best for Autonio. I'd like to point out again how our only incentive are infact the team tokens which will be accessible only after 5 months and hence our only benefit is in the growth of the token itself. We're invested our heart, soul and time into this and we will continue to do so. We are very close to getting listed into an exchange associated with a major blockchain giant, no information can be revealed on this matter and no promises can be made as exchange negotiations and deals are very sensitive and prone to changing. In a matter of few weeks at least a few more exchange options should be available based on my communication so far, stick around to find out what happens, I'm sure it'll be worth the patience.  Core team is focussed on bugs and fixes and making the platform more robust apart from planning out the exchange which should be a big deal considering the features we will be incorporating into it.  There will be an Airdrop for NIO holders to mark the collaboration with a project very soon. Probably in the next 48 hours I'll share more details about the airdrop and briefly about the project.  I feel like I'm forgetting a few things I wanted to mention, but anyway, for now just know, there's a LOT going on and I haven't even talked about how James, Embermine and us have in store for everyone.

He has quickly become an indispensable fixture at the company. But as all of you have learned, he has also devoted himself to NIO, at first as part of his duties with Embermine, and then because of his sincerely loyalty and belief in the NIO platform.  I am a escrow key holder for NIO, I am one of the single largest holders of NIO, of which I will not have access to for five more months. I am also the CEO of Embermine, and despite at one time holding all 50 million Embers, I gave/sold/traded away all 50 million MBRS and nearly all of the 100 million each of TOV, IDEA, and SLIP, 200 million KNOW, and 5 Billion DOM tokens. I did this because I know where the power stands in Decentralized networks.  I received 5 million NIO and promptly gave them all to MBRS holders. I have 3.8 million NIO that will likely be worth millions, but my intention is to give away as many of those as I can, selling only what is absolutely necessary to build the systems that both Autonio and Embermine need to create the systems our collective networks need.  The only exception are this: I am donating 500k NIO of my 3.8 Million to pay for the first 1,000 subscriptions on the day of release. As the tokens are not in circulation, we are working out a way for this to be guaranteed and have them burnt upon release, resolving the debt for the subscriptions. Why? Because the world needs and deserves this tech. At least the first 1,000 uniques will get it free.  The other exception is that I will give 100k to each of the team members of Embermine, with exception of Justin, whose tireless dedication to this group has been a big part of its success. To him  I will award 250,000 NIO. Finally, Embermine will be sponsoring the NIO Championships in the near future and will offer 1,000,000 NIO to the purse pool. My intention is to make it so that competition will take place on the Embermine Marketplace this coming year, likely in the Fall of 2018.  That leaves about 1,150,000 NIO of which will be spent to pay for development costs for the Marketplace and other NIO/Embermine development.  The power in crypto-networks is always in the hands of the composite or individuals who make up its membership. We all, individually have our own independent goals and needs, but collectively, we all want this to succeed. No one before this moment, knew that I was going to say this, but I hereby now pledge that is exactly where the 3.8 million I will earn will go. And I will publish all transfers out that 3.8 million publicly when they do occur, so the community knows they are not being dumped haphazardly.  Ali and his staff have done some amazing things already, but this is only the beginning of their great work. This community is amazing, but it is so, because we CHOOSE to be so. It is a deliberate course of both action and purpose we all choose to make. As long as we continue to do so, we may have our ups and downs, but we will always move forward.  Thank you to everyone for their support of this project, and those who work so valiantly night and day to make it so.",False

The problem I see is that it is currently only really an option for users with sound technical skills, not for the amateur/hobby trader. There are however plenty of amateur traders out there, so targeting that market makes a lot of economical sense. Creating a platform that offers something to both technical and non technical users is a smart choice, so I would love to give it a go myself. I imagine the final product to work a bit like 1broker, where I can see which traders have the best strategy, and then pay some NIO so I can apply their strategy myself.

The problem I see is that it is currently only really an option for users with sound technical skills, not for the amateur/hobby trader. There are however plenty of amateur traders out there, so targeting that market makes a lot of economical sense. Creating a platform that offers something to both technical and non technical users is a smart choice, so I would love to give it a go myself. I imagine the final product to work a bit like 1broker, where I can see which traders have the best strategy, and then pay some NIO so I can apply their strategy myself.  Cheers, Tony",False
