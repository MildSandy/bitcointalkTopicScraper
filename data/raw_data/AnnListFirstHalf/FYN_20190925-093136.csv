FundYourselfNow has decided to completely revamp its token model, which was initially created in early 2017 before the token sale. A lot of things has been changed since then, and now we are glad to announce exciting news for all our token holders!  Currently, we have around 7% of FYN tokens in circulation (850k out of 12.5M). Over the last 3 months, we have been collecting feedback from our community, Business Partners and Advisors on how to make our token more exciting.      We are glad to announce the FYN Staking Program (2M Tokens allocated, ~ 8M USD value)  By staking FYN tokens and holding FYN tokens in your Ethereum wallet (registered in your FYN profile), you will be getting FYN tokens sent to your wallets every quarter. The staking programme will be conducted at the end of every quarter till 2019, lasting a period of 2 years.  The staking schedule and cumulative rewards is as follows:    Based on the table above, for each FYN you hold till Q4 2019, you can expect to get up to 2 FYN tokens back.  Note that there is a special bonus for true FYN holders. If you have not transferred out any FYN tokens for 2 years, you can expect a large stake reward. At the end of Q4 2019, we will distribute the remaining tokens to all participants that have held FYN for more than 2 years. For example, if there is 500k tokens (out of the 2M allocated) remaining in the staking pool, these 500k will be distributed in proportion to all stake holders that have not transferred FYN out.  To be eligible for the Staking program, you must:      1. Sign up on www.fundyourselfnow.com and put in your Ethereum address in your profile.      2. Join FYN telegram group at t.me/fundyourselfnow.com.      3. Have at least 10 FYN tokens in your wallet during the last week of every quarter.  Do note that the percentages are subject to change depending on the success of the program.      In addition to FYN Staking Program, we are also introducing the below programs to let FYN token holders earn more tokens for supporting FundYourselfNow in any aspect!    FYN Marketing Program (1M Tokens, 4M USD)  We are setting up a FYN Marketing pool to reward supporters of FYN and boost visibility of FYN. Some of the ways in which these tokens can be used are given below:  a) We are planning to perform FYN token airdrop to every Etheruem wallet that holds more than 1 Ether. This is similar to what OMG did successfully for their token.  b) Tokens will be used to reward community for participating in FYN competitions & offline events, and reward our community champions who write articles and create videos for us.  c) Collaborations with exchanges, where tokens could be used as a prize for trading competitions on the exchange itself, e.g. what Monaco did with Binance.  d) Reward Reviewers who write top quality reviews/comments for projects on our platforms.  Besides this, we are making changes to our FYN community marketing program. For listing, we will require all the projects to give us a small % of the tokens. These tokens will be airdropped to all FYN community users who performed a simple action to support them, for example joining their telegram group. The process will be much faster and easier.    FYN Liquidity Pool (1M Tokens, ~ 4M USD)  The liquidity pool is for us to facilitate bulk purchases of FYN by projects. Beginning Q1 2018, we are expecting projects to start taking FYN in their token sale. We want to make this process as easy as possible. Note that the funds received (Ethers) will be used to purchase FYN back in the open market on the behalf of the projects.  New Era Energy is the first project that will take FYN in significant amounts.    FYN Employee & Advisor Pool(1M tokens, ~4M USD)  Employees and Advisors can choose to purchase FYN and get a 30% bonus tokens, subject to a cap based on their salary & contributions to FYN. Bonus tokens given are subject to a vesting period of 6 months. We want every employee and advisors to have a stake in the growth in our company. This token pool will also be used to attract strategic partners to come on board FYN.    Company Reserve Pool (6.65M Tokens)  The reserve pool will be used for:      Second Fundraising Round at end 2018 if required     Future company initiatives     Founders Tokens  We really hope that the above Staking Program will prove beneficial to all our token holders. We have always tried our best to serve you guys better. There is one more program coming out next week for FYN Members — FYN Starter Program. We will be announcing the details soon!  If you have any questions, shoot them in our Telegram group.  Stay tuned & enjoy the AIRDROPS!",False

With the astronomical rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, there seems to be an influx of people into the market. Many cryptocurrency exchanges cannot even afford to have their account creation feature open all the time. Such is the demand for entry into the market that trading account creation for new customers is periodically disabled. The average daily trading volume of the market is usually in trillions of dollars. The total market cap of the entire market stands at more than half a trillion dollars which is an astonishing feat considering the market is less than a decade old.  However, despite all of these large numbers, there are a number of major problems that plague the market. To use these numbers solely as an appraisal index of the state of the market would present a false narrative. There are structural and functional issues that affect the market. These problems stem from a variety of reasons such as the infant nature of the market, lack of understanding of the cryptocurrency space, and some peculiar economics of cryptocurrencies (“tokenomics”) just to name a few.  The following are some of the major problems in the cryptocurrency market.  https://hackernoon.com/major-problems-in-the-cryptocurrency-market-c9c9ff53b266",False

If you’re under the age of 60, chances are you have been exposed to digital dating adverts in some form or another. Online dating has pretty much taken over traditional personal ads, and evolved from “site only” communication to every form of social media available to the masses.  Mankind has looked for contact and companionship from the very beginning, the need to establish an individual voice or identity and stand out, is stronger than ever. What’s more, our constant need to reach out to others lead the way in creating tools we couldn’t do without today e.g. the telephone.  That being said, dating and courtship have pretty much stayed in its complex little niche. After all, trying to figure out a few billion individual preferences and matchmake is no easy task.

It is easy to use, clean and unique in nature. Here is our guide to help you trade on GEMINI.  Gemini is a cryptocurrency exchange platform where investors can buy Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) using US dollars – or just trade between BTC and ETH. It’s a robust tool for more advanced traders, but it’s also has clean, easy-to-use interface that even a total beginner can quickly get the hang of.  This crypto-coin exchange is probably best known for its infamous founders, the Winklevoss twins, who sued Mark Zuckerberg for stealing the idea of Facebook from them in 2008. Their $65 million windfall from that lawsuit was certainly put to some good use – the brothers had accumulated $11 million worth of bitcoin by 2013, when it was worth about $120.00.  Their bitcoin stockpile has skyrocketed since then, with the digital currency’s value now several thousand percent higher than it was back then. In fact, the twins are said to have become the first “bitcoin billionaires” in December of 2017 around the time bitcoin surpassed the $11,000 mark.

This new web architecture was based on user-generated content that would replace the then static nature of the Worldwide Web. It is important to note that her description of the framework differs significantly to what obtains today. The fact though is that Social Media came to be known as the advancement of web technology, in other words, Web 2.0. There are strong indications that Cryptocurrency may soon become the new Social Media.  When the internet first emerged, it was the pinnacle of distributed computing. It forever changed the face of information technology. Data could be transferred from and to multiple network nodes at breath-taking speed. At some point in the evolution of the web, the idea of user-generated content was developed and Web 2.0 was born. Within the framework of the Web2.0 architecture is Social Media with its many popular platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Google among others. These platforms have changed the way we share information and communicate with one another.  In the few years since the emergence of Social Media, the digital phenomenon has attracted praise and criticism in almost equal amount. Social Media critics point to the many flaws in the system which undermine the fidelity of the information that is being shared. These issues have even been brought to the forefront in the wake of the alleged manipulation of the 2016 general elections in the United States.  https://hackernoon.com/cryptocurrency-may-become-social-media-2-0-64f933ab0140",False

Today, i would like to share with you the progress we made since our last monthly report and outline the plans for the month of January  Marketing  As mentioned in Dec updates, one of the key areas were focusing on is content generation. For the month of Dec, we were writing one article under the FYN account everyday. Currently we are a contributing writer to the top 3 crypto/tech publication on Medium (The Mission, Hackernoon & Good Audience). Over the last month itself, we crossed 100,000 views on medium for the articles we wrote, and we garnered about 1463 fans organically. Show your support by following us on medium if you have not yet.  One of the article i personally wrote gathered over 10k views on medium and got featured on Zero Hedge, a leading financial news website, with over 100k views. We also got featured again on the front page of Business Times Singapore. We are working hard to establish ourselves as a thought leader in the crypto-currency space.  By end of this month, we are launching a new channel called Blockchain Hunt, where we will hunt and review the latest Decentralized App (Dapps). If 2017 was the year of ICOs, 2018 will be the year Dapps. There is an incredible number of products launching in 2018 and having this channel will align well to our vision at FYN, which is to make Great Ideas Happen. We will be able to feature FYN projects and get them the visiblity they need through these channels.  Our first three reviews will be covering Kyber Network, Digix & Tron and we will be working with an popular cryptocurrency youtuber to launch this channel.  By end of Mar, we hope to be able to hit monthly views of at least a quarter million a month through our video and news articles. Currently, we have also started doing content marketing for the ICOs under us and we expect significant revenue to come in from the media side (PR & Content Marketing) in the next few months.  We are also rebranding FYN in line for our official launch in Feb, with a name competition starting next week, and attractive prizes to be won! Do stay tuned to our twitter page.  New Projects  We are happy to welcome 3 new projects: Newera.energy (Vietnam), Viola.AI (Singapore), Matchroom.io (Malaysia).  For these 3 ICOs, we are helping extensively and advising on their crowdsale.  Find out more on what these projects do and the exclusive deals/bonuses for FYN tokens holders here.  We would also like to congratulate all the ICOs (WandX, Genaro, Olympus Lab, Gatcoin) that we have helped so far and their successful ICO completion. Their token price has also done extremely well over the last few months.  We are also excited to have our first major FYN hosted event for the ICOs we are helping in Vietnam on the 28th Jan. We will also be be heading down to New York late Feb, with the event hosted by our own FYN advisor, Michael, who also heads the 6000 strong Ethereum New York Meetup Community.  Development  Over the last month, there were many minor enhancements to the FYN page based on feedback from our customers & sales team. Some of the key one were  BTC & Fiat Payment options Single page signup if you are not logged in. Most of the team is focusing on the the development of the talent marketplace and the expected completion date is expected to be in early Feb.  On the development side, we are actively hiring and we expect to onboard another 2–3 developers over this month to speed up the development progress.  Company Financials  Currently FYN offers a full fledged ICO advisory service, from marketing, legal, technical to fundraising support. Our revenues have been steadily increasing, and we expect to break even in by mar 2018. Note that we have been accepting payment for our services in FYN tokens and will continue to do so.  If you know of anyone that need helps with their project, please email us at contact@fundyourselfnow.com  Our token price is doing well and hit an all time high of about $6.80 a few days ago, almost double of what our price was a month ago.  VinaEX, the crypto-fiat exchange that we partially own, has soft launched and we are expecting a significant amount of revenue to come in from there in the next few months.

Simultaneously the FYN tokens should allow participation in FYN ICOs at preferential rates (does not seem available yet with the alpha version). The FYN tokens also seem to have another advantage, namely in the form of the FYN Community Marketing Program so I expect many to simply hold on to their tokens in order to acquire more tokens:  https://fundyourselfnow.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002183374-What-is-the-FYN-Community-Marketing-Program  https://fundyourselfnow.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002183314-What-are-FYN-tokens-and-the-benefits-  The newbie presence likely has to do with the FYN referral program in my opinion.

I find the above a bit confusing as I thought the cost of using the FYN platform is 5%, but in case there are pro rata distributions and buybacks then I would assume the costs could also reach up to 15%. I am not sure if one of the two programs got replaced by the other or whether it is just me misunderstanding an aspect of it.  I was also curious about the requirements for the air drops as currently I am FYN verified, but I still had my tokens at the HitBTC exchange when getting verified. Do I need to initiate an aspect of the verification again or is that done automatically when such airdrops take place? In that regard I also am curious when the first airdrop is expected to take place. Thanks in advance!  P S: Is there a promo banner we can use at the moment to bring a little more attention to the FYN platform? I thought that might help out. It is not about any bounties for me. I do not care about bounties. Just a small thing that FYN backers can use to help out in a small way.",False

What will also greatly help FYN and all tokens issued on its platform will be Loopring. Loopring will be able to connect exchanges and traders all over the world and thereby allow for both decentralisation or centralisation depending upon user wishes, but the key aspect is that it will greatly enhance liquidity and match the very best prices across exchanges and traders. Every trader can keep control over their own cryptocurrencies and still trade them on this platform.

I think in the long run it would be a mistake to use only Bitcoin and Ethereum and also account for the rising smart economy stars such as NEO for example. On Ethereum there is truly a lot of competition, but on newer platforms that is a great PR tool to raise awareness, market cap and new sources of financing in the future....especially if you are one of the first. For example AdEx already intended to run on the Ethereum platform, but the news that it would also run on the NEO platform pushed its market cap from $10 million to $90 million and it did fall back again, but it is currently at a market cap of $71 million. Admittedly it could be said that I am biased as I am a great fan of NEO, but I think the philosophies of NEO and FYN are related as the key philosophy behind NEO is compliance (with governments), whilst the main philosophy of Ethereum is anti-censorship just like there is an anti-establishment mentality in Bitcoin. FYN on the other hand seeks greater accountability in the raising of funds and therefore in essence also has a philosophy of compliance and accountability.",False

In this article, I would like to share with everyone on how FundYourselfNow is trying to build a complete ecosystem that will help creators achieve their dreams. If you like this article, please join our https://join.slack.com/fundyourselfnow/shared_invite/MTk2MTQ1MjU4MjkyLTE0OTcyNDUzNTYtZDhhM2I1NzQ1ZQ & https://telegram.me/fundyourselfnow chat.  For more information on our coin, please visit https://coinmarketcap.com/assets/fundyourselfnow/  How is FundYourselfNow different?  Unlike other platforms out in the market, there will be two modes of funding on our platform: the traditional route & the token crowdsale route. In the traditional route, no tokens are issued and creators get funded in cryptocurrency rather than fiat currency. As mentioned in our white paper, our aim is to become better than Kickstarter, where backers can back the projects that they love.  There has been a huge interest on token sales in the last 6 months, with the recent major news being the ban on ICOs in China. The team at FYN would like to refocus on how we are actually improving traditional Non-ICO crowdfunding to foster greater innovation.  Our aim is to allow creators to create project and to raise funds ranging from as little as $1000 to as much as a few hundred million. In fact, once the platform is up and running, we envisage that most of the projects on our platform that we help, will eventually go through the traditional non-token route. 97% of the projects on Kickstarter raise less than 100,000 USD. From a funding and business perspective, it is impractical for small projects to do token sales because     1. Almost no centralized exchanges will list the tokens due to almost zero liquidity.    2. High costs of hiring blockchain developers to integrate tokens into your business.    3. Potentially no logical tokenization model that makes sense for the business and backer  Currently, we are not aware of anyone in the blockchain industry that is attempting to do something similar to us for traditional crowdfunding. Also, it is important to note that FundYourselfNow is a rewards-based crowdfunding platform, and we review each and every project to ensure that no equity or debt or collective investment schemes projects are listed on our platform so that we remain legally compliant.  Milestone-Based Payments with Refund option using Smart Contracts  At FYN, one of the key features is fraud protection for backers. Currently, there is no existing crowdfunding platform that offers any form of protection for backers against failed projects.  We are solving 2 major roadblocks that traditional crowdfunding platforms face when they try to implement milestone based payments:     1. Regulated financial entities that provide escrow services to hold funds raised by a company typically charge a high flat fee plus 1%–5% of        the funds held on a yearly basis. Obviously, this will not make sense for a huge majority of projects that raise less than 100k due to the        cost. We are using Smart Contracts as a trustless, transparent escrow, where creators can only withdraw crypto-currency after they        reach certain targets promised to backers. The cost to do so is relatively cheap compared to traditional escrow options.     2. Cost of processing refunds is extremely high with fiat currency. Wire transfer and administrative processing fees could easily run up to 50        USD or more. Most donations on Kickstarter range anywhere between $10–$200, and it is likely that the refund costs might even cost        more than the remaining backed amount. With blockchain technology, the fees can be reduced to less than $1 which makes refunds        practical.  In fact, milestone based payments are critical for projects fundraising via traditional crowdfunding route as there is no liquidity for the backed project. For a token-based project, backers can exit anytime by selling their tokens on the secondary market.  Besides outright scams, many projects also fail because of poor business decisions, lack of talented staff, lack of communications etc., which results in the projects not being able to deliver on their promises. We believe with this milestone system, creators will be held accountable and provide proper updates to backers, who have the power to withhold or terminate payment throughout the entire project lifecycle.  Talent Marketplace to support crowdfunding ecosystem  The purpose of the talent marketplace is to help creators get their idea from the idea stage to the fundraising stage. Project Creators will be able to post jobs and find the help they need via the platform. The platform will consist of talents in 4 key areas:     1. Development    2. Advisors & Mentors    3. Marketing    4. Operations Support/Legal  In our initial launch, we have partnered with trusted and reputable companies that can provide the help that creators need. For projects that are fund-raising via the token model, creators will have the additional option of partial payments in their project tokens, reducing the upfront cash needed. All partners offer a wide range of services that are applicable to both non-crypto and crypto projects. At FYN, we will be using our volume to negotiate a better rate for creators coming in via the FundYourselfNow platform.  Some of the talent partners that we are working with include (not exhaustive):     1. Netset Software Solutions (Blockchain Development Partner) who can provide a full range of software development services like Mobile        Application development,CRM/ERP development,eCommerce, Web Design and Content Management System, including blockchain        technology.    2. NewsBtc (Media Partner)    3. Blanket Media which can run social media campaigns provide video reviews on channels such as Hackdroid & EnergyModzTech    4. Coss.io (Exchange & Cryptocurrency Payment Partner)  On top of this, we are opening the talent marketplace to individuals so that they can offer support to the projects that they like, in return for tokens or some cash amount.  If you are interested in signing up for the talent marketplace or have a project you need help with, please drop us an email at contact@fundyourselfnow.com.  Keep in touch because I will be telling you more about our plan for upcoming months!  Warmest Regards,  Kenneth, Co-Founder, FundYourselfNow",False

Currently, it is the fifth day on our crowdsale and we have raised about 2250 Ethers so far, and we are more than halfway to our minimum funding goal of 1.5M USD. We strongly encourage all our supporters to join our Slack chat to find out more about what we do. Over the last few days, we have started our advertising campaign in the Chinese ICO platforms and our eventual goal is to have FundYourselfNow cater to both the Chinese and English market. Since our last post on how we plan to make FYN tokens grow, we have also received collaboration requests from 4 -5 entrepreneurs globally, which we are currently in the process of reviewing. To celebrate our progress so far, we are releasing new details of 2 new projects that will be funded exclusively via the FYN platform. Nogle Chat Currently in China, there are free instant messengers (e.g. QQ. MicroMessenger) that are popularly used, but messaging data within platform is mined by the platform provider to identify opportunities for targeted & government compliance Nogle Chat is a a combination between telegram and whatsapp. It is designed to be super secure. There are two versions of Nogle Chat: Nogle chat branded app that to sell direct to enterprises and end users. White label for resellers to sell to enterprises and end users Their target enterprise customers are corporate entities like financial institutions that require a private and robust networked, secure and encrypted internal and branded chat application where they can do all business functions video file sharing voice etc. Security features such as Read-and-Destroy & Remote message destructions ensure that sensitive company information can be destroyed once it is read.

Nogle chat will potentially create Nogle Chat tokens that will be used to as credits to access the app functions. More details will be released further down the road. Relapp In the current global market, there is no mobile application for private clients to trade bonds. However, for most private banking clients, bonds form a significant part of their investment portfolio as they are safe and have low volatility. Relapp offers an organized way for private banks to convey their range of products to clients in a user-friendly manner.

We have listened to community feedback and revamped our rewards structure for our ICO and made it much better. Instead of a 5% eventual dividend payout, 70% of the profits will be distributed back to the token holders in the form of token buybacks.  The reasons for the changes are outlined here at https://medium.com/@FundYourselfNow/changes-to-fyn-reward-structure-54208e0d0c79  To allow for time for the rewards changes to be communicated, update of the legal terms and grow the FYN community further, we have decided to move the ICO launch to 13th June.

We are planning to write an article to highlight the difference between existing projects (e.g. wings) & starbase early next week. One of the main key difference between us and others is that we have a heavy focus on building a service marketplace where project creators can build a team and get the help they need to launch their project/ICO, where Wings focus on building a prediction marketplace that allows users to see which ico will succeed.  I do want to highlight our ability to execute on our ideas. Our CEO also owns another company, Pinnacle One Consultancy (www.pinnone.com), which is a digital marketing consultancy company that has won awards and we are very confident that we would be able to provide the neccessary marketing/design expertise to get things started initially for the service marketplace where there would be a few contractors on board. We have also developed many custom business applications such as accounting, booking, CRM etc for our clients. Lastly, we have a pipeline of ready customers in the Asian region that we currently work with would be willing to work with us to launch ICO for their new products to raise funding. You can take a look at demo.fundyourselfnow.com where we have built an alpha version of the product that we envision it to be.  We believe that the current ICO market is definitely large enough for 2-3 crowdfunding players. Our vision is to bring the ICOs option to the mainstream market and with more options for people/investors, such as FundyourselfNow/Wings/Starbase, the ICOs market will continue to grow at a rapid pace.",False

We are also building a service marketplace where project creators can find and build a team to support their project and ideas, and these people get rewarded with project tokens when the fundraising is completed. This is similar to the bounty program which many ICOs are running now, but we want to make the process far more user friendly and easier for people to manage.
