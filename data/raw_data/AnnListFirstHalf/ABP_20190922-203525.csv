The Acebusters Tokens can be distinguished as Nutz (NTZ), the players’ token that allows playing games and protects the players’ bankroll from market volatility, and Acebusters Power (ABP), the investors’ and influencers’ token, that allows to profit from the growth of the Dapp and participate in decision making.  The crowdsale starts 21st September 2017 at 13:00 (UTC). The purchase price will be 30,000 NTZ = 1 ETH. The provided discount is 33% and it should be available until either the soft cap of 30,000 ETH has been collected or until the maximum duration of 30 days of the event has passed, whichever comes first. You can find more information about the upcoming crowdsale on our Website.  You can convert you NTZ to ABP. What ABP give you: 1. Voting Rights Power holders can cast ballots on votes with the weight of their ABP balance.  2. Access to trusted tables The bond can serve as access right to trusted tables and can be slashed if a player is found cheating or colluding.  3. Profit ABP, the investors’ token allows to profit from the growth of the Dapp.  More about ABP you can read here: http://help.acebusters.com/information-for-investors/investor-faq/how-to-invest-in-the-acebusters-project",False

Check out our github repo. Use the tech to build your own fantastic Dapp! Contribute to development and earn bounties.  Yellowpaper Abstract:  We present a payment channel concept for up to 10 participants and an efficient protocol to rotate in and out of this multiparty state channel including secure cash distribution. Of this, a busy cash-game poker table with players sitting down and standing up is a prime example.  Our protocol has an initial phase where a participant interacts with the blockchain to join a state channel. After that, new and previous participants need to communicate only with each other over the course of many message exchanges. At any time a participant can signal intention to leave the state channel and eventually rotate out from the channel without interrupting the ongoing message flow or affecting the security of funds. We describe the stateful contract model and the security notions that our protocol accomplishes. Moreover, we provide a reference implementation as smart contract in Solidity. In comparison to existing payment channels, our multiparty state channels are more efficient and have additional features.",False

We worked hard on the product and the crowdsale trying to achieve the best result for the project. In this period we have learned a lot about the ICO space and received an overwhelming amount of interest, both from the public and from private investors.  We have found friction in the following points: Complex token model - hard to communicate purpose and advantages. Crowded ICO market - not able to create the wide attention that Acebusters deserves. Overwhelming interest - the small team has not been able to follow up with all inquiries. Consequently, we decided to take more time and prolong the process to accommodate our learnings, close more investments, build out the team, and improve our messaging.  New Crowdsale Schedule We will extend the Acebusters crowdsale until December 21st 2017. The current discount rate of 33% will stay unchanged until November 21st, from that date on, the rate will drop every 6 days by 5%. The following graph indicates the schedule:   We are happy to announce that we have closed private investments and collected multiple commitments that already exceed the minimum amount stated in our whitepaper. The crowdsale is bound to succeed and Acebusters is bound to kill Stars!  Existing Investors We highly appreciate your early stage trust in this project. As an early investor you have the following options: You got the best deal possible. Keep everything as it is. We'll hit exchanges ASAP after the close of the sale. You can sell your NTZ in our Dapp any time time before Nov. 21st to receive your Ether back.  Either way, we will keep you updated on the progress. We have some exciting updates about our road-map and an improved business model in the pipeline, stay tuned!",False

The offering period ends with a total of 5,000 ETH raised. ● According to the graph, with 5,000 ETH raised, 70,000 ABP (10%) is issued in addition to the existing 630,000 ABP before the event. ● In the power-up period, Alice converts all of her 30,000,000 NTZ into ABP, receiving 14,000 ABP (2% of the issued ABP).""  Shouldn't Alice receive 20% of the issued ABP? (she spent 1000 ETH, 5000 ETH total were raised, so she contributed 20%)   The value of ABP will depend only on the price of NTZ, because when powering down you receive the exact same amount that you used to power up? (and ABP can't be traded)  How is the profit part / dividend returned? In additional NTZ? Very unclear in the whitepaper.  Is the amount of ABP that could be issued in power events capped in any way?    It's an interesting project and I like the idea of having a token that is stable in value, because your funds for playing poker aren't meant to be a risky investment, but I don't really see why ABP should be suited for investors and why NTZ would be riskless, if ABP value depends on NTZ price. NTZ seems to be a risky asset and ABP seems to be just NTZ with some extra steps. The way I understood it, NTZ would fluctuate in price just as any other coin, because it determines ABP price which is bound to be volatile because of the dividend. It would simply fluctuate in a more controlled way because of the market maker contract. But if interest in ABP rises and people start to value ABP higher, demand for NTZ rises, because it is needed to convert to ABP, forcing a change in the set prices of the MM contract. Same goes for depreciation.  Another question is, if people buy say 1,000,000,000 NTZ just as funds for playing, and issued ABP is say 1,000,000 and outstanding ABP is 800,000, then how much NTZ needs to be powered up to receive 1 ABP?   I hope I am mistaken and someone can clarify these issues.  Thanks",False
