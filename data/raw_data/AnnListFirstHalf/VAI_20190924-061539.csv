However, our project goes beyond dating stage and it helps users throughout any relationship stage they are in; single, attached or married, with REL-Registry and Love AI. Furthermore, another key factor what sets us apart from other projects is that this project is supported by an existing company with 14 years of experience in the love industry in Singapore. We have also recently confirmed a partnership with Singapore AI Program , AI Singapore, and a tertiary institution, Singapore Management University, to develop the AI match engine. Viola.AI is the latest project of the company and we have the motivation to keep it going.",False

Viola.AI is different from other ICO because we are more than just a dating platform. We realized that the love industry as a whole is plagued with unethical practices and pressing challenges that contribute to the increasing number of love scams due to: 1) lack of identity and relationship verification, and 2) higher divorce rates because of the stigma for seeking professional help. Viola.AI aims to restore trust and transparency in this $800b love industry and help millions, if not billions of people find and sustain happy and lasting relationships. The key feature of Viola.AI is its verification process, which we call REL-Registry. Our REL-Registry, which is built on the blockchain, verifies each user’s identity through visual recognition, social media check and at the same time, ascertains their relationship status. Our goal is to eventually create the world's largest single women database and give them the reassurance that the people they meet on Viola.AI are genuine singles who are real. REL-Registry is complemented by our smart AI Love Advisor. Our AI evolves with the user, from dating to couple-hood to marriage based on the user’s relationship status, and can recommend relevant and customised content, advice, and services to serve each user’s needs.

However, this manner of throwing anonymous accusations on the eve of our Public Sale is very uncalled for.  No-refund policy is common among not just for ICO but also many businesses. While users have the duty to read the terms of service, we do notify users of the changes in our policy in May and these terms and conditions are accessible on the website easily.

There are many new tokens and promises of revolutionizing software applications that will be on the blockchain, but there still isn't really anything like that yet. This won't be like that either, but the point is that it wasn't part of their advertisement in the first place. The financial relation with the customer is also relatively easy: Customer comes in, service is provided, payment is received. It might be that there are unhappy customers who don't want to pay and that there are more unhappy than happy customers, but then their income would decline and that isn't the case, the opposite is. It's also improbable that there will be hidden debts among a lot of customers, because why would anyone provide a really fine diner and a date for you, and continue doing that without payment?  Let's hope their customers like this new thing, so that the software and tokens will be used. There isn't an arrangement that includes an intercontinental flight so I can't use them ",False

There's no worrying about the market, the company financials, the community, because they are doing this for over a decade already. There's the token sale that still has to finish, and then the road map says in May 2018 the first few things are supposed to be introduced to the community. Actually all things after the token sale are depending on the software/technology. Even if there are unforeseen complications along the road map, this company is never gonna throw this entire project down the drain over some software complications, coding errors or whatever. This is something they desire themselves as well. If there are any complications, they're just gonna hire someone to fix that, like a good company would. Only time will tell, but that is what I expect.  From their whitepaper  Quote We build the VIOLA token to have strong utility. Besides just the Viola.AI app, the VIOLA token will be integrated with our existing ecosystem of 4 apps, 2 websites and 3 offline services (integrated 3rd party Merchants/Partners)...  From their recent history it seems that they have been acquiring companies alike all over Southeast Asia for years now. Companies with similar platforms and active community. This article names some of those companies, no small players: https://www.newunion.sg/insights/the-sme-show/finances/how-to-scale-successfully-by-acquiring-companies  Reason we don't hear that much about it is because Southeast Asia uses it's own internet fora / social media / et cetera.  edit: I doubted this at first, but having read into this little by little, it seems that expansion of their dating business is not a step they took overnight. This has been well thought of. Let's hope the A.I. strives to be just as thoughtful for the customers/community of this business, because that's what eventually will be the basis of success that will put value in the coin (for the investor).",False

Greetings Viola.AI Supporters!   Since we started our pre-sale in December 2017, our team has been working super hard to grow our community and launching our pre-sale bonus as a way to thank our passionate early supporters!  The biggest bonus tokens was rewarded until 31 Dec 2017 and second round of bonus token for the first 1,000,000 tokens were snapped up in a matter of days!  Currently, you can still support our project until 31 Jan 2018 with third round of bonus tokens. This will mark the end of our pre-sale as we gear towards the highly-anticipated Public Sale!  A couple of changes that we’d like to announce in regards to our campaign that many of you have been asking:   1. Public Sale Date starts on 14 March 2018 After feedback from the community and advice from our experienced Advisors, our team has decided to change the start of our Public Sale date to 14 March 2018 (and will run for 30 days.) The reason for the change in the start of our public sale is that with the exciting plans, partnerships and new advisors joining the team, we need more time so that we can really present to you the best vision that we have for Viola.AI!   2. A total of 7.5 million VIOLA tokens is available for Pre-Sale (excluding bonus!) Pre-sale of Viola.AI is ongoing (3 more weeks!) and we have allocated 7.5 million of VIOLA tokens in this period (until 31 Jan 2018.)  You can still take part in the pre-sale with third round of bonus tokens now!   3. VIOLA Bonus tokens lockdown reduced from 6 months to 60 days! After feedback from our community and advisors, we have adjusted the vesting period for VIOLA bonus tokens from 6 months to 60 days only!  This means our supporters can sell their VIOLA bonus tokens in just 2 months after the distribution of VIOLA tokens. (which will be done 7 days after the end of Public Sale.)   4. We give you the BEST exchange rate Many supporters have asked us, which exchange rate do we use for purchase since crypto value may change from time to time, thus determining the amount of VIOLA tokens.  The amount of VIOLA tokens you will receive is dependent on:  The exchange rate at the point of your purchase (we use Coin Market Cap) to get the rate. At the end of the public sale, we will lock the exchange rate again, and compare the two. We will choose the best rate for you (whichever is higher) — which means MORE VIOLA tokens!   Talk to us!

Q1) How can we see how much VIOLA tokens do we get? This is next in our next round of development. Our team is currently working to improve the Dashboard, so that you can view your own contribution details, the amount of VIOLA tokens you have purchased, as well as edit your profile and information.

Q3) When will I get our VIOLA tokens? VIOLA tokens will be credited to your wallet 7 days after the public sale is concluded.  ***  Finally, a couple of things that we are working on next week!  1) We will be improving the Dashboard Panel for you to: - Make the process of purchasing much easier and clearer - Allow you to edit your profile (add information, complete your KYC) - View the purchase that you have made, and the amount of VIOLA tokens you are getting This is a priority as we know that this feature will be very helpful for our community.  2) We are working on a very exciting partnership which we will announce early next week.

Viola.AI’s very own Chief Violet Lim recently was interviewed on entrepreneurship, management advice and of course, her successful business Lunch Actually! Violet Lim is an advocate of finding love. Through the dating service she co-founded, she and her team have arranged over 100,000 dates across South East Asia. Here, she talks about running the business of finding love within the Southeast Asian region.  37-year old Lim, a mother of two young children, knows what she’s talking about. Since its inception in 2004, dating service Lunch Actually has grown exponentially through acquiring matchmaking brands such as Singapore dating app Love Out Loud Asia in 2014, Thailand’s MeetNLunch the year after and the most recent, Indonesian Setipe in 2017. Today, it operates in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong.  Lim left a stable corporate job to start Lunch Actually. It sounds like a flighty move, in fact, her parents thought so at the time. What made her do this was the realisation that her extremely eligible and attractive banker colleagues were still single and it was because they were working long hours. ‘They were virtually married to the bank. When I came across the concept of lunch dating, I was immediately attracted to the idea because I felt that lunch was “short, sweet and simple” – long enough for you to get to know someone, yet short enough not to become awkward,’ the modern-day matchmaker explains. ‘It’s not just a business of making money but making a difference in people’s lives by helping them find life-long happiness.’  What are the main lessons learned throughout the journey? What are the differences of managing various offices in the region? Dating business - is it lucrative?

Thanks a lot for your interest.  This will be an app that encompasses 1) Real-ID Verification 2) A love advisor and assistant  3) A marketplace that provides goods and services 4) A community network that shares questions and answers/ advices to one another.  1) Real-ID Verification Elizabeth downloads the Viola.AI App and creates an account. She uploads a photo that has half her face blocked and Viola.AI then takes a video scan of her face for the verification process. The verification fails as the photo Elizabeth has used is not suitable (or even good for a dating profile) when compared to the video scan.  She is then prompted to use another photo which she uploads to Viola.AI again. This time, the photo used is more suitable and the verification test passes. Elizabeth logs in to her Facebook account to allow verification to be conducted on her profile which includes name and other basic information. The final checks are passed and Elizabeth can proceed to use her verified dating profile on Viola.AI.  2) A love advisor and assistant Henry is using Viola.AI to find new matches. Finally, Viola.AI informs Henry that one of his matches, Elizabeth, is also interested in meeting up with him. She proposes to arrange the date on Wednesday (after checking both side’s calendars) in a Japanese restaurant (both parties like Japanese food) that is relatively near. One day before the date, Henry receives a reminder on the date and Viola.AI suggests a first date article for Henry to read. On the day itself, Viola.AI prompts Henry to leave work on time and shows him the location of the restaurant again to avoid being late (first impression counts). Henry finally meets Elizabeth face to face.  They both hit it off which Viola.AI promptly asked Henry for feedback on how the date went after the date.  After a few more dates proposed and arranged by Viola.AI, Henry and Elizabeth decide to become an exclusive couple.  Henry updates Viola.AI on this change in his relationship with Elizabeth and Viola.AI now switches mode from matchmaker to love advisor and begins to help Henry to grow his relationship with Elizabeth henceforth (e.g. reminding him of important dates and prompting him to gift). All this time, Elizabeth goes through the same process as Henry.  3) A marketplace that provides goods and services It is now one year since Henry and Elizabeth got married. Viola.AI reminds Henry that his first wedding anniversary is coming and if he wants to do anything special for Elizabeth. Henry responds “Yes” and he wants to buy flowers and book a restaurant for a nice dinner date. Viola.AI proposes the itinerary for the evening which Henry accepts. Viola.AI then proceeds to make the booking. Viola.AI presents Henry with 3 choices of the flower bouquet for Elizabeth and proposes the time and place of delivery. Henry doesn’t like any of the choices and sends out request to the florist merchants within Viola.AI for more options.  More flower options come back from the florist merchants and Henry chooses one of them to be delivered at the time and place proposed by Viola.AI and makes payment by VIOLA tokens to the chosen florist merchant for it. Henry is now all set for his Anniversary with Elizabeth and Viola.AI reminds him accordingly one day before about it.  4) A community network that shares questions and answers/ advices to one another To supplement Viola.AI’s initial limited capability in the beginning while she is developing and learning, users can seek answers by sending out their questions or requests via a bid. The requestor can encourage respondents to answer the request by adding VIOLA tokens to the request as a reward. The respondent with the best answer that is chosen by the requestor will be given VIOLA tokens. The requestor can decide to reveal their identity or remain anonymous if they desire the privacy. Most importantly, Viola.AI will learn from the best-rated responses and if she incorporates the responses into her future responses, the content providers will also be rewarded with VIOLA tokens.   A key benefit to note is that this Viola.AI evolves to meet your needs according to the changes in your relationship status. Whether you are single, attached, married, it advises you all the time. Seamless transition.  We have an existing dating business presence in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia and Japan. We have about 1 billion datapoints accumulated over 13 years to work on this project. We are very determined to make this work because this Viola.AI is going to change how we deal with relationships and benefit a whole lot of people significantly from this revolutionising project.  We welcome all support and feedback to make Viola.AI even better.",False

This Viola.AI is more than a dating app where single men meet single women. It is a love advisor that helps singles, couples and married couples to create and sustain happy their relationships. We emphasise on the seamless transition of providing dating and relationship advices to users as they transit from one relationship stage to another.  In order for Viola.AI to understand the user and prescribe the right relationship recommendations, it needs to collect user profile data such as demographic, user behaviour and preferences. In addition, users can share more detailed relationship data such as current relationship status, past relationship info, if married, perhaps even sharing their # of kids and etc. Selected user data needed for verification will be encrypted using industry-standard private/public key and save on user’s phone. After which, Viola app will take further security measures to obfuscate the data. Only after the data has been hashed and signed will it be written to the blockchain.",False
