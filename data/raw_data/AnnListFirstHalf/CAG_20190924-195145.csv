We will still need to work together with the integrator on coordinating how processor fees will be structured — however this should be a more dynamic process.  We started off working with 4 options — one (integrator #4) which fell of at the start due to lower appetite in terms of risk exposure and another one (integrator#3) was somewhat left in limbo while their compliance was designing new guidelines for working with companies in our sector. This later option has finalized its process and it looks like it will be hard to move ahead with them — however it was the case that a majority of players in the market was working with them so we’re glad that we had contingencies and started with 4 options.  With options #3 and #4 out of the picture and #1 moving along nicely you are probably wondering what’s happening with #2 — on this side as you might remember last week we submitted some new and innovative schematics to credit card company which are still currently being reviewed — however early feedback is positive — last thing that needs to be done here is monetary related negotiations.  In the mean time, we have also spoken and assessed 3 other potential integrators, one of which we might bring in as a further contingency. We also had the chance to attend a hackathon at one of the major banks in Estonia and got some very interesting contacts.  State of Current Partnerships We have seen a couple of questions in the chat regarding to what is the current status of announced partnerships so we’re happy to address that. We have decided to move in the direction of partnering with companies such as Mothership, Kyber, ETHLend, Zilla as well as Smartly, Bitof Property and Indorse — because we saw synergies between our products, however, we are all at the start of the journey as as you have seen everyone is focusing on building their core products at their own pace. Right now the partnerships are at a starting stage where we focus information and knowledge sharing to better understand how everyone is navigating the space and building relationships.  The next step will take place once partner’s respective product has reached a degree of maturity so we can actually integrate and as you might have noticed there has been impressive progress so far — everyone is excelling in their particular expertise. You will notice that we have not been pushing too aggressively on adding new partners despite receiving constant contacts from other parties, this has been so we can keep focusing on our current commitments — deliver on these and then expand.  E-Residency Goals E-Residency can be considered one of the most impressive achievements in the context of digital identity and it is surely paving the way for other countries to take a global approach on the topic of doing business and enabling a generation of digital nomads. Since the inception of Change we have had close contact and have worked to support each others vision. We do plan on executing more aggressively with E-Residency in the future and this will be done in a much more formal and direct manner than it has been done up to now.  With Change scaling we do envision E-Residency allowing global residents to access a series of Change services that for whatever reason might be restricted to Europe, an example you might have seen and real problem can be the fact that some cards companies only allow card issuance to the residents of a particular country and you are restricted from ordering such country if you are let’s say from outside the EU.  https://medium.com/changefinance/partnerships-update-progress-on-integration-and-state-of-current-partnerships-494ee0afc6e9",False

We’ve been keeping very busy to find the new members to our great team. Currently, our main focus is growing our engineering power. A rather tough task, considering the expectations on the candidates are high.    Careful consideration Right now we are building the core team of our company and the people joining us in this stage will play an integral role in creating the company’s future. This is why we are taking our time to very carefully analyze all applicants and although we have a lot of applications coming in, very few have passed the evaluation process.  Just like Sam Altman, the founder of Y combinator, brilliantly said:  “What we have seen is the best startups hire the least and the slowest in the very beginning. AirBnb took 9 months to hire their first person. Dropbox took “a long time” to hire their first person. Stripe took 6 months to hire their first person”  Evaluation process To be sure that anyone joining us is a perfect fit to the company culture and values, our hiring process consists of 4 steps:  1Pre-screening interview — 30–45 min call regarding applicant’s motivation, product thinking, main achievements, ambitions etc.  2Development team interview — 1.5h conference call focusing on technological knowledge and skill set, also conducting a small coding task.  3Product Manager interview — deeper look into the mindset to understand the candidate’s way of thinking and find out if there’s the “Special habanero sauce” in the inside we are looking for.  4CEO interview — final round to see the overall match to the company.  This week we had 15 pre-screening interviews, 4 tech team interviews, 4 product/design team interviews, and 2 meetings with our CEO Kristjan. We’re very happy to see that all the hard work we’ve put into interviewing has lead to the first results as well- we made 2 offers to promising candidates in the last few days.  https://medium.com/changefinance/hr-update-hiring-hiring-hiring-48d31e9e5df0",False

I didn't come into crypto with my last or my life savings, I came in to crypto knowing full and well I could lose whatever I brought to the game.  I have a venture capitalist approach and I already conceded that somethings will lose.  I've accepted the risks and I live with it.

I just hearken back to the table here: https://medium.com/@CryptoJudgemnt/comparing-cryptobanks-tenx-monaco-change-polybius-tokencard-bankera-54345c04c6a7  (even though I see mention of fees in the article posted a few posts above this up)...If you look at that table and consider that we're pretty much moving out of the testing phase, all we have to do is work on growing the ecosystem.  WE JUST passed Polybius and Tokencard in cap rankings in the past month but prior to that Change was the lowest on the totem pole even though we project to be one of the best.  NONE of Change's competitors can boast E-residency and this can bring huge potential to the third party services platform.  Also as far as I'm aware, Change bank gives the most total percentage points back to its hodlers versus the competition.  We're def well positioned for great long term growth and a big exchange listing like Binance could come at any given moment.",False

Like I said, I think the team is inexperienced, plus there might be more to it than meets the eye. I've been involved with a number of startups, and the budget you work with is usually very tight. It's not like they have one pot of 79 million coins, but rather a large number of addresses, all with various amounts of coins in them. Some budget goes to legal fees and such, some goes to marketing, .... I assume they underestimated the bounty amount and overestimated the ICO amount, which led to coins being used to pay marketeers/advisors/legal fees/development/... when in fact they were destined to be used as bounty rewards. That's why I believe we're seeing so much action in the addresses, because they're now looking into cutting certain budgets to make room for more bounty payments. Don't forget either that this situation wasn't planned. They expected to be done with bounties by the beginning of november. This means some people (krayola, jack, ...) now have to split their time between their planned tasks, and bounty handling. To conclude, I think there's more going on behind the scenes than meets the eye. For the record, I've been paid around 20% of what I believe I should get, but I'm waiting patiently. Soon, the large bulk of participants will be satisfied with the outcome, so if I haven't gotten my full rewards, I'll contact them then. Disclaimer: I'm in no way affeliated with Change, but I know how startups operate and what unexpected difficulties they can face.",False

You could simply find out actual 17x difference in expected returns between Polybius and Change in favour of first one. It seems Change team is too greedy!  As far as it concerns 'Polybius is scam' - but most of them is soft scam! For instance MonacoCard: they get on ICO near $25mlns, but it is already known that they launched crypto-card leveraging third-party WaveCrest solution. It costs them nearly $300/$400thnd. + 2mln for marketing, and rest of money was pocketed-out. So no doubt Change will obtain EMI licence and be able to launch product - they openly stated in wp that will use third-party solution for card-issuance, see page 25. The question is that $4/$5mln is enough even taking into account thier innovative API for other fintech, so asking investors for $50mln is soft scam too.",False

The slight difference is that Polybius team was shy to mention cryptos in conjuction to banking services, but these guys dare to do it. As far as it concerns crypto accounts and crypto-nominated debit cards - there are hundreds of such start-ups and even well-established companies like MonacoCard, Coinsbank, UQUID etc.  Economic model is also weak - in WP they promise to distribute only 10% of annual income to tokens holders and try to sell only 40% of token supply for near 50mln. For instance, Polybius bank engaged to distribute 20% of annual income for all tokens, from which 93% are sold to public.

Please do.  In addition to a crypto card, Change is offering a financial services marketplace. The philosophy behind the Change model is the understanding that banks which focus on all key financial products at once don't really excel in any product and therefore offer mediocre services. We at Change believe that fintech companies specializing in one financial product offer a much better service than a traditional bank.  By aggregating a variety of fintech companies together into one marketplace, a customer of Change gets to cherry pick the best loan offerings, ETF investments, real-estate investments and insurance options the market has to offer. A banking experience from one app with the market’s best financial services.",False

That makes zero sense. The price of Ethereum dropped $100 in just a few days. In just one month the price even dropped from almost $400 to $150. How can you even fund a project based on cryptocurrencies when they are so volatile?  It seems to me that raising funds this way is based on nothing. If the hard cap is 200.000 ETH you can potentially raise $76 million when the Ethereum price hits $380 or $40 million when the ETH price hits $200. You have no clue in advance what the price of ETH will be at the time of the ICO.  So how can a hard cap of 200.000 ETH be justified? The hard cap should be based on actual dollars needed and then recalculated to the amount of ETH needed.  Besides, how does the public know how much money will be raised? How much of those 200.000 ETH will be sold for dollars right away? I doubt every single ETH will be sold right away.  Also, the white paper only uses percentiles. For example, 25% of the funds go to licensing and partnerships. And how much is 25% of the funds exactly? No one knows. This is based on the price of ETH which may drop or rise significantly in a matter of days.  Don't get me wrong, its sounds like a great project but funding ICO's based on cryptocurrencies makes no sense at all. I see this happen with a lot of ICO's.  Millions of dollars are raised but no one knows how much. And if all these millions are actually needed. The white paper only talks about ETH. That makes zero sense.  What will happen in the following scenarios:  - Hard cap is 200.000 ETH.  Scenario 1: price of ETH falls to $250 on the day of the ICO: $50 million is raised Scenario 2: price of ETH raised to $400 on the day of ICO: $80 million is raised Scenario 3: On the day of ICO the price is $400 but drops to $280 a month later: how much money is raised?  On a side note, these amounts are only raised if all ETH received in the ICO are directly converted to dollars. Which I doubt will happen.  Putting a hard cap based on cryptocurrency basically means there is no hard cap. Because you might raise $50 million, $20 million, $100 million, etc.  The only right way of funding an ICO is based on the amount of money you need. If you need $50 million then the hard cap should be $50 million. Then the amount of ETH needed should be based on the amount of $50 million. Meaning the hard cap based on ETH will change every day until the ICO takes place. And all raised ETH should be sold for dollars right away. But that does not make any sense at all either. Because if the market is dipping, it would not be wise to sell all ETH right away.  Maybe I'm missing something. But I have zero understanding how funding a project based on volatile cryptocurrencies can work.      ",False

I think investors all over the world are interested, so using ETH as a base currency makes it easier/safer/faster to contribute than using Bitcoin or our own federal currencies. Also, Eth has a lot of potential to grow right now, so they're probably fine with raising money this way. I'm sure they prepare for the worst (ETH drops back to 100$) and hope for the best (ETH shoots past 400$), so i'm guessing they need around 20 million to keep things rolling. Last, they add the hard cap to make their product more scarse, it's a well known marketing tool. Setting a cap of 20 million seems a lot less scarse than setting a cap of 200.000 ETH",False

One thing I would like to highlight is that Chance is VC funded and has been operating for 2 years with its on development team.  The partners - Smartly - Danabijak and BitofProperty have been individually funded by Venture Capital and have been operating individually and independent as well. You can go to their website and use their products at the moment as they are live.  These partners are based out of Singapore, Estonia  and Indonesia where they have they own development teams.  You can think of Change as a marketplace that will allow you to access all these partners, as we will be onboarding partners with finished and functioning products globally - so far partners we are working with are in the insurance sector, peer to peer crypto lending as well as real estate in countries such as Japan, Australia, Estonia, UK , Thailand. We are working with them for on-boarding and setting up the infrastructure.  If you have any other suggestions for partners that provide financial services/ products we would be keen to look into it.  Hope that helps answer your questions.   ",False

Banks SUCK ! not because they handle money but because people suck ! the motivation and incentive in a bank is to backstab and try to push yourself up the ladder -so you will have people across the the departments of bank constantly tripping each other up and making life difficult inside the bank for each other now this translates into high level of incompetency and inefficiency.  I personally welcome this project and these type of projects because they are not banks - yes they might serve the purpose but at their core they are tech firms and the think about tech firms is they have done a decent job at building strong healthy cultures.  In this market place scenario from what I can see - each company functions independently so there is no cross department BS and slog - giving everyone the chance to excel at what they do and serving the end user ie ME.  Now I put money in crypto all the time and make gains BUT if i want to take those gains and put them into something more stable its a nightmare ! especially in the country that I live in and especially because i tend to change countries every couple of years.  If this project will allow me to move my BTC into stocks, etfs property by a click or 2 instead of 2 months , then I am IN! if you know anything about the markets is that timing matters and if this removes the 7 days BS and allows me to buy into opportunities when they come up as opposed to 7 days after then Haleluja !",False
