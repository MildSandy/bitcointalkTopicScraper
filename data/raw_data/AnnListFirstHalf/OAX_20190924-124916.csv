We have recently announced the release of our Layer 2 Exchange (L2X) solution and have also released the open source code. Please view: https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/oax-foundation-releases-new-exchange-protocol-a7a2b8e0a4b7  The proposition of OAX has always been to build the next generation of decentralized exchanges based on speed, scalability, interoperability, and trust.  L2X's initial release is a key milestone for us in our commitment to build a DEX that addresses the challenges that decentralized exchanges face. Our next steps for the protocol will be heavily dependent on operator requirements and the ongoing feedback and testing from our open source code. The immediate future will be ensuring that we address these conversations.  As a part of our community, we understand all the interest in getting a roadmap now that L2X is launched. We're not yet at the point where we can share something in detail, but rest assured we do have some exciting ideas, and hope to share it with everyone once it's confirmed. Please stay tune to our updates!       Hi community members,  As you all know, we hosted our AMA session last week and we would once again like to take the opportunity to thank everyone who took part in the session!  Just to recap, we’ve received 110 questions in total, and we absolutely enjoyed answering each and every one of your questions. Quite a number of questions were related to our Layer 2 Exchange (L2X) protocol announcement, of which we have released the source code on our GitHub here: https://github.com/OAXFoundation/l2x-trustless-exchange.  Many of you were asking if we would host more AMA sessions in the future, and the answer is a definite YES! Our utmost priority has always been to be transparent with all our supporters and community members, and we believe sessions like these will allow us to clarify many of your questions you may have regarding our progress.  However, we would usually host AMA sessions after notable development-related announcements or significant milestones, so please be patient and stay tuned. We’d like to reiterate that all questions relating to OAX Foundation and the work that we do are welcome anytime at all - we are always open to questions, suggestions and feedback, so do join our community chatgroups and participate in our discussions!

This is an update that we've been requesting be made on the CoinMarketCap website for some time now (note that CMC can take upwards of 6 months to update such data,          and has its own specific methods of token supply calculation).           The increase in the market cap is NOT the result of an additional sale.           If you refer to the white paper, you'll see that we have tranches of coins which are locked for different periods (1 year and 2 years).          The updated figures reflect the airdrop and the fact that various portions of coins have now been unlocked as per the white paper and CMC's own approach to token supply calculation.           Here's an overview of how the number of tokens is made up of:           25M (first sale)          +          5M (airdrop)          +          14M (advisor coins unlocked after 1st yr, June 2018)          +          30M (additional token sale which never happened but are unlocked and in the Foundation Treasury)                    gives us 74M total but CMC has their own way of calculating and came up with the 69M you see now.

Representatives from the FinTech Association of Hong Kong and other industry bodies, as well as from across the digital asset industry, will come together to debate the right way to regulate crypto. Our Co-founder and Director Dave Chapman, and General Counsel Paul Li will be appearing on the panel discussions that form the centrepiece of the agenda. Regular followers will know Paul has spoken many times before about the challenge cryptocurrencies and decentralization pose the regulators. This conference will be a unique opportunity for us to demonstrate our commitment to open and transparent discussion of the issues.  It’ll also be another opportunity to promote the OAX project and our firm belief in the future of decentralization, following hard on the heels of our participation in Hong Kong FinTech Week and numerous other events.

There were no sales or marketing pitches to distract from the core aim of the morning.”  Last weekend, around 150 business leaders, entrepreneurs, lawyers and students spent their Saturday morning at the University of Hong Kong listening to some of the leading figures in the digital asset industry discuss the future of regulation.  As we’ve mentioned before, this event was organised by HKU’s Faculty of Law to launch the first in Professor Syren Johnstone’s series on regulating cryptocurrencies, sponsored by OAX Foundation. Regulation has been a constant theme this year in the industry and most FinTech or blockchain conferences have included at least one panel discussion on the topic. This event was different, though, in that the speakers were not only of very high quality but also engaged in free and frank debate between themselves and the audience.  Along with Professor Johnstone, the event featured speakers including our Co-founder Dave Chapman and Paul Li, our general counsel. They are joined by Anthony Lewis from R3, the enterprise blockchain software firm, Pindar Wong, the internet pioneer, Benedicte Nolan, formerly of the SFC and now head of regulatory affairs at Circle, Henri Arslanian, head of crypto at PwC and chairman of the FinTech Association of Hong Kong, Andrew Davidson, chief technology officer at OSL, and Tony Lai of Legal.io  The conference began with an OAX-sponsored breakfast before moving into a series of paired keynote speeches and panel discussions. Each keynote focused on a different aspect of the regulatory issues at stake, from the technical issues, to the role of crypto exchanges, to the development of a properly functioning secondary market. The panel discussions then debated each topic in more detail, meaning that a huge amount of information was able to be discussed over the course of the morning.  It was this focus on debate that made the event stand out for many of the attendees. There were no sales or marketing pitches to distract from the core aim of the morning. Topics like what it’s really going to take to make the crypto industry move forwards and the role custody should play in crypto trading were discussed, as well as fundamental questions such as how you define a token and the best way to make regulation effective.  One major question that was looked at was whether the current approach to regulating digital asset trading was helping or holding back the industry. Two things emerged from this discussion — firstly, that regulators the world over are not getting the credit they deserve for doing a good job in difficult circumstances, and secondly that events like Saturday’s are of crucial importance in getting us to a place where regulation is balanced with innovation.  We’re proud to have been a part of this event, especially one that stood out so much from all the noise and distraction that exist around the topic. It’s not too fanciful to say that it really helped move the regulatory conversation on, and we plan to get involved in more like it and continue playing a leading role in forming the future of our industry.

We’ve made huge progress over 2018 and are moving into 2019 with a new sense of excitement.  2018 started with the industry on something of a high — bitcoin was near its peak and optimism for the future abounded. As the year went on, however, things started to get more complicated and a number of themes emerged that dominated discourse: regulation, access, and scalability. OAX Foundation took a leading role in the debate, all the while making sure and steady progress developing the platform.  In particular, we’ve placed a focus on getting out into the community to help people understand the role of the digital asset industry and the importance of decentralization in helping it mature and become mainstream. As part of this campaign, we’ve spoken at over twelve events, ranging from major industry conferences to small group educational sessions.  We’ve been particularly prominent in the debate around regulation, giving lectures and participating in panel discussions about the direction regulators should take. We also sponsored a series of papers from a leading law professor to help bring academic rigor to the discussion. We’re now sought out by people and organizations, from journalists to law societies, to help them understand the dynamics at play in an area which will be critical to the future shape of the industry.  Externally, then, we’ve had a very busy year — and it’s been no less busy internally on the development front. In the summer we launched our platform prototype, bringing to life our project vision for the first time. Since then, we’ve run extensive tests bringing us ever closer to launching a fully functioning version. A key milestone in this journey was the recent announcement that we’d achieved speeds of over 1,000 transactions per second. This marks real progress for the industry as a whole towards solving the scalability challenge that’s currently preventing decentralized exchanges from going mainstream.  Of course, we couldn’t achieve all this without the hard work and commitment of our people. Over the last twelve months, we’ve shaped a team to provide us with the right experience where and when we need it. Our legal, compliance, technology and marketing functions have all seen senior hires who have brought best in class skills to the project. OAX team members such as our General Counsel (Paul Li), Head of Marketing and Communications (Kelvin Wong), Technology Lead (Wayland Chan), and Digital Lead (Robson Chiu), have spoken at events, written articles and generally raised the profile of the Foundation and our work, as well as shaped the progress of the project.  So after a busy 2018, what’s next? An even busier 2019 is on the cards — both for us and for the industry. Our General Manager, Amanda Liu, recently wrote about her vision for the next twelve months, which will see an even greater focus on regulation and compliance as well as market consolidation. As Amanda said in her article, OAX’s clear focus on building a platform that combines strict governance standards with liquidity and speed matches exactly the direction the industry is moving in.  This time next year the picture will be very different again from how it is now, but we’re confident that we will be there playing a central part in it. We look forward to sharing more of our work with you in 2019!

Behind the scenes we’ve been just as busy, working hard to complete the next phase of the project. As we’re fast approaching the end of the year, it’s about time we gave you all an update on this activity.  Since launching an 0x-based prototype in June, our developers over at Enuma have been extremely busy working on a layer two solution that uses off-chain state channels to address the performance issues of the Ethereum blockchain. As you’ll know from previous posts, this is one of the main things that’s been holding back widespread adoption of decentralized exchanges (DEX) for cryptocurrency trading and is something that many people have tried to address. We’ve made huge strides in that area recently and hope to be able to announce some big news very soon.  This will continue to be our major focus over the next few months or so, part of our plan to deliver a working, standalone DEX platform in 2019. We’ll then be able to move onto the beta testing phase, well on track to go live in the latter part of 2019.  Coming up with a scalable DEX isn’t easy. The blockchain community have been working on the scaling issue for years, several projects have made progress but it’s too early to say whether those developments will work or not. At OAX Foundation, we’ve been working on something that we believe will push the bar.  As Amanda, our General Manager, pointed out recently, the current economic environment is tough for many projects and this situation looks set to continue into 2019. OAX Foundation, however, is in a healthy state thanks to careful management of the funds raised from our token sale. In summary, we are in a strong position to deliver a DEX that has an off-chain order book, off-chain order execution and no custody of user assets, meeting the needs of the crypto community.

By Amanda Liu, General Manager, OAX Foundation  In October the Financial Action Task Force (the organisation tasked with combatting money laundering) looks set to introduce a global set of standards for cryptocurrency anti money laundering controls. The G20 had asked FATF to address this issue as they increasingly view the lack of consensus on the subject as a threat to financial stability.  Countries like China and South Korea have been imposing restrictions on the sector over this year,and other jurisdictions are working out their approach to regulation.  These developments are all set against a backdrop of falling Bitcoin prices and wider economic uncertainty. While the US stock market might be hitting fresh records, the impact of the US/China trade war is still far from clear. Over in Europe, Brexit and the chance of the UK crashing out of the European Union without a deal are looming large in investors’ thoughts.  The technology sector is not going to be immune from this. Over the past few years, innovation, particularly in finance, has been the trend to follow with a multitude of start-ups offering a new take on practically every part of the industry. Blockchain projects in particular have become the star of the show or — depending on who you talk to — the villain of the piece. Many people are predicting a tech bubble similar to the one which burst in the dot com era nearly twenty years ago.  To those of us working in the industry, however, the picture is much more nuanced. Over the next few years we’ll undoubtedly see some big changes in the structure and make-up of the cryptocurrency sector. Increased regulation and a more uncertain economic environment will combine to make life difficult for many firms, who will choose to turn their attention elsewhere, leaving their projects unfinished.  But blockchain, the technology underlying cryptocurrencies, is here to stay. Its potential to change financial services for the better is almost universally accepted. Just recently, the World Economic Forum issued a report saying how blockchain could help improve trade finance for small and medium sized enterprises by lowering barriers to trade. And the People’s Bank of China launched its own blockchain based trade finance initiative just a week or so ago.  These examples point to the fact that projects using innovations like blockchain to bring genuine benefits to the wider community will succeed where others fail. These projects are not interested in short term gains but are instead focused on building strong and sustainable products for the future.  That’s what we’re focused on doing at OAX Foundation. Regardless of the latest moves in the price of bitcoin or how regulations will eventually evolve, we are set firm on building a decentralized exchange platform that will bring stability, transparency and speed to cryptocurrency trading.

Regular readers will know this is not the first time we’ve done something like this — in fact, our team members regularly present on topics related to digital asset trading. It’s all a part of our mission to help bring transparency and greater understanding to the industry.  At today’s course, Kelvin introduced the decentralized exchange concept to about 150 students, describing the benefits it brings to the crypto market as well as the challenges facing its mass adoption. As you’ll be aware by now, decentralization means users have greater control over their own assets and the risk of hacking is greatly reduced compared to a centralized environment. But speed and volume remain issues that make performance levels a concern (and which aren’t problems faced by centralized exchanges).  That’s where the OAX platform comes in, of course — and the second half of Kelvin’s presentation gave an overview of the project, its aims and objectives. Through the use of innovative technologies we aim to combine the best features of centralized and decentralized exchanges, solving the challenges of both and bringing decentralization into the mainstream.  As the project progresses we feel it’s more important than ever to get our message out there — educating the public about how decentralization will shape the future of the financial services industry, and the important role we believe the OAX project will play in doing that. The interest and enthusiasm shown by Kelvin’s audience tonight makes us feel very confident about both!

Dr Patrick McCorry was the UK’s first PhD graduate in cryptocurrencies and has just been appointed an Assistant Professor at King’s College London. He is part of the team behind the Sprites technology that makes the OAX decentralized exchange platform different to all the others.  Patrick met with the Enuma team and Wayland Chan, the new Director of Technology at OAX Foundation, discussing the Sprites implementation on the OAX platform and sharing his views on why it’s so significant.  As we’ve described before, one of the main benefit of Sprites will be increased speed, finally making decentralized platforms able to cope with the transaction volume needed for a successful digital asset trading system. Patrick gave us some more insight into that.  In the pre-Sprites world, time delays are inevitable because dispute resolutions are happening on the blockchain. This means that whenever there’s a dispute between individuals, the entire chain is held up while it’s resolved. Imagine it as a roomful of people. In current systems, if two people disagree on a transaction, they ask the others in the room one by one to verify the facts. The more people in the room, the longer that takes. You can see how this is a real problem if digital asset trading is ever to become mainstream.  Sprites presents an innovative solution to dispute resolution when multiple state channel paths are involved; that results in a drastic reduction in the time collateral is locked up. The second improvement that Sprites offers over traditional state channels is the ability to do partial deposits and withdrawals throughout the lifespan of the channel without interrupting normal operation.  The OAX DEX platform is one of the first real world applications of Sprites, and when asked how it feels to see Enuma implementing it, Patrick said it was “awesome.” He gets emails all the time from people wanting to use Sprites in their projects, but Enuma and the OAX project stand out because we’re taking it seriously.  And he’s right — we’re serious about the project and our commitment to making digital asset trading accessible, transparent and safe for all. Sprites is a critical part of that, so it was truly inspirational to have Patrick with us in Hong Kong and hear his enthusiasm for what we’re doing!

Scams have evolved fast to embrace digital, and unfortunately as a result we’re seeing increasing levels of fraud involving crypto markets and cryptocurrency products.  So it’s hardly surprising that the majority of people searching for advice about scams on the website of the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority are looking for help with digital assets. Scammers use social media to advertise their schemes, and even sometimes fake investment recommendations from famous business people or celebrities.  But of course social media is also used by legitimate firms like ours to update the community on their projects. So it can be hard to know what’s genuine and what’s not.  At OAX Foundation, we want to make sure everyone interested in the work we do keeps themselves as secure as possible from scams. We’re also all about promoting a safe and secure digital asset trading ecosystem. So here are our top four tips for staying safe and avoiding the scams:  1. Watch out for unverified social media accounts.  Always check that the links are verified by the company. For example, OAX’s official social accounts are these:  Website: www.oax.org Twitter: twitter.com/OAX_Foundation Medium: medium.com/@OAX_Foundation Telegram: t.me/openanxteam and t.me/oaxcnt Slack: openanx.slack.com QQ: 651355919  2. Watch out for anyone promising high returns on digital asset trading.  Always be wary if you’re pressured to invest quickly or promised returns that sound too good to be true — they probably are!  3. Do research on the company and examine its background.  Make sure that the projects a digital asset claims to support are actually in existence. Whitepapers (like ours here) and project updates (like this one) will show you that the company actually does what it claims to do, and isn’t out to scam you.  4. Think twice and don’t be rushed into make an investment decision.  A genuine bank or financial organization won’t force you to make a financial transaction on the spot.   At OAX Foundation, we’re building a platform to offer a transparent, secure and fast way for everyone to trade digital assets.

Billed as one of China’s most influential blockchain events, it aims to strengthen collaboration between different parts of the industry and so promote its long-term development. Last year nearly 10,000 people attended when it was held in Shanghai and Macau, with many more participating online. It’s not only an important event for us to be seen at, but it also really puts us in touch with crypto market industry influencers.  The morning session alone featured speeches by representatives from the world of politics (a member of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council), financial services (a senior representative from Zurich Insurance) and professional services (partner and head of CIO Advisory at KPMG). My presentation built on the speech I gave to the Law Society of Hong Kong back in June, and focused on the regulatory challenges involved in the different and developing models of cryptocurrency trading.  As you might recall, I used that opportunity to explain how I thought all participants — including regulators, lawyers and the traders themselves — need to rethink their approach not only to digital assets, but to the very nature of the transactions themselves. Today, I was able to expand on that argument and explain in some detail the features of digital assets and the market itself which make them different from any other asset class that’s previously been regulated. This is an important point because it means there is no precedent or existing model to guide the regulatory approach.  I was also able to describe the inherent contradiction that a decentralized asset typically trades on a centralized rather than a decentralized exchange. This is unsurprising, given that with the centralized model, the individuals who are trading give up control of their assets to the exchange, who hold the assets on their behalf. But digital assets are meant to be about disintermediation — each user taking control of their own assets personally without the need for or reliance on any third party.  Added to this situation is the fact that it is the centralized exchange model on which regulatory focus has been placed. The regulatory focus has always followed the traditional pattern of putting responsibility on intermediaries. Now in a decentralized world, when you trade digital assets p2p, there are no intermediaries — so what then?  In my speech I described a number of potential scenarios — banning p2p trading (or ‘wallet to wallet’) outright, taking a light touch approach that removes any oversight, and regulation of every end user involved. Each of these has its shortcomings and a more nuanced option would seem to be the best way to go. However regulation pans out, the speed at which the industry is evolving means that within a year it’s likely that any regulatory response based on the market as it currently is will already be out of date.  Events like Finwise are important. They allow us to engage with the community and provide education to the broader public. I know for a fact that regulators the world over are acutely aware of the challenges they face and are actively working to find ways to balance the need for effective regulation with the need to encourage an industry that can bring many benefits. Our role at the OAX Foundation is to help them — and the wider community — do just that and create a safe, transparent and truly decentralized cryptocurrency ecosystem.

They organise events where community members come together to discuss the latest trends in new technologies and disruptive innovation.  We were there on behalf of OAX Foundation and able to represent their project in the conversations that took place. As you know, Enuma Technologies is the main developer on the OAX project and is helping apply blockchain technology in OAX’s decentralized exchange platform.  The event we went to focused on some of the latest ideas for a scaling solution for digital assets and was organized by Dr Patrick McCorry. He’s part of the team behind Sprites, the state channel technology that has the potential to bring industry-leading speed, high transaction volume and low cost to digital asset trading on the OAX platform.  One of the main topics debated during the workshop was how to reduce on-chain interactions by, for instance, avoiding the on-chain creation of a state channel application contract unless it’s required for a dispute. Another area of focus was routing for payment channels, and we saw two examples of routing algorithms specifically designed for payment channel networks.  On the practical side, we learnt a lot hearing about the experiences different development teams have been having with Lightning implementations, as well as updates from the Raiden development team. We also saw what is arguably the first production implementation of generic state channels from FunFair, a blockchain-focused gaming technology company.  In the off-chain ecosystem there are a number of research groups pursuing similar directions and it was great to finally have most of the groups gathered in one place to collaborate and exchange ideas. Hopefully this will also serve as a stepping stone towards standardizing some of the concepts that are important in the off-chain world. The workshop brought together the most prominent researchers and engineers working on state channels, and we were proud to be participating on behalf of OAX Foundation.  One of the best aspects of the two-day workshop was finally meeting Patrick alongside Surya Bakshi, a co-author of the PISA research that addresses the offline problem with state channels. Having been so focused recently on applying Sprites to the OAX project, it was great to finally meet them in person.  If you’d like to learn more about the workshop and see some of the highlights, feel free to watch videos of the conference talks and panel discussions on Binary District’s YouTube channel.

Please note that an application form containing all the terms and conditions for the airdrop will be made available shortly.  Rules:  1. Airdrop period: 17 July 2018 (12 am HKT) — 16 January 2019 (12 am HKT).  2. Each individual airdropped amount will be calculated by the minimum of (a) the average daily balance of the total OAX token holdings in their wallets over the above period or (b) the balance in their wallets on 16 January 2019 (12 am HKT).*  3. Only OAX tokens held in participants’ private wallets will be deemed eligible for the airdrop calculation amount.  4. Any airdropped amounts will only be made to the corresponding wallet address from which it was calculated. Airdropped amounts will not be made to any other wallets (this is the case even if multiple wallet addresses are identified in the application).  5. Participants may be required to undergo additional AML/KYC procedures conducted by OAX Foundation.  6. The official airdrop distribution date will be announced on OAX social media channels once we complete all registration verifications and calculations.  7. Eligible participants must complete all steps and input all information required in the application form and agree to our terms and conditions.  8. Please note that the airdrop will not be available to participants in certain jurisdictions for legal and regulatory reasons.  *Here’s an example of how our airdrop works. A total of 5 million tokens will be in the airdrop. Assuming there are eligible holders of 10 million tokens signed up for the airdrop period. In this case, these holders will get 1 airdrop token for every 2 tokens of average daily balance they hold during the airdrop period. So if you maintain a 10,000-token average daily balance over the airdrop period, you will get 5,000 airdrop tokens.  On the other hand, if the number of eligible sign-ups is 20 million tokens, the ratio becomes 1 token for every 4 tokens held. A 10,000-token average daily balance over the airdrop period will entitle the holder to 2,500 airdrop tokens.  For any inquries, please email us at info@oax.org.

These will be important in helping us improve during the development of our platform. Here are some common questions we have identified.   And don’t forget our feedback and bug bounty campaign! You can find the form here  Q: Is there plan to make a mobile version? A: It is being considered as part of our roadmap. Our main focus now is on building our OAX DEX Platform, by combining improved technological developments (eg. Sprites) with a strong governance framework (for example, including dispute resolution and KYC).  Q: Will the login to the exchange be possible only through Metamask? A: Apart from Metamask, we are working on supporting Trezor and Ledger. We use Metamask only for our POC, but our final product will definitely offer other options for connecting your account.  Q: OAX establishes connection with the exchange with the help of the signatures SHA-1 but similar exchange uses Sha384 in the chain. What’s the difference? A: We support a suite of ciphers to communicate between the exchange demo and the end user. SHA-1 is one of the ciphers we support, mainly for compatibility reason, which is fine for a demo. You can verify the quality of the security certificate together with the suite of ciphers used here. The servers serving the demo will use a stronger cipher if the user’s browser supports that. Users are always encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of their browser and to ensure their browser supports stronger ciphers.  Q: Will there be a possibility to choose different colour themes? A: The source code is open, anyone can modify the colour theme for themselves.  Q: Due to the tokenization of the fiat, exchanges will become more competitive. Will OAX adopt a fiat deposit and withdrawal system? A: Establishing fiat gateways remains a key part of the OAX ecosystem. We are progressing well on multiple options and will make an important announcement very soon. Please keep following our news.  Q: When the ETH network occupancy happens, what will help OAX deal with transactions and solution? The Sprite payment channel will help with that, so you only have to talk to the chain when there is a dispute. Also when opening/closing the channel, a single sprites state channel will allow unlimited number of trades.  Q: Which kind of latest technology will OAX adopt? A: OAX is using Sprites and 0x. Sprites enables on-chain scaling up the Ethereum blockchain to accommodate increasing user demands to an unlimited amount. For state channels, the speed depends on how fast the clients involved in a settlement can communicate. It should be possible to perform a trade within a second.  Q: How many transactions per second can OAX handle? Currently the POC is limited by the Ethereum blockchain tx limit. A: For our next milestone we will be using state channels to do off chain settlements. Since these settlements can be done between peers without blockchain transactions the number of transactions the DEX can perform per second will increase with the number of clients.

As we continue the work on our decentralized exchange (DEX) platform, we’re also expanding our platforms for communication and consultation with our community. Through this newsletter we will provide regular updates on the latest progress on the OAX DEX, as well as important news and developments in the industry and how it affects the OAX community.  OUR ANNIVERSARY AND OUR FIRST POC RELEASE  We are coming up to 12 months of OAX Foundation with the anniversary of our token sale this month and we are excited to announce that we are well on track with our DEX.  A lot has changed over the last 12 months, moving from our early visions of solving some of the biggest challenges facing our industry and experimenting with different technologies to solve them. We are proud to present our initial Proof of Concept, a basic DEX which offers the ability to trade ERC-20 tokens and uses aggregated order books. This will be fully released with all code for our anniversary.  This has been achieved using the 0x ordering and settlement protocol, with Whisper-based payment channels, a unique solution in that it demonstrates not only off-chain order channels with on-chain settlement (0x’s hybrid model and one of the proposed solutions to the ethereum overuse issue), but it also uses decentralized, shared order books. Here’s the video about the vision behind our project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdPKHA6buO0  WHAT’S NEXT FOR THE OAX DEX  While Phase 1 POC is exciting, to truly achieve the volumes and outcomes we want, 0x’s hybrid model just isn’t enough.  The OAX Foundation is already working hard to deploy our solution using a new technology called SPRITES. SPRITES is special because it allows us to generate fully auditable, immutable transactions which are decoupled from ethereum transaction delays. Click here for more about the amazing potential of this technology and how it could apply to our platform.  This new technology is so promising, the Ethereum Foundation recently provided two grants to our partner Enuma Technologies to further its development!

Both the traditional centralized exchange and existing decentralized exchange models have inherent weaknesses limiting their potential to service the rapidly developing digital asset market. These weaknesses are also a hindrance to widespread acceptance of tokens as an asset class. The OAX platform addresses these shortcomings whilst combining the best elements of both trading systems.  The development of the OAX platform is led by Enuma Technologies, a leading blockchain engineering firm. The current prototype utilizes the 0x Protocol for order settlement with Whisper based communication to maintain a distributed order book. This is a unique solution combining off-chain decentralized order books with on-chain settlement. However, as previously announced, the later stages of the project will focus on the deployment of Sprites. Sprites is a new blockchain technology that will create a decentralized solution combining industry-leading speed, high transaction volume and low cost.  Enuma in May was awarded a grant by the Ethereum Foundation to help further the implementation of Sprites. The OAX project will be one of Sprites’s first real-world applications.  The prototype launch comes on schedule and is now available for testing at a publicly-accessible URL. It will be refined using the Continuous Delivery engineering approach, meaning that updates and improvements will be made to the prototype continuously as the OAX development team collects feedback from the community.  OAX Foundation will announce a series of campaigns in the coming weeks to encourage the public to test and give feedback on the prototype.  Amanda Liu, General Manager of OAX Foundation, said, “The launch today of the OAX platform prototype is a significant milestone in our mission to revolutionize digital asset trading. Since we first launched the project, we have put in place the people, systems and technology that together have brought about the successful delivery of this crucial stage, on time and on budget. We remain focused on delivering greater technology and standards for the digital asset industry.”   The prototype is now accessible at the following URL: https://dex.demo.oax.org/#/   The article on Medium: https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/oax-foundation-revolutionizes-digital-asset-trading-with-launch-of-decentralized-platform-prototype-f64c78207e68  The official site: https://www.oax.org/en/",False

Firstly, we are airdropping 5,000,000 OAX Tokens to reward token holders for their commitment to the project. Secondly, there will be no token sale this year as OAX has sufficient financial resources to fund its current development program.  When is the Airdrop?  Between July 16, 2018 and Jan 15, 2019.  The airdrop will be allocated based on the level of token holdings utilizing a formula to be published shortly and which encourages commitment to the project.  We will announce the specific details and conditions very soon. Please keep following us through the website and social media channels.  What Else is Happening?  While we’re not planning any token sale this year, there are many other exciting developments surrounding the OAX project. Over the next few months, we will announce more strategic partnerships and new projects to position ourselves for the platform’s going fully-live next year.  Prior to the prototype launch, in May we announced the strengthening of our relationship with the Ethereum Foundation Grant-winning Enuma Technologies, who is leading the development of the OAX platform.  So what is the team focusing on after the prototype launch? For the project’s second phase, our development team will be busy deploying SPRITES, a new blockchain technology that will create a decentralized solution combining industry-leading speed, high transaction volume and lower cost.  We are confident that this new technology, together with our decentralized, shared order books, will help to elevate the OAX Platform to the next level, realizing the full potential and value of the project thereby maximizing the liquidity of the ecosystem.

Much of the event centred around the legal implications of new technologies, with digital assets forming one of the main topics. My session was called “Unblock the Blockchain: Explore the Legal Minefields of Cryptocurrency.”  The panel discussion was moderated by Kevin Woo, a member of the legal committee of the Hong Kong Blockchain Society. My fellow panelists included Pindar Wong, who set up Hong Kong’s first licensed internet service provider, co-founded the besafe.network and is now a member of CoinDesk’s advisory board, and Rocky Lee, the managing partner of the Silicon Valley office at King & Wood Mallesons, the law firm which sits on OAX’s Working Group. Both of my fellow panelists have international profiles as leaders in their field, so it was fascinating to debate the role of blockchain and digital assets with them.  One of the main points I made in both my speech and the panel discussion was that regulators, lawyers and the public at large need to rethink their entire approach to digital assets. Owing to the decentralized nature of both the products and market for trading, digital assets are fundamentally different from traditional asset classes and systems. I argued that because of this difference, we all need to alter fundamentally how we think about not just each particular asset, but the entire environment and infrastructure surrounding these assets.  Traditional markets focus on centralized sources for trust and validation, and the current regulatory focus mirrors that. To merely approach the new digital asset market in the same way will not be effective and will result in unsatisfactory outcomes for both the participants and regulators. It is only with a shift in mindset that digital assets will become an accepted part of the financial mainstream and bring benefits to society as a whole.  More importantly, the conference’s focus showed how seriously the world is taking the developments in blockchain and digital assets, with hundreds of lawyers keen to learn more about how they are becoming part of everyday legal work and experience. It was a welcome opportunity for us to assist with this education and to promote the shift in mindset that is required. We are confident that events like this will continue to establish our reputation as a firm closely involved in bringing digital assets into the mainstream through our focus on transparency and high governance standards.

Over the three days we saw a huge number and variety of people, ranging from potential partners to service providers to industry peers wanting to know more about our platform and the technology behind it. We were particularly pleased to see many of our token holders and see their excitement at the progress we’ve made.  Demonstrating how far we’ve come was one of the main reasons for attending the event, and as part of doing that we ran many demos with our technology partner, Enuma. The questions people asked showed how interested the industry is in our project and that we’re building something of value to it. Of most interest was the project timeline and how our decentralized exchange differs from others, as well as how people can connect to our platform.  We also used the occasion to formally announce an extension of our partnership with Enuma. If you’ve not yet read the press release, you can do so here. This generated plenty of interest, particularly as Enuma were recently awarded a grant by the Ethereum Foundation to help further the implementation of the Sprites technology that the OAX project will use. In fact, partnership was something of a theme for us at Consensus as we spoke to many organisations about potential tie-ups.  Overall, it was a fantastic opportunity to spread the word and demo the OAX project — the sheer attendance levels was one of the most impressive things about it, as well as the diversity in terms of countries and industry segments represented, and the speaker line up. Showing just how diverse and fast-paced the three days were, general manager, Amanda Liu, did a stand-up interview with iSUN-TV of China and senior advisor, William Barkshire, met with the Prime Minister of Bermuda!  Consensus was also a chance for us to get to know what others in the world of digital assets and blockchain are doing. The attendees represented the best of the best of the community. Our management will be spending the next few weeks reviewing the feedback we received and opportunities we identified, as well as everyone’s observations — particularly on other decentralized exchanges — to help inform the next stages of the project.  We’ve returned to Hong Kong full of energy and ideas for the next stages of the project. The next big event for us will be the launch of the prototype, and we’re very much looking forward to updating you on progress!

A group of us — including general manager Amanda, head of marketing Kelvin and lead developer Lio — headed to the bank’s HQ to present the OAX platform  It was a fantastic event with over 100 staff of the bank present. We got to show a demo of the platform to lots of them. We had lots of questions — some very technical and some more basic. As we had Lio from the development team with us, we were able to go into some detail about the technology behind the platform and the progress we’ve made. You can read the latest on that progress in last week’s development update.  This was also the first time we’ve been able to show off the new user interface, and feedback was really positive. Having this in place really brings the project alive for people and demonstrates the great progress we’ve made over the course of this year. Yesterday’s event was a great practice run for Consensus 2018, and as we’ve said before we’re taking every opportunity to get out there and tell the OAX story to as many different people as possible. Last week Kelvin was presenting to a group of people wanting to learn all about blockchain. Momentum is really building behind both our development and marketing activities as we get closer to Consensus, and we’re confident we’ll really make an impression at New York in May!

These have been across areas including senior level appointments to drive key functions, raising our profile at industry events and educating the wider public about digital assets and what we do. But this doesn’t mean the technology has taken a back seat. Quite the opposite — in this latest development update we’re really excited to be able to give you a first look at the user interface for the OAX platform.  During the first phase of the development, the back end obviously took priority. But recently things reached a point where we could begin the design of the front end and connect it up to the back end. What we’ve got so far is the screen that people trading tokens over the OAX platform will see (the UI for Asset Gateway owners will come next). It’s designed to be user friendly and intuitive, fitting in with our philosophy of making digital asset trading as transparent as possible.  Of course, one of the reasons for getting the UI in place is that we are promoting the project much more. We aim to have a full demo ready for Consensus next month and are looking forward to giving delegates there a tour of the project!  Putting in place the UI is also allowing us to undertake testing. A fully functioning, safe platform is obviously our aim and we will be testing it thoroughly by bringing in some expert traders to put it through its paces. We’re also making sure that it’s robust and conforms to the high governance standards we’re committed to promoting at the OAX Foundation. To that end, we are examining all procedures on the platform so that transparent and proper use is stuck to by all potential users.

Amir and our team discussed how the 0x protocol works and how it is benefiting the OAX project.  As you all know, we’re building a new type of decentralized exchange platform that gets over the shortcomings of current models. The decentralized exchanges that have already been developed have a number of issues in them, not least the limited trade volumes they can handle.  To get over this issue, and to power our decentralized exchange model with high trading liquidity, we’re applying the 0x protocol. This is an open, permissionless protocol which allows ERC20 tokens to be traded on the Ethereum blockchain. Here’s an analogy to explain how it works:  Assume that you’ve got something you want to sell. If you were just to ask around your friends on WhatsApp it might take a while to find a buyer, assuming one of your friends even wants your item in the first place. But if you were to post your offer on a public exchange platform, it would sell much more easily because of the maximized exposure it gains.  This is how smart OAX’s trading logic is — by letting someone broadcast their orders publicly on the Ethereum blockchain, the order is exposed to all the potential takers on the network, meaning the order gets filled quickly. This shared, on-chain and decentralized order book results in much higher market liquidity compared to a closed, centralized network.  At the OAX Foundation, we believe the time is right for the market to evolve from centralized exchange models to a decentralized exchange, free for all users to access and powered by the latest blockchain innovations like 0x. With the OAX project we’re creating a more orderly, transparent and efficient ecosystem for digital asset exchange.

Following last week’s appointment of Paul Li as general counsel here, we’re now welcoming Kelvin Wong to the OAX Foundation. He’s taking over from Liam Bussell who guided the marketing of the project during its launch phase and who is now moving on to other activities (though he’ll remain a part of the project team as an adviser).  Kelvin is going to lead the promotion of the OAX project and the OAX Foundation itself through the next phases of development, taking us to new audiences (including at Consensus in May here) and with new ideas. His experience makes him the ideal person to do this, having held regional and global roles in financial services, technology, communications, and journalism.  His nearly twelve-year experience at Bloomberg ranges from being deputy chief of the Hong Kong news bureau, writing reports on the greater China real estate market, to leading sales and marketing campaigns for Bloomberg’s news platform in North Asia. In this last role, he devised and executed sales plans, and spoke regularly at seminars and conferences to promote Bloomberg functionality and content.  Most recently, he worked as global media relations director for a Hong Kong-based holdings and asset management company, where he put in place structures to ensure the firm’s communications strategies were being implemented efficiently and its messages told in a clear and effective way.  This is a pretty unique combination of skills gained in very high profile organisations which will benefit the Foundation across all our marketing and communications activities.

Paul was previously in the Financial Regulation Group at Linklaters in Hong Kong. Here, he advised his clients on a wide variety of matters concerning compliance with local and international regulatory requirements, corporate transactions and the licensing of financial services businesses. He also brings with him experience of working with international regulators on investigations at both retail and institutional firms.  Transparency and governance are core parts of the OAX project. As we updated the community last week, at our recent Working Group session here, the members spent much of their time discussing approaches to anti-money laundering, know your customer and counter-terrorist financing policies. Getting the governance right in these, and all other regulatory, areas is crucial to ensuring the acceptance and successful adoption of our platform.

It's nice to see your FUD here again.  ""if you see OAX and are thinking of buying it because its green DO NOT BUY IT!"" - Everyone decides for him/herself when and what to buy.   The OAX Foundation doesn't comment on the secondary markets and doesn't force anyone to buy its tokens.  ""The devs are only here to scam you, they took the 25 million and ran and then went to another project with Hugh"" - False. Nothing to comment. Anyway you may check conversation with Hugh on the Slack couple days ago.   Just for you to better understand the project:   https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1943946.msg26265876#msg26265876  ""There has been no progress on this project and it has been on a disgusting downward spiral since the ICO (still below ICO price)."" - There is a progress. Just check Medium with last announcements, gitlab, devs journal etc. Yes, below. ""disgusting downward spiral"" - sounds poetic, but doesn't corresponds the reality. Anyway nobody from the Foundation promised the ""moon in the nearest days"". It was said many times all over all channels that this is a long-term project, the first prototype will be released in Q2 2018 etc. In fact anyone could/can read this in the WP and check in the project road map.    ""Why don't you care about the price of your token?"" - The market determines the price. Demand and proposition. The Foundation can't influence on the token price directly. Only by ideas, plans and actions. The OAX team is growing, learning and working hard on the project. As soon as the OAX perspectives and activity results will impress the market participants, investors and traders the demand will change and the OAX price will change.  ""Why don't you care about getting this token on a real exchange?"" OAX is already trading on 6 Exchanges (Binance, Liqui, AnxPRO, Etherdelta, HitBTC, Qryptos) Bitrex - ""Launching is free and at our discretion"" https://support.bittrex.com/hc/en-us/articles/202583854-Submitting-a-Coin-to-Bittrex Poloniex - ""We do not accept payment for listing. We don't have a definitive set of criteria as each project is unique."" https://poloniex.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/1000229325-how-can-i-get-a-coin-listed-on-poloniex- Both exchanges decide themselves which token and when to add. You can't influence this. Quite possibly OAX will be listed there and on many other exchanges someday. But let's don't speculate on this now. OAX Foundation was possibly one from only some token sales organizers in the summer which didn't speculate on the question of exchanges and will never do this.    ""Why are you still trying to have another ICO when the first one was a failure?"" Absolutely false. Just read my post above: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1943946.msg26486025#msg26486025  ""Where are the updates or code? It has been 6 months since ico and and all you've done is update the site!"" You can monitor the progress here: 1. Gitlab - https://gitlab.com/oax 2. Mockups - https://modao.cc/flows/InUGhKMaeHp7XgJDYv1yweIAKLJ8u0N 3.

Liam Bussell, Head of Marketing, answered you already a couple days ago:    ""OAX Team, if you want people to get faith in your token start pumping up the price and get it on a real exchange like Bittrex or Poloniex."" - Do you propose to manipulate the price?

In my view the most important success factor for decentralised exhange trading to succeed is liquidity - and banking on and   off ramps are key to that.   good news coming on that front shortly as soon as the marketing team can get the press together.  - i think the critism about lack of presence here to engage and take questions is completely valid, i'll make more time in the day to stop and and stay engaged.   we aren't really a ""hype"" team we are busy trying to engage professionals and establish the legals and banking relationships to make this work. banking and legal   partnerships are slow protracted engagements - it's not as quick as smashing out a bit of code or posting misleading ""hype"". we are trying to do this for real; which   means compliance teams and legal opinions and a long hard slog of producing what is needed to present something that allows the financial sector to engage with   an accept risk profile regards compliance an AML.  - sorry DT i have no interest in your ""weeks end"" statements etc. these sorts of relationships take months.   but all the same i can see you are thinking along the same lines as us, with regards to what is required  - our marketing team is underweight now, some some maternity leave and sickness, we are hiring. It's a hard time of year though in Dec because everyone is   waiting for their new year bonuses. but all the same yep marketing needs to ramp up again. we've been trying to knock off some of the important milestones   however so we have something to talk about  - relationships and agreements will be discussed when they are established and not before. speculation of such can only endanger in flight discussions, and so there   is no way i would ever comment.   what i can tell you is banking relationships for gateways are our number one priority, and in our view the critical success factor in all projects related to DEX.   i'm am not going to speculate. i'll debate on whether that is the right priority and strategy.  - perhaps we don't have the same view on what good news is :slightly_smiling_face:   in my view there is strong progress on all fronts, legal, structure, and technology.   i would love to be able to state the legal, entity structures, global banking partnerships are in place, but it takes time.   all i can state is there is a senior experienced team working on exactly this.   if think if you ask most projects about their headway into banking relationships, you'll hear stories of 1 and 2 year lead times just to engage with a large   international bank.   DT: all the same i appreciate your cynicism.  - do you follow on similar and related projects, focusing on banking integration with public crypto currencies and related projects ?   that would be a valuable contribution to the conversation.   there was a rumour for example that tenx was going for a banking license i believe, would be very interesting if they managed to do that.   but .. getting a banking license (i've done a project doing just that in my past) is a large undertaking in any serious jurisdiction.   my typos are atrocious :wink:   in case you mis-characteristic my comment, we are not going down that route   but point is very interested in various ways of bridging public crypto economies and legacy banking   - no problems, i should be on here more often.   cynicism is fine and healthy.

I answered almost the same questions on Telegram. Here is it.  The second ICO was initially planned on Q2 2018 WP, page 17 - https://www.openanx.org/en/assets/whitepaper/openANX_White_Paper_ENU.pdf  But there was an update in August regarding this matter: ""Due to this likely underspend; it is not clear that a second token sale will be required in 2018."" https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/oax-q4-roadmap-update-community-and-engagement-stream-9b699f668322  These tokens locked in the Contract untill the Q2 2018 and nothing can be implemented to them until then. So there is some time ahead for taking decisions.    Here is the answer from Liam Bussell, Head of marketing to this question: ""Honestly, nothing has been confirmed yet. The reason for this is that the tokens are locked in the smart contract until the time period of the second sale anyway (Q2 2018) We won’t be keeping them. There’s 3 options basically: burn, airdrop or push second sale until 2019 when the platform is live"" https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/oax-development-ama-1-transcript-a02a173ccd8b  My personal opinion is that burn and airdrop are not the best options, I'd leave these tokens locked until 2019 or possibly even longer. And then act according to the situation. A lot of things can change, a lot depends on the memberships prices and other prices on future platform. There is a deflational system should be itself - pages 22-23 in Project Deck: https://www.openanx.org/en/assets/documents/openANX_Project%20Deck_ENU.pdf  Possibly these tokens will be needed for something else in the future. So, my opinion is that there is no need in hurry. Let's wait and see. The team is adequate and I think nobody will do something for the deterioration of the situation and unregulated emissions and inflation.",False

Hopefully it will give you and the rest of the community some insight into my thinking and my expectations based off the career I have had and the people I have worked with.  Yes, that was a slam. And yes it was aggressive - I'm not happy with OAX so far. They are my observations as a business guy who has been around capital markets, hedge funds and VC funding for over 14 years plus another 11 years in strategy gigs in banking. So all up 25 years if you're counting, most of it in entrepreneurship and business building. To put some context behind this, I have personally been involved in launching and growing 8 ventures in the past 10 years. 1 was a spectacular success, 3 were a good successes, 4 failed. With our VC business, I would guesstimate 70% of our investments fail, 20% return as expected, the rest will outperform with a few outliers being huge hits. So there's a lot of learning here on what works and what doesn't and the qualities displayed by exceptional business leaders vs the rest.  I'm not sure what ""facts"" you feel I am not referencing - they are my perceptions of OAX, it's what I see in the public domain and how I interpret  it.  Before I dissect your post, let me first address your post from a branding perspective. I am afraid your response reads incredibly unprofessionally. It lacks structure, lacks poise, lacks command and control, displays defensive desperation, is combative and is rambling -  at times I don't even know who you are addressing and who you are quoting.  It simply lacks the maturity and professionalism that is expected of an A grade player looking to make a mark in this space. I couldn't imagine your blue chip partners responding like this. It's this lack of professionalism that has me doubting your capabilities as seasoned business guys and serves to confirm my opinion of the leadership team. Like I said to Hullo above, signals.  While you have been good at responding to feedback and criticism throughout this thread, to date this has only been ""soft"" pressure. With the first sign of being pushed with hard pressure this is the response we get. It's a very telling indicator of how you guys handle pressure and crisis and a good indicator of your future behaviour. This is already manifesting itself in the way the OAX project is panning out and serves to confirm prior suspicions about your execution capabilities.  Finally, can you clarify who ""shadowlpb"" exactly is? Is it an OAX employee, is it Liam, is it Hugh, is it a major investor, an advisor....? I accept you guys are trying to communicate but there's a lack of transparency with a lot of your posts. I don't spend much time on here so can't go looking through all your posting pseudonyms from OAX representatives to work out who is actually posting. Yes it's the internet but you should either personally stand behind your business or don't bother at all. This is even more pertinent given that you have taken funding from the public. Be clear in real names who is actually posting from OAX. As it stands I am just confused as to who's who and what's what with OAX.  Now to the specifics of your post.  What is the #1 reason that crypto is not mainstream right now?  I don't need convincing of the importance of banking relationships. It's a pretty obvious observation for anyone who has spent any time in capital markets. Heck you don't even need capital markets experience to grasp this, anyone with a business mind will quickly see the fiat and banking bottleneck in cryptos.   I am by no means a crypto expert but I do know the key difference between centralised and decentralised exchanges and the need for fiat currencies. I do, however, find amusing your hypothesis that Kraken, Bitfinex et al don't have (or can't maintain) banking relationships because they haven't tied up with an industry expert (a Big 4 or law firm as you assert). I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt (i.e. that you know that having a big 4 relationship is only but a small factor in your ability to build banking partnerships), but I am afraid the way you expressed this as a singular root cause problem is just plain amateurish and comical.  Even more worrying is your quote:  ""...... having real problems maintaining banking relationships. Why is that? Because when they initially launched they did not consulting industry experts. Because when they initially launched they did not consulting industry experts (Like PwC, EY and lawyers)...."".  Excuse me, but aren't you guys supposed to be the experts in crypto? Banks are turning to Fintech startups to learn this space and they are actively seeking partnerships with crypto/DLT and Fintech startups to learn about this new world and to co-develop solutions. Of course, they are incredibly selective as to who they work with but it's the banks who are actively encouraging Fintech/Crypto/DLT startup engagement and opening up invitations for partnerships. You guys are supposed to be the experts in cryptos, not the banks and most certainly not the Big 4s.  With regard to PwC and EY being the industry experts, can you point to any individual person from PwC or EY in your working group, or the firm itself, that brings in more than 1 year of experience in crypto, blockchain, DLT? I know they have deep experience in KYC/AML, governance, compliance etc advisory across BFS. This will be useful for working out how the compliance regime impacts in this new crypto trading world. But how much real world, and tangible, work have they done in the crypto space? How much real fee paying work have they done with regulators, how much real fee paying work have they done with other crypto players (compliance and/or general advisory across the crypto world)? If cryptos is too much of a stretch, then at the very least how much real world fee paying work have they done in the Fintech space? This will help to validate your assertions that you are working with crypotcurrency industry experts.  Oh, and a few PDFs, online event videos, retrospective talk about the year that was in crypto, presenting Fintech surveys, interviews with Fintech/crypto leaders etc doesn't count as real world fee paying work by PwC, EY et al. Being a commentator in an area you had no involvement in just a year or two ago doesn't all of a sudden make you an industry expert.  As to my ""useless stuff about PwC, EY and KWM"".  Having said the above, I do agree that it's a good strategy to get Big 4s and other brands on board to give validity to the project. However, my concern is your over reliance, and spruiking, of these brand names as your USP.  As it stands now you are leaning on the Big 4s for your credibility. This speaks volumes for your mentality about business growth, brand building and execution. The clear message from OAX is that you choose to buy credibility rather than invest in building your own foundational, and long lasting, credibility.  This brings me to what exactly this Big 4/KWM relationship is? Correct me if I am wrong, but as you have described it the Big 4s have merely joined your working group? I assume it's just a couple of their mid level employees, maybe a partner or a director, turning up for a monthly chit chat about regulatory issues!?!? I also assume that this is gratis, they are not formally doing any advisory work for you (re governance, risk mgt, compliance, business/ops strategy etc), they are not regulatory lobbying on your behalf, they are not introducing you to regulators, they are not opening up banking relationships en mass and they are not endorsing you to their banking clients or the market??  From all I have read, no where do I see endorsement by the Big 4s, or any other Blue Chip firm, of the OAX business or OAX leadership team. Please correct me if I am wrong on this!? And also please confirm that if I were to ask my FS partner contacts at EY and PwC in Hong Kong they will confirm that they are backing, supporting and promoting OAX?  From my experience with working groups, it's a lot of talking with very little action and follow up. No different to the many internal meetings company people bemoan on a  daily basis. For these big consultancies it just serves as a marketing avenue for them to post straight to linkedin or twitter immediately after attending with headlines like ""proud to working with the team at ...."". The big consultancies are notorious for this - every Fintech event, they're there. The simple reality is 2 years ago these Big 4s wouldn't have acknowledged you unless you wanted to pay them a fee. In 2017 though, the year of the crypto, they're all over it with no meaningful experience in this space. Who knows what latest trend they'll be chasing next year and whether they'll still be with you.  Having said that, and as mentioned above, I do think that the Big 4s, and your law firm partner, are valuable for wading through the regulatory points, setting up your governance practices, helping with KYC/AML etc . Hopefully you are using this opportunity to build your own capabilities here.  By all means if you don't have credibility yourself then feeding off their brand name is a good strategy. It's a good strategy that the masses will buy into but critical minds will see through. I would imagine your crypto audience would be made up of more of the latter personality types.   from ""Day#1""  Your comment from Day#1 doesn't fly. Day 1 was 8/9/10 months ago when you were drafting your white paper, not today. My problem is that you went out to the public, got investment in your ICO and only now are trying to work it out. Now admittedly the ICO and Crowd Funding world is different, but in my VC world businesses don't get funded off business plans or seeds of an idea for the reasons you are displaying - an unfounded team with no meaningful exits who haven't shown execution capabilities who are now meandering in the hope of hitting quick surface level wins. Not much has happened for the first few months after the ICO. All we saw was your global travelling on the ICO's dime. You are fortunate the ICO world allows fund raising without even a proof of concept. But in the VC and IPO world, only the best management teams, who have built validated business will get funding. You could have used the correct Day 1  (have all the bits and pieces in place at the time of white paper publication) to really differentiate yourself from the other ICOs out there but squandered it with a lack of a foresight into how the market will react, lack of focus, lack of speed and now a lack of transparency.  ""Why are some tokens sales/ICO's now having huge problems in terms of are they a security or not? Because they did not consult with a legal team or understand regulation.""  100% agree and this where your law firm (and also the Big 4s) can help. While I didn't out KWM specifically in my original post I did say ""the law firm you keep trotting out"" which is inferring KWM. Lumping them in with the likes of the Big 4s was wrong on my part and I apologise for that. KWM's legal expertise in unpacking new products and their applicability to existing laws (and how laws need to change) can, and will, add significant value for you and the industry as a whole. I hope this is successful partnership for you.  Who is blockbonds?  No I didn't look them up. Why? There are far too many of these cyrpto startups coming and going on an almost a daily basis. A lot of fakes, a lot of frauds, a lot of incompetence and a lot of companies with simply nothing to add. I didn't criticise them but asked who they are. As your credibility is already low in my eyes, I am not going to assume that the startups you are working with are all A grade game changers.  I notice that you did not reference NetKi or Trusted Key, our other Working Group members. The reason for that is they are both legitimate, well respected industry leaders?  As with Blackbonds.  And once again, a comical, amateurish and just plain immature response. I ignored them because I realised they were legit and well respected!!! Really - I'm really not sure of your logic behind that conclusion!  We don't use Steemit  I don't know about this but some of the posts on Steemit read like they could be coming from OAX, or someone associated with OAX. They certainly do read incredibly positive and glowing of OAX. As mentioned, with all the posting pseudonyms you guys use I really don't know who's who and what's what. If they genuinely aren't your posts then that's fine but it is your job to be on top of and monitor your social media mentions. Steemit (along with Medium) is probably the site that has the largest collection of articles about OAX. It just reads strange when you flat out say that you don't use Steemit yet don't acknowledge, or maybe realise, that a lot of OAX info for your investors most likely came from Steemit articles.  On the prototype. I think that we communicated clearly from Day#1 the timeline for delivery. Apple puts out a phone every year, so a year seems a reasonable timeframe .....  Not arguing with you on this. My concern is here is your use of ICO funds to build a prototype. Yes I do realise the way of the ICO and Crowd Funding world vs the traditional funding world i.e. fund to produce vs funding off production. My point here is two fold. Firstly, this was an opportunity to differentiate yourself from the rest of the ICOs )(i.e. actually show something tangible at white paper time, at 2 weeks, at 4 weeks etc). Secondly, it's very naive of you, and shows lack of business experience, to think that you can say Q2 2018 and expect the market to keep quiet until then.  Oh and don't compare yourself to Apple. You just sound like amateurs. Apple is a hardware manufacturer that embeds software capabilities into a vast API and App ecosystem. They have an incredibly complex global supply chain, operations, logistics and vendor ecosystem made up of independent contractors and vendors that need to tie into a global hardware and software ecosystem. Their business model and  ecosystem is in orders of magnitude more complex than anything OAX is building.  The ventures I have been involved in and the startups we fund through our VC business are all software and tech companies. None of them take anywhere near the time you think is necessary to build a prototype. Admittedly, I don't spend my days looking at just crypto exchanges, but from what I have gathered, it looks like your crypto exchange competitors also don't require the time to build working models that you think you need, let alone do they need to go through an ICO to do it.",False

Googling I could only find a few 2 references about Will's association with OAX. Looks like he's a seasoned guy in building out non crypto markets exchanges. What does he actually do for you, is he an employee of OAX, is he an advisor, is he a board member, is he in the working group? Please advise, his LinkedIn doesn't anything about OAX at today's date - I assume his relationship with you is via one of his other companies. He looks like a great asset to your team and we look forward to hearing his thoughts on, and his endorsement of, OAX.  Now - Amanda L??? Again - why the lack of transparency? You can't even give a surname for Amanda!! And what does veteran of the banking industry mean? What exactly did she do previously, what exactly does she do for you now and how does her prior banking experience help you? As mentioned in my original post re David Tee (CFO? Legal Head?), be clear on who your leadership team is and what they do. Don't give some some hazy, unable to be fact checked, description of their background. Why is this important? Investor confidence - triply so given the cowboys coming and going in the ICO world. If you take funding from the public expect to give full and complete disclosure of who your leadership team is and what they do.  Even more disappointing - it now turns out that all along you have a GM looking after OAX! Yet all this time we neither heard anything of it nor heard anything from her. The first we hear of this Amanda L is now (I am assuming she didn't join OAX in the past week)!  So now we can assume it's not just Hugh pulling the strings but also this Amanda L. The last I heard a GM is a business leader, a key decision maker and a key public face of the company. Yet somehow, all this time we have heard nothing from her and have heard nothing from you about her. Given her storied background in banking I am amazed you didn't roll her out earlier to improve your waning investor confidence.  If you have a press release or have mentioned her elsewhere previously, please do let us know.  Finally, you have a habit of jumping to nonsensical conclusions. So to be patently explicit with you - the above comments are not attacks on the individuals, they are commentaries on OAX's leadership team and their inability to display sound business logic.  Also, you are totally mistaken, we are not a marketing driven project, we are delivery focused project. If we were marketing driven, I would hire 10 guys in India to manipulate the price, Good to hear but I am not seeing it.  Your missing my point. Marketing is critical, it is expected, you need it. You're just not doing a very good job of it. I can see the effort but you're missing the mark. I'm not here to write you a marketing strategy, that's something you need to work out.  Your short term token price is not relevant to me as a professional investor. I have been around long enough not to buy into market valuations which bare little correlation to fundamentals. Like I said a number of times, I am not accusing you of scamming or fraud. My concern is your lack of business and commercial sense and the lack of maturity coming from OAX. Frankly it's all just looking rather amateurish right now - your posts are reading liking 15 year olds rather than seasoned business leaders.  I would ask what specific examples you see of a lack of business judgement? Just curious.  See my above posts. This is just from what I have publicly seen. I shudder to think of the terribly bad business practices that may be happening behind closed doors.",False

Thought I'd jump in and provide some info. In terms of dispute resolution, the mechanism is looking pretty straightforward. Each Asset Gateway will post some ETH to a smart contract (the exact amount if up to them, there will be some guidelines based on volume) then if while you are trading with them, they fail to pay, or are hacked or suffer an IT failure etc, the end user (you guys) can use an automated process (think something like an online form) to submit your grievance. Once the evidence is evaluated, the amount you are owed will be released (likely to the same address that you used for the payment - for ID confirmation)  So the ETH collateral is there to protect users. At this stage we are not confirmed which resolution body we will lock in ( or more than one) but HK or SG based resolution bodies are being considered first.",False

This is Liam.  I use this name on all our channels. I appreciate the time you spend writing this out, you feel pretty strongly about it and that's understandable.  First, I will answer you as best I can, but I shall not be posting a page and a half over here. I'll try to keep it short.  #1 - Let's skip the personal attacks, they serve no purpose.  #2 - Apologies if you thought my answer was terrible. I answered on my phone because I thought it was important to respond sooner rather than waiting until I was back in the office.  #3 - You've talked up your experience and cast suspicion on the use of alias' then done the same yourself. I doubt I'll find ""Zigerat"" on LinkedIn. So, let's just agree that it's pretty common practice to use names on the internet and it neither reflects badly on us or you.  #4 - We don't use Steemit. We post our updates via official channels. Here, Medium and Twitter + website. I cannot control what's posted on Steemit. If it's good it's probably because someone likes what we are trying to do.  #5 - Many new ventures fail, yes. We are working hard to deliver a project that works and is viable. If 70% of ICO's fail to deliver (As per your number quoted above) we plan to be in the 30%.  #6 - RE: Advisors. We do not need PwC and EY for their crypto expertise, but instead for their KYC, complaince and goverance expertise. As for your question about ""If I ask my contacts"" sure, feel free. Or you could just read what we have put out on our official channels.  ""PwC Hong Kong, adviser to the Foundation with respect to governance, risk management and internal control matters"" - Yes, PwC is engaged.  ""EY, adviser to the Foundation in relation to taxation and accountancy matters; "" - Yes, EY is engaged.  You can see this info out in the wild here http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/oax-foundation-launches-digital-asset-industry-working-group-in-hong-kong-657655343.html  Do all members of these companies know our project and are they actively promoting us? of course not.  As you know both these organizations are huge and have many departments and thousands of employees. Do the relevant Partners there know who we are? Yes. I don't have permission to post the name of the partner here and I'd rather not upset them, if you want his name, PM me. I can tell you that apart from the Working Group he was in our lobby the other day buying Bitcoin for his kids through ANX.  #7 - As for ""no meaningful exits etc."" Hugh, Ken and Dave are pretty well known in the space. Dave was on Bloomberg the other day, invited back because he predicted (accurately) the Bitcoin price 6 months ago. I'm not claiming any special powers, but they have a track record of building businesses.  They have a successful business in ANX that has in the ballpark of 20 corporate clients for their exchange platforms, they founded Octagon Strategy - Asia's largest crypto OTC desk, to name a few of their businesses.  #8 - Blockbonds, Trusted Key and Netki - You did no looking at all but just assumed they were crap/fake or ""something"". If you were back in your VC days and that was the level of due diligence a junior analyst displayed, how would you react? Your question showed you hadn't looked, so I treated it as such.  Sorry if you thought my answer was immature. A quick Google search will show Justin Newton sits on panels at Consensus and is consider pretty legitimate in the field of Blockchain KYC. As is Pradesh at Trusted Key, and Blockbonds have agreements signed with a number of banks worldwide, this is all info in the public domain.  #9 - (I think this is the last one) I wasn't comparing us to Apple. I was communicating that a 1 year development time is not unreasonable.  Did we communicate that during the sale? Yes.  Do we have code updates, a roadmap and have we met the milestones we established? Yes  Is the price down? Yes, but as we have said from Day #1, we do not speculate on secondary markets. The reason for this is because a project could go like Tezos or have channels filled with speculation and pump and dumps, but where are they in terms of delivering a project now? We are focused on doing the work. Could the market for OAX be better? Certainly. It's a shame, but as we get closer to an exchange with a working Asset Gateway and a banking aligned channel to bring fiat in/out, we think people will begin to pay attention.  I hope that helps answer some of your questions.",False

The guy you are replying to has no responsibility here, you do.  And I agree with him that the lack of transparency is seriously worrying. You do not mention this ""Amanda L"". Who is she? I also have not heard anything about her, and I did a fair bit of due diligence before investing. She was not listed on the Team page or in the whitepaper, and now you are saying she is acting general manager?   As you know both these organizations are huge and have many departments and thousands of employees. Do the relevant Partners there know who we are? Yes. I don't have permission to post the name of the partner here and I'd rather not upset them, if you want his name, PM me. I can tell you that apart from the Working Group he was in our lobby the other day buying Bitcoin for his kids through ANX.  You can probably justify the inclusion of every individual in the original marketing campaign. However, I agree with the general message - at ICO time, you guys showed a huge team of people, all smiling wearing OAX t-shirts. Now all of that has disappeared, and it's just 4 guys making 1 or 2 minor commits to Gitlab each day. Not knocking those guys at all - I've inspected the code and I have no problem with their work. But what about the (literally) dozens of other people? Why do we not get any kind of basic update of what they're working on?  Some rough numbers. You can get a decent dev for $100k p/a. A good dev for for $150k p/a. Let's be generous with overheads and take that to $250k p/a. I only see activity from 4 devs, that puts you at $1m per year development, inc overheads. Let's say you go behind schedule and it takes 3 years, and you ramp your development up 50% in the final year. That still only puts your total dev costs at $4m.  What did you raise? $18m? And that's not including your significant token reserves (partially earmarked for development in the whitepaper).  Development is obviously not the only expense, but $4m out of $18m is a very small proportion, and that's being overly generous in my calculations. Where am I going wrong with this estimate?  Let's be realistic - this is not VC funding, I do not expect the same level of reporting you would give for that. But I expect maybe 10% of that level of reporting to the investors (the general public essentially), and at the moment we actually get more like 0.5%.",False

Good to know it's you. Disappointing though to see that Hugh still hasn't the temerity to address the community.  Re your comments:  #1. None intended. I do have high expectations and can be scathing in my assessment but none of it is said with malice.  #2. It took a week to respond so I'm not sure about the sooner rather than later comment. I understand you are on the road. But if it were me and an issue of importance came up I would ditch the phone and get on a full screen to carefully craft a deeply considered response.  #3. Correct, I am posting anonymously. I am not an activist shareholder. I am not an industry representative.  I haven't gone out to the public making promises on what I can deliver and I haven't raised funding off the back of these promises.  I am yet to come across a public, IPO'ing, crowd funded company that doesn't have full disclosure on its management team. This doesn't mean all your employees, just the senior representative leaders.  Internet pseudonyms are fine but just make it clear who's who. And for all your leadership people on your masthead, webpage, whitepaper etc complete, fact checkable information about who they are, what they have done, what they will do at OAX. And only include those actually involved in OAX (If Dave and Ken aren't involved on a daily basis please remove them from the leadership team).  #4. That's fine. Good to hear independent views, supporters and detractors alike.  #5. Good to hear. Hope you guys pull through.  #6. Again, good to hear. Like I said my concern here is your messages seem to be coat tailing off their brand names for credibility rather than attempting to build your foundational, and long lasting, creditability.  We use EY, HK for our tax structuring so most likely may be dealing with the same tax FS partners. They are good, as is PWC, HK for compliance. Just please don't say you are using JL at EY.  #7. Agreed, ANX seems to be doing well as a collective. But we don't hear or see from Dave or Ken re OAX (if they are in fact involved at all or just backers).  Prior success is a good indicator of future success but not always so - we need to be careful of falling into the trap of fundamental attribution error. I have learnt very quickly that a lot of our success has to do with environmental factors, I would be grossly misguided and simply a fool if I thought my successes were just down to me.  It looks like Hugh is the only one from ANX actively working on OAX. So far I am seeing good ideas, good understanding of the crypto and capital markets issues and a good general view on what OAX should be. But this is what hit paper and has run it's course. Since then we have seen no development or evolution of these ideas and have seen very poor execution and even poorer leadership abilities. He may have done well with Ken and Dave on his wings at ANX but as a solo attempt he is scoring very low.  #8. Again, at no point did I call them out as fakes or frauds. Please reread my posts.  Well I did make a comment that may be interpreted as me inferring they are crap. But as I already clarified to you, if OAX has built no credibility in my eyes I am not going to assume that the startups you are working with are ground beaking trail blazers who will lead the way in cryptos.  To your point on our VC busines. As a VC we get thousands of proposal a year. 90% of these won't get to first screening. For the ones we do look at in detail or choose to invest in, we most certainly do not go through the minutia of partnership, supply contracts, vendor relationships etc (unless it's a pivotal contract/relationship that their business is dependent on). Plainly and simply - we invest in management teams and execution capabilities. The product and business space is ancillary (as long it's a growth area) as are the fine details of all their partnerships. Our dude diligence is on the management team not the contracts. As long as they are showing extraordinary month on month growth and have a clear path to commerialisation, all that matters is the strength of the leadership team to prove that a. it wasn't a fluke and b. that the management team can repeat the success. I strongly suggest you read up on how the VC investment world works before commenting.  #9. We will have to differ on this. If you were a slow, lumbering incumbent MNC bank then 1 year is a fantastic time frame. But if you're a hyper speed startup looking to disrupt the face FS and capital markets then 1 year just luxurious.  And one final point - where the heck is Hugh? This guy is supposed to be CEO and he has all but disappeared leaving it to others to sort out the mess he has created.   Anyway Liam thanks for your response. I understand the pressure you may be under and feel for you on this. Balancing the community with the business and OAX leadership is not an easy thing to do.  ",False

I don't spend much time on this forum so haven't built credibility here but have spent the last 14 years working in capital markets and hedge funds, including working with a team on the launch of two FX trading businesses, both of which were globally scaled with one being bought out to the tune of U$225m. I'd like to think I know a thing or two about growing businesses.  Similarly, don't let OAX's postings fool you. To be clear I am not saying these guys are scamming (I actually think these guys are trying) but what they have done so far doesn't add any value in the context of the greater picture and what they have delivered is nothing short of a joke. Their messages haven't really given any great insight. Marketing and PR is just too easy nowadays, it's too easy to build smoke and mirrors - heck I know nobodies  who have built a career off social media and networking site postings but who have nothing to show for it except for their own proselytising of who they want to be.

I'm not sure what involvement the other ANX team members have (Ken, Dave, Jehan, ) but it appears they are just figureheads trotted out on the webpage - I haven't heard any comments from them about OAX. The other David just seems like a complete mystery - very opaque for such a fancy background. They have some good advisors on board but a very young, very untested and dare I say probably very cheap tech team. Since the white paper, I am seeing lack of business judgement and business sense in rolling out and managing the OAX business. If this was a regular IPO, the investors wouldn't be happy. like I said, actually think these guys are trying but their lack of competence as seasoned business guys is jeopardising this project. Honestly, I would be happy if they got rid of the existing leadership team and brought on some industry and business heavy hitters to salvage this dog with fleas.",False

This seems to be a slam, but then it's not even referencing fact in some areas, but I will do my best to address it.  What is the #1 reason that crypto is not mainstream right now? Because of banking. Even large exchanges like Kraken and Bitfinex and Gatecoin are having real problems maintaining banking relationships. Why is that? Because when they initially launched they did not consulting industry experts (Like PwC, EY and lawyers) and hence they are now having real issues maintaining effective relationships. If you want to build a solid foundation of these relationships, you need to start from Day#1.   If you want proof of this, consider that the only thing growing faster than the cryptomarket right now is the Tether market. (It is up 100x in the last 12-18 months) Again, why? Because it is the only channel for moving USD/fiat between crypto only exchanges. Even with a $31 million dollar hack it is still booming. Lots of exchanges cannot get banking so using Tether allows them to at least peg to the USD.  ""Why do you post useless stuff about PwC, EY and KWM (our lawyers)?""  In response I ask ""Why are some tokens sales/ICO's now having huge problems in terms of are they a security or not? Because they did not consult with a legal team or understand regulation.""  Also, if you want us to use best practice in terms of managing the money we raised, ensuring a governance structure that is fair, impartial and recognises token holders, best to bring in some experts.  Who is blockbonds? Did you read the website? https://blockbonds.io/ They have legitimate banking relationships in a number of countries, including the Philipines and Africa. If you are considering using crypto as a valid means of providing value to millions of people who do not yet access these markets, working with a firm with relationships and expertise in these markets seems wise.  I notice that you did not reference NetKi or Trusted Key, our other Working Group members. The reason for that is they are both legitimate, well respected industry leaders?  If you intend to build a decentralised platform that is different than the dozen other DEX platforms (EtherDelta, Bitshares, Bitsquare, 0x, District 0x, Waves, LocalBitcoins)you need to offer something new. In our case, this is to handle fiat, and provide consumer protection. To handle fiat you require KYC/AML, as KYC/AML are the basic level of compliance required from banks before they will do business with any organisation. Who are experts on KYC/AML, companies like KWM, EY, PwC, Trusted Key,Netki and Blockbonds.  You referenced Steemit, we don't use Steemit. We do use Gitlab. You can Google our code base over there.  On the prototype. I think that we communicated clearly from Day#1 the timeline for delivery. Apple puts out a phone every year, so a year seems a reasonable timeframe and again, was communicated clearly during the sale. We may be early, we may hit an overrun. At this stage we are on time.  Hope this helps  Edit: Grammar and tone.",False

Sorry but when you have a budget of tens of millions of dollars, you can afford to do a lot more than this - there is no reason why they shouldn't be holding webinars, Q&As, posting guides, running questionnaires, surveys, etc every single week. They have the budget to do it but they do not seem to understand the importance of maintaining a community.  There is no OAX community right now. If the proof-of-concept was launched tomorrow, it would be pointless because it wouldn't gather any interest. Unless they have a huge list of partners that have signed contracts already (unlikely without a proof-of-concept), then they need public interest to be able to implement their solution in useful scenarios.

It's hard to not agree to some of your points. But I'd say that quite a lot of is being done in the question of the building the community. And the most interesting and important is still ahead.  What have been done just during some last weeks:  1. There was an AMA a month ago on Slack, quite long and detailed, devs answered a lot of questions. You may check transcript, English and RU-language versions: https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/oax-development-ama-1-transcript-a02a173ccd8b https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/oax-dev-ama-1-full-transcript-in-russian-faf55d9b29df  2. Hugh Madden and leading Devs visited Devcon3 in Mexico (it's not a ""low-key conferences"", it seems). Some words from @onetom, OAX core developer about results: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1943946.msg24172425#msg24172425  3. Liam was in Moscow this week, by the way it's one of the serious blockchain conferenses in Russia, organized by well-known and respectable company. And OAX was one of the sponsors of the event. You can check slides from the Liam's presentation, in English and Russian: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1___aDei2EcQt2zh0d1cjlkojnKxX3PTV2HEI7TMaQC0/edit?usp=sharing https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L2-J2i6563LeNIjTdaKxxQtLMUJ5_1-N1nU7RI34BG0/edit?usp=sharing  4. We reorganized, optimized and improved the Bounty program this month. And will develop it in all directions to the highest levels. To get maximum engagement and involvement of people to the community.   We launched pages and profiles at all possible networks and working on developing these social properties. OAX Bounty rules, En original and RU-translation: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1947373.0 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1949131.msg24466654#msg24466654  ""There is no OAX community right now"" - It exist and it grows. It's unique. And one day the OAX community will be one of the largest and influential in the sphere. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1947373.msg24387463#msg24387463  ""If the proof-of-concept was launched tomorrow"" - It will not be launched tomorrow.      ""Sorry but when you have a budget of tens of millions of dollars"" - no need to overspend money. Especially on this stage. OAX Foundation is trying to count every OAX and every ETH collected. You and any investor and supporter of the project can be sure that the funds will be spent wisely.    ""Unless they have a huge list of partners that have signed contracts already"" It's hard to say about the number to the moment, but the quality of the partners and advisors is on the highest level, PWC, EY etc. https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/oax-foundation-launches-digital-asset-industry-working-group-in-hong-kong-f63f3ca5e8a7  ""holding webinars, Q&As, posting guides, running questionnaires, surveys"" - you're right. This and a lot of other things are ahead in the volume which will correspond the current situation and objective demands.  OAX Devs and marketing team are working hard. A lot of useful is being done right now and a lot of usual and original activities as i already said are ahead.  Thanks for the constructive criticism and I hope that answered some your questions.  p.s. Welcome to the Bounty program",False

I'm really wondering whether this is a legit ICO:  - Rehashing your same small talk at conferences - maybe the ICO was to fund your holidays in exotic locales. Hugh seems to be doing nothing more than pimping himself globally whenever he gets a chance but never seems to add anything new let alone talk about OAX developments (harsh comment I know but your conference appearances aren't adding value to OAX); - enlisting the likes of EY and PWC and the law firm you keep trotting out - those that don't have their own product or execution capabilities partner with these guys, at best they're marketing firms - they'll be whatever you want them to be (Strategy& anyone!!), whatever the latest trend is they'll be there pretending to be ""experts""; - Who is this Blockbonds mob - just another of the thousands of crypto startups with a pipe dream but have yet to deliver anything?? - This thread is your only community - made up a few people playing nice in a hope to get some of their money back from ICO. Your Reddit is a ghost town, any other mentions of OAX gets no response. You are, for all intents and purposes, forgotten outside of this thread unless you have info that can shed a different light??? - 5 months after the ICO and all you have got is your Slack AMA and more marketing drivel on steemit about what you have done but can't show for. Oh yeah we got a UI screenshot last week, some random pictures of your spartan team and some 280p videos. Lol - reminds of the guy who posts a wedding speech picture on his linkedin profile to give the impression he's an intl speaker. - 1 year from ICO and white paper to build a prototype?? Really, what half serious tech company takes that long to build a prototype. Speed is the USP of any tech company yet somehow you guys think 1 year cuts the mustard. Speed is the basis of digital disruption, your competitors seem to get it but you guys don't.  Even if you do get a prototype out, you have no one left interested in you to test it. - ""No need to overspend"" - WTF!!! R&D spend is the biggest spend for any half decent tech company. Pay peanuts, get monkeys, don't spend on your team and leaders to build the product and you will deliver some half baked solution, if at all.  I would love to hear your anecdotes of all the great tech disruptors who took their jolly time on product development and partnered with the likes of PwC and EY to change the world.  Really I have been watching this thread and just had to respond to the sheer ridiculousness of your responses, this one takes the cake. I really don't know what you guys are playing at. I look at ANX and think well ok these guys seem to have built a decent business. But I look at OAX and can't help but think of the sheer lack of business sense. You seem to have a great idea with OAX but so far have failed miserably at delivering on it. The idea deosn't make the business. You guys really need to rethink your leadership team, your business case and your ability to deliver because as it stands right now it's looking pretty damn miserable. And no, standing behind your hopelessly inadequate white paper and product road map doesn't cut it, you need to start delivering a product and delivering on the business model.",False

When the lowest sell order is at ~0.0014 price, then there is quite a big margin between buy and sell orders. So it does not make sense that someone would wait for the buy order to increase such a small amount, and then within 10 seconds of the buy order appearing to match it.  Of course, if it happens a few times, it is not suspicious but it is happening on almost every trade. Take a look at the last trades:  https://i.imgur.com/lcjSHhH.png  Every single one below 200 OAX, and an immediate sell as soon as a small buy order appears just above the buy price.  BTW, I am not blaming OAX here. It could be price manipulation from bagholders, or something suspicious on Binance.

Liam: Honestly, nothing has been confirmed yet. The reason for this is that the tokens are locked in the smart contract until the time period of the second sale anyway (Q2 2018). We won’t be keeping them. There’s 3 options basically: burn, airdrop or push second sale until 2019 when the platform is live. We thought a lot about how it would look if we announced any of these things while price was fluctuating, and we weren’t sure it would look good for the project, so as we were unsure, we waited.

It’s not just the reaction to the ICO bubble, or China crackdown, but a larger question around governments and banks are looking at the cryptocurrency market and seeing warning signs of speculation, overheating and the ever present worry about KYC and money laundering.  Fair enough too, is what I think. A writer I respect, BitCrypto’ed coined a new term the other day. In the current climate, blockchain projects that want to be sustainable and integrate with traditional financial markets need to be TAF.  At OAX, we’ve been thinking a lot about this, which is why as we recruit for our Working Group we are talking to payments companies and KYC experts alongside potential Asset Gateways, and why we have prioritized a KYC/AML compliant fiat asset token as the first piece of the wider infrastructure puzzle we are trying to solve.  We think the time has come for the industry to take some steps on it’s own to grow up and put on it’s “Big Boy” pants.

Do you care that people lost money in OAX? Any single person who invested in your ICO has half their money.

They always said there wouldn't be anything to show before 2018, so you basically made a seed stage venture capital investment. Start crying when they fail to deliver until the end of 2018, and even then, VC always has a chance of total failure, so get over it. Of the many projects I'm currently invested in, most are still trading around or below ICO price, the few that lifted off totally make up for that though and the others just have to release an actual product first.

Irwin is correct, the code is not the hardest part. The platform aims to solve a few issues with launch. 1) Fiat onto the blockchain via Asset Gateways (a rising tide floats all boats) this means we need a KYC/AML token (like Tether but not suspect) the easy part with this is the token issuance, the hard part is the legal compliance in multiple jurisdictions. 2) Adding transparency to the whole token issuance process, for more on this, read this blog (not ours) https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/a-response-to-tether-releasing-their-prior-audits-cceab8989c70 3) Protection for people who get compromised by an Asset Gateway issue (hack, scam etc)  So, the legal and regulatory is hard. The code is also difficult, but half our developers have been working for a business that has deployed 23 exchanges ""out of the box"" in the last 4.5 years, so we have a headstart on that.  The other challenge is recruiting reputable members for the Working Group, who will become the first round of Asset Gateways and KYC providers, but we are moving ahead on this too.  Hope that helps",False

Let's respect each other. And please don't shout. Everyone can understand your message without bold and red.   Regarding the participation in the Bounty campaign in general - all the Rules clearly described in the Bounty ANN. ""If you send us a submission for this bounty program, you are agreeing to these terms. If you do not want to agree with these terms, do not send us any submissions or otherwise participate in this bounty program.""  pinkman12345, thank you for your thoughts. We're analysing the current situation. ""OAX will not let a hero member get more than 120$ at this price."" - as i can calculate, Hero will get 400+ OAX per month in September campaign, it's almost $170 today, not $120 as you said. And can be x2 tomorrow or x10 in a year. About stakes, would you like to participate in the campaign with determined budget and not determined number of participants? Stakes in this case can mean that you don't know the final amount you'll earn and your reward can be unexpectally low at the finish. Fixed prices have its own benefits. Of course a lot of depends on the market, it's unpredictable, especially these days. Also imagine the reverse situation, price of a token grew relatively the moment when you joined the campaign. Will you ask to decrease your reward in this case?  Thanks z0n0, ug2017351feig, your opinion have right to exist and definitely was heard.  Thank you all who participate in the OAX bounty campaign, you're valuable and respectable members of the community and I'm sure we'll always find a common language. p.s. Let's discuss bounty related questions at the according thread.  ",False

If you guys, who are investors, do not like real non-marketing, non fancy things why are you investing in general.  Investing should be a serious thing.   At least me, usually invest in the projects that I understand and  they have solid business plan.   I understand the value of decentralized exchanges and there is no guarantee of the winner on the venue.  Ox project has higher secondary market price in term of difference between current price and ICO price.  https://0xproject.com/  for me the most important is that team member pay attention into on going project -- instead of marketing or keeping investor happy -- especially once there is not ready product.  both issuers OAX and 0x have already raised their funds on their emission.  It does not matter  for them what is the price on the secondary market --  other than --  if the secondary market price is very low the issuer could purchase their token back on the open market and burn them  or  on the other hand if the secondary market price is very high, the issuer can sell  such kind of token that they have left unsold on their initial emission.    I am not marketing person, I am just interested in the project and the planned product. in this case de-centralized market place without middlemen.  I am not paying a premium of 0x , because of fancy communication, proper maintaining public relations.  For me most important in good product  and  in the end of the game  the fact is that is the product is good enough will lead the situation in which the product  will not need any professional marketers marketing efforts else than minimal amount.   Existing users of the product will recommend the product to others. I always count on more friends more than sales persons.

There is no inspiration or community with OpenANX and you have failed to inspire attention and people to invest. If you want people to draw to this project please do not bore them with legal or technical jargon. People interested in ANX want to see some development, not pictures of Hugh shaking hands and burning through your funds traveling/visiting other countries. Your team needs vision and actual milestones, not a flowery roadmap. We need specific commitments:  For example:  In Q4 we will achieve X In Q1 2018 we will specifically achieve Y By June the project will be released.  We need to see specific milestones (technically) being reached for anyone to feel this project is still current and that the 20 million raised was not in error.  It is not too late to turn things around but they require some big steps:   1) Getting your coins on more exchanges and being transparent with this. 2) Showing what you will actually achieve and the what you plan on coding and or showing the code from ANX Intl as a base (so this doesn't appear to be an empty vaporware project). 3) Being live, active, and energetic on social media. Please look at how blocksafe approaches its twitter and bitcointalk forums. Study communities like NEO and Dogecoin to see how they generate hype. As an example, when Mysterium went silent for a month people felt it was a scam, so the CEO was pressured to release a statement, be more active online, and post pictures of development etc...Even the best coins with best fundamentals will die without active marketing. Your marketing team is slow and feels like a regulatory, boring, old company at best. Cryptocurrency is fast paced and lives off momentum, not stagnation. 4) Show the world what type of value OpenANX can bring. You keep stating this coin will be beneficial because we'll all be hurting when an exchange gets hacked and takes our funds. However, I'd rather risk an exchange holding my funds, than an exchange that doesn't exist at all holding my funds (aka OAX has no working product).   Hugh, Liam etc... you may not care about the price of OAX, but when this coin goes to 1 cent and no one wants to buy it because it is on no exchanges what's the point of even developing it? You do realize if this project fails to inspire investor confidence, it will bleed over to ANX international and hurt your major brand, right? Why would you advertise OAX on the front page of ANX international if people don't think this is a good project? And how people think this is a good project is through investor confidence, aka a product and a higher marketcap. Don't act like the price is irrelevant, you raised funds for a reason and people invested in your coin for a reason. This isn't a charity or an open-source grassroots coin. You raised 20 million and now you are responsible to create a business out of it.",False

Strange choice of name for a token sale backer. I understand your frustration, really I do. However, I feel we have been nothing but transparent. We have posted updates in terms of our roadmap, and how this will progress in the next 4 months until the end of the year. At this stage it looks like we will have something early rather than late, but I can't guarantee this so we are still following the roadmap as published.To answer your questions one at a time  1) We have said we cannot speculate on exchanges from day one. The reason for this should be pretty clear based on recent developments in China. We want to be a successful long term business, and to do that we must be responsible and in line with regulation. To not do that, or to ride the hype train would be irresponsible 2) We have posted user journey's on Slack, code updates on GitHub for KYC/AML tokens, which should show that our first step is to get asset gateways in place from Day #1. We won't simply push out a product that doesn't have these systems in place. One of the great benefits of the OAX project is the asset gateways and fiat channels. The ecosystem needs them to work, so we will have them from the start. 3) We have never been silent, I can understand that we can certainly improve, and we'll try to do that, but we are here every day. We are looking at doing an AMA in the next two weeks on Slack with Hugh and some of the developers. We are moving, obviously just not as fast as some people would like. We cannot predict things like the changes in China, or Korea, or other markets. 4) We were clear from the beginning what the timeline was. I'm not sure what we are getting at here.  In addition, the good news we have given you have ignored. The fact that we are in good financial health and don't need a second token sale in 2018 is surely a good thing? As I mentioned on the Slack channel we are still considering the best way to approach what that means in terms of the remaining tokens. We will update you when we have made a decision.  In closing, I do understand that you are frustrated. We are working hard to deliver a great project. If you have specific questions about the project, I'll be happy to try and answer them",False

It wasn't much but it was at least something and it got people taking. Otherwise what are we supposed to do with these OAX tokens for 9 or so months besides gamble them on Liquidity or Binance?

We have a firm outline of the deliverables and work has commenced. Below is the first of 3 blog posts that outline the “3 pillars” of the OAX roadmap — Technology, Regulatory and Community. We will cover these 3 concepts in a series of 3 blog posts this week.  The charter for the OAX project is to deliver the technology, legal framework, and ecosystem to ultimately replicate the functionality of the current centralised model for trading of Ethereum assets. The objective is to introduce decentralised digital assets with bridging and accessibility to traditional payment systems and fiat currencies.  An initial engineering delivery team has been engaged and further announcements will be made in the next two weeks regarding the specifics of this.  The immediate focus of the team is as follows: Delivery of a working off-chain, collateralised token framework; governance framework and upgrades procedure for the platform; development of an integrated system for KYC/AML/compliance related to these tokens; adoption of proposals of an industry standard approach for each of the above by means of an Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC); delivery of an integrated platform through which the OAX tokens can be redeemed for memberships; delivery of a dispute resolution framework system; a reference API and UI to interact with the platform  The project team believes the rapid scaling of the engineering team will slow project velocity overall; the staffing strategy is to initially gain momentum with a small experienced team to lay the underlying data and architectural building blocks. After this the engineering team can be scaled to allow additional delivery velocity.

OAX Project Statement — Evolving Regulation We have received questions from the community about recent regulatory announcements in China, South Korea and other markets regarding ICO/Token Sale projects. OAX and the Foundation welcome regulation, as it aims to remove uncertainty from the market and is the first necessary step toward legitimacy for the cryptocurrency space. The Open ANX Foundation is a non profit entity incorporated in Hong Kong, and was advised by several legal firms; for example: KWM | KWM advises on Hong Kong's first cryptographic token sale  King & Wood Mallesons (KWM) has advised the Open ANX Foundation Limited as Hong Kong and PRC counsel on its initial… www.kwm.com    We actively monitor updates from regulators, and endeavour to comply with all relevant laws and regulations. As seen in China, some jurisdictions are evolving their policies. The foundation will take such steps as necessary to remain compliant as and when clarity and details are available on the revised policies. We expect our project to continue as per the roadmap recently released, see below:  OAX Project Q4 Roadmap Update — Legal and Regulatory Stream https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/oax-project-q4-roadmap-update-legal-and-regulatory-stream-8d9a3d4671a2 By Hugh Madden & Liam Bussell medium.com     OAX Project Q4 Roadmap Update — Technology Stream https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/oax-project-q4-roadmap-update-technology-stream-120a8ef3046b By Hugh Madden and Liam Bussell medium.com     OAX Q4 Roadmap Update — Community and Engagement Stream https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/oax-q4-roadmap-update-community-and-engagement-stream-9b699f668322 By Hugh Madden and Liam Bussell medium.com     WEBSITE | WHITEPAPER | YOUTUBE | SLACK | TWITTER | MEDIUM | REDDIT | WECHAT | TELEGRAM",False

The long term and ongoing deliverables of the community and ecosystem stream include:  - Formation and engagement of a working group of select industry partners to collaborate on, and guide the three streams/pillars of execution - Build a large “grass roots” community to support, guide, and educate the market on the goals and benefits of openANX to the crypto-currency community - Ongoing public relations and communication to maintain the visibility of the project in the public - Continue to build industry support and awareness for the project  The foundation has acquired the OAX.org domain, and a rebranding exercise will be undertaken to remove “ANX” from the foundation and project branding, this is seen as necessary to present an open, neutral community project.

I suggest you act on your comments and bow out gracefully, sell your OAX tokens and focus your creative efforts elsewhere.  - We welcome criticism as much as we do feedback or questions but our roadmap was clear.

Good leaders have brass balls but this crypto environment where any and everyone has a magnifying glass up your ass 24/7 has to be brutal. Normally when a start up company gets funded, they go off and work like nuts without having the responsibility of being a public company with the internet as audience. Double edged sword. Sure, you raise a ton of money with nothing more than a white paper that has no absolutely no legal ramifications, Yes, you get the money before you've even done a thing but you have an ass ton of pressure if things don't go right...24/7.

As for Oax, it's the not the first bag I've ever held nor my last. Without getting into details, the very first serious investment I ever made tumbled about 60% in a couple of months time. I woke up every day and felt a little sicker. Within six months, it was down around 80%. With all that was in me, I bought more. Not many things felt worse than buying again. It would rise and fall, somewhere between 70%-80% of my purchase. I bought more when I could and stopped thinking about it. I still liked the team, the vision and frankly, not all that much had gone wrong. I averaged down to the point where my total losses were about 33% and it started to climb. A year later, it had tripled. This was not in crypto so a year was a remarkable turnaround. Today, that company is known as Apple. I'm kidding. It was a small company that built cell phone towers and leased them. Was eventually bought out.  Hang in there and remember, we invested in this team, not the fickle market place.  Cheers",False

At first i'd want to underline that OAX will be the large platform for the integration of DEX, CEX and other market participants.  Second, the KYC process will be ""outside"" the system.  As it's stated in the Technical White Paper, Note that off-chain functions such as banking integration and KYC data collection is not within scope. It is expect that service providers will use their existing centralized infrastructure for these purposes, with points of integration to the Ethereum contracts https://www.openanx.org/en/assets/whitepaper/openANX_Technical_White_Paper_ENU.pdf  Also there are lot of info about OAX KYC/AML aspects in the White Paper, pages 11-12 Exchange users are users who wish to participate in the exchange, using the services for native token trading or for real world asset trading. Exchange users of real world assets will require a relationship with an Asset Gateway. In most jurisdictions, Asset Gateways are obliged to perform KYC and AML in order to operate legally and maintain the necessary relationships with financial services suppliers such as banks. ... When a user establishes a relationship with a gateway, the gateway will first direct them to one or more KYC services. The KYC service will provide a KYC rating, which is registered into the openANX DAO. Note that no physical documents or other materials are stored on the blockchain, merely an Ethereum address. The KYC service will stipulate a KYC level, and validity date range through the KYC API. ... Once a user has satisfied the KYC requirements, the gateway can release the token to the user. ... Asset Gateways will be afforded varying KYC parameters according to their requirements. ... Many Asset Gateways are expected to register and supply their own KYC service implementation, as in some jurisdictions it is difficult or undesirable to outsource KYC to a third party https://www.openanx.org/en/assets/whitepaper/openANX_White_Paper_ENU.pdf",False

There are projects which I dont want to even look at due to horrible experience I had. Hopefully, Chinese will invest once the price settles on lower end, thats what they wanted anyway.  Just my personal opinion. You are losing money only when you're selling. If you bought 10 OAX yesterday and didn't sell it today you lost nothing to the moment. You still own 10 OAX. Perhaps it will rise high again tomorrow or in two weeks and you'll be able to exit with profit. It's if your purpose was a short-term speculative investment. If you are a long-term investor you don't need to worry at all. There is no much difference beetween 0.007, 0.008 or current 0.0045 if you think about possible x10 or x20 in a year or two when the prototype will appear and platform will start to work and grow. I am really empathize to you guys that you invested to the OAX at the not perfect moment. But perhaps it will return a hundredfold. The OAX token is based on the good deflational model and quite possibly will cost much more in the future when the platform will be successful.",False

Some quotes from conversation on Slack  Most decentralized exchanges love openANX  It's focus is bridging fiat world and blockchain. All the new breed of decentralized exchanges focus on pure crypto  Everyone can't do everything. In the ecosystem different teams are working on different problem areas. 0x and oax very complimentary. Most successful projects pick and area and try do it best. Projects that try do -everything- end up doing nothing.  Oax will bring fiat gateways to the blockchain, with credit risk trading, dispute resolution, and decentralized exchange integration. Amongst other things  0x good the otc style trading and very easy to implement so we will integrate with it first. But because it's one blockchain event per transaction it's not so strong on higher frequency order book style trading. We will do 0x first but then do more when they are ready I raiden exchange. Possibly we need to build our own as we need multi dimension order books for liquidity aggregation. Which nothing except anxpro does currently. Some of the engineers like Sprite and are investigating that. We also have an open research grant yet to be placed for exactly this   Hugh is responsible for much of the vision behind the openANX project. He has a strong commitment to the future of digital assets and a belief that access should be free and open to all. Hugh started his first business when he was 16, providing security services for companies in Australia. He has worked for various financial service firms (HSBC and AXA) building and designing their systems and security. In 2012, Hugh founded ANX International, one of the world’s largest blockchain developers and a backer of the openANX project.

Thank you for the question. I answered some time ago.)  Quote from: bitvoyager on June 24, 2017, 01:10:24 PM Quote from: statdude on June 24, 2017, 12:22:03 AM Quote from: adu1t on June 23, 2017, 11:57:01 PM Quote from: bitvoyager on June 23, 2017, 11:33:30 AM  Thanks for the question, adu1t!  Just go to the White Paper and CTRL+F - search ""token"".      Page 18 - 5.1 Uses of OAX Tokens  ""OAX is a token that can be exchanged for memberships in the DAO and/or its association. Members will be entitled to certain privileges, including but not limited to voting privileges on major operational decisions relating to the openANX platform.""  Most valuable information that I found there is: Members  are  not entitled  to  any  economic  rights  of  the  Foundation  at  any  time and  Memberships  do not entitle the holder to any distribution of profits nor any claim on any assets.  Everything else is just a bla-bla-bla, voting  privileges, bla-bla-bla, voting  privileges. Who need these voting privileges on YOUR platform for such of money? People need profit, but you sell them pure air  Agreed, what a joke. I almost invested until I realized these tokens have next to no value.  Thanks for your opinion, guys!  1. ""Members  are  not entitled  to  any  economic  rights"" - Yes, you are right.  OAX token holders only get privileges of the memberships they own. It is not limited to only voting, ie: third party service provider membership grants ability to be service provider. Possibly something will be changed during the development, there are a lot of forces and deep minds are involved in the process and the platform just gets its final shape.  2. ""People need profit"", ""no value"" If you want to know if you'll make money if you'll invest, it's not something that the openANX team can talk about as staff. Ultimately, if people like the project idea, and can understand it now, they could get involved. Later, when a prototype will be able obviously there'll be more interest as people will be able to see what they're getting.  You can exchange OAX once it's tradable on exchanges ( July 29, or possibly earlier if the Token Sale will end sooner)  When the OAX platform will start to work there should be the increasing demand on Token and supply will be dwindling. ""The initial number of issued OAX Tokens is 100,000,000; as there is no planned inflation, the number of outstanding tokens would be reduced over time as activity on the openANX platform increases"" Project Deck, Page 23: https://www.openanx.org/en/assets/documents/openANX_Project%20Deck_ENU.pdf  The team is expecting that in the case of success the user base will grow exponentially. Nobody can predict the future though. You can read more about the Metcalfe's law: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law  The main aim of the openANX team once the Token Sale will be finished is to concentrate on building a consortium of companies and platforms to integrate, and the team will do this with the huge passion.  Only you to decide to be involved on the early stage, or later when the working prototype will be released, or just stay an observer.  ",False

If I hear Bithumb got hacked and want to move my funds away, where would I go? I’d probably go to another centralized exchange in Korea, like Coinone. The same problem still exists however. No one really knows how or why Bithumb got hacked, as the system is centralized, opaque, and closed. If I moved my funds to another centralized exchange, does any of that change? How do I know that the new exchange I sent funds to has better security protocols?  God forbid the OAX platform ever have a security breach, but if one were to occur, there are clear protocols in place. First of all, unlike centralized exchanges which hold both crypto and fiat private keys, Asset Gateways in the OAX platform will only have custody of a single set of keys. For example, with a fiat gateway, the gateway will only hold onto the fiat currency in a transaction, and the user will retain crypto custody. The vice versa applies for crypto gateways. Asset Gateways will also have transparent collateral levels, so that users can determine the amount of risk that they want to take on in a trade. The whole system will be open-sourced and transparent, so that everyone can check if there are potential loopholes.

Here's where we are right now. If you took part in the Public Sale, the tokens would have been sent to the wallet address that you contributed via the smart contract. Essentially, as soon as you sent the ETH, the OAX were sent in response. They are in your wallet and you should be able to see them.  On the 29th of July, we will Activate the tokens, which will allow them to be moved to another wallet, to an account, whatever. (As long as where you are sending them supports ERC20 tokens) To get them Activated by the 29th, you needed to register here by the 25th  https://registration.openanx.org/  If you missed registration, Don't Panic! We will perform further Activation Batches later. However, if you didn't register by the 25th, you will have to wait. The reason we do this is in some cases, we may need further information from some backers, and we'll do that via email. This is on the advice we have received from our legal advisors.  If you did register your ETH address and email and we didn't follow up with you for any additional details, you'll be able to move your tokens on the 29th.

Many of you probably know him from our Slack or Telegram channels, or maybe from BCT or Reddit on some other project. He’s been a great help to us here, and he’s a great guy! Thanks Rory!  However, when you find a project in crypto that you feel is revolutionary or groundbreaking, it can be one of the most rewarding experiences you will find in the world of technology.  When I look to become involved in a project I always look at the team, even before I look at the idea. Without the team of developers, marketers, and other support staff a project has almost no chance of being successful. What made openANX different was its connection to a successful centralized exchange ANX International. This was a team looking to evolve and build on what was already in place.  That is the real key to becoming a community manager. You must first work to be part of the community you represent. You must understand their concerns, anticipate challenges, and be willing to voice your concerns in a professional way to the development team or contact.  I truly feel that with good communication you always have a shot to turn around a challenging situation and exceed expectations.  Lastly, always be honest with the developers, community, and yourself.

They are also actively searching for new technologies that seem promising, hence why the Ukrainian government has implemented the blockchain technology into their system. Ukraine has one of the largest cryptocurrency community within the CIS region.  On the appointed day (1st of July) at 7 PM, we all gathered in the pub. We perfectly discussed about blockchain and crypto, and I made a presentation of the openANX project. With the ongoing problem of centralized exchanges being hacked, I decided that openANX was a project worth noting about. I talked about the main features of openANX and answered all questions from the audience. After that I explained to everyone how to participate in the openANX ICO.

There were a lot of discussions about how openANX could achieve these goals, how it could be a real alternative to the traditional exchange and, one of most discussed topic, with a little awe, how and when openANX will apply the KYC/AML policies to backers.  For these reasons –thanks to Tiarnan, the Bounty Manager- there was an AMA with the Dev. Hugh Madden.  Here some most interesting AMA questions:  - Could you explain the policies you want to adopt regards KYC? - What exchanges are involved in OAX token trade? - May I ask what kind of relationship (if any) is there between the OpenANX and the ANXPro platforms? - Which are the main advantages to join the platform?

I have backed many ICO’s and this is the first one I’ve had to register for, why is that?  As I have mentioned in other posts, we are trying to build a community. We are not simply raising funds as the end goal. We want to develop an amazing platform that is useful and of benefit to the users. To do that, we need to build a strong, active community. So, we’d like to be able to keep in contact with our backers and supporters and keep them informed of developments. We also need to be able to contact any contributor who may need to submit additional information for KYC purposes.  Why Do I Need To Register to Activate My Tokens?  To ensure that we can keep in touch with our backers, we’d like to collect an email address from everyone to allow us to communicate project developments, news and upcoming events. Linking an email address to the contribution address also allows us to confirm if we require any additional details from any backer in order to comply with KYC/AML requirements. If we have an email address we can contact you easily.  Why Do You Need To Do KYC?  At openANX, we are very committed to the long term development of the platform and its widespread adoption and use. We are trying to build something important, that is functional and changes the nature of crypto-exchanges for the better. To remain viable long term, we need to ensure we follow regulations and compliance as they are presented to us by our legal counsel.  How Do I Register?  It’s very simple. Just go to the website (www.openanx.org) and CLICK the REGISTER button on the Homepage. Or you can go here directly -> https://registration.openanx.org/  https://medium.com/@OAX_Foundation/how-to-transfer-your-oax-tokens-7a7cd45bc7dd   Register early to ensure that your tokens are ready to transfer on the 29th July  Bounty Hunters don't need to register   WEBSITE | WHITEPAPER | YOUTUBE | SLACK | TWITTER | MEDIUM | REDDIT | WECHAT | TELEGRAM",False

Yes, this have been discussed many times here. This just the last i found.  Quote from: bitvoyager on June 25, 2017, 08:42:47 PM  Quote from: bitvoyager on June 24, 2017, 01:10:24 PM Quote from: statdude on June 24, 2017, 12:22:03 AM Quote from: adu1t on June 23, 2017, 11:57:01 PM Quote from: bitvoyager on June 23, 2017, 11:33:30 AM  Thanks for the question, adu1t!  Just go to the White Paper and CTRL+F - search ""token"".     You'll find a lot of interesting info.  Page 18 - 5.1 Uses of OAX Tokens  ""OAX is a token that can be exchanged for memberships in the DAO and/or its association. Members will be entitled to certain privileges, including but not limited to voting privileges on major operational decisions relating to the openANX platform.""  Most valuable information that I found there is: Members  are  not entitled  to  any  economic  rights  of  the  Foundation  at  any  time and  Memberships  do not entitle the holder to any distribution of profits nor any claim on any assets.  Everything else is just a bla-bla-bla, voting  privileges, bla-bla-bla, voting  privileges. Who need these voting privileges on YOUR platform for such of money? People need profit, but you sell them pure air  Agreed, what a joke. I almost invested until I realized these tokens have next to no value.  Thanks for your opinion, guys!  1. ""Members  are  not entitled  to  any  economic  rights"" - Yes, you are right.  OAX token holders only get privileges of the memberships they own. It is not limited to only voting, ie: third party service provider membership grants ability to be service provider. Possibly something will be changed during the development, there are a lot of forces and deep minds are involved in the process and the platform just gets its final shape.  2. ""People need profit"", ""no value"" If you want to know if you'll make money if you'll invest, it's not something that the openANX team can talk about as staff. Ultimately, if people like the project idea, and can understand it now, they could get involved. Later, when a prototype will be able obviously there'll be more interest as people will be able to see what they're getting.  You can exchange OAX once it's tradable on exchanges ( July 29, or possibly earlier if the Token Sale will end sooner)  When the OAX platform will start to work there should be the increasing demand on Token and supply will be dwindling. ""The initial number of issued OAX Tokens is 100,000,000; as there is no planned inflation, the number of outstanding tokens would be reduced over time as activity on the openANX platform increases"" Project Deck, Page 23: https://www.openanx.org/en/assets/documents/openANX_Project%20Deck_ENU.pdf  The team is expecting that in the case of success the user base will grow exponentially. Nobody can predict the future though. You can read more about the Metcalfe's law: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law  The main aim of the openANX team once the Token Sale will be finished is to concentrate on building a consortium of companies and platforms to integrate, and the team will do this with the huge passion.  Only you to decide to be involved on the early stage, or later when the working prototype will be released, or just stay an observer.     For example how many tokens does one need to use for what exactly so demand for the token increases? -  Some answers from shadowlpb, OAX team on Slack:  ""in order to join small fee, in order to get voting rights there will be a fee, to open a gateway there will be a fee. Those coins will be destroyed and there will be less in the market place""  ""Tokens will be used for membership, and they will also likely be involved in ancillary services (data services, KYC services) in addition there will be a nominal fee to access the platform for first time users ( think something like the Economist Magazine's Big Mac index, which prices Big Macs around the world as indication of buying power)""  ""Tokens will be used for memberships and memberships will have different levels. (An asset gateway membership will be worth more than a voting member for instance)  ""In addition, as the platform makes profit from fees, above a certain level of liquidity it will activate an algorithmic buy back using funds in excess of its baseline reserve. Details of this are theoretical currently so I can't give you numbers.""   You may go through the thread here, on the Slack, on Telegram, Reddit and found some answers from the OAX representatives to the same questions.

These are not OAX. Real OAX will be activated on July 29th.  2. Possibly these are so called IOU (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOU)  3. The price (exchange rate) of nonexistent tokens on hitBTC usually means nothing, imho  4. The lowest ""ask"", 0.00250000 ETH/OAX is higher then the price (exchange rate) of OAX during Token Sale.  5. If you are looking for some OAX welcome to https://www.openanx.org/en/.     It's the best and the only one way to become a happy OAX owner.

We’re proud to say that we reached our funding goal, allowing the Token Sale to be closed at an earlier-than-expected date. More than 24 million OAX tokens were sold, raising over $18 million USD.    Our Token Sale was actually the biggest Asia-based token sale in history, which you can read about here  So many people from so many different countries contributed to the token sale. Over 5,100 different purchases were made, and this diverse community is really what the project team was hoping for.    We want to thank you guys once again. We would never have had this success without you! Please remember that this is just the start of the openANX project. We’re not a “pump and dump” type of project. Our developers are hard at work on the openANX platform prototype, set to be released sometime in Q2 of 2018. We really appreciate our diverse community, and we will continue to work to make the project something that you can be proud of.",False

Still, we’d like to give our users an idea of how to navigate through the platform and what to expect once the platform comes out.  1. Find Asset Gateways: Users will first need to use an asset gateway to on-board fiat currency onto the blockchain. Unlike in Centralized Exchange Models, the openANX platform will utilize multiple Asset Gateways; we will discuss the benefits of this later on. Another key difference in openANX is that gateways will never hold both of the user’s keys. For example, with a fiat gateway, the gateway will only hold onto the fiat currency in a transaction, and the user will retain crypto custody. The vice versa applies for crypto gateways. This significantly reduces user risk, which brings us to our next step.  2. ...

No pre-sale bonus, no early entry bonus, the price per OAX is the same (in ETH) during the whole initial Token Sale.  Hugh, OAX representative on the Slack: There was no general pre-sale. In China there were parties who were granted conditional allotment in return for a commitment (no discount) for a short window. Outside of China there has been a limited number of pre-commitments with no discounts. This amount represents a minority of the sale, and will be visible at launch. In short, no discounts, we are not running general public sales until the launch, and most of the tokens will be available for the community. However, we have been fortunate to engage some key strategic players in the industry who will play an important role in furthering the goals of the project.",False

Answers:     - if you check out our site, you can see we are partnered with 0x, thats because most DEX focus on pure crypto, 0x for example erc20 tokens;   - we have a leg up / head start because anx has been around for four years, we have a customer base and plenty of IP already,     we intend to prove the business model with our own business;   - given that 99% of the volume is centralised, the DEX partners (such as 0x) love openANX, it brings fiat to their doorstop   The full conversation: https://www.reddit.com/r/ArkEcosystem/comments/6imxdj/log_of_ama_with_openanx/?st=J47G5BLS&sh=bc3f32b9   REMINDER  THE ETH CONTRIBUTION ADDRESS WILL NEVER BE PUBLISHED OR SENT VIA EMAIL, SOCIAL MEDIA OR ANY INSTANT MESSAGING APPLICATIONS OR GROUPS.

There is a lot of info about KYC in this document: https://www.openanx.org/en/assets/documents/openANX_Information_Memorandum_ENU.pdf  According to the team representatives: Actually on practice KYC and AML/CTF will be done for large payouts only. The team is expecting to implement this to some people, no more.  Here is the answer about KYC from Dave Chapman on Telegram:  - Hi Phi, and thanks for the question.  The Foundation has sought counsel from  law firms in Hong Kong and the United States as to the potential legality of conducting the token sale. As there are no established directives or clear polices from regulators, the Foundation has undertaken a prudent approach to conduct the token sale in compliance to relevant legislation and regulations. The counsel has recommended that the foundations complies with established KYC and AML standards and procedures to disincentivize the utilization of the token sale as a vehicle for money laundering or other illicit activity. All KYC information will be collected and maintained in accordance to strict data protection policies therefore the participants and the foundation will be in privity of the KYC information and a disclosure will only be made should it be required by a law enforcement agency as part of a regulatory or criminal investigation. The foundation believes, in openness and transparency and thus it is compelled to follow all relevant legislation and conduct the token sale with the highest level of integrity.  Please let me know if this helps.  https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@openanxteam",False

Yes, something like this have been discussed many times here. This just the last i found.  Quote from: bitvoyager on June 24, 2017, 01:10:24 PM Quote from: statdude on June 24, 2017, 12:22:03 AM Quote from: adu1t on June 23, 2017, 11:57:01 PM Quote from: bitvoyager on June 23, 2017, 11:33:30 AM  Thanks for the question, adu1t!  Just go to the White Paper and CTRL+F - search ""token"".     You'll find a lot of interesting info.  Page 18 - 5.1 Uses of OAX Tokens  ""OAX is a token that can be exchanged for memberships in the DAO and/or its association. Members will be entitled to certain privileges, including but not limited to voting privileges on major operational decisions relating to the openANX platform.""  Most valuable information that I found there is: Members  are  not entitled  to  any  economic  rights  of  the  Foundation  at  any  time and  Memberships  do not entitle the holder to any distribution of profits nor any claim on any assets.  Everything else is just a bla-bla-bla, voting  privileges, bla-bla-bla, voting  privileges. Who need these voting privileges on YOUR platform for such of money? People need profit, but you sell them pure air  Agreed, what a joke. I almost invested until I realized these tokens have next to no value.  Thanks for your opinion, guys!  1. ""Members  are  not entitled  to  any  economic  rights"" - Yes, you are right.  OAX token holders only get privileges of the memberships they own. It is not limited to only voting, ie: third party service provider membership grants ability to be service provider. Possibly something will be changed during the development, there are a lot of forces and deep minds are involved in the process and the platform just gets its final shape.  2. ""People need profit"", ""no value"" If you want to know if you'll make money if you'll invest, it's not something that the openANX team can talk about as staff. Ultimately, if people like the project idea, and can understand it now, they could get involved. Later, when a prototype will be able obviously there'll be more interest as people will be able to see what they're getting.  You can exchange OAX once it's tradable on exchanges ( July 29, or possibly earlier if the Token Sale will end sooner)  When the OAX platform will start to work there should be the increasing demand on Token and supply will be dwindling. ""The initial number of issued OAX Tokens is 100,000,000; as there is no planned inflation, the number of outstanding tokens would be reduced over time as activity on the openANX platform increases"" Project Deck, Page 23: https://www.openanx.org/en/assets/documents/openANX_Project%20Deck_ENU.pdf  The team is expecting that in the case of success the user base will grow exponentially. Nobody can predict the future though. You can read more about the Metcalfe's law: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law  The main aim of the openANX team once the Token Sale will be finished is to concentrate on building a consortium of companies and platforms to integrate, and the team will do this with the huge passion.  Only you to decide to be involved on the early stage, or later when the working prototype will be released, or just stay an observer.     For example how many tokens does one need to use for what exactly so demand for the token increases? -  Some answers from shadowlpb, OAX team on Slack:  ""in order to join small fee, in order to get voting rights there will be a fee, to open a gateway there will be a fee. Those coins will be destroyed and there will be less in the market place""  ""Tokens will be used for membership, and they will also likely be involved in ancillary services (data services, KYC services) in addition there will be a nominal fee to access the platform for first time users ( think something like the Economist Magazine's Big Mac index, which prices Big Macs around the world as indication of buying power)""  ""Tokens will be used for memberships and memberships will have different levels. (An asset gateway membership will be worth more than a voting member for instance)  ""In addition, as the platform makes profit from fees, above a certain level of liquidity it will activate an algorithmic buy back using funds in excess of its baseline reserve. Details of this are theoretical currently so I can't give you numbers.""   You may go through the thread here, on the Slack, on Telegram, Reddit and found some answers from the OAX representatives to the same questions.

""Direct Purchasers are required to activate the OAX for OTS issued by the Foundation’s smart contract by completing the verification process to the satisfaction of the Foundation. Such verification process includes but is not limited to Know-Your-Customer (“KYC”) and anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (“AML/CTF”) checks.""  ""when all KYC and AML/CTF verifications are deemed to have been satisfied by the Direct Purchaser to the Foundation’s satisfaction. This requires action to be undertaken by Direct Purchasers (as stated below) and there is no assurance that verifications will satisfactorily be completed swiftly or at all, depending on the circumstances.  OAX Token Sale Information Memorandum. https://www.openanx.org/en/assets/documents/openANX_Information_Memorandum_ENU.pdf  On practice KYC / AML will be done for very large payouts only. The team is expecting to implement this to some people only, no more.   Here is the question from Phi on Telegram:  ""i have a question from the audit report regarding kyc  Initial post sale token transfers require prior KYC verification of the sender and some consideration needs to be given as to how KYC verification is enacted outside the contract. It is not entirely clear why these initial transfers are KYC encumbered though I’m told it may be a regulatory requirement. The KYC requirement will likely present as a disincentive for token purchase.  Many investors who may wish to remain anonymous may not realise this encumbrance exists.  Such cases could lead to protracted negative publicity toward the project and frustration on behalf of the investor.   Token holding can become anonymous after the first transfer. KYC verification may make more sense when the owner wishes to redeem their OAX tokens for OpenANX governance powers though contract does not provide for this.  The token itself appears to have no intrinsic value apart from being redeemable for governance power with OpenANX. Lacking in intrinsic value and being burdened by KYC buy in requirements leaves a pessimistic view that the sale will be unattractive and the token may not perform well in the market. The 1 and 2 year locked tokens may be effectively worthless once they are unlocked leading to possible shortfalls in current and future funding.  While these opinions are beyond the scope of the code review, I feel they must be addressed and made public prior to the funding launch.""  is that summary above true?""   Also here is the answer from Dave Chapman:  ""Hi Phi, and thanks for the question.  The Foundation has sought counsel from  law firms in Hong Kong and the United States as to the potential legality of conducting the token sale. As there are no established directives or clear polices from regulators, the Foundation has undertaken a prudent approach to conduct the token sale in compliance to relevant legislation and regulations. The counsel has recommended that the foundations complies with established KYC and AML standards and procedures to disincentivize the utilization of the token sale as a vehicle for money laundering or other illicit activity. All KYC information will be collected and maintained in accordance to strict data protection policies therefore the participants and the foundation will be in privity of the KYC information and a disclosure will only be made should it be required by a law enforcement agency as part of a regulatory or criminal investigation. The foundation believes, in openness and transparency and thus it is compelled to follow all relevant legislation and conduct the token sale with the highest level of integrity.  Please let me know if this helps.""  https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@openanxteam",False

I've seen this semi-disclaimer in at least 3 other ICOs and all of those have made plenty of gains regardless of people thinking the tokens had inherent value. plus, only time and development REALLY show if a token has any true-value.

""Members  are  not entitled  to  any  economic  rights"" - Yes, you are right.  OAX token holders only get privileges of the memberships they own. It is not limited to only voting, ie: third party service provider membership grants ability to be service provider. Possibly something will be changed during the development, there are a lot of forces and deep minds are involved in the process and the platform just gets its final shape.  2. ""People need profit"", ""no value"" If you want to know if you'll make money if you'll invest, it's not something that the openANX team can talk about as staff. Ultimately, if people like the project idea, and can understand it now, they could get involved. Later, when a prototype will be able obviously there'll be more interest as people will be able to see what they're getting.  You can exchange OAX once it's tradable on exchanges ( July 29, or possibly earlier if the Token Sale will end sooner)  When the OAX platform will start to work there should be the increasing demand on Token and supply will be dwindling. ""The initial number of issued OAX Tokens is 100,000,000; as there is no planned inflation, the number of outstanding tokens would be reduced over time as activity on the openANX platform increases"" Project Deck, Page 23: https://www.openanx.org/en/assets/documents/openANX_Project%20Deck_ENU.pdf  The team is expecting that in the case of success the user base will grow exponentially. Nobody can predict the future though. You can read more about the Metcalfe's law: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law  The main aim of the openANX team once the Token Sale will be finished is to concentrate on building a consortium of companies and platforms to integrate, and the team will do this with the huge passion.

""how far the price of the coin will go up"" - The team prefers not to speculate on this matter. To my mind this will depend on 3 main factors: 1.The development process, how successful it will be. Personally I'm absolutely sure that the team behind the project will do their best to launch OAX paltform as soon as possible, Q2 2018 or even earlier. 2. The general situation on the market. If existent problems with centralized exchanges will grow, then the expectation of successful entry of openANX into the market will favorably influence on the OAX exchange rate. Developers claim and we can see this in the White Paper that it can solve a lot of bugs of current ""cryptocurrencies-exchange OS"".   3. Regulatory questions.  ""Will we be able to trade this coin in an exchange"" - Yes When? In 7-10 days after July 21st, the last day of the Token Sale. Or even earlier if the Campaign will end sooner.

First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.    Here is the answer from the openANX representative:  ""... Second, We aim to build a consortium of exchanges and we've had initial discussions with a number of them. From the outset, it will probably be tier 2 (regional exchanges) and other decentralized exchanges that join first as they stand to benefit the most initially. Centralized exchanges will want to support a gateway to hedge their risk: decentralized matching is clearly the future.Small exchanges get to utilize a top notch matching engine (rather than attempting to build their own,  and they get access our initial liquidity, or exchanges that don't do a full range of tokens can add those to their existing clients.  It's then that aggregation becomes exponential. Once we have 4-5 exchanges then we become attractive for other reasons. Credit provides consumer protection, and our liquidity now looks attractive to even larger exchanges who can use it only in instances when their own order book can't provide the trade volume they need. So, initially we believe big exchanges will use us to fill gaps in their own books, maybe only running 5-10% of their own business through us. Over time, they will see that if they provide better service in terms of customer service and banking expertise, being part of a bigger ecosystem works because they have access to a larger group of potential clients...""  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1943946.msg19504045#msg19504045  2. From tlynch on Slack: ""once we reach the soft cap, openANX can end the token sale at our discretion"" Total suply - 100M OAX. There should be one more Token Sale (30M) when the Prototype will be released somewhere in Q2 2018.  3. There is the Pizza Gateway behind the scenes.  4. You are welcome!

Here is the answer from the OAX team on Reddit:  How is openANX different?  A lot of the community has asked us to explain the difference between openANX and other decentralized exchanges out in the market, be it BitSquare, BitShare, Bancor, Raid-X, ShapeShift or others. As you can see from even this incomplete list, the move toward DEX’s is significant, and sustained. While I am no expert in all these platforms, I’ve gathered some info to do some initial comparative analysis, and from this, we can draw a few conclusions.  The first thing to understand is that in any transaction, the Asset Gateway will only hold a single set of keys, rather than both crypto and fiat keys. If a user wishes to move ETH to BTC, then the Gateway will hold BTC keys, if the user is changing crypto to cash, the Gateway will hold the cash. In both the above cases the asset held by the Gateway will be secured by the Collateral they have posted to the blockchain(More on this later). At no time will any part of the platform or Gateway service provider hold both keys. This is the critical difference between Decentralized and centralized exchanges.  The three key areas that differentiate openANX for other platforms can be summarized as follows;  1) Credit Risk markets 2) Asset Gateways 3) Liquidity Aggregation  I’ll spend some time talking through each of these.  First, I’ll talk about Credit Risk. If you consider the non-crypto financial markets, in most of the large banks and trading houses that run trading desks (who may take long or short positions on various stocks and commodities.) These organizations will have a credit desk, whose job it is to evaluate counterparty risk. The opposite party in every trade or transaction must be considered for its potential to default. By considering available information about the borrower or bond issuer, the credit desk can find an objective measure of the likelihood of default and the potential downside risk. They can only do that by evaluating the other parties assets, liabilities, and other factors.  This does not exist in the crypto-world. Until openANX. By asking Asset Gateways to post collateral onto the blockchain in ETH and issue fiat tokens for different currencies onto the blockchain rather than simply hold IOU’s, openANX creates an objective yardstick whereby users can compare exchanges by more than just price and volume. By having Gateway A vs. Gateway B USD tokens freely tradeable, the reputation and effectiveness of gateways are being evaluated in real-time by the community. In essence, this creates new credit markets and new liquidity for participants to trade in.  To understand the second unique difference of the openANX platform, it is necessary to understand the key complaint about current DEX. Many users talk about the speed and security of these platforms, but lament the lack of liquidity and trade volume. The reason for this is many traders and users like to be able to recognize market gains quickly, and in cash. In the DEX space, very, very few decentralized projects have decided to consider providing Asset Gateway services, and if they do, they provide a single exchange channel, with no competition on rates or fees.  OpenANX is a real-world application of DEX technology because we recognize that users want the option to bring assets and cash on and off chain. To provide greater competition, and hence better service for participants, we will bring together existing centralized exchanges via a consortium and allow them to integrate into the openANX ecosystem. Each Asset Gateway will offer a collateralized deposit onto the blockchain, held in a smart contract. The amount of this collateral will be transparent and will allow users to more effectively evaluate the risk of interacting with a particular Gateway. By working with existing exchange providers and decentralized platforms to integrate and by migrating the ANXPRO user base to the openANX platform, the openANX platforms enters the market with a ready-made user base. The platform will launch with sufficient users to overcome one of the major challenges facing existing DEX, that of having enough trade volume, or liquidity.  Many DEX projects contain exceptional technical developments, new specifications or functionality that the wider community greatly anticipates. Many of these projects are developed purely from the perspective on technical excellence, with little actual business understanding by the project team of how to run and exchange, how to build or maintain the network of relationships to be successful in the space. ANX International is the keystone backer of the openANX platform. ANX International runs one of Asia’s oldest exchanges. They are well known in the industry, with a large base of users and contacts in the community. They have a successful business providing blockchain services to companies worldwide, and have one of the largest and most experienced blockchain and DLT development teams in the world. In addition, openANX has a team of advisors who are well known in the industry, from blockchain companies, from the mining consortiums, and from the wider community, from the US, UK, China and elsewhere. By bringing this exceptional team of some of the industries brightest minds together, the openANX project has a wide network of contacts and partners to help drive adoption and growth. This allows for a large and robust network of committed users who will use the platform, exponentially increasing liquidity and hence trade volume.  Hopefully this post has answered some of the major questions of comparison and outlined openANX’s competitive advantage.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenANX/comments/6fzxu9/how_is_openanx_different/?st=J47FSGZT&sh=b351927a   REMINDER: Only send ETH to the official contract address available at the www.openanx.org   WEBSITE | WHITEPAPER | YOUTUBE | SLACK | TWITTER | MEDIUM | REDDIT | WECHAT | TELEGRAM",False

The underlying idea and structure look promising, but perhaps more importantly, the team behind it is the right team to take on this challenge.”  Peter Smith Strategy Advisory, OpenANX Project CEO & Co-Founder, Blockchain.info  Recently, ICO Alert has also published a detailed report on openANX.     ""openANX is, not unlike Bancor, a protocol that is likely to be vital for the crypto world on the medium term, and will greatly enhance the viability of many existing organizations in the crypto space today. The prospect of a sort of ‘marketplace for exchanges’ is exciting for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the simplified implementation of rating and auditing organizations that can help enhance user protections driven by organic demand rather than overt government intervention.""

The prospect of a sort of ‘marketplace for exchanges’ is exciting for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the simplified implementation of rating and auditing organizations that can help enhance user protections driven by organic demand rather than overt government intervention. Auditors, credit rating agencies, and many other financial services providers will find managing their activities within the cryptocurrency marketplace substantially enhanced by a functional openANX protocol and marketplace. Combined with the improvements in liquidity for decentralized exchanges and the potential cost reductions and service enhancements for centralized ones, it seems inevitable that openANX will help shape the practice of cryptocurrency exchange for the foreseeable future.""

Let me try to answer... OAX tokens gain access to voting privileges, as discussed. This allows you to have a say in the future direction of the platform. In the future, this may provide other benefits, but this is still in concept phase.  Memberships can be swapped, certainly. Whether or not tokens can be traded is really out of our hands.  Last, I can't predict the future, nor do I want to be seen building hype. If you like the project, concept stage is a good time to get involved. A lot of people understand what we are trying to do with the platform and want to get involved now. Likely when the prototype is deployed and woking, people who find the whole thing theoretical now will likely feel more confident with something concrete. It depends on if you are excited by the idea.",False

ANX International is providing much of the initial IP of the project (order matching engine etc) and will plug into the project as an Asset Gateway when the prototype is live. Hugh Madden, project Technical Director, conceived much of the idea and technical thinking behind openANX, and he is the CTO of ANX International, so that's where the overlap comes from.

This is how new users come into the new financial world we’re all building everyday. It’s their first touch point and often a very poor one — expensive, risk prone and prone to security disasters. It isn’t natural in the blockchain world for cypherpunks to trade on centralized, closed source exchanges, relinquishing custody of one’s private keys. For liquidity, we give up the values that we hold dear.  While there are a proliferation of decentralized exchange projects, they focus on pure crypto to crypto and are far from practical as end to end solutions at this point in time. Real world banking, compliance, and AML is simply not attractive to a small team of highly technical engineers. On the flip side, centralised exchange operators are weary of fending off DDoS attacks, managing 24x7 trading engines, and managing customer private keys. If you could build a platform to merge those two key competencies in a decentralized manner — letting exchange operators focus on their core competitive advantages (local language, support, compliance, and banking), while moving private key custody off balance sheets and back onto block chains — you’d have a product that could drive value for our entire industry.  The OpenANX Foundation (https://www.openanx.org) is the most credible attempt I’ve seen at leading the effort to deliver on this mission in the years I’ve been thinking about this problem. The underlying idea and structure look promising, but perhaps more importantly, the team behind it is the right team to take on this challenge. Hugh, Dave and Ken and have been hard at work in Hong Kong years, building one of the larger DLT development companies in the world, albeit in a low key, quiet way. I met them shortly after they launched their first product, the ANX exchange, a few years ago. Since then, they’ve built a few successful projects, but they’ve been remained passionate about building a better way to provide liquidity in our ecosystem. Who better to build a decentralised exchange protocol than a team that already runs a first class exchange?  It’s a hugely ambitious project, with a tremendous amount of work to be done — but that’s what our space is all about. I’m excited about working with them to build radically better, more transparent, and less risky infrastructure that can facilitate liquidity and the on-boarding of the next fifty millions users into the cypto-ecosystem. After all, what could be more exciting than brainstorming on a regular basis with some great people working on a project that would improve our whole industry?",False

There's a bit of an error though, let me explain.

We act as a technology partner for them, implementing exchange platforms for their business. Essentially like Oracle would install a database. This business line is successful, and we have many such clients globally. ANX have no control over their pricing, or their terms and conditions. The company simply delivers the solution (essentially a white label product) and supports it.  But I understand your concern.

Really interesting question. I guess nobody knows the answer to the moment. There is almost a whole year ahead, or possibly a little less if the project will develop quicker then planed. I'll pass your question to the team and will post the answer here when there will be a clear statement on this theme.   Some quotes from the Slack about possible advantages of participating in the 1st round:  - ""... The advantage of this (first) round is the price of the token. As demand rises so will the price of the coin.""  - ""... But there's no reason that price will be 0.75 in the second sale. 0.75 cents is the price now. I can't predict the future, but the price on the second sale will be determined by the market. Once ppl and companies start buying memberships the total number of tokens will reduce, introducing deflationary pressure.""  - ""... The advantage would be that we think more ppl will get engaged once they start to see us close on the prototype delivery. We don't intend to stop working after the first Token sale.""  - ""...  Second, unlike a lot of Token Sales out there, our major backer is a company that has run an exchange for 4 years in Asia and has a lot of experience in compliance, maintaining banking relationships and maintaining liquidity on the platform. We aren't four guys in dad's garage. We have one of the largest and most experienced Blockchain development teams in the world.  I understand what you're asking, but from a risk/reward stand point, we are a serious bunch of guys who are committed to building the best product we can, most of the team have been in the space a long time and we aren't four guys with...""

The ICO starts at June 22nd, but the bounty campaign period is about 1 to 2 month. If the ICO tokens are sold out in a short time since it is a promising project. Will the bounty campaign ended in just after the ICO ended?  Hi  juicejoyce thanks for the note. Just to clarify, if the program runs through to the end (midnight July 21) that would be just shy of 7.5 weeks. If we finish early it will be around, 3-4 weeks at the earliest. If that is the case, we will round out the full week (for example if it's Monday we'll pay through to the end of that week) then close out.  Of course, if people go ABOVE and beyond in their help promoting the project, we may consider paying an extra week to those guys who we think did awesome work. I'll run it past AsiaNexgen to confirm, but that seems likely at this stage.",False

You plan on bridging the fiat & crypto markets with a focus on serving the credit/debt markets on a large scale. Is this correct? What do you see as the potential $$$ market (trade volumes) for these types of asset classes?""  It's a good question, you've jumped a few steps though. CDO's and CDS's will certainly develop, but at a basic level, credit is about having the information to accurately determine risk of default.  Example If Gateway A and Gateway B both trade in BTC:ETH why choose one over the other? There are a host of reasons.  1) Better Pricing 2) Reputational variation 3) Speed and Service  In the cryptocurrency space, we see plenty of examples of 1) and 3) in practice, in fact variations in price drive much of what traders do. However, there is no objective yardstick to 2.  There's plenty of forums devoted to opinion and sentiment, and these are valuable, but there is no way to measure exposure or market sentiment in a numeric form. That's the first thing to understand. By providing the following information, we benefit the user  Gateway A - 75% collateralized in ETH in Smart Contract Gateway B - 20% collateralized in ETH in a Smart Contract  What does that tell a user? Well, nothing directly. But then consider that Gateway A is pricing BTC at $3,009 and Gateway B at $2,950, then it is clear that you can purchase on B and make a saving but the risk is higher. This puts the power back in the users hands.  Another example A certain large exchange that we all know recently lost the ability to on and off chain fiat. If you were holding tokens from them and needed cash very quickly, you could liquidate your tokens on the credit market at a price reflected in what people were prepared to pay. Is it worth taking the hit on the credit market, or should you move your assets out through a wallet and deal somewhere else? a Collateralized credit system give you some numeric understanding of how people are pricing this risk, and helps you make informed decisions.  In terms of complex credit offerings (CDO's etc) we don't plan on offering those, our plan is to simply open up the credit market and allow 3rd party providers to offer services they want, as long as they meet the requirements for a TP membership. In terms of junks bonds, CDO's, CDS's and mortgage pools, the credit market dwarfs the equity space, It seems likely that there is at least some potential for that in the crypto space.  Essentially Regards governance model on credit risk, we want to establish an ecosystem in which credit risk specialists and ratings agencies can flourish and compete, rather than providing those services ourself. Counter party credit risk and amounts of collateral pledged will be a function of the marker rather than standard dictated by the foundation or any central planning body.  openANX would not ff the rating agencies that make the assessment. But the platform would be open to service providers who use data mining and other tools to evaluate credit based on available information. The pricing of these gateway tokens not only also provide a market view on their credits, but also enable a credit holder to decrease his exposure if so desired.  Last part on this point, The level of collateral posted is up to the gateway. A company with a strong brand and reputation may choose to post very little. Our sovereign entity may choose to most a de minimis amount and rely on their country bond => rating. => ultimately this is about transparency and choice for all participants.  Ultimately we want to implement the function, then let the market decide how to work with it. Going back to our earlier example  Gateway A has a business model that avoids fractional reserves, focuses on good service and a great reputation.  Gateway B focuses on bringing the best pricing and speedy settlement as their model, both of these models can exist, by providing a collateral concept we provider a simple metric for users to comparatively ""shop"" in these markets.  Hope this answers your question. I'll post the final piece on the tokens shortly.",False

I have one update from some of my team members to the part #1 about cannibalizing markets for centralized exchanges  ""It's important to understand that for an exchange generally the trading transaction fees are not as compelling as the revenue from providing other services. However the costs of maintaining the system, providing security not just for the system but also having to move crypto to cold storage and back again are not insignificant. There is also the cost of the customer accounting system. Many of these costs would be eliminated""  Token Usage You are correct that higher level memberships provide greater access and involvement to the platform. In essence, we believe that it is important that the platform is open to all. We will likely have a one time nominal fee the first time someone uses the platform (like $1-$2, currently we like the Economist.com's ""Big Mac Index"" as this fee) then users will be free to use the platform (obviously paying Gateway fees etc as this is beyond the platforms control).  If they wish to engage with the platform or its users by offering some third party services, have access to voting rights or exclusive groups (KYC Service providers, Asset Gateways, User Groups, Steering Committees etc) they will need to exchange some tokens for membership. These exchanged tokens will be destroyed. This will reduce the total token pool, and will cause deflation in the system.  In addition, once its funds in reserve cross a certain threshold, the openANX platform, through the DAO, will implement an acquisition of OAX tokens on the open market. These tokens will be destroyed.  Hope this answers your questions, if not, post again and I'll post again.  Thanks",False

It's more than one question, so I'll answer them below in order. If I miss something, please tell me and I will come back to it in a follow up post.  In the case of exchanges eroding their user base, it's a valid point. The first thing to keep in mind is that we think the system is better, and here's why....In the centralized model you relinquish custody to all your assets, in the case of openANX you don't surrender your keys to your ERC20/ETH tokens at all.  Second, We aim to build a consortium of exchanges and we've had initial discussions with a number of them. From the outset, it will probably be tier 2 (regional exchanges) and other decentralized exchanges that join first as they stand to benefit the most initially. Centralized exchanges will want to support a gateway to hedge their risk: decentralized matching is clearly the future.Small exchanges get to utilize a top notch matching engine (rather than attempting to build their own,  and they get access our initial liquidity, or exchanges that don't do a full range of tokens can add those to their existing clients.  It's then that aggregation becomes exponential. Once we have 4-5 exchanges then we become attractive for other reasons. Credit provides consumer protection, and our liquidity now looks attractive to even larger exchanges who can use it only in instances when their own order book can't provide the trade volume they need. So, initially we believe big exchanges will use us to fill gaps in their own books, maybe only running 5-10% of their own business through us. Over time, they will see that if they provide better service in terms of customer service and banking expertise, being part of a bigger ecosystem works because they have access to a larger group of potential clients.  Lastly on this point, the barrier to entry for new gateways drops to near zero. By providing the Matching Engine and the infrastructure solution, it becomes simple for new service providers to become asset gateways, as long as they are able to post collateral.  This drives competition and aggregates liquidity across the platform. As liquidity grows the centralized exchange legacy revenue from opaque matching will become less material.  I'll answer credit markets in the next post.",False

As I understand it, you are improving on the Decentralized Exchange model by adding features to enhance liquidity as well as adding a DAO Governance model. To enhance liquidity, you are proposing to bridge the Centralized Exchanges and their liquidity to the openANX exchange. Why would the centralized exchanges want to bridge their liquidity to a DEX and essentially erode their own userbase & business model?  What incentive do they have to send liquidity to your DEX?  It looks like you really want to target credit markets (ie:/ Credit Default Swaps; Collateralized Debt Obligations), as well as OTC markets. You plan on bridging the fiat & crypto markets with a focus on serving the credit/debt markets on a large scale. Is this correct? What do you see as the potential $$$ market (trade volumes) for these types of asset classes?  So your governance model and smart contracts will assess the credit worthiness of companies and institutions that want to trade assets through openANX (like Credit Default Swaps; CDO's; Bonds). So you'll also be acting like an S&P or Moody's Rating agency on these collateralized companies/mkt participants at the same time. Correct?  So openANX is proposing to mitigate counterparty risks with their collateralized smart contracts. If so, how much collateral are mkt participants required to allocate to the smart contracts?  Regarding the tokens. Their functionality provides membership & voting privileges (Access & Voting rights). In other words, all openANX market participants are required to obtain ANX tokens to transact on the exchange. Correct? The more tokens purchased the more rights and privileges a participant has on the openANX system. Correct?    Do the tokens have any other functionality (ie. Fees; profit share)?  Any clarification on these topics would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",False

I posted this blog over on Medium, but a lot of the questions were coming from here, so I thought I would share it here as well.  A lot of the community has asked us to explain the difference between openANX and other decentralized exchanges out in the market, be it BitSquare, BitShare, Bancor, Raid-X, ShapeShift or others. As you can see from even this incomplete list, the move toward DEX’s is significant, and sustained. While I am no expert in all these platforms, I’ve gathered some info to do some initial comparative analysis, and from this, we can draw a few conclusions.  The first thing to understand is that in any transaction, the Asset Gateway will only hold a single set of keys, rather than both crypto and fiat keys. If a user wishes to move ETH to BTC, then the Gateway will hold BTC keys, if the user is changing crypto to cash, the Gateway will hold the cash. In both the above cases the asset held by the Gateway will be secured by the Collateral they have posted to the blockchain(More on this later). At no time will any part of the platform or Gateway service provider hold both keys. This is the critical difference between Decentralized and centralized exchanges.  The three key areas that differentiate openANX for other platforms can be summarized as follows;  1)   Credit Risk markets 2)   Asset Gateways 3)   Liquidity Aggregation  I’ll spend some time talking through each of these.  First, I’ll talk about Credit Risk. If you consider the non-crypto financial markets, in most of the large banks and trading houses that run trading desks (who may take long or short positions on various stocks and commodities.) These organizations will have a credit desk, Who’s job it is to evaluate counterparty risk. The opposite party in every trade or transaction must be considered for its potential to default. By considering available information about the borrower or bond issuer, the credit desk can find an objective measure of the likelihood of default and the potential downside risk. They can only do that by evaluating the other parties assets, liabilities, and other factors.  This does not exist in the crypto-world. Until openANX. By asking Asset Gateways to post collateral onto the blockchain in ETH and issue fiat tokens for different currencies onto the blockchain rather than simply hold IOU’s, openANX creates an objective yardstick whereby users can compare exchanges by more than just price and volume. By having Gateway A vs. Gateway B USD tokens freely tradeable, the reputation and effectiveness of gateways are being evaluated in real-time by the community.  In essence, this creates new credit markets and new liquidity for participants to trade in.  To understand the second unique difference of the openANX platform, it is necessary to understand the key complaint about current DEX. Many users talk about the speed and security of these platforms, but lament the lack of liquidity and trade volume. The reason for this is many traders and users like to be able to recognize market gains quickly, and in cash. In the DEX space, very, very few decentralized projects have decided to consider providing Asset Gateway services, and if they do, they provide a single exchange channel, with no competition on rates or fees. OpenANX is a real-world application of DEX technology because we recognize that users want the option to bring assets and cash on and off chain. To provide greater competition, and hence better service for participants, we will bring together existing centralized exchanges via a consortium and allow them to integrate into the openANX ecosystem. Each Asset Gateway will offer a collateralized deposit onto the blockchain, held in a smart contract. The amount of this collateral will be transparent and will allow users to more effectively evaluate the risk of interacting with a particular Gateway.  By working with existing exchange providers and decentralized platforms to integrate and by migrating the ANXPRO user base to the openANX platform, the openANX platforms enters the market with a ready-made user base. The platform will launch with sufficient users to overcome one of the major challenges facing existing DEX, that of having enough trade volume, or liquidity.  Many DEX projects contain exceptional technical developments, new specifications or functionality that the wider community greatly anticipates. Many of these projects are developed purely from the perspective on technical excellence, with little actual business understanding by the project team of how to run and exchange, how to build or maintain the network of relationships to be successful in the space. ANX International is the keystone backer of the openANX platform. ANX International runs one of Asia’s oldest exchanges. They are well known in the industry, with a large base of users and contacts in the community. They have a successful business providing blockchain services to companies worldwide, and have one of the largest and most experienced blockchain and DLT development teams in the world. In addition, openANX has a team of advisors who are well known in the industry, from [Suspicious link removed]panies, from the mining consortiums, and from the wider community, from the US, UK, China and elsewhere. By bringing this exceptional team of some of the industries brightest minds together, the openANX project has a wide network of contacts and partners to help drive adoption and growth. This allows for a large and robust network of committed users who will use the platform, exponentially increasing liquidity and hence trade volume.  Hopefully this post has answered some of the major questions of comparison and outlined openANX’s competitive advantage.

For example, if its an ETH to BTC Gateway, they hold BTC, if it's ETH to Fiat they hold the Fiat. This reduces risk significantly.  In addition, the platform solves the problem some other decentralized projects have by increasing the number of Asset Gateways available to users and adding ""Gateway Collateral"" so users funds are ""secured"" against the gateway in case of a hack or other issue.  The system will aim to integrate with all existing exchanges and decentralized platforms, increasing liquidity and transparency to all users.
