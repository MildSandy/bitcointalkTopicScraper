Some of our team until very recently still worked full time for major technology firms; for this and other reasons (market timing) we have not been seeking funding until our company concept received strong commercial validation. We recently signed an agreement with a QLD/AU construction firm to implement AR solutions with regard to building & construction projects, and they are releasing to the media soon (Effcon, part of the Mcfadyen Group). We're also in discussions with two government departments looking at AR for their workforce (one is related to law enforcement!). We had looked at VC options but prefer ICO, for the main reasons - community and social engagement. It's hard to replicate the brand and product loyalty owning a part of it all brings. Funding would occur under either model, yet ICO offers a significant improvement in community engagement, and allows a natural extension of our Ethereum stack integration.  - ICO contracts are heavily reviewed. Around 200 regression test and functional test runs of our main ICO were conducted. - We posted our real information, LinkedIn profiles, social (reddit) accounts, and didn't make dummy-everything to hide behind. - We're building a company we're genuinely excited about. Who wouldn't be - full time AR world-wide, and commercial/professional AR in many more workplaces than just industrial! - The bottom line is that sometimes in ICOs there are genuine funding needs, from genuine companies, we're one of those. I hope that helps your decision to support our fundraising or not. - Finally, to offer the best support, when you purchase ARX tokens you will gain access to our applications via the Redemption smart contract. Even if you choose not to hold all of your tokens, we encourage you to experience our applications first-hand to see what supporting this company has created! ---",False

I'm Travis Roe, the founder of Assistive Reality (https://aronline.io), a project dedicated to creating Augmented and Mixed reality applications for Intel, Google, Apple and other smartglass/AR platforms. . We have a core set of Ethereum capabilities within our product stack. Our company is registered and operates in Australia with the relevant legal structures. At the moment we're conducting an Ethereum ICO, having already raised 300ETH in our Pre-sale last year. We've been doing some media releases in order to spread the word about our technology before our ICO fundraising kicks off.  We are a member of Microsoft's Mixed Reality development group and have a sponsorship for them for lab/development equipment. We also have direct access to the Mixed Reality development team within Microsoft. Within the APJ region we have strong prospects for company-wide deployments of Augmented Reality eyewear and applications with demonstrations already being requested by potential clientele.  In addition to our corporate revenue stream, we will hit the consumer market hard with applications releasing in 2018 with very advanced Augmented Reality features that will draw media attention and consumer excitement.  Firstly, please join us in our Telegram group for more information and to be able to interact directly with staff: https://t.me/AssistiveReality_ARX  We are also of course on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/assistive-reality, and you can view our team here: https://aronline.io/team/  The technology/whitepaper that we completed in November 2017 which will be revised this month, is located here (of note we have incorporated very early provision for Intel's glasses to be supported since the whitepaper, and have moved parts of our core Spectrum engine over to Vuforia natively): https://github.com/assistivereality/ico/raw/master/whitepaper/Assistive%20Reality%20aronline.io%20Whitepaper%20and%20ICO%20v1.9.pdf  ARX 2018 ICO schedule  Legal compliance disclaimer: https://aronline.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/LegalDisclaimerICOandPresale.pdf  Pricing Schedule: Note: ICO limited round (40,000,000 coins only) 09-10 March-     5,000 ARX = 1 ETH [ICO limited day 1 bonus] 10-16 March-     4,500 ARX = 1 ETH [ICO limited week 2] 16-23 March-     4,000 ARX = 1 ETH [ICO limited week 3] 23-30 March-     3,500 ARX = 1 ETH [ICO limited week 4]  Note: ICO unlimited round (220,000,000 coins) 30Mar-2  April- 3,250 ARX = 1 ETH [ICO unlimited day  1 bonus] 2-8   April-          3,000 ARX = 1 ETH [ICO unlimited week 1 bonus] 15-22 April-        2,750 ARX = 1 ETH [ICO unlimited week 2 bonus] 22-29 April-        2,500 ARX = 1 ETH [ICO unlimited week 3 bonus] 29-6  May-         2,250 ARX = 1 ETH [ICO unlimited week 4 bonus]  What you receive when participating in the ICO Firstly, there is only one ARX token and will only ever be one ARX token, and its address is: 0xb0d926c1bc3d78064f3e1075d5bd9a24f35ae6c5 There is only 318M in supply and there will never be any more created. https://etherscan.io/address/0xb0d926c1bc3d78064f3e1075d5bd9a24f35ae6c5#readContract  How to use the ARX tokens ARX tokens will be able to be consumed within our applications for:     Playing AR games from our partner developers within World 1     Accessing premium multiplayer AR zones     Renting, claiming or purchasing physical locations for AR content (advertising or other shared usages)     Placing advertising banners into locations in World 1     Placing business locations and interactive purchase bots into AR zones (e.g. shopping malls, bus stops, walkways)     Creating consumable AR tours within World 1     Activating AI-guidance within World 1     Activating AI-guidance within Profession     Purchasing a content or skills pack within World 1     Purchasing a profession or hobby skills pack within Profession     Corporate clients of the Spectrum engine will consume ARX for site licensing     Corporate clients of the Spectrum engine will consume ARX for application feature enablement     Corporate clients of the Spectrum engine will consume ARX for in-app purchase conversion   1: Some of our links --- Social: Twitter: https://twitter.com/aronline_io/ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/assistive-reality Telegram: https://t.me/AssistiveReality_ARX BitcoinTalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile%3Bu%3D1167273%3Bsa%3DshowPosts Github: https://github.com/assistivereality  Media releases: https://icowatchlist.com/blog/ico-focus-interview-travis-roe-assistive-reality/ https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2217180 [ANN thread] http://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/15682/ann-presale-4-days-left-assistive-reality-augmented-reality-applications-with-ai-assistance/ [ANN thread]  Videos: (OK, ok...I was exhausted from a 20-hour dev marathon...the next video will be better.) https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCac_RbYZcBC7goKDMYZmfDg  Homepage: https://aronline.io/ --- 2: Some commitments:  - We are real people, working on a high technology project. Some of our team until very recently still worked full time for major technology firms; for this and other reasons (market timing) we have not been seeking funding until our company concept received strong commercial validation. We recently signed an agreement with a QLD/AU construction firm to implement AR solutions with regard to building & construction projects, and they are releasing to the media soon (Effcon, part of the Mcfadyen Group). We're also in discussions with two government departments looking at AR for their workforce (one is related to law enforcement!). We had looked at VC options but prefer ICO, for the main reasons - community and social engagement. It's hard to replicate the brand and product loyalty owning a part of it all brings. Funding would occur under either model, yet ICO offers a significant improvement in community engagement, and allows a natural extension of our Ethereum stack integration.  - ICO contracts are heavily reviewed. Around 200 regression test and functional test runs of our main ICO were conducted. - We posted our real information, LinkedIn profiles, social (reddit) accounts, and didn't make dummy-everything to hide behind. - We're building a company we're genuinely excited about. Who wouldn't be - full time AR world-wide, and commercial/professional AR in many more workplaces than just industrial! - The bottom line is that sometimes in ICOs there are genuine funding needs, from genuine companies, we're one of those. I hope that helps your decision to support our fundraising or not. - Finally, to offer the best support, when you purchase ARX tokens you will gain access to our applications via the Redemption smart contract. Even if you choose not to hold all of your tokens, we encourage you to experience our applications first-hand to see what supporting this company has created! ---  Onto the technology. The fun part!!  We're writing code for multiple hardware devices at once. It forms the base platform we call Spectrum. Spectrum's capabilities are beyond the standard encoded by the device in some cases (we oversample and then use transforms on the result and can pull off some neat things like this!). We aim to run our applications natively on Hololens (v2,v3,pro..), the lower cost MS SDK-licensed devices (there are already many in education), and of course, ARKit, ARCore and all the collection of smartphones in the world that that encompasses. There are opportunities for our applications, experiences and licensing in the hands of almost everyone in the modern developed world!  We are focused on two core apps at the moment: 1. World 1 2. Profession ---- World 1 is a consumer-focused always-on AR inteface designed for you to wear at home, in public, or when performing a sporting activity such as cycling or jogging. It will use real-time 3D object recognition to passively identify objects within your world view. If you turn toward after it enters your FOV, or if your focus rests on it sufficiently, World 1 will begin to interact with you. It features an AI assistant that you can personalise upon running the application that will interact with you in a human, natural-language way. The aim is to ensure the AI is psychologically acceptable to you as a human, as a friend or colleague, and will feed you information and assistance in a variety of way, visually and audibly. The AI (which we nickname Arai interally for obv reasons) will even allow you to ask questions and will endeavour to search the internet and provide you with a quick result. It's trained to only retrieve structured data it can understand properly to relay to you. For example you can verbally ask Arai to overlay a sporting match result in a transparent hover while you are working at your desk, and it will comply.  World 1 is working best at the moment on Hololens. We've put a fair bit of our early development spend into Hololens however we are months into our ARCore engine build and the ARKit build will be notably easier after this is complete.  Oh and did I mention? It's multi-user networked. Across platforms. Expect Beta to native app stores in Q2 2018. It will be a revolution. We're publishing standards for the AR Zones and World zones (which of course include paid & sponsored content, paid for by ARX or ETH in your local wallet).  Your biometric IDs are strong-cryptographically hashed onto the public chain with actual data stored on our private Eth blockchain hosted out of Azure. It works really really well, giving low cost, high replication. The aim here is to give you the user experience of signing into your AR headset/augmentation device at home, and equally being able to sign in at a friends place, on their headset. The app and license are not bound to a device and your biometrics are both highly secured and replicated cheaply. ----  Profession,  Profession is similar to a multi-tool for your professional life. Whether you're an IT expert who wants multiple floating screens with transparency adjust, and wall-projections, surface web-browsing, and to do memo functions, or a carpenter who needs immediate accurate point to point measurements, or even an electronics tech who needs to be able to overlay circuit diagrams onto a board while working, Profession will give you what you want. Profession was written under the concept that while AR glasses met with significant social pressure when introduced, that pressure is significantly removed in a workplace setting especially in some areas like Hospitals/healthcare, dentistry, electronics technician, IT workers, construction and building projects. The employer's policy can also dictate adoption due to the huge increases in productivity that become possible. The future really is here right now with workplace AR, and once you've experienced it you just can't go back.  Profession features a similar underlying architecture to World 1, since they both use our Spectrum AR engine. This is how they can both run on multiple platforms with minimal code changes - we are in fact abstracting the hardware slightly by using the common engine's provided APIs. being able to produce an application that can be retained through a hardware replacement and upgrade is a critical point for enterprises and something that is currently not possible. We have strong support from our contacts within Microsoft and Google on this point. Apple are also being open to work with so I see absolutely no issues with this and nothing but huge benefits for corporate users.  The process is this: Open the app store. Install Profession, and select any 2 from the available 500+ job roles database. Once you have loaded the job role, the user interface in the field of view will be adjusted to be more appropriate to your selected profession. With your focused AI elements, you can interact with the real world in a way you've only ever seen in Scifi. This allows us to make a very specific plug in for 'Plumbing engineer' that has focused controls that give visual and audible guidance when performing tasks.  How do we process all this on the glasses and wearable units? Cloud CPU. Or, more specifically, Microsoft's Azure and with access to a lot of compute. The actual link transfer usage (for network bandwidth) is not high, it is not communicating bus commands. The glass device only sends a brief 3D positional and movement profile to our aronline.io service which then identifies the most probably situation and suggests a response the UI could follow including a probability of accuracy assessment. Some interfaces will not change if the probability is not high enough, i.e. some jobs require very high accuracy for certain functions; but not most.  There's more. But you're only human. I could go on for hours. For hours and hours. So instead of that i've done some focused Youtube interviews and produced the whitepaper with my technical design colleagues. But perhaps if you had AR glasses and one of our apps you could read faster, in a more focused way...it's the study of one of our researcher's topics...we have on-staff Phd-qualified human biology experts that will be working full-time on our product set. Fatigue management and assessment, efficiency improvement, distraction science (that's right, distraction is a science!).  Sizing We're now 8 people (up from 4 before presale.) We've got our photos and linkedin profiles in the whitepaper and we are contactable through other media. Please feel free to reach out. We aim to expand our company to 16 people within 18 months. That is aggressive but we want to free the core technology team to work more on the tech and to put in place a media and admin team to support our sales/marketing strategy while it is executed. We are aiming high...as high as possible.  Dates/times Check here also https://aronline.io/participate-in-the-ico/  In sum, I wanted to get the word out about the company, the ICO, and ultimately try to help the great staff and products we've put together to become very successful. The experience of using AR in your every day life, seeing the AI bot notice you return to the fridge at the same time each day, and gently prompting you as that time approaches next time (""Need a drink?""), is highly engaging and in some ways enables an extreme efficiency for the wearer. The way you can wire the events from the API to external sources opens up truly amazing possibilities. When you use this tech in a professional setting, it is a massive game changer both for the wearer and the corporation. This really makes it feel like the future is here now.  We don't have the marketing budget or spend of (some quite questionable!) other ICOs but we integrate tightly with Ethereum as default currency, as storage, as a crypto for our bioprints, and as a matchmaker for online social modes. We strongly support the crypto community and have used coders on ETH development forums for Eth integration pieces.  I hope the technology and our founding team as well as our down to earth non-spin approach get through to some truly visionary people out there, and we can get together in this way to do something truly amazing.  People are worried about AI taking over jobs and rendering humans obsolete. It's not so - and doesn't have to be. Augmenting the human condition with technology - such as is the case with AI-assisted Augmented Reality experiences - is a highly effective way to keep humans competitive in situations where AI might otherwise have a natural inherent advantage; and yet still allow the (possibly quantum) functioning of the human brain to operate the process and provide decision-making where relevant.  Join us in helping to create the future, with this amazing community of crypto supporters and enthusiasts, and the creativity coming in from the AR/MR 3D design world... lets can make this company part of a huge future.

We're taking that to another whole level and bringing social, multiplatform, blockchain currency and enterprise connectivity into the apps.   with the other Q (tried not to quote your re-quote but thanks!) ""I help qoute post you so that the image can appear, whether this project already has the finished product or not?""  >correct yes we have a product. We actually have 3, the Spectrum AR engine, World1  and Profession. Spectrum AR engine is providing an API platform we will offer out to developers in 2019. World 1 & Profession are both up and running on Microsoft devices and Google ARCore, however we haven't got as far yet with ARKit/Apple AR. We have a little extra overhead as we expand to new platforms as we want our engine running natively on each, so we can provide this whole ecosystem later to devs and also offer companies and corporates, Spectrum-AR based deployments, i.e. using the engine for their application i.e. a hospital app for a chain of big hospitals.

Yes sorry about the no bounties etc, we got fairly strong legal warnings about not using any of those specific processes. we were free to use the 10% manual addition as an advertising and promotion system so long as clear about it. the legal aspect here is fairly reasonable otherwise so we didnt want to go causing issues when we could avoid it.  to try to make up for it we got this presale organised, coded up and tested for some way way better token rates esp. day 1, and happy to give anyone 10% off here extra ARX just let me know TX info after purchase via email IM here or telegram.  thanks for checking out the product set and whitepaper, if you do purchase some ARX, we'll have it load into your AR client nicely via the Eth mainchain in whatever qty you like; you might be just wanting to hold some instead of using it into the ecosystem.  I see from the block numbers we're getting very close now!  I'd urge anyone reading to remember the gas requirement too, its called out in a few spots but generally ive seen in testing gas values from 55k to 95k, so to be sure I generally recommend the higher side. It's common for ICOs, and Parity, mist and IM.Token all behave, we also have native token listing within IM.Token. however i always mention it to try and help before ICOs or presales (we've done a few other company's contract coding)",False

We will be pushing hard for this.  In terms of video interviews, 3 days ago we held a video interview with ICOTalk.TV - business@icotalk.tv via Anastasiia Chernenko, the reporter who interview us was Elena. I believe that will hit the internet in the next few days. I've emailed them just now to ask for an update. If its not online soon, I will record a new one this evening to give you a brief update, and to introduce some team members.  Thanks for the interest, do check out the whitepaper, and I will set up an events page soon along with media releases page. Our team is very technical but not as used to ICO/PR style operation so we are learning as we go, but we want to maximise our funding return as the tech is expensive and we want to launch this company properly, and hit the biggest clients first!
