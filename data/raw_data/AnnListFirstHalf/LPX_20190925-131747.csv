Thanks in advance.   1. How come the site is only registered for one year? 2. I see on the road map that the project began a few months back but the site was recently created/put up, is there any reason why the website wasn't created a few months back? 3. Do you have a github? If so can you provide link? 5. In terms of marketing the site hasn't gotten any traffic, what is your marketing team working on implementing to make this a popular ICO? 6. Will the ICO run round after round like IDEA and LIBRA coin? 7.  I see the internal exchange is going to launch within a few days after the ICO, is it finished? If so do you have some screen shot of how the internal exchange looks? 8. Your planning to be listed on external exchanges if so which exchanges? Have you contacted them regarding your listing and is there proof if you have? 9. What makes you different from all these other lending platforms coming out? 10. How come the wallets won't be released until May? We would like to have the block explorer released so we can start staking around the time your internal exchange begins? 11. ARE YOU A SCAM?  I know that was a lot of questions but  I would like to have some feedback.  I'm planning to do a video for my subscribers.",False

WARNING: To make sure everybody will be content with the sale today, we have to give you one last warning regarding the recent events the last 24h.  If you didn´t notice, Coinbase just announced and also listed Bitcoin Cash as their fourth currency on their exchange. This is major news. Combined with the Future Market which just opened the price of BTC can fluctuate tremendously the upcoming days. Because of this events and the enormous transaction costs for BTC, we urge everybody to make the payments on our site with ETH.  Thats only a recomendation and everybody is free to decide which currency he or she will use.    If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.
