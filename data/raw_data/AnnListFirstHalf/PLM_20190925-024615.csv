We consider that our project is unique in comparison with other ICOs, namely in the symbiosis of real production with the integration of the anti-counterfeiting system on block-chain technology. We’ve already produced and sold our ICO and right now we generate profits and get positive feedbacks from our customers. The project team have been formed and checked on the real experience basis. Investors of our ICO have a double guarantee: 1. System of production and the existing product. 2. Anti-counterfeiting system on block-chain technology, which can be used by other companies to protect any products / goods, including digital goods. 3. The launch of a franchise company for start-ups of mini-productions around the world. Proceeding from the facts mentioned above, we can say with the great confidence that the project will be profitable, and the POLYMERIUM (PLM) token will be highly appreciated. Are there any similar products with the lower price on the market? Here everything is clear and simple. The main competitive advantages of POLYMERIUM products are price and quality. According to our data, there are no similar motor oils with the same high indicators and low price. We gain a low price through the application of modern blending technologies and the main simple logistics with the absence of intermediaries. What is the demand for this product? The annual demand only in Russia constitutes about 6 million tons. According to average estimates China needs 6-7 times more. How much money should be invested in the project realization? We would like to attach to the project at least 1 million dollars. This amount would be enough for us to build a plant in Russia using our own additional funds. The ideal amount for us would be at least 5-11 million dollars. These investments would be enough for the plant construction in Russia and China, as well as for the launching of a franchise company around the world, and of course for developing a system of protection against forgery ARMPACK on the block-chain technology. Why not a bank? In fact it’s a greenfield project. Banks try to minimize their risk, they need caution money. And those who nevertheless undertake such projects require a controlling block of shares. The technology that we use is innovative and may attract the interest of our competitors. Equipment of the technology is our main value. In general, we get possibility to manipulate the enterprise and technology. But that’s not the point. It seems to me that now it's a right time for using new technologies in investing Who can become an investor? The main idea is the launch of crowd finding which means that anybody can become an investor. Here the most important things are convenience and transparency of the investment process. Therefore, for our ICO we’ve chosen the Waves Platform. Why have we chosen the WAVES platform for ICO? The main thing we liked about the Waves platform is that it generates tokens very easy. And it is also possible to issue dividends for each token on this platform. In addition, this is a Russian project. I think it has great development prospects. How can an investor protect his inputs? Our investors receive digital token, which is a digital products-backed asset. In fact, this is an option that is sold with a discount. It’s an optional feedstock contract for products with the block-chain technology accompanying. And each investor gets such option. If the option holders will be ready for running their personal data, the company can provide warranty and supporting documents. The company will be annually audited, all the reporting data will be published on the site. The company will install CCTV cameras: any user and investor will be able to watch our working process any time online. If some of the investors will be unpleased with our work and have a desire to get out of the project, it can be done at any time. How long does it take to get back an investment? Investments will pay off completely within one and a half- two years period after the completion of the ICO (it will last about a month and finish in November). If the fundraising is successful, we’ll start the implementation of the project. We’ll ransom the territory in the industrial zone of the Moscow region and begin the construction immediately. The plant can be built in five to seven months period: three months for the erection of the production department buildings and 3-4 months for the manufacture and installation of the necessary equipment. These processes go side-by-side. One more month is enough for equipment checkout. The production process on a new plant is expected to start in April or May next year. After launching the enterprise, we will ransom our tokens back at the expense of the received profits. The tokens will be bought at a price in which the project investment income will be assessed. The repurchase will be carried out during 12 months period. What will you do, if you cannot earn the required amount through the ICO selling? If we cannot earn the required amount or we earn ton enough, we will add money from our own funds and possibly with the involvement of a private investor on certain terms What volume of production will be produced? We will produce 3000 tons a month or more (at first). This is not a very large volume of oils production. Nowadays, this is only one tenth or even one-hundredth part of Russian market requirements. We already have consumers who are ready to buy our products and not only in Russia. Our products gain interest of South Korean, Chinese and European consumers as well. The demand for our products exceeds the possibility of production. Why have you chosen such an unusual method of raising funds for the production? We think that block-chain technology is safe and clear for users. Each user sees what is being bought and sold. Revenues are placed on a separate wallet. All transactions are monitored in real time conditions. The enterprise will be audited annually, all reports will be published. CCTV cameras will be installed: any user and contributor will be able to see our working process in real time. If someone is unhappy and wants to get out of the project, it can be done at any time. . If some of the investors will be unpleased with our work and have a desire to get out of the project, it can be done at any time. If your technology has a good perspective, why are you trying to raise funds through the Internet, in preference to finding an investor? We have investors, but there is one moment. Our project is essentially a venture for the investor. In Russia, the investor wants to get a controlling block of shares from 51% to 80%. Thus it turns out that we are actually selling technology, since the investor has the right to order it around. That's why we decided to take advantage of the block-investment with the use of the block-chains, without losing ownership, but simply by sharing a part of the income with investors. The amount that is required is small, but sufficient to realize the production. If we collect more, we’ll simply increase the capacity of the enterprise. They write to us: You have a complicated investment agreement. The organization of investment attraction through the ICO (initial coin offering) is currently in a ""second"" league, as there is simply no regulation of attracting investments through ICO in many countries. The founders of ICO who want to work legally are forced to bind the sale of digital tokens to the product or to the software. In our case, there is a specific binding to the product (motor oil). Regulation of investment attraction can be changed at any time, therefore, the organizers reserve the right to change the agreement in order to avoid unnecessary problems and fulfill their obligations to investors. Look at the examples of investment conditions in the projects iconomi or chronobank and you’ll be convinced that we haven’t invented something new, we even give guarantees more than others. You affirm that an agreement can be changed at any time. Should I stay on your website 24/7 to watch the changes in the agreement? This is your right, but there is no need.

If you do not agree with our rules or changes you can always discuss or conclude the agreement that suits you, in accordance with paragraph 15.11 of our agreement: 15.11 These terms are not boilerplate. If you disagree with any of them, please contact Plmico.com via e-mail and immediately navigate away from the website. Do not use the website and / or products you are offered thereto until you and Plmico.com have agreed upon new terms of use. We are always ready to communicate and we try to work for the common interest, because the success of our project depends on you. Why did you select the Arbitration Court of Moscow as a court? All assets and executors of this project will be located on the territory of Russian Federation. In the case of conflict situations, it is much easier and quicker to solve the problems that have occurred on this territory. If your technology has a good perspective, why are you trying to raise funds through the Internet, what is the advantage of this method? Why can’t you borrow money from a bank or an investor? I’ll answer this question step by step. Firstly, Russian banks require deposits, which constitute 200% of loan amount. That is, if you want to take a loan for $ 5,000,000 you will need to pay the amount not lower than $ 10,000,000. It turns out that this method does not suit us. Secondly, when you contact an investor you come and say I have a project, there is a technology, there are successful sales. In general, you have it all except for the necessary amounts of money. The investor says: ""yes this is a good project, I'm ready to invest."" But there is one essential condition, the investor wants a share of 60-80% of the company, and we stay with 40 - 20%. And thirdly, if the investor offers us such unsuitable conditions: 20-40% of the profit goes to us, and 60 - 80% of the profit goes to him. Why can’t we use crowd investments to exclude an unnecessary owner in the company and to gain a profit of 60 - 80%? Will the POLYMERIUM token bargain on exchanges? Certainly, it will, at least on the DEX exchange. The success of the ICO will depend on the appearance of the POLYMERIUM token on other exchanges. We’ve been already negotiating with the major exchanges.",False
