In the United States 9-1-1 is our emergency telephone number to request Police/Fire/Medical attention. This service is limited in its ability to track where phone calls are being made as well as its ability to arrive on the scene in a quick time frame. The good majority of the globe do not have access to an organized system such as this, or live in an area where emergency services are privatized and require monthly service fees in order to receive emergency attention. Other regions don't have a formal infrastructure or are completely overwhelmed by their population numbers to where emergencies go unanswered altogether.  Guardian Circle (our API that is free to all smart device users, available now) is an emergency signaling system on your smart device that allows your friends and family to know when you are in an emergency instantly, with full GPS location and functions over Push Notification rather than SMS guaranteeing the emergency messages is received. This means that if your neighbor was listed as one of your 'Guardians' they could be at your house in under a minute, able to reach out to emergency services or transport you to the nearest emergency facility.  Guardium ($GUARD) is the utility token that will be used on the Guardian Circle App Marketplace, allowing for users in those rural/underprepared areas to: Purchase Privatized or Guardian Circle Contracted Emergency Services Remote Sponsor a family member or friend (Send funds to another individual over blockchain) Generate an supplemental income outside of their regular jobs which will help during those emergencies Lower unanswered emergency rates in underdeveloped areas. Act as a data lockbox to keep crucial information such as medical requirements/restrictions, access keys/passcodes that you may need to access during an emergency.  We want to give everyone the access to help in an emergency, even if the government or formal services can't. We want to take the Emergency Services world out of the brick and mortar buildings and put it at your fingertips at all times.",False

The Guardian Circle platform gives users in an emergency situation immediate access to a designated circle of trusted friends, family and neighbors located closest to the crisis, significantly reducing the emergency response time and improving a victim’s chances for survival. Guardians who respond to requests for help are then rewarded in Guardium tokens, which can be redeemed for more services or sold for fiat currency.  Diamandis is an innovation visionary who has founded or co-founded 19 entrepreneurial ventures, including Singularity University, Human Longevity Inc., International Space University, and Planetary Resources. He launched the XPRIZE Foundation in 1994, which leads the world in designing and operating large-scale incentive competitions for “radical breakthroughs” that benefit humanity. XPRIZE is currently teaming with IBM to offer the IBM Watson AI XPRIZE, which in 2020 will give $5 million to the artificial intelligence system that gives the best TED Talk. Diamandis is also an engineer and Harvard University-trained physician, and in 2014, he was named one of Fortune’s World’s 50 Greatest Leaders. He advocates the importance of living with an abundance mindset.  “We are humbled and honored to earn the endorsement of one of the most influential names in innovation today,” said Mark Jeffrey, Co-founder and CEO of Guardian Circle.  “After learning of the immediate impact Guardium can offer its users and the alliances Mark has built around him, it was an obvious fit for me and the work I do,” said Peter Diamandis. “I look forward to working closely with Mark and his team, to save more lives and change the world for the better.”  Available for free on iOS, Apple Watch, Android and Alexa, Guardian Circle is currently used by tens-of-thousands and has established partnerships with Anu and Naveen Jain Women’s Safety XPRIZE, Upchannel, Bee Token, and 0Chain. The app was recently named as a finalist in Fast Company’s World Changing Ideas Awards.  The Guardium Token whitelist, an advanced registration for its token sale, is currently open to applicants where purchasers can receive a 20 percent bonus if they buy before the first five million tokens are sold. The token sale ends on June 1. Those interested in learning more can visit https://guardium.co/ or join the Telegram group here.  ABOUT GUARDIAN CIRCLE Guardian Circle is a new worldwide public utility offering global, decentralized 911 emergency response. It is the first blockchain-based emergency response system to crowdsource safety, enabling users to access a decentralized pool of pre-selected citizen-rescuers who are alerted in the event of an emergency, dispatching aid closest to the situation.

This paper calls for the formation of a decentralized emergency response grid that would be more widely accessible, faster, proximal, scalable, user-friendly and technically advanced than any existing network. Like the creation of ride-sharing services like Uber, Smartphone ubiquity is a precondition for the establishment of such a global network. But the emergence of protocol-based decentralized organizations, distributed ledgers, cryptographic currencies fundamentally shift the economics of providing such a global service. Services like Filecoin, CIVIC, and Tezos have demonstrated that a new class of Global Public Utility provider that is decentralized and protocol-based enables the creation of a unified decentralized network that evolves and updates through its governance framework. Distributed ledger technology can provide an immutable record of responses to emergencies for auditability, accountability and trust. Finally the availability of cryptographic tokens and smart contracts enables a framework for establishing protective relationships, compensating responders and rewarding positive behavior within the network. No government is capable of providing a global network, yet the economic benefit of having a single, final, global provider is evident when considering the user experience of multiple competing networks during an emergency situation.

Here's the 'In English' simple explanation:  How Is Guardium Used?   FIVE WAYS:  1) Creation of Emergency Response Contracts and Form of Settlement (so it’s an economic framework for the 4 billion unbanked people with no 9-1-1).    - Local EMT or doctor    - Ambulance / transport    - Security Response  2) Remote Sponsorship of 9-1-1-like protection for people in the developing world (i.e. send Guardium for them to spend on emergency response)  3) Alert Room transcripts stored on Guardium blockchain    - Transcript of chat    - WHERE everyone was during the Alert    - Timeline of all of the above    - Immutable / tamper-proof evidence    - ONLY the Alerter has custody / access control, not centralized officials  4) Emergency Info Lock Box - Inscribed on Guardium blockchain    - Location of key under the rock    - Secret health issues    - Private keys to cryptocurrency    - Opened only when Alerter declares Alert    - Openable only by Guardians  5) Doubles as a Loyalty Program.
