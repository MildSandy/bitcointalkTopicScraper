The price going up is not a indicator the project is legit or has serious intentions to do the project.Example, Bitconnect was $400 and it was still a scam no matter the price and now it's worth just a few dollars.  All I see is that they release a few youtube videos showing how it works, but no testing is done by the public (in other words the videos are sketchy as hell).There was a twitter fiasco too with one of their Devs a few months ago (the Dev told there was no working product and even they can't test it).+The founders past is not the best..  I can't stop anyone from investing into the project, but for me there is too much red flags..    https://twitter.com/dnwiebe/status/955426521619017728",True

I took some screenshots as I was reading it. I'm sure they've fixed a lot of it by now but I'm in shock by how incredibly poor this was. I hope they weren't paying anyone to write the copy because this is just absolute poop. If they paid someone to do this it's a bad sign that the Substratum management can't assess good writing and doesn't have any better options to do the work. Alternatively, they might have written the thing themselves, in which case it's terrifying that they can only write at an eighth-grade level and that they didn't realize their poor copy should be edited before it is published.  Anyway, here are some screenshots and my comments on them. The list is long and tedious but got damn, there is just a ton of shitty writing all over this project. I'm shook. Just about every paragraph had something terrible in it.  https://imgur.com/a/7tfuyE1 The author used ""borne"", that probably should be ""was born"" but isn't strictly wrong. They use borne here but don't stick to it throughout the website, though, so it looks like a mistake. ""Three separate products..."" This entire thing is not a sentence. ""The ability to Connect, Earn and Spend."" is absolutely not a sentence and none of those words have any reason to be capitalized. ""...digital borders raised..."" Walls are raised, borders are drawn.  https://imgur.com/a/zDaVCjR ""Setting out in July 2017..."" This should be ""July of 2017"" or something like that. This whole sentence should probably be two sentences as it wanders quite a bit. ""...one single whole hybrid web..."" This is babble, and it's also a big new idea brought up near the top of the page without any explanation. ""...this project ensures..."" This looks like it's the start of a second sentence. Honestly this whole sentence is just shit, I don't even know what they're doing here.  https://imgur.com/a/zztpVYt ""...gateway to allow..."" This should be ""that allows"". Elementary stuff, guys. ""Crypto to crypto transactions..."" This is an adjective and should be hyphenated. This is the first of many hyphenation errors, the author doesn't know when to use them. ""...crypto to fiat resolution..."" Another adjective without hyphens. ""...third party tools..."" Another adjective without hyphens. This whole last sentence is just too long. It may be a run-on.  https://imgur.com/a/WYWELX7 ""...third main need..."" None of these needs were enumerated before in this document. If they're so ""main"" why are there three of them? Poor writing.  https://imgur.com/a/HSAYIUL ""...web-site..."" The author finally uses a hyphen and they screw it up. This whole sentence is phrased weirdly and wordily. The paragraph should probably be restructured to describe distributed exchanges (also not a proper noun) first and then go on to say that they're a majority of the space. Whatever ""the space"" is. Also not sure why they got into the weeds with words like ""relational database"" in a high-level sales pitch.  https://imgur.com/a/e0ioNCg That second paragraph is a train wreck of a run-on sentence. ""...or worse loss of funds."" Try "", or worse,"", it needs to have commas. ""...also."" Wrong.  https://imgur.com/a/hCZ6POM ""...best in breed..."" Another adjective without hyphens. ""...blockhain based..."" Another adjective ""Learn More..."" Not sure why More is capitalized.  https://imgur.com/a/A6x5XPf ""One of Amplify's strengths..."" This is unclear. What does it mean to ""serve up"" a portfolio? What is this portfolio API that you're talking about. This is the first time it's been mentioned on the website. ""This is just another step..."" This should be phrased differently, either folded into the sentence above it or left out entirely (if it's truly revolutionary you don't need to hit people over the head with the idea that it is). ""Tokens and Coins..."" These aren't proper nouns! ""...purchase through..."" purchaseD ""...through this direct integration."" Wordy and unnecessary. Kill it.  https://imgur.com/a/D7c2LpU This second paragraph is amateurishly choppy and wordy.  https://imgur.com/a/rqt8SoD ""...is huge and has never been done before!"" Show, don't tell. Amateurish.  https://imgur.com/a/cjP1D4b ""...called: The Popularis Protocol."" This is the wrong use of a colon and the ""The"" shouldn't be capitalized. The sentence should be flipped around to not use the colon. ""...the block number is an odd or even on the ledger."" If a number is odd or even you just say ""is odd or even."" No ""an"". The part about ""on the ledger"" looks redundant in the grammar of the sentence and is likely wrong in a technical way.  https://imgur.com/a/gngM95w Enumerating the odd and even integers? Do you really hold your readers in that low regard? I mean, I guess they have to, if they're writing like this the kind of person who falls for this poop has to be a moron. I am also pretty sure they're using the last digit of the block number for this which is not mentioned anywhere.  https://imgur.com/a/yiEIzM2 ""...even numbered block..."" Another adjective without a hyphen! ""...still..."" this word adds nothing to the sentence and should be deleted. The last sentence needs a ""for"" and has to lose a comma.  https://imgur.com/a/91mKzTT ""...odd numbered block,..."" Needs a hyphen! The comma is wrong too. The previous paragraph had the bad comma as well. ""...providing..."" provides.  https://imgur.com/a/k4fHPba ""...often, and fairly,..."" These commas don't belong there! Wondering if ""stakeholders"" is not the best word to use here given that proof of stake is part of the system while this paragraph is using it to mean all miners. On the technical front, how are you dealing with sybil attacks?  https://imgur.com/a/g3PWYlc ""...history long rooted..."" How about ""long-rooted history""? You probably could have googled that one. ""...technology from..."" This is a run-on sentence. Going to go out on a limb and guess that Justin wrote all the copy for this website because his own bio has all these stupid mistakes in them. ""Maintaining..."" This sentence should start with ""After"" to make a prepositional phrase out of the first part of the sentence. The sentence is incorrect without it. ""...Ecosystem..."" This isn't a proper noun.  https://imgur.com/a/0nyvhqN ""...excutive team's..."" Take a guess! ""3 of those..."" ""...1 on..."" Numbers must be spelled out. ""IPO-ed"" Not seeing this hyphenated in a Google search, looks wrong to me. ""...Cryptocurrency..."" Lowercase! ""...institutional grade..."" Hyphens! The rest of this sentence is garbage too. ""Also as importantly,..."" bad grammar ""...post ICO..."" HYPHENS. This sentence is also a sentence fragment. ""..Banking, Finance, Technology and Fundraising..."" none of these are proper nouns. Not even a little bit. ""...hungry maturing..."" This should be a series.  https://imgur.com/a/FpOPUaD ""...Investment Advisor."" This isn't a proper noun. ""...engineering, Warren..."" I think this comma is wrong but not sure. ""...Stocks, Options, Futures, and Cryptocurrency..."" None of these are proper nouns as well. Wondering if these two bios were both written by the same secondary author.  Anyway that was a bunch of nonsense, this whole thing is amateurish crap, I can't believe nobody else is in as much disbelief as I am so I guess that means the people buying this thing are a bunch of dumb sheep.",True

The Sub nodes encrypt the data sent so the exit nodes cannot see your information.  Tor exit nodes have all your information available. NSA and hackers use directed tor exit nodes to spy and steal information. There are products that use the same routing methods substratum uses now but they rely on the trust of a human "" a third party auditor "" to ensure your privacy and information is not stored. Substratum uses the blockchain to ensure privacy and security of your information.

Here it is:  In the two demo videos video they did (here and here), Justin did something I didn't really understand:  The original DNS is 0.0.0.0 Localhost is 127.0.0.1 The default DNS settings is 0.0.0.0 (normal DNS) He changed it to localhost, 127.0.0.1 Then, he ran Substratum Node, but with the parameter ""--dns_servers 0.0.0.0""  I don't really know how this parameter is supposed to work, however we can suppose it redirects the DNS requests to 0.0.0.0.  So in fact, when the browser sends a request to the DNS : - it is set to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) so the request is sent to 127.0.0.1, - SubstratumNode take the request, send it to the DNS set in the command parameter, so 0.0.0.0 - It receives the answer, and send it to the browser So, the program would just be redirecting the requests from localhost (127.0.0.1) to 0.0.0.0.

In my opinion: - If you have a trader approach, I think you should buy soon because the market is quite low actually (although it can go lower) - With a technical approach, it is a bit different: if you are very confident in the project, you can invest now, so that when a product is released, you can make profit. Otherwise, you can wait a working product is released and then invest on the growth potential of the project. The last one is the less risky, and this is a long term investment. You're free to choose, the market needs winners and loosers anyway.",True

He may have meant that they now have no working network to test or that they can't test their newest ideas or that they currently (as he phrased it) have no way to check if things work out as they think they will. As in 'we currently can't test the network because we don't have the nodes active like in the Alpha Test', the point is you don't know, as you don't work there.  That said, I think that it is always important to question things and that a community's responsibility is in part to check if a company stays on track. And a company can use his community and listen to what's going on resp. how they are perceived in public. That's why I appreciate their decision to give us weekly updates, starting tomorrow.

You can't interpret someone's written words without knowing all the context. And, as mithrim correctly pointed out, you don't know all the context as you don't work there.  It's good to stay sharp and critical, but it's also important to give a team and project some time and room to grow. These people don't have time to give everyone who might mis-interpret their words a full explanation of what they exactly meant, because then they wouldn't have any time left to work on the project.  Give the team a chance. They've got a great idea, great marketing and I'm still absolutely positive that they can pull it off.

He even keeps on explaining things. Wait for releases, be patient.

But I'm so relieved that Substratum doesn't rush things because I'd bet my last shirt on it that if they'd presented a working POC with some bugs, the internet would've gone crazy and blamed them for not having a perfect product.

Either you trust them, then just wait and judge them when you actually tested their product or you don't trust them, then (re)search another project and invest your time and money there.

(1) The CEO said he beat up a guy decades ago for sexually harassing his sister. He got charged for it, but it was really a ""bad"" thing. That's his story at least. He got charged with a bunch of things for that. While we don't know what really happened, what we should know is that in the United States, thanks to Bill and Hillary Clinton, you can never escape a criminal record - it stays with you wherever you go, and for any reason. Even if what you did was morally justified.  (2) Marijuana possession crimes aren't really taken seriously...  Now let's get real... with the real facts  (3) DataDash, youtuber who can influence markets, was PAID 200K SUBSTRATUM (a couple thousand dollars at the time) to talk about Substratum in one of his videos. It means that they bribed someone for marketing/publicity, not on the merit of their non-existent coin/platform.  This is what I mean by ICO/millions of dollars of marketing: Teams like SHIFT, with better product (well, actually just a product that exists) and better workers, but no money, don't have the ability to bribe crypto celebrities to mass-market their coin.  Nevertheless, word gets out eventually, but it takes a lot longer, which gives the undervaluation.  (4) A quote from reddit, which is factually correct:  ""It's easy to tear down the paper tigers. However, only one sentence at the end gives any time to the real issues at hand. We are being told the finished product will have:  *Distributed web with dynamic content *Anonymity better than Tor (BTW, this is totally ridiculous - it would mean that Sub would be better than virtually all the privacy tokens out there...) *Visibility of in-network anonymous hosts from outside via regular URLs *Ability to evade ISP / state firewalls *Developer platform for additional features on top of nodes *Cross-crypto payment gateway *IoT  Entire projects with larger teams are focused on only one topic above. Substratum is telling us they're doing it all. We have no code and no one even going so far as to anonymously acknowledge being in private testing.""

As a result, coins like Sub go up quite a bit (although we're still in the middle of a mass-market correction).  However, this also means that investing strategy needs to be rethought - personally I will always invest mainly in the objectively best coins, the ones the have a product, and perhaps also masternodes or PoS (which are both passive income - there is nothing new here), but I am starting to rethink the price potential of coins like Substratum, which are based on hype.

Alternatively extant blockchains will be coupled to a platform bridge like an exchange to expand use case for currently under utilized coins/tokens, everything from $1m to $100b chains would then suddenly ""spring to life with a reason for being"" as the foundation of a new global web engine & currency.

However there are a few different aspects of the Substratum project from what I've become aware of (learned alot by talking to some of the admins / devs in their slack which is very active)  Substratum node - will host web content and split up files / encrypted across many nodes. Hosting fees are paid via microtransactions to the nodes that end up serving the content or chosen as the best node to serve the file chunks from due to region or speed. They have a video with a demo you can view of the node interface which shows you can select how much ram, cpu, drive space to the node software, and also schedule it to turn on when your at work or asleep so its not running when your using your computer. Illegal content like kiddy porn would be community flagged, and no single full file would be posted on any one node, so nodes would not be able to try to decrypt any content they are hosting because they would only have a file chunk, not the whole file. The more content you serve up on the network, the more SUB coins you earn which dumps directly into your wallet address  Crypto payment gateway - would be like a paypal module websites can put on their site to accept crypto and receive either fiat or crypto of their choice. The user can choose which crypto to pay with and the merchant can also select which currency they wish to receive  Substratum video - very few details about this but they mentioned they would also have a module or part of their project to build a video hosting network across the substratum nodes  Micro node - very few details about this also, but eventually as more and more computing power is increasing in the form of mobile devices, you could assist with serving smaller content from your phone, running a mobile lightweight version of the node interface.   2nd token burn coming up, price just rose slightly and they are close to 2nd place community vote for listing on Binance. If your interested now is the time to finish your research and get in because the price could rise over the coming week  Disclaimer: I hold a few thousand SUB",True

The referral bonus system won't allow a smart contract to send the tokens automatically to your ETH wallet. They have to do it manually if you really want to get the 5, 10 or 15% bonus.

So Referral bonuses are making the distribution of the ICO really tedious and slow, there is a backlog of 72, 96 or more hours.

Ipfs is just peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more ope  MaidSafe does not have the same solution SUBstratum offers for DNS  Substratum lets you keep your domain name also without needing to have .maidsafe.com E.g..  Facebook.maidsafe.com  So this goes much much deeper, from bottom to up to fix the centralized internet so i understand your frustration, that you are afraid your investments in shift or maidsafe could be affected by this.

I wouldn't be too concerned about that aspect of it personally.   This is the official response  (Justin Tabb, Substratum’s founder posted a reply a day ago responding to this but it seemed the comment got hidden as he didn’t have enough karma in this group.) I work on the marketing team with Substratum and his comment in summary was that: - Those are real screenshots of the alpha version which were done by hard core back end developers who don’t have a background in design. - It was meant as an internal piece of software to prove that we could do it. Once we did prove that we could do it we decided to show the world our project and ambitions. - The new version is being completely redesigned from the ground up and while it will have the same features it will be something completely fresh. Thank you for your concern and discussing it with us all, Let me know any other questions you may have, we’d love to answer them.  So yeah they are basically accepting they took the core design from istats or whatever, but that doesn't mean they are a scam. And also that doesn't mean that they will use that design at the end, they probably will change it , is was just meant to show a concept. ",True

Someone notices that the substratum screenshots were nearly identical to iStat Menus, posts a reddit thread questioning it. 2. Substratum addresses this by saying this: http://i.imgur.com/zhgLqy6.png - They are saying that it is a *screen capture* of their software *running* and they somehow ""based"" it on iStat Menus even though iStat Menus is not open source so there is no way they could grab the interface out of it easily, not like they would even bother trying since they could just photoshop it. 3. I discover irrefutable proof that in fact that is what they did, that is, photoshop.  I guess they assumed no one would be able to tell from the zoomed out screenshot, but a full res copy was found on their server not available normally.  I asked them in slack to address this, all they had to do was record a small video of someone interacting with their software or something, nothing that could be photoshopped.  Obviously they refused and came up with excuses that they did not have access to the software at the moment, and that I was ""FUDing"" even said I ""had too much time on my hands"".  This is $2,000,000.00 of people investing into this to date, with more as we speak.  At best they are pathological liars, worst this is federal investment fraud.",True

We will be able to serve Substratum Requests directly to the default browser (Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer) without any special software installed on the average consuming users computer.  How Substratum Works  Ease of Use: currently nearly everything that has to do with crypto or the blockchain is very difficult to use and requires technical knowledge. Through our 10+ years of experience working with companies like Apple we understand the importance of a good user experience.  The average internet user requires NO special software to use the Substratum Network. The default browser will service all requests for average users so they do not need to do ANYTHING different. Users who wish to service requests and receive SUB coins in return will have a point and click user interface that any user can setup. No technical knowledge required. SubstratumPay will be seamlessly integrated and geared towards high conversions of low technical expertise users.  Serving Up of Decentralized Content: Substratum provides a method for serving Decentralized Content (including Web Sites, Data, and Applications) through a Mac, Windows, and Linux application/service that is easy to install and run (requires no technical expertise) and serves up decentralized content using the toolkit that we have developed.  This is a point and click process and requires zero technical knowledge.  All the user has to do is install the application, click through a few settings and they are up and running and making Substratum Coin.  Incentivizing Users to Serve the Content: in order to incentivize users to run the Substratum Network client on their machine we will be providing Substratum Coin to them for doing so. The coin is issued to the serving machine through a micro-transaction from the hosting site to the serving computer. By breaking fees down to a micro-transaction level this will greatly reduce the overall cost to companies and entities that want to host sites and applications on the internet solving yet another problem with the web as it stands today.  Privacy / Security / Encryption: by allowing millions of Substratum Network users to serve content the biggest concern becomes privacy and security. Substratum solves these issues through advanced cryptography algorithms rooted in Artificial Intelligence that ensures all data remains secure. Following the lead of BitCoin this is the strength of cryptocurrency and the crypto movement.  Storage and Serving of Content: in order to serve millions of sites, databases, and applications the Substratum Network employs custom developed advanced compression algorithms and machine learning to geolocate the right Substratum Network machine to serve up the content to the appropriate user based on geolocation, this will ensure the fastest load time with the lowest amount of latency and strain on the Substratum Network and both the serving and receiving machine.  DNS (Domain Name System): DNS or the Domain Name System is the system that currently tells your browser where to go when you type in a domain name. For instance when you go to Chrome and type in apple.com a DNS lookup is performed to check where to send that request, the DNS system comes back with an IP address and your request is routed there. In the first version of SubstratumDNS will be a complex, AI enabled DNS server that will receive DNS requests along with the geolocation of the requestor and find based off of that information the closest available SubstratumNode that is able to fulfill the request. Development Tools for the Decentralized Web: the Substratum Network will provide an API and SDK for developing tools on the Substratum Platform. This will bring in strong developer support and will accelerate the growth of the decentralized web on the Substratum Network.  Net Neutrality: with the Substratum Network ALL web-sites and applications will have EQUAL ability to be broadcast in an equal and fair manner.  International Digital Barriers: currently countries like China have strict regulations on what their 1.379 billion citizens are able to interact with on the internet. Substratum will break down these barriers through a network of decentralized computers running the Substratum Network Software. Where other solutions that are currently used by residents in these countries require special software to be installed, like TOR, Substratum will take a reverse approach and require no special software for the average user.  High Hosting Costs: currently businesses must pay high hosting fees to get their web-sites on the internet. Amazon Web Services launched a 3.5BIL USD per year business by attempting to solve this problem. They allow you to pay for how many minutes you run a web / database server. Substratum completely solves this problem through the power of cryptocurrency by only charging for each request that is processed.",True
