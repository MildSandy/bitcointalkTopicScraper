People stealing content is something that will come up, but we have some mechanisms planned that will greatly reduce it. To sell a deck a user will have to link their account, once their account is linked purchasers will be able to see their rank. It takes hundreds even thousands of hours to reach a high rank in these games (we anticipate most people selling to be in the top 10%), which will outweigh the benefit of stealing content. We will also scan all user content for duplicates and deal with it on a case by case basis. Content theft is a big deal and we will make sure it is as hard as possible to get away with it.   Your point about the demographic being averse to crypto is valid. What we've done to combat this is incentivize content creation, and the linking of accounts by giving new users Deck Coin for these actions. This kind of coin distribution ensures many users will have a small amount to learn and use the platform. It will also be hard to cheat for these coins because leveling up in these games takes a lot of time (or electricity if they are botting accounts).  The creation of our own token also greatly helps introduce users to crypto. We can more easily sponsor tournaments and reward users for posting content. Instead of introducing a card game player to Ethereum, which might not be useful to them beyond our platform, we can introduce them to Deck Coin, which has more clear and understandable use case.  Thanks again for taking the time to respond with questions. If my answers were not clear or did not address your points completely I'd be more than happy to discuss further.",False
