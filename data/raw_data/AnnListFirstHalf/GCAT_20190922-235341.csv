Contact: ir@pave.com for details    GCP.Pave aims  at building a unique decentralized credit bureau which will forever change the way people perceive credit.  Lack of access to credit is a global problem. The World Bank estimates that 2 billion people worldwide “do not have access to a basic bank account” and that in all regions apart from high income economies borrowing from friends and family is often the only way to access credit.   Pave will use Blockchain technology to put consumers in control of their own financial profile and in doing so, empower the individual to become their own form of credit bureau, more accurate, complete and secure.      Having spent 5 years lending to those with limited credit histories, Pave is building a decentralized and Global Credit Profile (the “GCP”) that gives a user visibility, ownership and control over their financial data.       Diagram showing the current consumer credit ecosystem versus the Pave envisaged ecosystem    With the launch of the GCP, Pave intends to develop a decentralized ecosystem and marketplace for the transaction, utilization and validation of consumer financial data. By removing the middlemen and placing individuals in charge of their financial data, Pave’s GCP will enable a faster, more reliable and cheaper transmission of financial data. The effect of this change will distribute profits currently being made by the credit bureaus and credit scoring companies back to consumers and the providers of data. By empowering individuals with access to their financial data, millions of people’s lives will be impacted for the better through better access to credit.    Pave plans to introduce a global credit access token (a “GCAT”) to enables access to the Pave ecosystem and marketplace. Through the purchase of a GCAT, holders will be empowered and incentivized to upload, view and transact consumer financial data. Holders will also be able to gain access to and exchange their tokens for products and services pay for Apps that evolve within the Pave ecosystem. The only means of accessing the Pave ecosystem is via the GCAT.    As more and more users connect their financial data via the GCP, an unrivaled set of financial data will be created and network effects will start to kick in. Financial service providers and other users of financial data will be attracted to join the ecosystem due to its unique breadth and depth of data, as well as attractive costs compared to incumbent data providers. Users will be attracted to connecting their financial data because of the visibility and control it affords and the better access to financial products and services. As more and more users join the Pave ecosystem the value of the network will grow. This increase in value in turn will push up the value of each token as the number of tokens is absolute.    Those people who have been devoting immense amounts of effort to traditional Pave and who basically brought it to the point where it is now, are going to work on GCP. This fact, again, fosters the belief in success of the new venture.     We also acknowledge and appreciate the help of our professional advisors who support us in creating the GCP     Facebook | Telegram | Twitter | LinkedIn | Reddit",False
