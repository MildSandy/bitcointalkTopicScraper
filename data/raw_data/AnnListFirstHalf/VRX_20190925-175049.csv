Viarium has more advantages in which you might be interested:  Users get instant access to hundreds of thousands of goods either from home or a Viarium “islet” at physical access points throughout the world. Customers can pay for goods both with internal VRX platform tokens or fiat money*. In the future, the VR technologies will ensure tactile sensations in virtual space. Businesses have their lease, payroll, logistics and tax costs reduced, and save time while increasing traffic. No space limits exist in a virtual world. Thus the platform users are spared from excessive autocratic costs such as commercial cargo customs clearance or entry visas for traveling abroad. Customers can satisfy their demand for products from any point worldwide while saving their money and time. Business owners can increase net profit by reducing their costs. The customer base will grow due to access to a wider consumer audience. Users will be able to enjoy noncommercial goods such as for example, objects of art, in any corner of the world. People will be able to share their inventions, collectors’ goods and other items in the comfort of their home.",False

Thank you for your trust in our project. We currently receive a big number of financial offers from major venture investors. After long negotiations, we are happy to announce the cooperation with a new big partner. Due to the current situation on the cryptocurrency market and project’s re-focusing on the Asian market, we are forced to postpone the token sale. Dates of pre-sale from 01.06.18 to 14.07.18 and of token sale 01.08.18 - 31.08.18. Additional time will be required to finalize legal aspects of the project in accordance with new requirements for organizations attracting investments through the token sale. Thanks to fresh investments, we are elaborating the marketing campaign. We are also adding new presentations at the world's leading blockchain events. We will issue the announcement of upcoming roadshows by 15.04.18. To compensate these adjustments, we reward 50% of tokens to all existing investments.
