Nvidia has its own server farms and offer their service for a calculated price (I think 9,99$ a month). Playkey though has the advantage that they can have ""server providers"" (aka miners) all over the world, which SHOULD improve their service, BUT they have to pay the miners of course. That basically means they have to take higher fees from subscribers, which isn't great. Consumers are not big fans of subscriptions and tend to take the least expensive. ",False

But when Netflix came to the market, it was a different situation. First of all, people already wanted a service like this for a long time. There already were a few like Hulu (mostly TV-Shows), but nothing really outstanding. Besides, people are used to pay for cable, so it  wasn't something really new. Cloud Gaming is new though ... and personally, I tried it several times, but it never impressed me. The delay is the most annoying part. Although it is only a few MS ... you still notice it ... and me personally, I just can't play like that. Especially in these days, when games tend more and more to run with 60 FPS+ and have this very direct input feel.  Regarding Playkeys advantage - Playkey has its own server farms (like all competitors), but basically everyone with a gaming pc and a fast internet connection, can offer it for others too. So, in theory, assuming Playkey will have a lot of miners, the gaming experience should be better in contrast to the competition, because there is a higher chance that the gaming server is actually near your location. The further away the server farm is located, the higher the chance that you get a high input lag + you are able to play games at all.",False

On this stage we plan to find all the bugs and develop SLA (service level agreement) that can be used by home miners and semi-pro miners. The main goal, is to provide gamer with the best quality, so miners shall apply special requirements, like broadband quality, hardware specification, traction rating.  We have already signed contracts with GigaWatt (http://giga-watt.com ) and Gcore (http://Gcore.lu). Other companies are also welcome.  Stage 2: Home Miners. (6-9 months)  On this stage, we will make Playkey mining available to everyone, who has a powerful gaming computer or a mining farm, that can be used for launching games in good quality. Home miners have to fulfil the SLA (service level agreement), that they will be able to provide gamers with fluent streaming and high game fps (frames per second).",False

Also, wouldn't the Playkey miners also have to make sure that they have the other decent components required to run the game (eg.

In PlayKey's whitepaper they also show $10 a day which is about $300 a month.  DigRate assumes a usage rate of 50%. Not sure what they are basing that on. Maybe 50% downtime or no gamers. That is how they estimate $150 per month earned through PlayKey. If you can get the usage rate to 100% for example because of more gamers, then you cut your ROI in half too.  Another competitor DigRate mentioned is Vortex.gg. They have a $10 flat fee a month for unlimited hours.

The planned launch time is 6 months after the end of the ICO. What use is this to a miner, if he already has a powerful PC and can play top-of-the-line games on his computer? What he can spend tokens on, if he does offer his computing power for rent?  The miner will be able to sell the earned tokens on an exchange in return for other cryptocurrencies or fiat money (real money). He will also be able to spend the tokens to purchase Playkey game keys. I have a powerful computer. How much can I earn as a miner through your system?  A miner’s income will depend on several factors. First, the amount depends on the computer: The more powerful it is, the more value it offers. Users are willing to pay more for such a computer.  Secondly, the price will be determined by the market. A miner posts his price, and if there is user demand, then the miner will earn based on the specified price and the number of users playing on it. To precisely predict the amount now is very difficult.  With the current Playkey.net service, you can apply the following calculations: 1 hour of gaming on ultra settings (GTX 1080) costs $1. Assuming that the server will be busy 12 out of 24 hours, the revenue after deducting the commission will come to about $10 per day. At the same time, there is still the opportunity to do the old kind of mining when users are not playing, and thus to receive additional income. So in any case the income will be higher than from the usual sort of mining. Why does a miner pay 25% to the Playkey Foundation?  The Playkey Foundation will organize the work of the community of miners, refine the platform, and advertise the service and the miners’ servers. By what scheme are the revenues distributed among all participating miners?  A miner’s income is determined by the terms of the smart contract with a specific user. So the more users play on a miner’s computer, the higher his income. A user will be able to select a miner on his own and conclude a smart contract with him on individual terms, or enable the option of automatically searching for a miner by key parameters, first of all by distance from the user and connection quality.",False

If you could create some kind of issuance for PKT that goes along with every Ethereum Block and rewards each miner based on a performance index reported from the cloud software (fractals/sec, Gigaflops, Teraflops, etc.), it can create a more reliable system for a larger number of miners.  You could also add a difficulty algorithm to this based on the total hashpower to limit the amount received related to the computing power similar to legacy mining.

Or he selects automatic mode, whereby Playkey autonomously analyzes demand and manages the games on his computer to maximize his profit and, accordingly, that of the service.

What needs to be considered is, that you need some pretty good software, that is able to distribute hardware resources. What the huge cloud gaming providers do, is basically having big servers and using virtualization to give customers the hardware they need on demand. Of course most of private miners won't have the hardware (that is super expensive), nor the knowledge to configure the whole stuff.

Everything is explained in that one document.   But because I'm in a good mood, I will answer it for you:  How will the token be used? Playkey introduces an open source cryptographic token – PKT. PKT is a cryptocurrency that will be used to buy and sell cloud gaming subscriptions as well as other Playkey services and future products. It will be the unit of account for all economic transactions within the Playkey Ecosystem, and will be used as a basis for interaction with other digital services.   How much do you want to gather on ICO? Playkey plans to set up an ICO with an issuance volume of 100 000 000 PKT tokens 1 PKT = 0.004 ETH  Why do you need a blockchain? Playkey will be a blockchain-based decentralized ecosystem for gaming services that will cover the following market segments and participants: • The core participants in the Playkey Ecosystem are gamers and miners (cloud gaming hardware providers). Playkey is expected to build a large, private and professional community of miners, and become the largest streaming service provider and marketplace in the world. • At a later stage, Playkey plans on expanding the ecosystem, decentralizing other functions (R&D, game publisher relations, marketing), and connecting to the platform other gaming market elements and segments such as developers and publishers, in-game currencies, e-sport and live streams, apps and content creation.",False

The direction they are taking, eventually, will allow those with high end gaming rigs to rent them out when not gaming. You own a nice gaming rig, when you're not using it you load their virtual machine and let the rig ""mine"" playkey tokens by letting others use your rig. Nvidia is going the centralized route which is probably why playkey is changing things up going decentralized, taking idle rigs and putting them to work for others. This should allow them to compete on price if they get scale. Idle rigs just need to make a little more then power costs to make it worthwhile. Doesn't mean the rig will pay for itself by mining, Nvidia needs to ROI all the hardware they put in the cloud. Just a thought, and I could be wrong about their business plan but it's only way they can compete, putting idle rigs that were already purchased by gamers to work when not being used. And ""mining"" palykey tokens won't use as much power as mining other crypto since you're not running at 100% the entire time.

There's a limited supply, so if this takes off the subscription price can stay the same but more customers will mean more people buying $10 or whatever worth of the token. Same reason Bitcoin went up, limited supply. So the currency being limited means more people using the service the higher the price has to go, simple supply and demand.  All that said 100 million tokens is a pretty big supply, and it needs scale for it to even compete, and for the tokens to rise in value. Only reason I'm looking at it is their is an established company with almost a million customers already using their services. The white paper leaves a lot of questions, is playkey going to buy servers and ""auction"" them off going the data center route because then that is going head to head with Nvidia and seems like I'd rather own equity in the company than tokens. If this is going to lead to people with idle rigs renting them out (mining) at low rates then this could be a more cost effective way to offer gaming as a service. I'm interested but probably pass because I'm not clear on the business plan but will follow. I saw the price was lowered to 0.004 ETH is that the presale price or the Nov. 1st price? ",False

After reading the whitepaper I'm going to go ahead and call it a scam (not that in 7 pages anyone seem to care if this project could even work, people just seem to just blindly trust the project showing exactly what's wrong with ICOs).   First off, you can't possibly run already existing games in a decentralized manner. Running interactive games is not just 3D rendering, the game has to practically fully run on the ""mining"" machine including resources like CPU/RAM/storage.  And you can't run the majority of games multiple time (online DRM, 1 account/instance) so multiple miners running the same game for one player is impossible.  So it's already centralized in a sense that 1 miner = 1 player. And if that miner has issues the player will lose progress. The gamer would also want to play games on his account which would be hard to hide from the miner who would be running the game introducing security issues.  Streaming like Nvidia Shield or Steam Link works because they do so locally. The nvidia shield for example requires ""50 Megabits per second – Recommended for 1080p 60 FPS quality"" (source) which is easy to get on your local WiFi which probably have 70-100 Mbps speeds. Now players would need 50Mbps internet connection and miners would require 50Mbps per game they ""mine"". You could say 720p 30fps is enough but even old hardware can achieve that without latency and having to pay for it. And don't even dream about 4k...  The whitepaper argues that most people can't play games with the highest settings but most people also doesn't have a stable 50Mbps internet connection. So the video feed would have to be compressed which means a maxed out game will look like it's on low settings. An uncompressed video feed would require very fast (as in high bandwidth) internet. Steam's average download rate is 33.6 Mbps currently in the US including gamers with their own gaming PCs who also tend to afford faster internet.   The whitepaper also says such delusions as mining would be • 2-3 times more efficient than any altcoin mining add opportunities; • More stable in the short, medium and long term than cryptocurrency mining;  Which is just nonsense they can't possibly know.   And even if the impossible could be done and more computers could collectively stream the same game in a decentralized manner for 1 person playing, one miner having a lagspike or any short issue would surely create visual glitches and redundancy would make the cost unfeasible. But again, you can't render current games in real time without the whole game running so it's a moot point. Shit, some games can't even use more than 1-2 CPU cores or use SLI ffs...   And of course if this already existing proprietary platform would really exist, you wouldn't need an ICO. This project just smells like just another scam ICO seasoned a random interesting topic.",False

Did you try our service at Playkey.net ? We have thousands of customers in Europe and CIS countries, so it is definitely NOT SCAM.   First off, you can't possibly run already existing games in a decentralized manner. Running interactive games is not just 3D rendering, the game has to practically fully run on the ""mining"" machine including resources like CPU/RAM/storage. Yes, you right. We have more requirements for miners, like CPU, RAM, HDD, Network.  But if you want to earn more money, you can upgrade your farm and work with us.   And you can't run the majority of games multiple time (online DRM, 1 account/instance) so multiple miners running the same game for one player is impossible. We have a technology with isolated gaming sessions between each other.   so multiple miners running the same game for one player is impossible. You right, we stream only from one miner.     So it's already centralized in a sense that 1 miner = 1 player. And if that miner has issues the player will lose progress. The gamer would also want to play games on his account which would be hard to hide from the miner who would be running the game introducing security issues.  You right, that decentralized Playkey have security  tasks, that is why we use blockchain technology for our project. Miner will lose money if he will have security problem, it is the same as for Playkey miner.    Streaming like Nvidia Shield or Steam Link works because they do so locally. The Nvidia shield for example requires ""50 Megabits per second – Recommended for 1080p 60 FPS quality"" (source) which is easy to get on your local WiFi which probably has 70-100 Mbps speeds. Now players would need 50Mbps internet connection and miners would require 50Mbps per game they ""mine"". You could say 720p 30fps is enough but even old hardware can achieve that without latency and having to pay for it. And don't even dream about 4k... Nvidia our competitor in this, so it proved that this technology is a future for gaming. Yes, miner need a good internet connection, we have Terabits/s connection for our mining rigs. Try our service at Playkey.net for free on Demo, I hope you will be excited.   Quote The whitepaper also says such delusions as mining would be • 2-3 times more efficient than any altcoin mining add opportunities; • More stable in the short, medium and long term than cryptocurrency mining; Which is just nonsense they can't possibly know. Our current service Playkey.net more than 5 times efficient than simple Etherium mining for example We can't say about future, but if you ask me this question 2 years ago, I will answer the same and I will be right.  Quote And even if the impossible could be done and more computers could collectively stream the same game in a decentralized manner for 1 person playing, one miner having a lagspike or any short issue would surely create visual glitches and redundancy would make the cost unfeasible. But again, you can't render current games in real time without the whole game running so it's a moot point. Shit, some games can't even use more than 1-2 CPU cores or use SLI ffs... I'm not sure did you understand that it is peer-to-peer streaming, so a game is streaming only from one server. I will happy if games can will rendering in several servers, but i suppose it is impossible for now  Quote And of course if this already existing proprietary platform would really exist, you wouldn't need an ICO. This project just smells like just another scam ICO seasoned a random interesting topic. Yes, we can do it without ICO, but it will be too slow, because we need a lot of investments in hardware, for marketing to attract users, for development this architecture. It is just another way to launch decentralization project rapidly.",False
