ICO's are predicted to take off in 2018 (2017 was already huge).  ICO's are a form of venture capital so just like any other investment they can work very well or not at all.  Also, just like any other investment, I would suggest you do your research, but more importantly take a strategy of diversification because the big winners are usually the ones that did not look appealing at first and many times the ICO that looks fantastic has put all of its resources into image with very little substance.   A key point is to understand the market price of the token/coin will react to how the company implements/executes its plan and the real world viability of the project (i.e. will the project have a significant real world impact - is there a need or use case for the project).",False

I think you have demonstrated that bitshares is more than capable of dealing with the transaction volume but nevertheless it is not a hugely popular platform and I think that is discouraging people or at the very least failing to hook into the network effect that ethereum has built for itself with its ERC20 tokens. People expect erc20 tokens to be listed on regular exchanges because it is easy for regular exchanges to do so. People also know how to secure their ERC20 tokens with a hardware wallet and dont have to trust a web based system with the large amounts of funds required to meet the project requirements.  If you refund first and then re-launch you will have also very publicly demonstrated your trustworthiness.   ,False

I get 6% because the net profit you speak of was 12% and you say you will distribute 50% of the net profit.  Isn't half of 12% = 6%?  The directors do not benefit?  Who will OWN the property and asset value?  What stops you from raising the capital and selling all the assets next year and walking away with the entire ICO capital raise?  15 years I was speaking of is the time it will take me just to make my money back with a 6% return per year (with ZERO profit).  30 years is your ""Bounty""... which I have to believe you did not know what a bounty was when the person asked that question.   You want people to invest in an ICO and think about a 30 year return.  That is an annuity.  Again, why ICO?  Why not any traditional form of fundraising?  Sorry to be skeptical but I have to believe your sole purpose for an ICO is to avoid regulations.  Your entire scheme does not pass the Howey test which means you are simply selling securities yet they carry no ownership.  I didn't look but I hope this is not available to us the U.S. because you cannot possibly take money without registering your ICO (which it is not registered).

These companies have mortgages and various cross guarantees and debentures which would stop this project from being possible under Kexgill Limited. Kexcoin Limited had 5 shareholders, the largest of which is Mike but Richard the MD of Kexgill is also a director / shareholder of Kexcoin Ltd. In addition to this Kexgill will be providing full management services to Kexcoin. Kexcoin Ltd is making use of all Kexgill's existing infrastructure.  The two companies are set up separately for a number of reasons in addition to the one above. Firstly, we are under no illusion that the funds raised from the ICO are ours in any way so to mix these funds with those of Kexgill would be wrong to do. The company has been set up with a strong fund structure and this is how we view it. Custodians of the funds raised from participants if you will. Also as Kexgill will be providing management and resources there would not be the clear divide between the two companies if they were one and the same. We are trying to ensure that everything that we do is transparent, verifiable and legitimate. By having the clear divide we can show a clear division in what is Kexgills and what is Kexcoins and there will be no grey areas because of this.  In response to your questions specifically, are there any legal repercussions; The two companies are connected by Directors and owner. With all of the information we have published both written and spoken as well as the terms and conditions and articles of association for the kexcoin company, we are bound by UK law and if we did not do as we have stated we would be in serious trouble. Each one of the directors has built up an established and respectable career over many years and we simply would not risk that in order to make a ""quick buck"" with the potential to then serve at her majesties service. Please also remember that Mike is 70 and unlikely to see much in term of remuneration as he is unlikely to be here. Finally on your first question, you are looking at it the wrong way. If Kexcoin has no bank borrowings then it is very difficult to fail as there is no one to call in the receivers, in addition we have benefits over our competitors in terms of flexibility and being able to weather economical storms should they arise. By having the separate companies they are shielded from each other as it works both ways!  In regards to your second question, that we are not using the blockchain and ""why ICO"" again I think points are being missed here. Please check out Chris's Youtube shows (cryptoverse). You will see that he is an advocate of expanding all thinks blockchain and crypto and increasing adoption. If Crypto is to really go mainstream then it needs to be used for a variety of uses. So this would be my first point, we are using technology to break the old mold of how to fund property and as such are widening the adoption of the crypto space. I believe in the future there will be a large shift from the few to the many. My second point is that we are using Kexcoin as a commodity and a means of paying rent. Now this definitely uses blockchain! Finally, we are running our ICO on the bitshares network and are therefore supporting the space further.  I hope this has given you more belief in the project and I too believe it will be a success.",False

Kexcoin is a student housing project.  Cheers!""  I think a better question is:  What is Kexcoin doing differently than the 1.000 other companies that offer student housing investment?  I can't see any difference between you and Emerging Property/Select Property/Knight Frank/Knight Knox/or the other 100 companies in the UK that offer student housing investment EXCEPT with THEM - 1. Investors have FCA security 2. Investors actually own the unit  P.S. - You described your coin as a ""commodity"" earlier.  I hope you have registered with the FCA.  Have you?  What you are selling is a security and you must register with the FCA.  I think you are in over your head.  I'm not trying to jump all over you and I know first hand it can be very difficult to please people with new projects but this would be a better project for Housecrowd or Housers (traditional crowdfunding) as the people would feel more secure you are not just trying some unregulated side step to take money.

It's not what ""I"" am describing, it is what is REQUIRED by the UK Govt. for EVERY company.  Just seems dumb NOT to use it (if you have it).  Other concerns?  Why are they crowdfunding if they have 27 other companies and thousands of units?  Isn't crowdfunding for startups?  Why are they using an ICO?  What purpose does it serve them?  Why not equity?  Why not any other traditional financing or crowdfunding?   What are they using the money for?  Just more property?  They are a successful company that wants ""me"" to pay for their property (which they will own) and then they will ""maybe"" give me back a 6%?  So I can get my principle back in 15 years?  They do have a ""30 Year Bounty"" so maybe they are just really, really, long term thinkers?  To be honest, I was excited to see a student housing project but the deeper I look, the less appealing it is.  Who know?

If you only attract people seeking bounties that will not bring in any actual investment money.    I think it would be better to give out bounties as a bonus on top of what people have already purchased - so if you use the signature you get an extra 5% bonus on top of what you buy (depending on how much is available).    That way you ensure that people who get the bounty have some ""skin in the game"" (giving them a greater incentive not to dump) and it is shows that you value the people who actually invested.  Screwing the real investors by giving out tokens for next to nothing does not make economic sense.  Just because other ICOs have done it does not mean that it was helpful or indeed valuable.  Anyway we are not going to agree on this so further back and forth is pointless.",False

Those funds are then used to buy in the student investment property market which brings reliable returns.  Our vision is to build a new funding network through the use of the blockchain, making it available for almost anyone in the world to participate, in any amount, large or small. We are unique in the business as we are already supported by an existing infrastructure. Kexgill an associated company to Kexcoin has been investing and growing their European portfolio for almost 39 years. With an experienced team, they are an award winning student provider, owning almost 3,250 beds throughout the UK and 360 multi-family apartments in Germany.  Key Information When will the ICO be launched? You can place buy orders now for fulfilment at 15:00 UTC 15th September 2017  How long will they be on sale? 30 days (15 September 2017 – 14 October 2017)  How many are being sold? 8,500,000 KEXCOIN  What is the rate/value they will be sold at? 0.0025 BTC = 1 KEXCOIN  How to connect with us You can get in touch with us via Facebook, Twitter, Telegram, Bitcoin Forum, Bitshares Forum.   How will participants benefit? Once per quarter on a pre-announced date, we will take 50% of the net profits generated by the rental income from the properties and use it to buy back as many KexCoins as we can. Participants will be able to offer their KexCoins for sale on the market and we will buy them back starting with the cheapest first.  Once the buyback budget has been exhausted, all KexCoins purchased within that budget will be permanently burned. This reduces the total remaining supply and increases the scarcity of the coins that remain, thus inflating the price.  The remaining 50% net profits will be reinvested in further investment property to speed up the buyback process.   What does the KexCoin team get out of this? 10m KexCoins have been created. This is the total number that will ever exist. 10% of this amount (1m KexCoins) will be retained for the core team. An additional 5% (500k KexCoins) will be retained for contingencies.  The remaining 85% (8.5m KexCoins) will be sold to participants during the ICO. In order for the KexCoin team to profit, KexCoins must be worth something. This will only happen if the project is a success.  When a core team member wishes to take some profit, they would have to sell their coins on the market in exchange for Bitcoin in the same way as an ICO participant does. The core team are not allowed to sell or trade their kexcoin for a 1 year period after the ICO.   What happens if you don't sell all the coins during the ICO? Any coins that are left unsold when the crowd funding period closes will be immediately and publicly burned.   Useful Links Website Whitepaper Step-by-step guide to participate",False

Gross yields are generally from 8% to 15% depending on the type of property purchase (PBSA or HMO) and can be higher in certain circumstances.

Over time and as rents increase, both the gross and net figure will increase substantially. 2) We expect that the first buy back would be within 3-6 months. We are actively assessing property now so that should the token sale be successful we could purchase right away. 3) We are unlikely to dispose of property however, if we did sell property (say for strategic reasons) the funds would be used to purchase more property - so yes!",False

In addition to the buy back and burn policy we are now also offering a profit share to anyone who takes part in the ICO or that holds Kexcoin at the end of the buy back / burn period. If you do both, you benefit twice! So how will it work? When the ICO ends, we will take a snap shot (within 48hrs of ending) of all of the accounts that hold Kexcoins on the bitshares network making note of the account and the sum of Kexcoin held. The ICO will be deemed to have ended either by selling out of Kexcoin or reaching the end date (14.59 UTC 14th October 2017). In order to qualify you must hold Kexcoin on account at the time of this snapshot. OR You hold Kexcoin at the end of the buy back / burn period (again a snap shot will be taken). If you hold Kexcoin at the point of both snapshots you will benefit twice. What is the profit share? The profit share will be calculated as 50% of the increase in property value from the initial purchase price. Simple example - if £50m of property is initially purchased and by the end of the buy back period the said property is valued at £110m the sum paid back to ICO participants and Kexcoin holders at the end of the buy back period would be £30m (£110m - 50m = £60m x 50% = £30m). Please note taxes and costs of sale would need to be deducted. How will this be distributed? The number of Kexcoin sold at the ICO and the number held at the end of the buy back period will be added together and the profit share will be divided equally by this number. It will then be paid to the accounts noted on the snapshots.  This is our thanks to all that support us and participate in the project.  ",False
