In short, the CrossPay Mobile App is designed to be more than just a mobile wallet. Not only does CrossPay provide the unbanked with access to their account balance and enables transactions with other members in the communities like fellow community members, e.g., fellow villagers, and merchants, e.g., village shops, CrossPay will be key to the tokenisation of livestock (this unique element of CrossPay will be covered in another article).  Powering the transactions via the CrossPay app is the CrossPay Blockchain. There are several forms of blockchains, and ours uses the private blockchain technology. The advantage of deploying private blockchains into the CrossPay platform architecture is that it is private (duh) as usage is restricted to the members of the local community. In addition, the speed of deployment, the protection from the volatility of public blockchain currencies, and scalability are also the advantages of using private blockchain versus public blockchain.  It is with the CrossPay Platform that we can issue native cryptocurrency that circulates in the local community and the local community alone. Wait a minute, did we say native cryptocurrency? But why use a native cryptocurrency token? To understand how this usage is beneficial to the underserved and underbanked communities, we must travel back in time slightly.",True

My name is Nicolas Merton here at DataDash and today is February 28th of 2018.  Well today I want to spend some time to talk about a project in the blockchain space that I’ve not only grown more interested in as I’ve gotten to look further into the project but I’ve gotten more and more eager to talk about here on the DataDash channel.  Now as many of you might know in the space of blockchain there’s always a lot of talk and noise that really makes it hard to find projects that are bringing lost lasting innovation, opportunity and also the possibility to leave a lasting impact in some way, shape or form and Sentinel Chain is no exception in my eyes. And a short and sweet to the point summary guys — Sentinel Chain is aiming to bring banking and financing to the unbanked and they’re doing this through a concept where we can use livestock such as cattle as collateral for loans to these people who are living in the unbanked world and they’re doing this through the use of blockchain, RFID tags and so much really cool tech that I want to dive into.  Before we dive into the review guys I want to be completely transparent with you guys. I have not received any payment for this review I’m just doing it because I love the project. I currently don’t hold or invest in Sentinel Chain because it’s currently going through its ICO phase so I will be definitely getting into it once it gets on exchange and last but not least I want to be clear and transparent with you guys this is not financial advice this is just simply my opinion. So you guys got to do your own research and I’ll have all the resources you need down in the description as well as a website linked to the Sentinel chain project where you can find any additional resources that you might need.
