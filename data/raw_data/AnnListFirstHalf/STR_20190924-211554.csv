It has nothing to do with a home media server, but it will facilitate video streaming between two peers from anywhere in the world.Think any mobile device user would be able to ""strim"" a video from the specific location he is in (which can be a pub, a concert, a football match, on the street during a live event that is happening now - anybody could become a reporter etc) while other users will see a map of all these streamers and will be able to access them if they want to.  In this way anybody can contribute with their video (or device sensors - 2nd part of the STRIM Network see the Whitepaper for more details) to the network and receive STRIM tokens as reward.  Hope this answers your questions.  The Strim Team",False

As for protecting against fraudulent data:    - For the video streaming/recording, real users will actually use that data and they will have the option to decide if it's real or not;    - For the raw sensor data we will have a security mechanism in place for the user accounts to be verified. This will confirm that the data mined by them is accurate and the offered token reward will vary based on the scarcity of the data.  If you have further questions we will be happy to clarify.

What is STRIM? STRIM is a decentralised network built on the Ethereum blockchain technology that gathers various data from users around the world, shares the data and ultimately builds upon the data, turning it into useful information.  The network will incetivize users to share data by rewarding them with STR tokens. These tokens can in turn be used to retrieve data that other users have shared.  During the first development phase, STRIM will facilitate location based peer-to-peer video streaming, allowing users to broadcast using their webcams, phones, or other cameras connected to the Internet. This will allow users to view realtime video from various locations around the world.  The second development phase will expand upon the STRIM platform and allow users to share data using specialized sensors - such as air quality, temperature, humidity, all-in-one weather stations, radioactivity sensors, microphones. This data will then be used to create dynamic maps, for example for real-time weather information or city noise pollution.  Main Features On-demand live peer-to-peer video streaming based on GPS location  Sensor mining for any of the available sensors of the mining devices  Possibility to host the video streams on the user's environment or on a Cloud hosted environment  Autonomous devices to provide video and sensor data from remote locations based on a scheduled request  Aimed to be decentralized, no user data will be stored in a centralized location  Check out the Demo for the ~~NEW~~STRIM Network Alpha~~NEW~~   More info can be found on the STRIM Website - www.strim.me  Social Media Bounties  Twitter Bounty requirements:  1.

Our project will be part decentralized in which you will be able to do peer to peer and multi-peer live video streaming. This part will be completely decentralized. Over this we want to also offer the option to store this live stream in a decentralized location that the user chooses such as: Storj, SIA, Maidsafe, IPFS, etc.The second part will be centralized.  The idea came to us when we started thinking that the mobile devices that are used for video streaming have a series of sensors that could be used for data mining, for which the user could be paid for. This can be expanded to much more sensors and devices, for which we would like to build a data pool. This pool of data will be then made freely available for non commercial use and on a contract basis for Licenses for internal, OEM, and asset tracking implementations.  I hope this answers your question. If you want to talk in Romanian we could create a thread on the regional threads.  The Strim Team",False
