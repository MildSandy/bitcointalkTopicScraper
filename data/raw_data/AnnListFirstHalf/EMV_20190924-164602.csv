The initial film, produced by a Swiss company, ‘The Pitts Circus’ follows the journey of a four-person strong circus family from their home to a circus festival in an isolated part of Western Australia. With the second phase of its ICO beginning on 20th March 2017, investors can purchase the Ethereum blockchain-based coin called EMV coin. The coins that represent the shares are ERC-20 certified Ethereum tokens. The contract and the coins can be inspected on blockchain and prediction markets such as Augur list bets on the price – development of EMV over various timescales.",False

Your website suggests the coins are for this specific movie, and prior verbage in this thread suggests it's for future films as well. How are those funded? Are tokens liquidated to pay for films on secondary markets? Are they bought back from secondary markets with profits from the films? If the films are not profitable how are the losses socialized? This needs a ton more detail about the mechanics of the finance model. If it's just for this one film I think it will be a disaster because if you require people to get in to cryptos to view a film (requiring them to buy ""tickets"" with ether) that is likely going to be modest viewing audience anyway all you are doing is guaranteeing the film will fail financially because of the barrier to entry.  I'm not trying to troll you or be negative, but I feel at this point you are asking for way too much for investors without providing nearly enough details. Crowdfunding stuff is cool, but I think at this point you can't consider this anything more than a kickstarter and not really a prospectus for investors looking for return on their capital (and maybe that's okay for folks willing to ""donate"" to make some indy films).",False
