As bot adoption and innovation accelerates, the mainstream failures are frightening. Software is becoming more intelligent; creating more powerful and less predictable bots. And yet, critical systems, standards, and means to validate, certify, and manage the millions of bots and billions of transactions powered by AI are effectively non-existent. Autonomous technology holds massive potential but is dangerously under-supported.  BotChain‚Äôs platform introduces new levels of bot management, and eases developmental burdens. The BotChain solution establishes an environment of healthy control and security, meaning artificial intelligence ‚Äì perhaps the most significant technological advancement since the Internet ‚Äì can thrive.  The vision is to create a first-of-its-kind solution, built on blockchain technology, that provides the platform and trust needed for AI-based systems to flourish. The team recognizes that, despite the growth of bots and machine intelligence software, a lack of transparency, trust, and standardization limit the ultimate potential for this transformative technology. BotChain solves the fundamental limiting issue of 'black box' opacity in how AIs make decisions and operate. The solution provides easy means to understand and improve bot responses and choices, while creating a vibrant ecosystem where bot software and service innovations are shared. This improves the quality and availability of autonomous agent technologies worldwide.  By maintaining verifiable bot identities, storing activity, ensuring ethics, and creating a marketplace that spurs innovation in bot software, barriers to AI development and customer adoption will be lowered. This will ultimately benefit all ecosystem participants, ensuring new governance mechanisms to help the field grow in a scalable, principled, and profitable way.  As far as I know, there is no one else working on this solution. BotChain is sometimes compared to other AI + Blockchain platforms but they are all working on a different layer of the technology than BotChain is.",False

Interviewer [16.07.18 14:02] [In reply to Rob May] Hi Rob! Good day üòä  ANC AmaZix, [16.07.18 14:02] Let us start from the very Top, What issues are BotChain attempting to solve and how?  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:03] The biggest issue is illustrated by the Google Duplex demo.  You can watch it here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd1mEm2Fy08  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:03] We are about to enter a world where humans and bots are indistinguishable in many ways  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:04] So, bots need an identity.  Humans have passports, SSNs, IDs of all kinds.  Bots need this too.  And if bots have it, then, well, do you want Amazon or Facebook to control that identity standard?  Or do you want it to be decentralized and community owned?  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:04] If the latter, then you need a blockchain protocol.  And once you have identity for AI,  you can have reputation, smart contracts, audit trails, and more.  So, identity is the foundation.  Interviewer [16.07.18 14:06] Amazing!! Thank you for your apt response.  Interviewer [16.07.18 14:06] For the next question, How would you explain Botchain to your Grandfather? Like, someone who is not tech savvy.  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:07] I usually tell non-tech people that, if your bank bot contacts you, how do you know it is really owned by your bank?  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:07] Botchain solves that problem.  Interviewer [16.07.18 14:09] Oh I see. Thank you for that  Interviewer [16.07.18 14:11] I know you've gotten this question alot and it is the backbone of every crypto project so.. Why does botchain need to be on the blockchain, what special features can we expect or should I say, what advantages does the blockchain offer?  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:12] Great question  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:14] Blockchains allow tokenization, which allows for Token Curated Registries.  Botchain is a form of a TCR.  The tokens serve as an incentive to make the registry high quality.  In addition to that, blockchain entries can serve as good identity standards, and there are several projects that do so for humans... Civic being the most high profile.  (You can think of Botchain as Civic for AI).  When you look down the road, the immutability of the blockchain ledger is good for audit trails for enterprise bots too.  So, there are a few things that overlap well.  Interviewer [16.07.18 14:17] [In reply to Rob May] Exciting possibilitesüëåüèæ  Interviewer [16.07.18 14:18] [In reply to Rob May] Amazing! üôå For the next question, what will Botcoin be used for?  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:20] Initially, Botcoin is used to pay curators, and to incentivize early bot registration.  We don't have mining.  We have a concept called curation, and a ""token incentive vault"" that holds a bunhc of premined coins.  Down the road, botcoin can be used for other transactions as well  Interviewer [16.07.18 14:21] [In reply to Rob May] Can you clarify what you mean when you say ""Other Transactions""?  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:23] well, this isn't built yet, but, in 2019 we hope to have functionality that allows developers to build bot skills and put them in an open marketplace  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:23] So for example - maybe you ask your bot to book you a plane ticket, but it doesn't have that skill.  It could source it from the skills marketplace and compensate the developer (or another bot) in botcoin.  Interviewer [16.07.18 14:24] [In reply to Rob May] Oh wow! üòÆ Looking forward to it‚ú®  Interviewer [16.07.18 14:25] So, do you currently have an MVP, and do you plan on having masternodes in the future?  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:26] yes, we are launched on Ethereum main net, but we are the only company with access at the moment  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:26] We are integrating with our key partners, and will open up publicly once they launch.  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:26] On masternodes, we haven't made a decision.  I think you can make good money providing a curation service though  Interviewer [16.07.18 14:28] By the way, Botchain Community, if you've just tuned in - we are having a live AMA with ‚ú® Rob May @BotchainCEO ‚ú®üòä  AmaZix will be asking Rob members' submitted questions. Kindly stay silent during this time until after the disucssion. Enjoy!! üöÄüí•  Interviewer [16.07.18 14:29] [In reply to Rob May] Great stuff Thank you!  Interviewer [16.07.18 14:29] May I ask, do you have any plan for the worldwide adoption? ü§î  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:31] The initial partners we have already signed, they reach 50,000 developers and 400M end users.  So, I expect yes, as we roll out through these partners, that will happen.  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:32] In addition, one of our partners is middleware for IBM's cloud platform so, Botchain will by default be available on IBM's cloud.  And our other partners are working on more OEM deals in which Botchain will be supported  Interviewer [16.07.18 14:32] Wow! Truly impressive.  Interviewer [16.07.18 14:33] Could you please give us a few use cases of this Tech and throw some light on the comptetion you face?  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:35] One example of identity is - when you go to a webpage, say Starbucks.com, you see a green lock in the URL field.  This shows you are visiting a website that is secure.  With Botchain you could see that in your bot platform or, if  the platform doesn't support it, you could verify manually before you give the bot important information.  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:36] We don't have any direct competition.  In fact, several of the other AI/blockchain platforms have adopted our identity standard, and we expect to announce more soon  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:36] Here is one example https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/botchain-blockchain-bot-registry-adds-seed-and-passage-ai-partnerships/  Interviewer [16.07.18 14:39] [In reply to Rob May] Nice! Thank you for this example, Rob  Interviewer  [16.07.18 14:40] So is BotChain planning on staying on the ethereum blockchain? ü§î  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:41] Tough to say.  We aren't religious about the blockchain platforms the way some people are.  I've been in tech too long to do that.  We think Ethereum may not scale enough, and we will move to whatever will.  But maybe Ethereum will get better fast enough  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:42] For example, I worked on Ultrawideband tech in 2005 - 2007.  It was supposed to be lightning fast wireless, but, 802.11 got faster while we were building it and the whole UWB market fell apart.  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:42] So we will watch and make the best decisions we can  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:44] Ok, one last question and I have to jump on a sales call  Interviewer [16.07.18 14:44] [In reply to Rob May] I see. Thank you for that üôå Again, looking forward to it üòä Interviewer [16.07.18 14:44] [In reply to Rob May] Okay And now for the last question, are you out of beta yet? Roadmap says May 2018 main network launch is still in progress. If still in beta, when is the updated target? ü§î  Rob May, [16.07.18 14:45] [In reply to Angel AmaZix] Updated target is late October.  It really means when we are integrated with partners and in market.  Interviewer [16.07.18 14:46] OK Rob, thank you for your time and precise answers. Always a pleasure to have you around.  Interviewer [16.07.18 14:49] And that's it, Botchain Community! That's the end of our Live AMA with Rob May @BotchainCEO ‚ú®üôå Thank you for tuning in with us and of course, if you have anymore questions,  we're always here to answer them for you 24/7 üòáüëç  Interviewer: Thank you very much @BotchainCEO for your time! üòäüôè   You can join the Telegram channel and learn more here: https://t.me/botchainICO",False

The team recognizes that, despite the growth of bots and machine intelligence software, a lack of transparency, trust, and standardization limit the ultimate potential for this transformative technology.  BotChain solves the fundamental limiting issue of 'black box' opacity in how AIs make decisions and operate. The solution provides easy means to understand and improve bot responses and choices, while creating a vibrant ecosystem where bot software and service innovations are shared. This improves the quality and availability of autonomous agent technologies worldwide.  By maintaining verifiable bot identities, storing activity, ensuring ethics, and creating a marketplace that spurs innovation in bot software, barriers to AI development and customer adoption will be lowered. This will ultimately benefit all ecosystem participants, ensuring new governance mechanisms to help the field grow in a scalable, principled, and profitable way.

Here's an excerpt from the article that I think captures the value of Botchain really well:  While it is true that each bot might keep records of its part in a given conversation or transaction, there is no common ledger that records all interactions made by all the bots in the given scenario. Without a common ledger by which to audit the activity, the security, integrity and quality of bot behavior is compromised.  This is not a new problem. Those who work with cryptocurrencies have had this problem for a long time‚Äîmaking sure that the information provided in a transaction is authentic, true and auditable. The way that cryptocurrency systems solve this problem is to use blockchain technology.

Today we are officially announcing our token sale for the Botchain Network, that will start on January 16th.  Official site: https://botchain.talla.com  Telegram: https://t.me/botchainICO  Email updates: https://botchain.talla.com/#subscribe  Webinar next week for questions:  http://pages.talla.com/webinar-botchain-whitepaper  Medium post (with updates coming): https://medium.com/@robmay/explaining-the-botchain-network-part-1-b2f6fa2f2860  If you want to learn more about Talla, I recently gave a talk at Launch Scale on ICOs and how we decided to do one. https://twitter.com/TWistartups/status/930990099612950528  The challenge in building any network is that you have to show value when the network is small, so that people will use it even before the network effects kick in, otherwise you risk not getting to scale.  But, you also need a system that grows stronger as more people join the network.  Botchain has both pieces.  To start, botchain uses the immutable ledger features of a blockchain to provide archiving, compliance, auditability, and proof of existence for bot activity.  If a bot of some sort has to be part of a compliance workflow like HIPAA or SOC2, that will now be possible.  We have already signed 5 bot partners and will be announcing them as the ICO date approaches.  On top of that, Botchain has features that enable it to become a marketplace for bot skills and knowledge modules, which we expect partners to build and enhance.  In addition to that, we support bot identity, registration, and validation features.  Token details: There will be 30M tokens.  We expect to sell half publicly through SAFTs, a pre-sale, and the ICO.  Any unsold tokens allocated to the public will be burned.  We will use escrow for a $15M minimum raise.  We will probably impose a cap as well but the final value has not yet been determined.  Everyone who wants to develop for Botchain or use bots on Botchain will need tokens.  If you are a developer with a dApp idea for Botchain, we would love to hear from you.   We believe in the future, bots will need their own currency as more and more happens in the bot-economy.  We believe Botchain can be the anchor of that economy.  Thank you for taking a look and we look forward to your questions and ideas.",False

First of all, lots of companies do have rewards programs that are very similar to cryptocurrencies.  I haven't been to a McDonald's in many years but perhaps they do have something similar.  Secondly, blockchain technology is new.  McDonald's may indeed have their own cryptocurrency at some point.  I fall into the camp that thinks many many companies will issue their own tokens.  The fact that they haven't done it yet doesn't mean they won't.  It's new technology.  They didn't have the opportunity in the past.  Secondly, this provides a new way to build marketplaces.  The current standard is that as a B2B company, once you get a decent size, you launch your own marketplace.  Each marketplace is different and this sucks for developers.  It stifles competition and causes winner-take-most markets.  For example, if you are building a CRM add-on, you probably build for Salesforce, not the rest of the market.  Wouldn't it be awesome if you could build once and there was a single CRM markeplace?  To get CRM vendors to agree on a technical standard and share a single marketplace is tough.  But a blockchain could help make that work.  It's probably too late for CRM, but the bot ecosystem could evolve this way.  We could indeed raise a Series B round and just build Botchain and own the whole thing, as you could with almost any blockchain concept.  We don't think that is what is best for the bot industry, developers, or customers.  The only way to get people to agree on sharing and trust is to use a system/network that is independent.

Second... I fail to see how a token issued by a company could help ""vendors to agree on a technical standard and share a single marketplace"". What would be the reason and motivation for every vendor to accept a custom token issued and controlled by someone else as a medium of exchange. Why would they be happy to accept XYZ token instead of USD or EURO?  First.. Indeed, many companies have reward programs and issue different coupons you can spend when you shop with them. The most important difference, the main medium of transaction is local fiat currency. You can used your air mileage from your credit card, but the ticket you are buying is available in your local fiat currency and you can have a discount until your air mileages lasts. The ticket is not priced in air mileages, you don't need to buy air mileages first if you want to purchase the plane ticket. Same, in MacDonald's you can use a coupon if you want, but the food and drinks are priced in your local fiat currency. The coupon and air mileage is not tradeable, they worth nothing, you can't sell them... They are not even similar to cryptocurrencies.  Let's see an example. Amazon and eBay are competitors. Amazon won't change it's policy, but eBay issue an eBay token and stop accepting local fiat currency. From now on, if you want to buy anything on eBay, you would need to buy Bitcoin, transfer it to an exchange where eBay token is listed, buy eBay token, transfer it to eBay wallet and buy the product you would like to have. If no other purchase necessary, do the whole process again and withdraw your local currency from Coinbase to your credit card.  There are three big issue here 1, It is almost impossible or at least very difficult to exactly know how much fiat currency you would need to spend on Bitcoin to end up with the correct amount of eBay token. Most of the time you would need to buy more Bitcoin than necessary to be safe after all the transaction fees. 2, Bitcoin price and the token prices are highly volatile, eBay either adopt a dynamic pricing or it would see the product's price change upto 50% daily either way. Dynamic pricing will make the first point impossible, but not having a dynamic pricing would make the prices impossibly noncompetitive/unpredictable. 3, Why would anyone chose to continue to shop on eBay and go through all the hurdle (buying and selling 2 cryptocurrencies on 2 different platform and transferring then twice both ways) and end up paying more for the goods (transaction fees and leftover tokens) when they can have the same good from Amazon using a 1-click credit card payment?  I would like to understand the opportunity here as I fail to see the improvement.",False

You can indeed buy miles directly, and most times when you buy a ticket, they will offer you the chance to purchase extra miles.  You can also sell or trade your airline miles.  Google it and many sites will come up.  This is what you are missing - having a currency that ties to the underlying activity on the platform enables shared value creation.   Your ebay and amazon analogy doesn't accurately characterize tokenization use cases.  Think about how it works today with bitcoin - most sites that accept bitcoin price in their local currency, but you can pay with an equivalent amount of bitcoin that varies all the time.  Why would anyone do that instead of just using local fiat?  Because bitcoin offers benefits local fiat doesn't.  Tokens are about programmable money that can take on new properties for the network as needed.  As for your concerns about transfer, when you send a message across the internet, it goes through multiple layers of protocols, and is transformed at every one as needed, from English text all the way down to optical pulses of light.  It's seamless.  And tokenization will be the same.  You will still pay in local fiat currency at your interface point to the customer, but the connections between people on the network will use the token the same way they use any other protocol.  Here's the issue, let's say I want to do bot validation, and I want to do it without a token.  How does that work?  I need a centralized server to do that, or, if I have decentralized servers, I need an approval process to add new servers, and I need to figure out how to pay them.  If your server is in Moscow and mine is in Seattle and we both need to validate that a bot is who it says, how does each party get paid?  One has to buy the fiat currency of the other and pay them, or at least, someone at some point has to do that.  It's actually a more complicated supply chain now.   I think you are missing the big picture here.  Tokenization provides a lot of value for almost any kind of network use case beyond what fiat currency can do.  I think in the next 10 years almost every network will be tokenized because of these advantages.  Rob",False

For users, there are many USPs.  The first one is that you can validate bot ownership.  If you have followed Civic and seen how they (and a few other companies) are using blockchain to verify personal identity, we are doing that for bots.  Since bots are starting to be spoofed, this is one USP.  The second USP for users is that the audit and compliance capabilities of the blockchain allow users to deploy bots in workflows that require compliance, which they can't do today because bots are not auditable.  The third USP for users is that they get a full marketplace controlled by the Botchain so that bots can find any new skills or information they need to do their work.  For developers, the  first USP is that they can now sell to enterprises because they can add compliance features to their bots.  The second USP is that they get faster growth and adoption because they get access to a marketplace shared by all bots.  So far, we have 12 other bot developers signed on, which we will announce closer to the ICO date.  Rob",False
