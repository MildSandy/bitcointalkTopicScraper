The card has been changed to a unionpay card. Unfortunately you will only find out, when you receive your card. Paycent does not deem it necessary to inform its customers about ""minor"" changes like this.  Card was originally announced for the end of February. Now the date for delivery of second batch of 4th or 5th of July. Again Paycent doesn't really deem it necessary to inform customers of delays. The only place to get any information is their telegram channel. But that is quite a challenge to retrieve the few gems of valuable information amongst all the fanboyism talk by the investors.  If you don't want a unionpay card (because you paid for a mastercard after all) you can try to get a refund. Good luck with that though. You will soon realise that they keep no records of when customers paid. They will ask you to send them the transaction hash of when you paid the US$140. Okay that can be a bit of an issue if you use multiple wallets and have many transactions. However if you ordered and pre-registered through the website (and not the app) now is when your real problems begin.  Because of a bug on the website the price in BTC was not updated once you pre-registered. So if you didn't pay on the same day that you registered you will have payed more (or less if you are lucky) because of the fluctuations in the BTC/US exchange rates. If you belong to that group and only payed a couple of days after pre-registration, your amount from the transaction will likely differ. Once you send them the transaction hash they will tell you it is  not the correct hash because well the amount you paid is more than/less than US$ 140. ""And please send us the correct transaction hash.""  If you want to check for yourselves and not just take my word for it their wallet address is 33mUPvJK29cCB7Uo6xy11L5dcczjBdSbbG  (https://blockchain.info/address/33mUPvJK29cCB7Uo6xy11L5dcczjBdSbbG)  Now scroll down and check how many payments they received that were spot on $140 and how many were more (some as high as US$ 155) others less. In my case I pre-registered in January and it was only when I asked for a refund that I became aware that there had been a problem with the initial payment. Paycent never bothered to inform the customers. Even though they are very much aware of it and are now utilising it as a cheap trick not to repay the deposits.  There are other issues as well,  bugs in the app, payments that get stuck and need to be be retrieved manually, a process that on average takes three days to a week.  In view of all that it comes as no real surprise that paycent had problems with the audit and mastercard stopped further issuing of mastercard debit cards.

I put some figures inside, and this is the result. You can do your own math, show your analysis or change my assumptions based on your personal view. But I have no intention to debate and elaborate to much. I've made my investment decision.  Target: 5M users of future exchange and app. Target for cards 1M.  And here is my view: When Paycent opens trading platform (which has been announced in official Telegram group) , the first target should be 5M users, what is around CEX.IO size. If it manages to get that number of users than 1M cards look like reachable target.  And I used CEX exchange for benchmark, since they trade only limited number of major coins, what will be offered by Paycent as well. And they don‚Äôt have their own card. During the hype around ATH for BTC they used to have almost 5 times more active users. I calculate the number of active users by estimated monthly website visits. Xapo is around 1.4M monthly users with around 1M app download on play store.  So the first target to aim is to reach 5M users of future exchange and app. Target for cards 1M. Average daily volume of fiat to crypto is something hard to evaluate. But let‚Äôs say that out of 1M users 5% will use the card per day. 50.000 users * 50$ average transaction. That's 2.500.000 $ daily volume.  From the whitepaper, benefits for token holders - passive income (dividend):  30% commission sharing to token holders. It would be around 275M yearly for profit sharing, based on the volume I estimated. The company is burning their coins, and it plans only one more ICO phase, which will used for acquiring a bank. So two phases could be around 70M tokens which will be stored (staked) for commission, so around 4$ per token in dividends yearly. Nice passive income. I‚Äôd say dividend could reach 1$ per PYN  per year and could change our lives. 4$ dividend per token could be reached when we enter mass adoption, and since Paycent is operating in Asia, which has young and big population, this is also realistic. And you know that the company plan is to expand the business to Europe as well? Does this sound right to you guys? And I think this is the realistic target, we could reach within 12-48 months.  PYN market price:  My price targets for PYN token (please don't mix it with dividend). Short term 1$, which is around our competitor tenX market price. TenX has the app, but they don't have a solution for a card. And when the cards are delivered, the fair value should be 1-2$. The 5$ mark could be reached, when first bigger commission splitting is done with token holders. Afterwards it depends on the amount of commission. If we hit 4$ reward per token per year then we‚Äôll see two digit value of PYN.  So I‚Äôm confident that we‚Äôll hit 1M cards as the major milestone. The marketing campaign will start right after the cards arrive.  We can play with figures back and forth, but however we do that we‚Äôll have 1$/1PYN dividend as passive income. And we get it from revenue, not from the profit. In stock exchange market you always calculated based on EBITDA. So basically after the costs are deducted, and here we get paid first!",False

So the app that you'll download the 2nd of April will be a fixed and improved version !    Second, I see many people talking about ""Why only Yobit"" ""Where is Kucoin"" ""Where is the money from ICO"" Again, this is simple: - Forget Kucoin. They asked way too much. - The team is aware that we need something else and something better than this sketchy scammy Yobit and they are working on it !    - Expect to see PYN on new exchanges very soon.  Third, the ""Welcome Kits"" for the cards are already ready. The team is waiting to receive the cards to ship team. Expect them to be shipped in April and if everything goes well around 1 week after the release of the Global App.  Fourth, if you want to be in touch with the team and other investors, join the Telegram now !! : https://t.me/paycent  Finally, for anyone looking to see what the app looks like, yesterday I tweeted 2 videos, feel free to watch them and to let other people know about Paycent by retweeting  Overall video: https://twitter.com/Dizecrypt/status/979063858752053250 Instant convert Fiat / PYN In-app: https://twitter.com/Dizecrypt/status/979065177344757760   Be ready for next week because it's gonna be HUGEEEE.

The full ecosystem of Paycent and Paycent mPOS allows payments for daily household spend such as utilities, cable and Telco airtime. All conversions from cryptocurrencies to fiat will be done in realtime.  We have secured regulatory licenses and are also currently in partnership talks with several governments, banks, and companies to create an even larger ecosystem for Paycent and Paycentos.  The development on several aspects are as follows:  Regulatory Licenses - We have obtained regulatory licenses in UAE and the Philippines, and in-principle approval in Singapore and Hong Kong. With these licenses, we are able to start operations in the countries and build our user base.  Banks - We are currently in tier 2 talks to acquire and merge two banks in the Philippines, to create a larger ecosystem for Paycent. Paycent will be functioning as the online channel for the merged bank, and provide microfinancing and basic banking services for the unbanked. This strategy will allow us to set up more branches across Asia and penetrate the mass market more quickly.  Exchange - We are in negotiation talks to develop and host our exchange ‚Äì Paycent Realtime Exchange, in Dubai, with the oversight of the Central Bank of UAE. This will provide realtime pricing and liquidity for Paycent and other cryptocurrencies. This will be a world first where a crypto-exchange is built on a regulated exchange.  Payment Structure - We are in advanced talks with 2 major middle eastern economies to develop a Unified Digital Payments Network for their banking and government services, and with Paycent as the online hosts of their national payment infrastructure.  Established Fiat Ecosystem - Over a thousand merchants and counting are now accepting Paycent as an online payment mode.  Confirmed Crypto Ecosystem - We have signed an agreement with For Est Real Estate (forest.ae) in UAE to be the first cryptowallet to utilize Paycentos as a payment token, and are also in talks with over 30 real estate developers to accept Paycent as a payment mode.

PROBLEM THAT WE ARE SOLVING  3.1 BRINGING CYRPTOCURRENCY TO THE MASSES One of the primary goals of Texcent is to bring the cryptocurrency market/ecosystem to mainstream audiences. Such audiences might have very little experience with cryptocurrencies and will more likely have no easy access to use and invest in cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, there is the fear of new and innovative technologies that needs to be overcome. In the Paycent app, the user swipes right to the Paycentos e-wallet, allowing the user to buy cryptocurrencies, spend cryptocurrencies and invest in cryptocurrencies with a simple and seamless interface. The benefit to the Blockchain/Cryptocurrency ecosystem will be a huge influx of fiat market capitalization into cryptocurrency which will enlarge the ecosystem. Holders of cryptocurrency will have a better acceptance as cryptocurrency become mainstream with seamless change through Paycent and its dual e-wallet.  3.2 ALLOWING CRYPTOCURRENCY USERS TO HAVE MULTIPLE AVENUES OF SPEND One of the current limiting factors of cryptocurrencies is that, although the ecosystem is growing, there is a lack of avenues of spending it in everyday life. With the Paycent app, a user can pay for his utilities and make purchases with cryptocurrency within the dual e-wallet. Because of our seamless integration, we have increased the channels that cryptocurrency can be used. With the optional Paycentos Debit card, cryptocurrency can also be used at 200 million points including ATM withdrawals.  3.3 CONVERSION OF CRYPTOCURRENCY TO FIAT AND VICE VERSA IN REAL TIME With the seamless integration between the dual e-wallets within Paycent, all cryptocurrency conversion to fiat will be done in real time with a live exchange rate shown. This can eliminate fears and doubts of mainstream audiences to venture into cryptocurrency, because once cryptocurrency is converted, it will be reflected in their Paycent fiat e-wallet immediately.  3.4 CASHLESS FOR THE UNBANKED With Paycent e-wallet app, the unbanked will have easy access to our merchant ecosystem and bill payments with a simple iOS or Android app. This inclusion allows the masses to participate in digital world with our network of clients and even a branded debit card that has over 200 million points including ATM withdrawals. With Paycent, we are helping to push the unbanked to the forefront of currency freedom with the ease of exchanging fiat money into cryptocurrency with a singular app and vise versa to spend it on daily essentials. The wallet allows financial inclusion to huge population that otherwise would be left behind in the push to a cashless society.

For the users of Paycentos Debit card, they will receive an addition 0.1% of each spend in PYN tokens as loyalties token-back (similar to cash backs from credit cards). This will create a secondary distribution of PYN tokens that will create an open market for PYN with a price support and price increase. We will NOT create new PYN tokens after this TOKEN SALE, to support the growth of the PYN in the open market.  9. Buyback and Rebates Programme  9.1 With our mPOS MDR 1.1%  (a) Non Paycentos cryptocurreny ‚Ä¢ 1% is paid to Paycent for operational charge. ‚Ä¢ 0.1% is used to buyback Paycentos directly from the market quarterly and then will be immediately burned. This will be done for the 1st five years of the merchant using our mPOS, after that the merchant will be charged only 1% MDR and the merchant will not be part of our buyback programme. As we will be  expanding our merchant ecosystem, we will have an ever-increasing number of merchants contributing to our buyback programme.  (b) Paycentos Cryptocurrency ‚Ä¢ 0.1% is paid to Paycent for operational charge. ‚Ä¢ 1% is given back to the user in the form of ‚Äútoken back‚Äù and is deposited into the Paycentos e-wallet quarterly. This is to encourage our Paycentos e-wallet user to switch to Paycentos as a default cryptocurrency thereby increasing its demand.  (c) Special agreement with Forest.ae ‚Ä¢ We have signed an agreement with Forest.ae to be their sole cryptocurrency e-wallet to collect rental fees in Paycentos from their rental property across GCC. We have negotiated a special MDR rate for the  1st five years.  9.2 With our mPOS MDR 1.5% ‚Ä¢ 1% is paid to Paycent for operational charge. ‚Ä¢ 0.5% is used to buyback Paycentos directly from the market quarterly and then will be immediately burned. ‚Ä¢ With this buyback and burn with a finite supply of Paycentos, we are hoping to make Paycentos a compelling opportunity to hold with a diminishing supply and high potential for the price to rise.",False
