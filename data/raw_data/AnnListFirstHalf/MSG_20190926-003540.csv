You can find more info regarding the project as well as our whitepaper here: https://www.multisign.io/  Quote from: killingbegin on January 18, 2018, 04:34:45 PM Great presentation of your work guys. First time i see unique web site and graphics like this in Crypto World. A question. Can you make your tokens minable?  This seems legit. Waiting for more!    Greetings! We intend to migrate the token from a fixed-supply ERC Ethereum-based token to a seperate-blockchain token on our network. This will in fact make our token mineable by allowing users to contribute to the Multisignio network by supplying network power and in return receiving MSG tokens for transactions mined. We originally intended to kickstart our token on our own network but to ensure a smooth & familiar crowdfunding period as well as easy integration to current exchanges, we decided to leverage the already existent Ethereum blockchain. Thank you for your question!",False
