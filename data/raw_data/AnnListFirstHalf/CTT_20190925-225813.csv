One of these models for ChainTrade, and a company that ChainTrade is looking to parallel, is the Intercontinental Exchange.   What is the Intercontinental Exchange?  Founded seventeen years ago in 2000, and headquartered in Atlanta Georgia, the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) was created by Jeffrey Sprecher, who now acts as CEO. The Wisconsin-born American worked in the power industry for an extended period, including at the Western Power Group. Sprecher was a power plant developer and wanted to create a transparent and efficient market for energy commodity trading.  He was able to acquire the Continental Power Exchange for $1 in 1996, which became the nascent seed of the Intercontinental Exchange in 1996. Sprecher imagined the ICE as “a sort of eBay for energy,” and was intended to compete with energy giants like Enron. Backed by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, two major banks in the United States, ICE exploded in size when Enron collapsed due to scandal. Since this early success ICE has continued to grow, acquiring several exchanges such as the International Petroleum Exchange, the Climate Exchange and the New York Board of Trade.  How does ICE work?  The Fortune 500 company has created a global system of markets and clearinghouses to exchange futures and options on a variety of products. These include agricultural products, crude and refined oil, electricity, and natural gases and liquids.  Their customer base, which is composed of individual investors, banks, asset managers, commercial hedging firms and others come to the exchange to buy and sell futures, options and other assets.  ICE also brings together a variety of information for customers, especially as many transactions have become automated. ICE’s data service includes information on regulatory reform, indexation, independent valuations, analytics and desktop tools. The information is gathered from across the exchange along with the New York Stock Exchange, Super Derivatives and Interactive Data.  How ICE shaped the future  CE had a pivotal insight that changed the market for energy. The idea was simple — to open up exchanges at a lower bar of entry for investors who had previously been unable to gain access. To this end, ICE was aided by new technology and began as an online marketplace for energy trading and grew from there. ICE coupled the new technology of the internet with the marketplace.  Regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the New York State Banking Department, ICE has ensured trading even amongst member banks. ICE monitors the creditworthiness of its members and can demand additional collateral if circumstances warrant.  All these factors have led ICE to be a powerhouse in the world market and ICE has cleared more than $10 trillion in swaps. These derivative contracts are financial agreements that occur during credit default and has the seller compensate the buyer in the event of a default. What is important though, is that ICE opened new opportunities for market players.  Read More here : https://medium.com/@ChainTrade/the-growth-of-the-intercontinental-exchange-9bb77ab07090",False

Chaintrade meanwhile, wants to bring the commodities trading into the blockchain ecosystem. As the ICO is over now, I’d like to look into Chaintrade Token (CTT) price forecast. What can we expect from ChainTrade Tokens in the next 12 weeks?  17 December, Cryptocurrency news – ChainTrade ICO is now over and the results are quite impressive. The team have issued 42,034,200 ChainTrade Tokens (based on the ICO pricing this number is equivalent of 42,034 ETH).   Interview with ChainTrade CEO Vincent Jacques  I’ve managed to talk to ChainTrade CEO Vincent Jacques briefly about the Chaintrade ICO results:  JM: Vincent, I saw great results with the ChainTrade ICO. Do you believe, Chaintrade ICO was successful?      JM: What about the CTT token supply? Have you burnt the remaining of the unsold Chaintrade (CTT) tokens?   Vincent Jacques: “Yes, we have already burnt all unsold CTT tokens. So the total supply of ChainTrade Tokens is now 42,034,200 CTT. You can also track this via Etherscan as well.”  JM: As the ICO is over now, what is the next big step for Chaintrade team? Why should people hold the ChainTrade (CTT) tokens?    Vincent Jacques: “We have a very exciting roadmap ahead of us, Jacob. Our big next steps include the public launch of our beta platform, obtaining a license from Singaporean authorities, sign agreements with a few first major customers, and finally, start trading actual commodity futures on our platform. We will share all of these upcoming announcements with AtoZForex as well.  Meanwhile, today, we have reached our first milestone. You can buy and sell Chaintrade tokens via Etherdelta.“  How to buy Chaintrade Token (CTT)?  As a part of my discussion with Vincent, I’ve also learned that ChainTrade was mostly aiming to have insitutional token holders during their ICO. The minimum commitment was $50,000 (USD). That means that, many of the retail investors missed the opportunity to buy ChainTrade tokens. If you are one of those individuals, wondering about how to buy Chaintrade Token (CTT)?! You can now, buy CTT tokens on EtherDelta exchange ( https://etherdelta.com/#CTT-ETH )  Chaintrade Token (CTT) price forecast  I’ve also talked to a few Cryptocurrency enthusiasts, trying to set up a realistic Chaintrade Token (CTT) price forecast. One of the main points, almost every analyst commented that ChainTrade is undersold. So, I researched more into what they really meant by saying CTT is undersold.  My contact, Douglas, explained as the following:   “I believe, Chaintrade Token is undersold and soon, it should reflect itself in its price as well. The industry, Chaintrade is trying to distract is a $2 trillion per annum industry. Meanwhile, there are only 42 milion CTT tokens available. That means, as soon as the Chaintrade commodity exchange goes live with the CTT integration we should see CTT price appreciate. Therefore, my very own Chaintrade Token (CTT) price forecast is at least 5 folds by the time they either announce their Singapore license or they go forward with their beta. It is going to be big!”  Douglas was not the only analyst with positive Chaintrade Token (CTT) price forecast. Another blockchain investment firm commented about the number of CTT owners:   “Currently there are less than 1000 people in total holding, Chaintrade Token (CTT). I am one of those very few people. We saw how supporters pushed many small coins up this year. And this is a token with a very tangible product. “  Chaintrade Token (CTT) summary  To sum up the ChainTrade ICO and Chaintrade Token (CTT) price forecast discussion. I will review the points I’ve gathered from 12 individual discussions.  Most of the people have a positive Chaintrade Token (CTT) price forecast. Their reasoning are as the following:  Chaintrade ICO sold 19% of their hard cap; 42 mln tokens vs. $2 trillion/year industry Chaintrade trading platform will have larger than $30MLN trading turnover; Most people could not buy Chaintrade tokens during the ICO, due to its minimum commitment size; Chaintrade attracted $30 MLN worth support with almost no advertisement; Each mine selling commodities added on Chaintrade platform will push the price higher due to added demand; Getting a Singaporean license for a blockchain based product will be sensational.  So, to sum it up my Chaintrade Token (CTT) price forecast is positive. I believe, Chaintrade Token (CTT) price should rise in value within the next few days and should reach to its peak as soon as they announce their Singapore license.  Therefor, current price of 0.001 ETH per Chaintrade Token (CTT) is a good price to consider. You can buy Chaintrade tokens via Etherdelta under the trade name of  CTT.",False

The first thing to understand are commodity exchanges. These entities determine and enforce rules for trading commodities and investments like commodity futures and options. Contemporary exchanges can be either physical in location such as the Chicago Board of Trade (CME) and Eurex or can be digital like ChainTrade. Currently the market controlled by big exchanges like CME and Eurex taxing new entrants a high cost of entry.    Getting Raw with Food and Raw Materials  Most commodity exchanges deal in food and raw materials, the basis on which ChainTrade’s exchange is based. These items are used in the primary production of manufacturing goods. These basic ingredients are so important because as they are used the inventory is decreased while the work in progress item is increased. For example, a trader could buy some corn on ChainTrade. The corn is then used to create corn flakes. The value of the corn is increased as it is transferred into a finished good- a lovely breakfast cereal. Raw materials are the building blocks for greater value products.    Hoping for a better future  One type of transactions that happens often in an exchange is the buying and selling of futures. Futures are forward contracts that have one party sell something at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. The time could be weeks, months or years in the future. Both parties agree to buy and sell the commodity at a certain price, the forward price. Most of the time futures are based on food and raw materials like grains, metals, oil and gases. Stocks and bonds are also traded in future contracts though.  For example, a farmer might predict his crop of corn for the year will be 1,000 ears and harvest will come in 12 months. If the farmer sees that the current price for 1,000 ears of corn is $15 and he would break even with $10 per ear of corn he will buy enough future contracts at $15 to make sure that he will make a profit no matter what happens to the price of corn when the harvest comes.  The cereal producer will pay $15 for the corn because they will not want the price of corn to increase. If the price of corn goes up they will have to increase the price of their cereal which means less customers and less profits. Buying the future for $15 ensures price and profit for both parties.  This dynamic was first introduced in 1972 but has become an increasingly important function in the market. Future contracts help standardize the price of items and specifications are built into the future to ensure quality and quantity of the good.  So, who buys futures? Market makers will often buy futures hoping to make money off the small difference between buying and selling prices. Speculators gamble more and will bet on the way that commodities will go. For example, a speculator will buy a future based on the failure or success of an entire country’s harvest of corn.    Choices, Choices, Choices — the case for Options  Options are another dynamic in the world of exchange. An option is a contract that gives the buyer the ability to, but not obligation, to buy or sell a commodity at an agreed price during a certain period of time. Options are a way for people on the market to speculate the rising and falling price of certain commodities and raw materials.  If a buyer buys an option on corn for a $10 premium that means that when the corn harvest is ready the buyer will pay the agreed upon price written into the option of $200. If when the corn harvest comes the value of the corn shoots up to $400 the buyer will still be able to buy the corn at $200 having spent a total of $210. If when the harvest comes the value of the corn plummets to $100 the buyer will not be obligated to take on the corn and will only have paid for the premium of the option — $10.    ChainTrade reinventing the market  The consolidation of the market over the years has seen exchanges such as Eurex and the CME control the landscape. This monopoly in the market prevents liquidity making it difficult for traders to work across different continents. This is no accident as futures are very profitable. In 2016, the CME had revenues of $3.6 billion and a net profit of 43% with most of the profit coming by way of transaction and clearing fees paid by buyers and sellers of future contracts. ChainTrade would abolish these fees and would return that much valued money back to the buyers and sellers.  In addition, exchanges practice discrimination with prices. Exchanges such as Eurex and CME charge different participants different rates based on relationships and trading volumes. This uneven landscape further inhibits new entrants. ChainTrade levels the playing field by allowing anyone including institutional investors, food producers, and other traders access to the exchange.  https://medium.com/@ChainTrade/commodity-exchange-with-chaintrade-d3051a2580f6",False

"" 🚀   Making Commodities Markets Mainstream      Jim Rogers, the famous chairman of Rogers Holdings, once summarized the reason for buying commodities when he famously quipped, “The price of a commodity will never go to zero. When you invest in commodities futures, you’re not buying a piece of paper that says you own an intangible piece of company that can go bankrupt.”  Like nothing else in the world, commodities trading offers investors the chance to buy and own real, tangible assets which cannot depreciate to zero. The problem for many investors is that the commodities market is wildly complex to enter and is designed to keep out the small-time investor and serve the large corporate giants.  In fact, the $2 tln commodities market is the definition of centralized, with the vast majority of trading taking place in a few places in the world, with big players receiving discounts that make small investors unable to enter.

This move will decentralize the trade of futures and options known commonly as commodity derivatives, and allow anyone to participate in trading — both small and big players. ChainTrade will modernize the exchange of commodity derivatives, making transactions simple, cost-efficient, and fair. Current exchanges dictate requirements that present high barriers to entry for small investors. By utilizing the blockchain, Smart Contracts, and Artificial Intelligence, buyers and sellers will be able to trade any futures or options in the world, from anywhere, on one platform, with minimal fees. Artificial Intelligence will cover link analysis, data analysis, and pattern recognition to ensure KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering). “Today’s exchanges of food and raw materials are heavily centralized, charge high fees, and are exclusive to a few institutional investors, said Vincent Jacques, founder, and CEO of ChainTrade. “We will free this market thanks to the blockchain. Exchanges will be decentralized, accessible to everyone, and fees will be dramatically lower. It is time to bring competition to this  type of exchanges, open them to anyone who wants to be part of it and lower access costs.     The blockchain technology will allow us to do just that: revolutionize the world of commodity derivatives.” With an aim to complete 5 million transactions by the end of 2018, the ChainTrade platform will be based on the CTC token, an ERC20 compliant token.

I studied at HEC (top business school in France) and UCLA (MBA program). I started my career in investment banking but quickly became a consultant at the BCG. In 2009 I founded an AI company called Planorama, which is now worth $25 million.  Q: Tell us more about your team! Do they all have background of crypto? Yes, many of our developers have blockchain / crypto background. One of our technical advisors is a founder of Ethereum. But our team is also comprised of industry experts: for example, we are advised by the former Director of Strategy at NYSE and Euronext.  Q: What inspired you to do an ICO? We started to work on ChainTrade at the end of 2016 and wanted to move the trade of food and raw materials to the blockchain. Now that we have a working prototype, we need more money to make it a scalable product and start attracting buyers & sellers to the platform (budget for sales & marketing). From there came the idea of launching an ICO to finance the development of the company and the product.  Q: How did the idea of ChainTrade come about? Is this something you were doing before? Yes, I started my career in banking and I have many trader friends. The trade of commodity derivatives today (food and raw materials) is extremely centralized, high fees are charged, with many intermediaries, and only big financial institutions can access it. We want to decentralize this market, dramatically lower the fees (cut them by more than half), and make it accessible to anyone in the world – big and small players.  Q: What is the cap for your ICO and how did you come to choose that number? What do you think of unlimited ICO’s? Our hard cap is $50 million USD, because that’s the amount we’ll need to complete the project to its full potential. I don’t agree with unlimited ICOs as they reflect the fact that there is no real business model behind them.  Q: If you successfully crowd sell with your ICO, where will your company be based? The company is registered in Singapore, which is a major competitive advantage over potential competitors, because Singaporean authorities are much more business friendly than in the US or Europe. Therefore, we will move much faster in obtaining the necessary approvals or licenses than we would if we were based elsewhere.  Q: To what level of scrutiny do you feel ICO’s should be held to? ChainTrade is fully transparent with its project, business plan, team, and administrative/legal aspects. I think all ICOs should have the same level of transparency, so that contributors to ICOs can choose what tokens to purchase in full knowledge.  Q: Do you have a background in conducting due diligence on crowdfunded projects? Yes  Q: In addition to cybersecurity, what do you feel must be understood when performing due diligence on cryptoprojects? The most important to understand is the business model and business perspectives of the company / project.  Q: What is your “bird’s eye view” of the blockchain industry as a whole. From what you’ve seen, what aspects of token crowdsales could be improved? I wish that only pure blockchain projects would go to ICO. Today we see too many projects doing an ICO although they have nothing to do with the blockchain technology in the end (or they don’t need it).  Q: You’re clearly very passionate about the crypto space! Which projects are the most exciting to you? TenX is the most exciting project to me, I’ve been following those guys for some time and I really like what they’re doing.  Q: What kind of blockchain projects would you like to see in the future? I would like to see more revolutionary blockchain projects. At ChainTrade, our vision is to make food and raw materials trading accessible to anyone, anywhere, without barriers. I wish all projects would have a similar long term vision!  Q: What current proof of concepts has ChainTrade completed? What projects are in the pipeline? We already have a working prototype of the platform, allowing to see the list of contracts, make an order, see the order book,… Next steps are to make it a scalable product, obtain a trading license from Singapore, and launch sales & marketing to attract buyers and sellers to the platform.  Q: Have you talked with any exchanges about their interested in enabling trading of your ChainTrade tokens? Yes, we hope to list the CTC token on at least 2 exchanges by the end of November.",False

ChainTrade is looking to break open the gates that hamper food producers, traders, metal producers etc., by moving the market to blockchain technology to create fair and equal access to basic resources around the world.

As urban areas expand and farming space along with mining operations decrease, food and raw materials become more critical. This corresponds with the need for exchanges to be easily accessed by institutional investors and food producers, traders, and other stakeholders. ChainTrade will be ushering in new exchanges for these players. A History of ChainTrade  ChainTrade began in 2016 in Singapore as part of the successful Blue Tiger group. The company is led by CEO Vincent Jacques who began his career in investment banking and was the successful creator of startup Planorama which is valued at $25 million. The ChainTrade team includes other veterans of the financial world including a former strategy director of NYSE and Euronext and experienced blockchain developers. This strong staff is pushing ChainTrade forward at a tremendous rate.  ChainTrade aims to be backed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and has secured the services of prominent international law company Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP to ensure that the company is legally compliant. The path to success is clear with an initial coin offering coming soon, a blockchain prototype already developed and a goal of securing 5% of the market share of global transactions for food and raw materials by 2020. Based on market research ChainTrade forecasts over 500 million transactions to occur by 2020. To sponsor the growth of the market the second phase of ChainTrade could be to extend into futures and options for equities, treasury bonds and other underlying financial utilities.   Blockchain and ChainTrade  By utilizing blockchain technology and smart contracts ChainTrade will simplify and standardized the market. Blockchain technology is a new form of digital currency and ledger system that keeps track of purchases. Each transaction is given a date and time and is stamped into the chain, becoming another block. The blocks are encoded stopping it from being tampered with.  Every transaction is validated across a peer to peer network preventing duplication and double spending. The peer to peer network decentralizes the system preventing monopolies from arising. Blockchain technology clears out the need for regulatory bodies cutting down the cost of an exchange by at least 80%.  ChainTrade will use a blockchain based on the Ethereum network, which helps fuel the validation process. Ethereum is one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world, almost overtaking the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. Buying and selling Smart  The company will be using smart contracts to regulate trading. Made possible by the blockchain technology, smart contracts are a computer protocol that executes a contract. The smart contract can be seen by all the users on the blockchain making the entire process transparent. This prevents back and forth negotiations and approvals.  Smart contracts put users together so when one user wants to buy X amount of corn and a second user wants to sell X amount of corn the smart contract will put the buyer and seller in touch and automate the transaction. This creates faster transactions with less bureaucracy. Simply put smart contracts cut down on costs by making buying and selling more efficient.  Each contract is assigned arbitrators in case of the rare dispute as well. A dispute will be resolved within two weeks and most of the time within a few days. Each smart contract will have the arbitrators listed for buyers and sellers to review. Buyers and sellers will be able to engage in the market with their eyes wide open and will know exactly what they are getting into. This information is empowering and levels the playing field for all the players.    Getting in on the ground  ChainTrade is offering an ICO, or Initial Coin Offering, and is selling tokens to be used in its market. Initially valued at 1 Ethereum for 1,000 CTC (ChainTrade Coin) the ICO is a way for ChainTrade to gain funding and for the buyer to have real concrete value with the company. Because of the exchange between Ether and CTC, buyers will have a liquid asset making investment low risk and high reward.  The team plans to list the token on a variety of crypto exchanges including Poloniex and Bittrex. ChainTrade will be capping the number of tokens which incentivizes early investors. The token should continue to gain value as ChainTrade expands throughout the world.  Getting early access to tokens also means getting early access to transactions. Possibilities open for token holders to buy and sell. Early investors will get the chance to be the first people in a brand-new market with new more fair rules of play.  ChainTrade changing the World  ChainTrade will revolutionize the market in a big way paving a way for everyone to be involved in a free market. By using smart contract and blockchain technology the future of exchange for food and raw materials looks bright.",False

This volume is presently traded on centralized exchanges that are concentrated within a few marketplaces in the world.  Centralization is Exclusive  As a result of this concentration, the commodities trading market has become expensive as fees are high for traders and producers. This, in turn, makes it an exclusive venture only reserved for major banks and investors as bigger players get better fees at better terms.  Considering how crucial food and raw materials are to global sustenance and development, allowing its underlying market to be controlled by only a few individuals and organizations is unhealthy for effective supply. The hitches therein, mostly linked to the exaggerated cost of services can be blamed for the rising prices of food and raw materials on a global level.  Vincent Jacques, CEO of ChainTrade says:  “Today’s exchanges of food and raw materials are heavily centralized, charge high fees, and are exclusive to a few institutional investors. We will free this market thanks to the blockchain: exchanges will be decentralized and accessible to all, fees will be dramatically lower.”  Improving market accessibility by decentralization Read more >>",False

You get ChainTrade  The ChainTrade Revolution “Worldwide trade of food and raw materials represents more than 2 trillion USD annually. We want to move this trade to the blockchain, building a decentralized platform accessible to anyone, without intermediaries, with dramatically lower fees.” - Vincent Jacques - Founder & CEO, ChainTrade    ChainTrade will move the exchanges of futures and options on food and raw materials (commodity derivatives) to a decentralized blockchain, allowing anyone to participate – small and big players. Fees to traders, buyers and sellers will decrease dramatically. Smart Contracts will replace traditional contracts and cut intermediaries.  Why the Blockchain? Think about it... in the legacy world of Wall Street commodity and options trading, what is a major barrier that prevents more people from participating in the trading of options and futures on real world raw-materials and food? For most, it is the prohibitive cost cash reserve minimums and the huge fees to be paid to the middle men to facilitate and execute profitable trades which creates a layer of excessive risk to get an acceptable ROI. This is why the Block Chain is perfect for this type of trading. No More favored access. No minimum amounts required. No cost prohibitive fees that eat up potential profits.  The Blockchain Eliminates the High Priced Middle Men Let’s look at to the success of BitCoin to understand how the power of the Blockchain is destined to be a powerful force multiplier for commodity futures and options buyers and sellers... In the case of Bitcoin, the blockchain is a massive, transparent public ledger, which verifies and keeps track of all bitcoin transactions. You could even go back and view the first ever transaction in the first created block, unironically named the “Genesis Block [1]”.  Apart from being one of the best and reliable triple bookkeeping systems in the world, bitcoin was the first decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This means there are no middlemen (no central banks, individuals or governments) involved in your cash transactions, which means much lower transaction fees and about a 10-minute transaction time.  In other words, because of the the blockchain bitcoin has been and will continue to be fast, safe, efficient, and has and will continue to have no central authority  Fast, Efficient, No Central Authority and No Middle Men.. For all the reasons that has made BitCoin have explosive almost unstoppable growth is the same reason why it will make more people able to enter the commodities contracts futures / option market to buy and sell. The blockchain makes it possible to make trades quicker, with half the normal brokerage house fees with no minimum reserves to buy or sell contracts...  Read More >>",False
