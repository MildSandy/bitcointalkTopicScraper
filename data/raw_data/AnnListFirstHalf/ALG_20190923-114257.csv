Regarding unsold tokens, we informed about it in our article on Medium during the crowdsale:   Due to numerous questions regarding unsold tokens, please be informed that we are considering two possibilities for their further use:  Option one  The first option is to leave some of them (and burn the rest) to complete a post-sale later (in at least a couple of months) to ensure further financing into the company when we develop new key features for the products.  In this option — the amount (based on current ETH price) will not be great than 20–30% of unsold tokend. Rest will be burnt.  Option two  The second possibility considered by the company is to burn all tokens if the revenues of the company resulting from Premium access to the Algory platform are at a level that enables further fast growth of the project.

I'm intrigued to invest!  There are a couple of concerns though. Many ICO projects seem rather fishy, and especially with the extreme price surge of the Bitcoin, I feel like I should be wary of projects that have been announced after this price surge (Like Algory). Hopefully some of you can help me with those concerns.  Furthermore, I've got some questions.  - The hardcap. I read in the comments in this thread, that regardless of whether they'll reach the hardcap, they will continue on their project. Does anyone have a legitimate source?  - Coin distribution. What happens to the remainder of the coins? Will they be distributed?  - Crowdsale. The crowdsale has been up for a couple of days now, and not even 5% has been reached. Yes it's a new project, but I find this quite troublesome.  Thanks!",False

We would like to announce that we are decreasing the Hard Cap number by 40 000 ETH, from 100 000 ETH to 60 000 ETH.     We have decided to make the change as a result of the upcoming end of registration to the Whitelist. The decision was also motivated by opinions drawn from the environment of cryptotraders and the community focused around the project. There is no doubt that the dynamic increase of the Ethereum price also had an impact on the above decision.  Keeping in mind the soaring price of Ethereum, by over 50%, which has taken place in recent days, we have decided to adjust the planned level of hard cap to the current market situation. As an Algory, we declare that this change will not affect changes in the project Roadmap, rather, it will encourage a bigger group of people interested in the project to take part in the token distribution.  Important! This change does not affect people who has already subscribed to Whitelist.

Now, there is no such an advanced tool in existence. It will scan real-time all data from crypto exchanges and let you set hundreds of filerts/alerts in different time intervals. When you get a signal - you can use it and open position manually or connect it with the Autotrading system. But if you are not sure if your trading signals will be profitable - no problem, you can use Backterster. Our backtester will use historical data to check how profitable your strategy has been in the past.  Article about CryptoScanner: https://medium.com/algory-project/algory-project-functions-the-first-and-most-powerful-cryptocurrency-scanner-d681c3ce3c45  Secondly, you will have CryptoNews. There are some tools that provides news, but none of the you can connect with Autotrading system. You can choose keywords (i.e. ""china"", ""ban"") and try to be the first one who open/close position after important news. Additionally, our News System will also use the data from social media channels - you will be able to check the social media infuence on the market.  Please check the article about CryptoNews: https://medium.com/algory-project/algory-project-cryptonews-never-be-late-again-e63ebd90cf12  You can also check our Blockchain Analyzer and ""trade like a whale"" - it means, that Blockchain Analyzer will follow the biggest transfers between wallets (i.e. you will see that someone is transfering 200k ETH to big exchange = maybe you will see a sell-off there. You will be notified about it and see what happens later). And it is only one functionality of Blockchain Analyzer. It will provides much more important data from blockchains   And it is only the top of the Iceberg Check our official website: ALGORY. We have 13 advanced functions in our platform.",False

Today I would like to show you the first flagship functionality of Algory — Cryptoscanner.  “The idea for the tool was born at the beginning of 2017. It was a period when we really did a lot of trading in the cryptocurrency market, carrying out several dozen to several hundred transactions a day. We realized we did not have enough time to quickly and efficiently analyze the cryptocurrencies with the greatest potential to generate above-average profit. On the US stock exchanges in which I traded, such tools were present and practically all professional traders used them. I cannot imagine a trading office where nobody uses such a boon as a scanner.” — Dominik Gordel, Algory Project Cofounder.     There will be +100 different filters available on the platform.

Let me quote if for you:  Quote Jonnytracker,  Let's start with that: we are not a prediction market or bot that trade instead of traders.  We move methods for filtering data and news that we use when trading on Equity Markets.  So you can define different ways of filtering each cryptocurrencies listed on diffrent exchanges. You can filter news data from different sources. For example:  The trader is focused on finding consolidation breakouts which are the most effective when the breakout occurs on a turnover volume that is several times higher relative to its average turnover.  In that case, they will use several Cryptoscanner filters: 1. Price range of cryptocurrencies (possibility of choosing price in relation to BTC, ETH or fiats). 2. They will determine the average volume. 3. They will determine the volume ratio, i.e. how much the volume should increase. E.g. volume ratio 3 (3 times bigger than the average).  Then they will go to the alerts where they will choose: 1. Consolidation breakout – where they will determine at what intervals the prior consolidation had to be delineated.  When the criteria above are met, they will receive all information about the events that occurred in the scanner window:  The trader will be able to choose from a very wide range of 1. Filters 2. Alerts  In addition, they will be able to specify: 1. The cryptocurrency exchanges to be scanned. 2. A list of symbols that they would like to be scanned. 3. Enabling the auto-trading feature that will open/close positions based on pre-defined parameters. 4. Strategy backtesting to simulate its efficiency on the basis of its historical data.   This is just about Cryptoscanner. There are 12 more functions.   In next days/weeks we will be publishing articles about each functions - so you will be able find out more.",False

Jonnytracker,  Let's start with that: we are not a prediction market or bot that trade instead of traders.  We move methods for filtering data and news that we use when trading on Equity Markets.  So you can define different ways of filtering each cryptocurrencies listed on diffrent exchanges. You can filter news data from different sources. For example:  The trader is focused on finding consolidation breakouts which are the most effective when the breakout occurs on a turnover volume that is several times higher relative to its average turnover.  In that case, they will use several Cryptoscanner filters: 1. Price range of cryptocurrencies (possibility of choosing price in relation to BTC, ETH or fiats). 2. They will determine the average volume. 3. They will determine the volume ratio, i.e. how much the volume should increase. E.g. volume ratio 3 (3 times bigger than the average).  Then they will go to the alerts where they will choose: 1. Consolidation breakout – where they will determine at what intervals the prior consolidation had to be delineated.  When the criteria above are met, they will receive all information about the events that occurred in the scanner window:  The trader will be able to choose from a very wide range of 1. Filters 2. Alerts  In addition, they will be able to specify: 1. The cryptocurrency exchanges to be scanned. 2. A list of symbols that they would like to be scanned. 3. Enabling the auto-trading feature that will open/close positions based on pre-defined parameters. 4. Strategy backtesting to simulate its efficiency on the basis of its historical data.   This is just about Cryptoscanner. There are 12 more functions.   In next days/weeks we will be publishing articles about each functions - so you will be able find out more.",False
