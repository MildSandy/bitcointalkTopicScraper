The superstar singer and Arsenal’s majority shareholder have both put money into eSports teams, as the gaming competitions with millions of followers worldwide aim for even greater public appeal. Lopez has bought into a team franchise for the new Overwatch League, in which teams from cities such as Seoul, San Francisco and London play Overwatch, a mass-participation shooting game. The global competition for the game, which launches in January, also includes the LA Gladiators, run by Kroenke, a serial sports entrepreneur.  Lopez and Kroenke are not alone. A host of top sport stars are investing in eSports franchises, including the Formula One driver Fernando Alonso and the former basketball player Magic Johnson. When the US-based SportsBusiness Journal released its annual list of the 50 most influential people, 10 were from eSports.

In all fairness, they found errors which could be fixed.  However ABDK also failed to recognize that the name of the token in the smart contract was wrong, among other errors, which caused havoc at the start of our ICO. I asked multiple times for clarification and got the answer, that this was not part of their assignment. Now when you get a smart contract audited for 12.000 Euro, then you must assume that the basic common human sense things are included here.  Furthermore we explained ABDK, that we are in the middle of an ICO and building a product, therefore we will need some time to assess the situation. ABDK started to threaten with making this public and we agreed that they might do so, if they wish, but we would answer to it as I am doing it now.  Payment timeframes of 30-60 days are not unusual in business at all, especially when what has been delivered is up to discussion after crucial errors.  We never denied to pay ABDK, but we denied to let them pressure us and extort us into paying by giving bad press to our project. After an assessment phase, we will pay ABDK based on what they delivered, but no more. Also we will forward this subject to our lawyers now.  My recommendation if you do an ICO is, do not take Auditor's which don't even check your website or the name of your token and tell you afterwards, that its not part of the agreement...

You paid for an audit and you got an audit. ABDK found a critical flaw. That saved you possibly millions of dollars in potential losses. Why don't you want to pay him? Just because he missed a token name issue? Security audits don't really look for that kind of thing. It seems you came to an agreement on the price, he did his part, and now you are refusing to pay.

Since with us tokens don't get burnt, but are moved into company cold storage the ticker shows 25million right now. We are fixing the display issue. We raised all the money we wanted to have (5million was our internal goal) and after the 5million were reached we redirected all our marketing away from crypto community members onto gamers. Since this is our goal - to build the biggest and best esports community out there.  Currently we are working on displaying the final amount 5.8X million, which was raised in presale & main sale combined. Since not all tokens left are burned, we might do a second phase of the ICO at a later stage or just use the tokens to create great content for you guys out there.

Given the amount of code for review, ABDK has asked $12000 for the audit, of which 40% must be an advance payment. An agreement was signed by Pietro Seminara, the alleged director of eSports.com LTD with the help of Natalia Stoyanova-Perron. The agreement stipulated that eSports.com has 5 days to file complaints.  Audit  ABDK Consulting has finished the report on October 26th. Among others, a critical flaw was found: the smart contract has some tokens frozen till certain time, but later anyone, not only the legitimate owner could withdraw them. The developers, having seen the report, fixed the mistake saving potentially millions of dollars in tokens for eSports. On October 30th, ABDK has reviewed the corrections to the code made by the developers.  Payment  The payment has never happened, even the advance one. The invoice was sent on November 9th. On November 10th Natalia promised to return to me on Monday [13th]. On 13th she commanded us to contact their CEO Philipp Geppert. When we provided our phone number, on 16th she said “he will call you tomorrow”. On November 18th Philipp promised to contact on Monday-Tuesday [20th-21th]. He did not call. After a reminder on 23th Philipp sent a cryptic message about token naming and mentions that he is very busy. On November 25th he finally called and said he did not see the agreement. He could not provide details on what the problems are. On November 27th we got a message he is on flight to Singapore.   Dmitry Khovratovich, CEO of ABDK Consulting",False

I am Ben, one of the Co-Founder & Chief Esports Officer at esports.com and I want to share a lot of information with you guys.  For deeper insights into the project, please check out our Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFtLf5D2YA7ScebNzE1Qm1g (Videos are available in English and German) Or join Telegram to ask direct questions: https://telegram.me/esportsert  I will tackle all the comments one by one from page 4:  - Will you pay authors for making content for the portal? Will you pay in fiat money or crypto-currencies? // Yes, we will pay authors and content contributors on the platform. We will pay them in ERT, which can be cashed out into Crypto or FIAT.  - Hello! What are the main content categories on the Esports portal? // We will have 3 major categories: Education, Entertainment and Statistics. Check our Whitepaper or one of our videos to get a deeper understanding.  - iam make signature for this project // please contact us directly. Thank you - Our CMs will speak to you.  - Can I exchange some of my tokens for fiat money inside Esports portal in the future if I need it? // Yes, we will allow you to exchange your tokens at market value (we integrate an API to one of the exchanges) into FIAT and pay it out to you.  - In which region is your company registered? Will the received licenses allow you to bet on cybersport events in the crypto-currency? // Our company is registered in Malta, we have offices in Prague (CZ), Sofia (BG) and Berlin (GER). The gambling license we are using allows users to bet on esports tournaments in ERT, although the actual betting contract will be in FIAT. This means, we convert ERT into FIAT and place the bet. For the user it will not feel differently than using directly crypto. We have to do this due to the regulatory framework in Malta. This might change in the future, since Malta is working on a framework, that actually allows us to accept cryptocurrency as well as skins.  - Will juvenile users be able to bet? How will the account verification in Esports be carried out in terms of age confirmation? // We are regulated in Malta. This means, we have to check ID and do a full KYC on customers, that want to bet. We will only allow licensed betting in countries, where it is legal and to adults, who are old enough to do so respective of their country they live in.  - What part of the profit do you plan to invest in the promotion of Esports in order to make e-sports recognized as an official one? // We give 1% of our profits to the growth and promotion of esports as a sport. We want to support the esports industry and help the guys to develop clubs and training programs like we already have it in established sports like soccer and so on.  - Which club do you plan to create in Germany to increase the popularity of Esports? Do you already have an approximate plan for its structure? // Maybe you refer to the esports university - our physical gaming house location, where we invite anyone to participate and become a pro gamer? If you specifiy, I can tell you more about it as well as we can actually show more in a video.  - do you have plans to organize e-sports competitions to raise the popularity of Esports? What competitions are you planning to launch in the near future? // We don't plan esports competitons - there are others (like our Partner ESL) out there, who are really good in crerating such competitons. We will sponsor some of the events but not hold our own ones. At least not for the near future.  - Will I be able to use tokens that I’m going to buy during the ICO to buy goods in your online stores? Will there be any discounts for using tokens when paying? // Yes, you can use the tokens for merchandise, hardware, skins or tickets to events. There won't be any discounts, because all sales are done through ERT. If you pay in FIAT, this will be exchanged to ERT, then you use it to pay.  - How can I enter the Esports cybersport university? How much will training cost and can you pay for it with tokens? // We have different programs, because the esports university is very complex. 1. We have coached available, that you can book for X Euros an hour (in ERT) - those can be peers, so you can actually offer a coaching lesson yourself and earn money - or pro players and coaches, who might cost more, something like 100 - 200€ an hour, depending on, who you want to book. 2. The physical university will be a real university studies program with a German university. There won't be any tuition fees (Education in Germany is free), but we will go into more details in the future. 3. Online courses and videos available for training will be free of charge. So feel free to check out all guides and browse around, once we are live.  - what privileges can I get for a premium subscription in Esports? Can it be bought only for fiat funds or for crypto currency? // There will be different tiers but in general you will be able to pay in ERT (or FIAT) and the privileges are exclusive content, access to sold out VIP tickets to events or some special vanity items for our most loyal fans.  - Do you already have a prototype of your platform? How can I access it to become familiar with the basic functions? // we have an internal prototype and will release first screenshots soon. A clickable prototype will follow during the course of our ICO, but we are still working hard to make it nice and shiny for you guys!  - How will the odds for e-sports events on the Esports platform be formed? // We have most likely one or two providers of Odds and our inhouse trading team. Ivan, our Head of eSports Trading built the esports trading team at Pokerstars and he knows his way around setting odds and making markets. Feel free to message him on Telegram - we try to cover all questions.  -   Now this one, I have to quote. You are my special friend already and I will give you a lot of attention, because I don't want to leave this unsanswered. Hereby I invite you to send me a PM and we can have a skype or Telegram call within the next few days. We can record this call and I will be open to post this here for anyone to read.  It is very easy for you to call us another scam, but already the domain name and all our in-depth videos on Youtube should show you, that we are a real project, with a 20+ people team and by no means trying to run away with your money. Please let me know, why you think, we would not be real? We are humans And we are Entrepreneurs, this means - yes... in The beginning a website doesn't look perfect. A few things take a bit longer and maybe it is not the glossy high life style you would wish for. But isn't this how all those projects here started? So give us a chance to prove, that we deserve your attention as well as we will build the project we have in our minds. We will do that anyways, with or without your contribution and I myself put a big amount of my personal money into the project. You know - the domain alone was a 7figure investment to make. Thanks for noticing, that it is really awesome We love it too!  So please - send me a message or come to my team or myself. We go to the conferences, we speak there and explain what we do, so people like you can come and ask theri questions to a real human being. If you, by any chance are in Berlin or in any other city I am going to speak soon - come to me, shake my hand and ask me things, but please. Don't call it bad words, before checking back with me. (It's my baby and I like it too much )  Thanks for listening and send me messages at any time! (I am not too often here, but try Telegram, we check it most of the time and have about 2000+ Users in our channel)  And also - thanks for supporting. We just released a video, that we reached already 5M€ in funding in our presale! You guys are awesome! We are happy, that a bunch of you really like the project as much as we do  Ben",False

In addition to that ERT token holders will have the opportunity to participate in raffles. We will release more info on that after discussing with our lawyers.

It is important to say, that we are in discussions with several exchanges to allow you trade ERT on their site and that we also buy tokens back at current market value.
