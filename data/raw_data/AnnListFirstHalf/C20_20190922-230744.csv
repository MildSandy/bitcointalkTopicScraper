The Hyperion white paper is now available for download at invictuscapital.com.    The Invictus Hyperion ICO will begin on 30 April 2018 with a hard cap of 15M USD. Through the IHF (Invictus Hyperion Fund) token, investors gain diversified exposure to a portfolio of expertly-vetted investments in both private and public pre-sales, and ICOs, and will receive quarterly dividend payouts once the fund has doubled in size.  Priority access will be given to both CRYPTO20 ICO investors and current C20 token holders. In the latter case, you will need to prove ownership of at least 500 C20 tokens (using a verification tool being released soon). Visit www.InvictusCapital.com/Hyperion for more information.

It is an index fund that holds and autonomously rebalances a data science proven portfolio of the top 20 cryptocurrencies.  Actively managed funds have consistently failed to beat the market index despite decades worth of data, billions of dollars and hundreds of analysts at their disposal. When they have, their fees dilute investor returns to less than if they had simply held the index.  Due to rising crypto prices, the fund value per token exceeded the price of tokens being sold. Pre-sale investors were able to acquire $1.10 of underlying crypto assets for $0.95 per token.  The CRYPTO20 pre-sale is now over, with over 2000 backers from 93 countries and $5 million in total funds raised.
