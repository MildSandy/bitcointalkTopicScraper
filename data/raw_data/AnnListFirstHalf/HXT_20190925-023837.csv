With all those of you who are spreading FUD about Hextra need to consider is that a lending platform thrives in a healthy market and people making loans. Without those elements, how can anyone be surprised that the platform wouldn't place measures to control the price and people dumping. These measures are actually an indication that they care about the project.  I would love to be able to withdraw some btc right now but I understand that if that was allowed to happen, we would likely end up with a 404 page error. All we can do is wait for the market to improve and see what Hextra does afterwards. Not really much for Hextra to say now when things look like a dogs breakfast across the board.  Does everyone agree the lending space has changed from when it was only Bitconnect? Back then people would reinvest and keep lending.

We can't get BTC without exchanging to HXT first, so, we can wait, but if Hextra keeps ignoring the community like they have for the past months, they will follow their price schedule. So, in 10 days HXT will be at 25USD, getting even pricier.. At this point though, we can't get out with USD or Hextra anyway. Only maybe if you currently have some BTC left. I still have soe hope Hextra wises up, as at this point no one in their right mind would invest. They need to fix things first. To begin with stop fixing the price. Free market.  Regarding the Lotto.. Not sure, but they would need something like that to keep interest in the project going. Although, i'm not gonna invest HXT until they paid out the missing interest., then, maybe.  For now i just login daily, exchange for HXT and hope for better times. Not much else to do until the exchange is fixed.

Or at least better than now. I rather have a 1.8USD floor, than a 15USD floor with no way to sell or withdraw. Yes, for most 1.8USD would be bad. But then you can decide to HODL or not.. I would hold at least until it gets to a good price. The last 10 days or so showed that with a artificial floor at 5 or now at 15, selling is near to impossible, besides the issues of withdrawals. Still not sure if they work, the withdrawals that supposedly did work took at least 3-7 days because Hextra skimmed the fee.

These are created by the miners over time and the time is fixed. Hextracoin has about 350k Facebook followers if you would assume each of them has an average payment of $200 due at the end of January  (from Hextracoin Gold + Interest + 60 day loans made in November) that would sum up to 70 Million USD. So they would be screwed at the current price of 5 USD*10 Million Coins= 50 Million USD Market cap of all coins. With their price setting they will have a minimum price of 15 USD by then which translates to a market cap of 150 Million by then which means they could pay the investors in Hextracoins if they hold 50% of the total supply themselves by then.

The thing that I find the most annoying is that Hextra is trying to reward the true/initial investors with HXG and somehow people take this whole process to bring the platform down! Yes, they have some delay on their roadmap, but HXG was never included in the roadmap and that took time and resources to get done! The always kept their promises so have some faith!  The whole price dip came from people trying to take advantage of the HXG by coming in before the snapshot and withdrawing like crazy again afterwards. These same people will now wait 30 days and will all try to take the HXG + interest cash total out of the program at the earliest convenience! That will potentially be bad for the HXF price again! That was not what HXG was meant for... It's meant to reinvest!!!  Of course everyone should be able to cash in on their profits every now and again, but it is killing for ANY system if the majority of the community does this at the same time. What happens If we all run to our regular banks at the same time and withdraw all our funds?? That's how whole economic systems crash! The same goed for these lending platforms! Hextra is right to limit this behaviour in some sort of way (limiting the possibility to sell HXT, at least for a sub market price) because it is destroying the system imho.  If everyone just keep reinvesting their money and cashes out some nice amounts at random moments then these lending platforms will flourish, but the crazy amount of day trading and panic reactions are dangerous and ill adviced! There are different (ie. not lending) platforms for that you know?  Anyway...just my two cents 😊",False

You have to be on, to survive these whale dumps.    My opinion is a dump after the gold is released.   But a rebound after, because people will know they are legit, after they come back.  In my opinion, if you have faith they will be back after the fork, put in a loan.   If you are afraid, sell before the snapshot, with enough time to withdraw.  I would not wait for the snapshot, then try to sell, is what I am saying. I want to put in a loan, depending on the price tomorrow night.  I sold a decent amount the last two days, just in case.  Which I kind of regret, but I had to make sure I secured some profits.  A bit afraid of dumping, look at regal price now Dont know whats wrong with them though The snapshot is at 11:59PM UTC/6:59PM EST on 12/25.  Regal, had a lot of problems, from what they did at the beginning, locking people.. to these partying gatherings... to the fact that they dont have an internal exchange.  They are losing transaction fees by not having an internal.  IMO hextra is doing okay, but not that great.  The platform is the best looking imo, and they havent failed on a payment yet.  But you always have to look with caution.  I am worried, because the price is underperforming what I expected, esp 33 hours from gold.   So we will see tomorrow.  If you are afraid, sell before the snapshot. 1) People are worried that Hextra may not come back after the snapshot. 2) It will probably dump hard after the snapshot  If you have faith that HXT will be back after the snapshot, might as well put in a loan.  Price will be good(hopefully) and you will get the gold.  Cant really 100% blame them for the price. Recent bitcoin price really hurt the alt coins price badly. Its gonna take a while to recover the price",False

I found a new on couple of days ago.  weekly and monthly passive returns on  your investment. But you don't need to lend out your tokens. When you invest you receive units and the amount of units determine your weekly passive return. So no tokens are locked because of lending contract.  weekly passive returns on trading monthly passive return on their mining activities.  impossible that purchased tokens get mossed or stolen. when signing up you only receive units and as soon as their token, wallets and blockchain are ready your tokens are sent to your external wallet. So the platform itself will not contain any tokens, wallets or BTC wallet. so impossible to steal tokens from the platform.  This is much more than all lending platforms.  - decent white paper instead of the lending 'white papers' that are just something like a presentation of the affiliate and lending program and some basic information on what btc and their token stand for. - no hidden owners. The 2 owners are visible in the white paper and have both public fb accounts that already are active for years- - no Ponzi payout schedule. They invest raised funds back into the market after only deducting 10% for affiliate system. The other 90% goes into holding, trading and mining. And all real stuff.  holding: They will publish all their holdings and will be audited several times per year so investors can verify. trading: All trades and profits will be published every single week mining: they don't cooperate with cloud mining services.    - BTC mining: They will buy their own blockboxes from BITFURY. So they have their own hardware, but will be managed by bitfury for a fixed monthly fee.    - ETH and altcoin mining: For this they will cooperate with ethmine.co.za. A South African hardware provider that also offers managing of rigs for a fixed monthly fee  So all their distributed earnings will be real and verifiable.  They don't promise anything but they promise what they deliver will be real. They don't promise 40-48% monthly but they promise you real returns.   The most powerful about this project is that they don't rely on supply and demand on exchanges to increase the value of their token. Their activities create an environment that makes the token grow in value without any human interference.  I am not posting any links here but if this sounds good to you hit me in a pm.  Another nice thing is their ICO launched only very recently and until now less than 100 contributors. So you all have the chance to become an early bird and get on top of the affiliate program.

The idea of our system is very simple and profitable. We have created bots (IDEABOT) which monitor more than 12 exchanges and other sources for the appearance of new coins in their listing.  After the appearance of the coin on the exchange, the system analyzes the coin indicators, more than 24 parameters and decides whether to buy this coin for profit or not.  After the bots have made the purchase of coins, they further analyze the market for a sharp increase in the value of the bought coins (pump) and if it occurs, then sell these coins in several steps, making a very high profit in the system.    Lending Program  Lending is to invest by your own Idea Coins (IDEA) to get the return on a daily basis from the Management of IDEACOIN. IdeaCoin provides investment options for you to get the full benefit as per your investment ability.  In case you would like to invest more than $1,010 , IdeaCoin will guarantee your return per day based on your investment as the additional benefit, excluding your daily return.

Believers. Myself I am a believer too, back then I was a believer in good (only) and now I am a believer in both good and bad. Approx. 15 years ago I came to know Forex, it took me months to figure out how to find a niche, how to find the way it could work for me. I happen to found it, and I've made cca 55x (multiple of investment) I've put into it within a short timeframe. I was paralyzed, pumped, excited and foremost my ego went up! My world has changed and I have changed myself. In many ways I suddenly felt sooo much freedom from everything around, however I started to feel stuck....Anyhow...to make story short ... I've hit the wall and pretty strongly and I've blamed everything around me but myself. It took me years to re-emerge from the financial ashes of my poor decisions. I feel that nowadays we are in the midst of the (crypto)revolution and one of the most spectacular re-distribution of the wealth! This revolution will fuel many projects, including Hextracoin, BCC etc. IMHO Bitconnect will be here for longer, despite it's shady background, and perhaps pyramidal structure together with a huge bet on cryptocurrency (and in particular BTC) appreciation. (Hence all of the investment remains in US$). For how long will they last is everyone's guess. Until then everybody here will make money and very easily.  However, if any of you are into HYIPs (and at this stage I am into it myself) I strongly think there are even better programs out there.  It is a time to pull out the very simple calculator and use the simple mathematics:  http://compoundhyip.com  The miracle of an automatically compounding interest together with an option to pull your investment out anytime (!) (20% fee).... Hm, hm, well, going through dozens if not 100s of HYIPs...I could not find anything better than T.G.Thomas within the Chain.Group. There are numerous other HYIP's or even other trading groups within chain.group and they all sounds great, looks great, but upon further investigation and calculations, nothing can beat TGT. With an easy adjustable option to reinvest between 0-50-100% of your daily income, it is staggering how quickly funds start piling up. TGT offers its services since April, 2017 that speaks volume too!  Anyhow...this is just my 2c worth. Everybody do your own DD(!) and never forget to invest only the money you part with right from the beginning. If there are HYI Programs out there and all of them with relatively risky propositions...TGT looks on top of everything, just based on the pure mathematics!

To me without internal exchange is the really lost out alot as more ICO + lending platforms coins are coming out too.  And also they applied a good marketing strategy by giving investors Hextra Gold (HXG = US$30) and invest for 30 days and return with captial + special interest rates. So as a investors you definitely wont sell your HXT coins to earn more profit and also attract more investors which further increase the coin price more. Therefore is profit for all investors and developer too.  And the price now is already USD35 due to increase BTC price but HXT/BTC rate is moving up slowly too very stable.  I hope Hextra team can do even better and their system is alot more stable and fast now. This is the right approach for long term investment.,False

There are 2 Scenarios:  1) The amount of HXT you initially put in lending (i.e. you lended 20 HXT on Nov. 1st so you will get 10 HXG on Dec. 25th) 2) The amount in USD in your lending account by Dec. 25th (i.e. you lended 20 HXT on Nov 1st - were about 300$ then, but till December the price rises to let's say 40$ each HXT - 300$ / 40$ = 7.5 HXT / 2 = 3.75 HXG)  Any ideas about this?",False

It doesn't matter if you set a loan today or around that time. As long as you have HXT on the snapshot date, you get your alloted HXG.  I'm waiting for a better value before setting a loan for instance.",False

So to my mind, they will calculate from there and of course with the price of HXT to the time of the snapshot.  It's nothing more than a ""picture"" of all accs and balances. So how could they determine the initial value of your investment?",False

Otherwise no one in their right mind would setup loans just for HXT. If you read their posts, it's based on invested HXT. Not USD. If i loan 200HXT today, keep 200HXT in wallet, i get 150HXG. If i do the same but on Dec. 24th, EVEN if HXT is 30+USD by then, i get 150HXG. That's the only fair way and the only way to easily calculate.  If they would use USD value, looking of Hextra's past history: that's gonna go very wrong and they would lose any credibility.  Also, day 1 i had a 16USD loan setup for 100HXT and another for 100. I'm about 99% sure that said the amount of HXT invested and at what rate. They might have changed that by now. Total was 3200USD worth (after the reset waiting on a better rate now)",False

All they've done is removed the queue numbers so you don't know where it's up to.  I did a test withdrawal of 0.001 BTC at 9am on the dot when it first opened. It came through to my wallet 2.5 hrs later.  Once that went through I submitted the rest of my btc through at 11:30am. It's already passed 2.5hrs. I think it's going to take much longer as I'm sure there's a massive backlog of withdrawals ahead of this transaction now.  Think I'll go to sleep and hopefully it's in my wallet when I wake up.

Traders are happy with 1% a day and bots can lose more in 1 hr than a manual trader in 6 months. If your claim was true, all you have to do is buy any bot out there and not even bother with these sites, but its not true. That's why they don't. And to see these high returns they would have to trade BILLIONS of dollars in trade on these ghost exchanges with their magic ""bot"" just for 1 site... however if you add up the daily trades on ALL exchanges you get nowhere near the level of trading volume needed to pay out the money these sites claim they will, even transaction and trade fees wouldn't account for a fraction of the profit they claim they will pay.  Your claim of BCC trading is foolhardy, they put on a show and people (your so called ""new investors"") throw their BTC into a pyramid scam Banking on the idea BTC will continue to rise in value so they will make 500% on the BTC you traded to them at a set price while you may be lucky to make %300 at your set price when if you just held you'd make 500% (if the BTC price does not crash, if it does, they exit scam!),  they then pay out those who withdraw, and will eventually screw over those who ""re-invest"". You know where they have you click to transfer the $ into BCC, that's click bait for morons to pay their price for the BCC, then you can trade into BTC for more loss. If you'd just held BTC from the beginning you would have made 6000% profit on that BTC, if you ""invested"" on BCC you'd have earned maybe 300%, that's how they pay you suckers profit, all these coins you list do the same, and people pump them for fools to join under referral links. You'd be better off buying BTC and holding it, end of story.  Logic isn't hate speech. But fools like you keep referring to logic as hate or racism... that means you've been so blinded by the scam you don't know what is real or not.

Defenition of racism: ""The belief that races have distinctive cultural characteristics determined by hereditary factors and that this endows some races with an intrinsic superiority over others.""  As any member of any race has the possibility of belonging to any religious group, stating any simple difference between 2 religious groups such as ""gift giving"" and calling it racist is inherently ignorant as the obvious is all religions consist of all races. In simple terms: Races are not religions and religions are not races. Gift giving or not giving, is not racist.  Also: ""It is not Shirk (associating partners to Allah) for a Muslim to offer presents or receive presents at the occasion of Christmas. However, it is forbidden for him to do so (to accept or offer presents on this occasion) because by doing so he confirms the falsehood the Christians are upon. This is also considered as helping in falsehood."" ( http://www.islamweb.net/en/article/155835/giving-and-receiving-christmas-presents )  Kenmasters, you have a long history of ignoring questions, and requests at showing logic in your statements and you always dance around the topic by replying with baseless accusations designed to discredit without logic or relevance.    Dec 25th is the perfect scam date. Half the world will be sleeping in, or busy with their families, the perfect time to run out the back door!

He got more then 50 hextra's though, so people who didn't buy them might still have troubles withdrawing.  The only thing I'm really worried about is where everybody is discussing the launch of hextra, because other ico's are much discussed; telegram / bitcointalk etc. But I can't find a single platform with a heated discussion, while you would expect that with the hype around it. It makes me think more and more that the hype was staged and the plug was pulled at the sell marks in the ico period. I hope somebody else can prove me wrong by giving me a topic or place where the launch is discussed.  The discussion is not very heated here, not a lot of comments, so somebody knows a place where all the excited people are discussing this?",False

The requirement to buy 50 HXT was right on the page where you click deposit BTC.  IT COULDNT GET ANY CLEARER!  Hextra was hard to buy, a minimal amount of research would have told you this.   Did you read the whitepaper?  Now Hextra wants to steal your Segwit 2x? LOL, BTG was a joke.  Hopefully segwit flops too. If you think Hextra is a scam, move on.  You were not supposed to invest more than you are comfortable losing.  Use the lessons you learned in the future.

If you bought at 90 cents and sold at $96 USD, thats over 10000% return thats crazy.  So sad that I let the fud scare me off on that one. (Even though Regal's actions have been pretty scammy)  Hextra has a bonus plan thats intended to keep people in the platform at least till Dec 25th.  It sounds like a good idea and I am probably going to take them up on it.  If you keep or lend your ICO coins with them, they will give you a bonus HextraGold coin on Jan 1. If you keep your coins in the platform without lending, you will get 1 HextraGold coin for every 4 ICO coins you kept in.  If you lend with them, you will get 1 hextragold coin for every 2 ICO coins that you are lending through their platform.  Each HextraGold Coin is worth $20 in lending on their platform.     Doing the 4:1 math, thats equivalent to a $5 lending credit for each ICO hextracoin you keep on their platform until Dec $25th, OR equivalent to $10 lending credit for each ICO hextracoin you lent through their platform through Dec 25th.  Seems pretty enticing to me.  Hopefully Hextra pops to $5(or much better  ), that way I can sell 10-20% to get my investment back and keep the rest in platform.",False

I was gonna say RegalCoin in second place however it seems hextracoin devs have their shit together a little more and their site looks more polished.  Not that that means anything. So equal 2 & 3 would be Hextracoin and Regalcoin. 4. EthConnect - still very new and most likely very dodgy but looks pretty flash.

Initially Hextra DID NOT ADVERTISE YOUR BTC WOULD BE LOCKED IN, this was added about 2 weeks ago, and doesn't excuse the fact they did that as if the ""artificial"" demand was ""real"" demand there would be no reason to lock it in due to it selling out anyways. Why are you so willingly arrogantly ignorant about this?  DDOS attacks take MILLIONS of hits per SECOND to affect a site. Hextra knows this and is one of the reasons they want to lock in your BTC so the site crashes and it appears they have demand then no one can buy and it looks like more demand, rinse and repeat. Opening multiple pages trying to buy only worsens this not makes it better, that is why they use a preferred customer list. This does not mean demand is high. They can also co-ordinate their own efforts at jamming their network to create artificial demand.  Representatives of a secret company responding on a thread could be held accountable if ever traced back to who they really are when these scams finally fall, that is the whole purpose of referral links and paid pumpers like yourself,... ""sympathy vote""~""I had problems just like you people... this worked for me... now you can trust me!""~ When really its just some greed blinded fool convincing others to invest in a scam and pump it up. A technique to wash their hands of any wrong doing and receive funds in the process. That's why these so-called ""investment platforms"" are all anonymous with impunity. They know they are dancing with the devil and are subject to domestic and international fraud laws. This is why countries such as (CHINA) and (JAPAN->(huge crypto adopters) have total ICO bans and USA is banning many ICO's.... because they are scams.

All lending platforms operate the same.  If you were smart you would send a small amount of BTC, make sure you are able to buy before sending a larger amount of BTC to the platform. BTG is worth 2% of the BTC price currently.  That's like a rounding error in terms of value. 5. There is no preferred customer list.  There are days I got and others I didn't.  On 2 occasions I got in twice.  I even used Paxful for escrow to purchase more at $2 so I can get my hands on it.  If you want to get them you can get them. 6. It sells out everyday in a minute for an entire month.  Your BTC is available to buy after the ICO is over.  Support at FB has helped people get BTC out.  Plus how much did you send that you are doing a 180 after not getting some and wanting to take your BTC out. 7. Pure conjecture and bullshit.  It works and will be revealed per the road map. 8.

Each and every day I've missed out.  Somehow, they're selling hundreds of thousands of coins in 10-seconds.

I have no issue with missing a supposed purchase window, although totally selling out in 10-seconds is really shady... my issue is their arbitrary rule that you can't withdraw your bitcoin.  I didn't think about it until I read it earlier... but maybe it is because of the Bitcoin Gold fork.  The timing is really suspicious.  Hundreds or even thousands of bitcoins transferred, then only allow about 10% of those to purchase gives you a guaranteed Bitcoin Gold balance.

So far everything worked fine but as soon as i was logged in into blockchaininfo a transaction was immediately made without me doing anything. All my money gone within a second. There was a cancel button and i tried to click it several times but it didnt work. I know im in the wrong section but i didnt find anything simular and just wanted to give it a try here. So if anyone had/have the same problem or knows whats going on let me please know. This is what i got from the blockchaininfo support:  Hello,  An unconfirmed transaction will eventually be accepted into a block by whichever mining pool mines the block, or the transaction will eventually be rejected by the bitcoin network. If it eventually is rejected, then the funds would remain at the bitcoin address they were sent from. The only thing you can do at this point is to wait and see if the transaction is accepted into a block. Like all wallet providers, Blockchain.info has absolutely no control over this, and cannot expedite transactions. This is always dependent upon the bitcoin network of miners, which we are not a part of.  Blockchain.info wallets utilize dynamic fees.
