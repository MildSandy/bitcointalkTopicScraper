It was a placeholder that was accidentally left when building out signature.  Our project is fundamentally different from TenX or any other crypto card for three main reasons:  1. Instantaneous exchange protocol. Our methodology for ensuring instant transactions is different to any other cryptocard. We mimic the parts of traditional banking that work, to ensure that when you spent it is instantaneous and doesn't need to wait for digital confirmations. We do this by using a multisig system which automatically 'locks' the funds you commit to a purchase allowing us to pay the retailer in fiat currency immediately while preventing double spend.  2. Credit card perks. We believe that the general public aren't going to adopt crypto card en masse if we can't compete with the type of perks they get elsewhere. We've solved this by agreeing to an air miles programme with the Star Alliance group and will negotiate with other air line groups and hotel groups to offer more perks. This is a fundamental selling point for general adoption.  3. Decentralized profit sharing. Every coin holder is investing in something with a true underlying value. One coin = one share and all of the profit from our network (which come from small fees levied on transactions and affiliate fees from exchanges) will be split equally between every coin holder.  Best,  Daniel",True
