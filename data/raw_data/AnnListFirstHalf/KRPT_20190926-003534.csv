Assessment Kript gives you personalized insights about the crypto market and the potential of other crypto assets.  Exchange service With Kript you can buy or sell crypto assets from multiple exchanges directly in one app. Anytime, anywhere.  We develop our application for two groups of people:  people who have already invested or plan to invest in cryptocurrencies and related businesses, but they are afraid of the high risks usually associated with the crypto market inexperienced investors who have money but don’t want to spend a lot of time analyzing the market. They need a clear idea of what and when to buy  What is our goal?  The largest issue facing cryptocurrencies is illiquidity. Our goal is to help create a transparent and sustainable liquidity for the markets. We keep the investors better informed and aim to bring additional knowledge, ability, and talent to the markets. In order to create transparency and value in this new economy, we created Kript — a multi- blockchain platform that implements a service function — to assist the investor in making the best trading decision for his portfolio. We create a social trading environment for the investor to make these decisions based on knowledge and understanding.
