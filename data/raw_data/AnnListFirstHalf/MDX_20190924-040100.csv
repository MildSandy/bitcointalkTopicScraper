It was proposed to several workers of different companies from around the world to get paid via cryptocurrency. International cryptocurrency exchange Midex decided to organize an extraordinary experiment. The company came to an agreement with the directors of various offices from different countries that they would propose to their employees the option of receiving their salary in cryptocurrency. The reactions of the workers would be captured by camera and transformed into a unified video file. It would be quite interesting to see how ordinary office workers would react to this if they were proposed to draw their salary or some part in cryptocurrency. Therefore, Midex decided to examine how they would respond to this.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAmpYLW0tDk    Thank you for your participation! Lets MIDEX IT!",False

Direct transaction of ETH to smart contract address. 2. Cryptocurrency (not ETH) transaction to shown addresses in account. 3. Transaction from your ETH wallet on our website.  Only using 3rd way you need to type your private key. It is voluntarily. The key is needed to sign your transaction and we don't save or watch your key. These method is MyEtherWallet website analogue. It works the following way: There is a cryptocurrency node for Etherium. So the node is the distribution programm packages which are provided by ETH developers. Any website including Midex refers to that node by API to transfer transaction which afterwards sends to blockchain. On the moment of sending the transaction from website to the node it is necessary to sign up the transaction by your private key. Transaction is signed and send. During this process your private key is not sending anywhere and the transaction is sending already encrypted. This way of payment is made for your convenience and Midex account don't save your private key as well as any other keys. The account is only the tool for displaying of wallets ballances and a guide for token purchasing.  So if if you don't like 3rd way you can buy our tokens by another 2 ways.,False

Direct transaction of ETH to smart contract address. 2. Cryptocurrency (not ETH) transaction to shown addresses in account. 3. Transaction from your ETH wallet on our website.  Only using 3rd way you need to type your private key. It is voluntarily. The key is needed to sign your transaction and we don't save or watch your key. These method is MyEtherWallet website analogue. It works the following way: There is a cryptocurrency node for Etherium. So the node is the distribution programm packages which are provided by ETH developers. Any website including Midex refers to that node by API to transfer transaction which afterwards sends to blockchain. On the moment of sending the transaction from website to the node it is necessary to sign up the transaction by your private key. Transaction is signed and send. During this process your private key is not sending anywhere and the transaction is sending already encrypted. This way of payment is made for your convenience and Midex account don't save your private key as well as any other keys. The account is only the tool for displaying of wallets ballances and a guide for token purchasing.,False
