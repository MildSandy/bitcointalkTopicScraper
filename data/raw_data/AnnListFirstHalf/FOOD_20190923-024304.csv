Dishonest retailers are frequent in the food industry, either among the intermediaries and supermarket staff. We will tell you how can it be and how the blockchain technology can help you to avoid being tricked. The substitution of the expiry dates and the information about the origin is not caused by the food deficit, but the competition on the food market. A large amount of goods rests unsold, and most retailers will try to put the products on another’s shoulders to avoid expenditures. The most common practice is the substitution of the expiry dates. The products can be put with new stickers with new dates, repacked or even processed: for example, the meat can be minced, or vegetables can be frozen or cut for salad. The fact that these products are already inedible will be hidden from the customer. Such products can also include those ones that had been stored under wrong temperature or humidity. Even the country of origin can be replaced. A certain store can replace the stickers or even the certificates in order to sell the food faster. It is not just a problem of certain stores, but also of large retailers. There is just not enough of certifying bodies to check everything. The store owners often know about forthcoming inspections, and will get ready for them the months before. The customer itself often risks buying expired food. And such things happen in a society with cutting-edge technologies! Speaking about the technologies. There is something that can save the customers from deception and keep the vendors from modifying the information about the product. It is the blockchain technology, which implies storing the information in a distributed ledger which doesn’t allow to modify the entered information. It means that the expiry date and origin data of the product will just be impossible to be changed, because the vendors will just not be allowed to change it. You will know for sure, when and where a fruit which you have on your table have been grown. The same ledger will have the information about how these products have been grown, whether organically or not, which seeds and fertilizers have been used in the process, and all from the source, not from third parties, which are unsafe for the health to be trusted to. FoodCoin Ecosystem considers developing a special product origin tracking system – PRORID. It will consist in signing a smart contract by one or more experts (public, commercial or private) with an undisputed authority in matters of origin authentication of the goods that are the subject of an agreement under the current Smaco contract. If a smart contract includes a PRORID feature, the logistics company will be obliged to accept the goods only after confirmation from the experts on the current smart contract based on the consensus between the parties of the contract. PRORID integration with the electronic databases of public fiscal, customs and supervisory authorities will significantly limit the circulation of illegal, counterfeit and other illicit trafficking products and goods, thus making a significant contribution to the fight against economic crimes.",False

I had the pleasure of working on farms in 2 West African countries. It was part of a college course I undertook. 2 things I noticed when I was there was the the price the farmers were paid for raw products (cocoa beans 5c for a sack 10kg!?!) and the fact that all the farmers had skipped the PC, Laptop and Tablet life cycle and were all on smart phones. I believe this is a common phenomenon with all sub Saharan countries.   Locally, I have a friend who set up a small poultry farm, although western Europe is big on the virtues of local produce and healthy sustainable supply, he explained how incredibly difficult it is to compete with big suppliers to break into any store, even stores that profess to be the healthy local option.  I'm by no means a health freak or a green warrior. But the beef option in my shops come from Argentina, I live in Ireland which has a healthy and renowned beef stock. Fish situation is similar.  To sum it up, I really like the idea of this project, investment aside, I hope my money helps to develop the concept and it gives small and under educated farmers some help in sustaining their lively hood and also reaping the rewards of what they sow.  Good look team, hope to see more in the future.",False

There's a very interesting article recently appeared on Cointelegraph focused on Foodcoin and blockchain in agriculture, that can help to answer your question though I think the team spokesperson may give you more info:  ""Implementing Blockchain into the production, certification and food processing steps creates transparency in an otherwise non-transparent system and allows consumers to support suppliers they choose. It is particularly relevant for organic and certified origin products.  Liz Reitzig emphasizes the importance of determining the origin of organic products:      “If a farm is certified organic, or they want to emphasize a different kind of certification, they can use Blockchain to track products. Consumers want to know what they are buying, and Blockchain can offer that.”  Marcel Blankenstein, owner of Naked Organics, believes that origin information may be interesting for the user as long as it’s usable:      “Blockchain in agriculture allows the consumer to scan the barcode of a product in the supermarket and instantly view the entire supply chain from supermarket to farmer. In terms of consumer orientated transparency. From a regulatory perspective, agricultural contamination can be very quickly isolated.” Read More: https://cointelegraph.com/news/growing-the-garden-how-to-use-blockchain-in-agriculture  Personally I believe this project is awesome and cant wait to see it in action!

Ekgaon is an IT network integrator that provides services to aid farmers such as financial, agricultural and civil assistance.  - Financial help is provided by a mobile app that helps to find financial organizations which deliver services such as credit, insurance, investment and savings.  - Web technology and interactive voice responsive system offers help in finding information about weather, market prices and goods, soil nutrition and crop management.  - Through web and mobile applications, the citizens can use government programs and services.  Aquaculture lacks of good technologies for measuring and controlling the water conditions. The technologies of Eruvaka help to implement technologies in aquaculture to measure and control water conditions. Eruvaka organization developed solar powered buoys that measure water parameters (oxygen level, temprature, pH) that are crucial for the health of fishes and shrimps. The measureв data is then uploaded to the cloud platform and delivered to the customers via app, SMS, voice call or internet.  BIOSAT is a soil addition based on biochar which increases soil fertility, reduces carbon emission and strengthen the topsoil, thus reducing the need to use of chemical fertilizers.  Barrix Ago Sciences, a startup based in Bangalore, has developed technologies that help to fight pests without using chemical pesticides.  Barrix Catch Fruit and Fly Lure traps use pheromones to attract pests to the trap.  Recyclable fly pest sticky sheets also helps to attract 19 types of pests from a long distance.  The last innovation that is now gaining traction in India – and we are sure you have heard of it – is 1000Ecofarms platform which unites farmers, food produces and customers within a marketplace. It helps to save money and tailor marketing and sales. 1000Ecofarms is currently going through updates, and developing into a blockchain ecosystem with its own payment and marketing instruments, useful for every farmer.

Those things which used to seem a keenness of a small group of people, today have all the chances to become a worldwide trend. Fortunately, it is not about unhealthy diet obsessions or pursuing blindly the fashion, and we take incredible delight to see trends which positively influence to our health and life. The most significant one is the worldwide expansion of the organic production, which is very noticeable recently. Poor quality products may cause more than two hundred diseases, from the digestive system failure to oncology. According to the assessment of the World Health Organization, 600 million of people become ill due to bad quality of food every year. The organic food is produced without food additives, colorants, GMO, synthetic agricultural chemicals, growth hormones, or antibiotics. Organic agriculture is the most proven and reliable way to get healthy and delicious products without any environmental damage. The organic farmers treat the environment, animals, and the most important – the health of those who consume their products, most responsibly. The demand on the organic products is not going to decline. USA Today reported in July that the sales of the organic food products increased by 8.4% compared with the previous year, hitting the record level of $43 billion in 2016. According to the recent TechSci Research estimates, it is anticipated that the global organic food market will increase with the rate of 14% or more between 2016 and 2021. The recent survey of OTA confirms this opinion because the organic sector demonstrated rising trend again. It was noted during the September survey of Organic Trade Association that the millennials are the most common buyers of the organic food. This fact also proves the stability of the trend: The estimates say that 80% of those who belong to this group are going to have children in the next 15 years. However, despite of the stable growth of the organic food consumption and production rates, not all types of products can fit the existing logistics and retail system successfully: The products without conservants get spoiled faster, and cannot travel across long distances. The main ways for them to reach the customers are the specialized shops and direct sales. FoodCoin Ecosystem offers the most convenient, safe and inexpensive way to buy natural products – directly from the seller. As the organic products consumption grows, our audience which prefer the healthy food and beneficial FoodCoin Ecosystem, also does it.",False

However, if you look at the price labels of the supermarkets, you will see that the farm products are much more expensive, while going on a farm on your own may require additional time and gasoline. In order to make purchasing of the farm products easier, we created the platform of 1000Ecofarms, and now we are going to tell you how it works.  1000Ecofarms is an online farmer market, a liaison between the buyers and sellers of natural food. You can find here everything you may need for buying: interactive map to find nearest farms and a handy chat for making orders and contacting the farmers. To make a purchase, all you have to do is to sign up – it would take less than a minute. Now there are almost 4000 users registered on the platform. The sellers are concentrated mainly in Russia and USA. Both of these countries have offices of 1000Ecofarms – in Moscow and Maryland. Of course, there are even more countries where the platform is available: now you can find sellers from Canada, Mexico, Great Britain, Costa Rica, Malaysia, India, Australia, Nigeria, Ukraine and other countries.  Every farmer can publish the goods in the 1000Ecofarms store, with photos and detailed description. If you need more information, you can send a personal message to the farmer. It is helpful both for users and for sellers, as they don’t have to create their own online shops and pay for their maintenance. After the deal, farmer and customer can leave their feedbacks to describe their opinion. For those who are interested in news about the world food industry, we have the Online Journal that have all relevant info.  The project is relatively new, but it is always changing, getting more progressive, beneficial and helpful, all because of the implementation of new tools and an integrated payment currency – the FoodCoin (FdC). 1000Ecofarms is a self-consistent and independent food market – but now not the only one.",False

Which criteria do you follow when you buy food? Strict statistics gives the answer. The experts have surveyed the natural food demand among different generations. The results show that conventional supermarket food sales are decreasing while the products claimed as natural, clean and free from artificial admixtures are the more successful.  These trends are becoming more mainstream: results of the survey show that 93% of US families prefer buying eco-labelled products in supermarkets, 70% - in big marts, and 33% in wholesale stores. 50% of the shopping trips include purchasing natural products. Don't let the common numbers confuse you: not all families always visit the same shopping places.  Consumers born after 1965 prefer buying products labeled as ‘Organic’, ‘Non-GMO’ and ‘Free from added hormones’. On the other hand, older generation consumers pay less attention to such labels.  Consumers are more and more keen in the eco-production concept. As a consequence, the food producers seek to exclude artificial sweeteners, colorants and flavoring agents, and especially such products as high-fructose corn syrup, gluten and trans fats.  Kraft Heinz reconsidered the recipe of their famous Oscar Meyer hot dogs, adding only clean products in it. Two years before, Campbell Soup also claimed to exclude almost all artificial colorants and flavor agents from the products manufactured for US until the end of 2018, and launched a new line of goods made of simple ingredients to satisfy the demand for healthy food. Hershey, General Mills and many other manufacturers have made similar changes.  According the survey of Innova, 75% of consumers always read the ingredients section on the product packages, 91% prefer products that contain well-known healthy ingredients.  In such a way, the food industry has a clear economic motivation to move towards the clean production, as the surveys show that most consumers prefer paying extra 10% for the food that contain ingredients they trust in. 18% of the consumers say that they would pay extra 75% for products they prefer.  Aside from the ingredients, the consumers also consider the nutritional information as an important aspect of choice. However, the price is still the most important factor. Despite of the fact that general consumer prefers eco-labelled foods and drinks, there are still variations by age, income and personal choice. Nielsen analyzed the proportion of eco-products and drinks versus the regular ones. Eco-labels are leading in several categories such as: beans (51% vs. 49%), baked goods (57% vs. 43%), vinegars (81% vs. 19%), sugar and sweeteners (83% vs. 17%) and dairy (90% vs. 10%), according to Food Business News.  A typical eco-labelled production fan can be drawn as a young customer who occasionally cooks at home, loves dairy and has a sweet tooth. However, as it always is, the survey shows the complex consumer demography which food producers should consider, as well as their awareness on choosing the products.",False

A person whose main task and mission is to grow delicious and quality vegetables and fruits. In fact, a farmer should deal with many more things. In order to sell the products at a profit, a farmer has to do a hard work, and making a sale on time often require even more effort than planting, growing and harvesting the crop together.  Why is it so hard to market the crop, even though it is the most qualified and certified? Paradoxically, most of the producers have no direct access to the retail market and supermarkets. Large retail chains work mainly with large producers, which have their own resources for proper storage and transport of the grown products. Supermarkets would prefer to procure products of large agricultural holdings and corporations, which package the products in a good-looking wrapping and these products can be stored for a long time, even though they use chemical fertilizers, preserving agents and GMO-seeds.  In order to market their products, small farmers have to be content with the service of middlemen who purchase their products at deliberately knock-down prices in order to sell it at farmers' and wholesale markets with a 2-3 fold increase. The producers themselves rarely can afford hiring carriers, sellers or renting storage facilities for independent product sale. In this case, there is not much benefit to expect.  As a result, the losses of harvest until spring reach 30-40% and more. To reduce losses, small farmers join cooperatives that also has many problems in organization and management.  The internet gives good opportunity to find customers: many successful farmers have their own online product shops with the option of delivery. However, not all manufacturers have time or possibility to apply to the web-designers and developers, or contract logistic companies and banks. The best solution is to sign up a unique platform of 1000Ecofarms where you can create your own shop freely. A little later, after the implementation of blockchain tool of FoodCoin Ecosystem together with all instruments and smart contract library, product marketing will be even simpler.  On the other hand, a particular online farmer shop rarely has a variety of products, which you can find on 1000Ecofarms, so there are certainly more buyers.  More than 4000 users around the world have already been registered in 1000Ecofarms.

Ethereum is a platform with a plenty of possibilities and a big potential, and no surprise that many startups and entrepreneurs decide to find new solutions for old problems, using cryptocurrencies. For this reason, FoodCoin is intended to solve real problems of people.  Own cryptocurrency – the FoodCoin – resolve several issues.  The first and the most essential issue is the shortage of healthy and quality food, the most important resource in our life. Modern economy has come to a situation when the vast majority of retailers have to fill theirs shelves with inedible products, which become so in order to maintain visual attractiveness after long delivery trips. The products labeled as “eco” and “natural” became synonyms of unreasonably expensive, but still not being different from products made by local producers and farmers who go to rack and ruin because they cannot compete with large producers and agricultural corporations.  The next goal which FoodCoin (FdC) is going to reach is the revival of local economy. Farmers and producers are forced to compete with agricultural corporations and get paid peanuts for their hard work. With the access to global marketplace, they will get opportunities to receive an additional demand. FoodCoin (FdC) will serve as an additional alternative social currency to support agricultural systems and ensure local food and economic safety, thus reviving local small-scale food producers, pushing the local economies to development.  Third, and equally essential usage of FoodCOin (FdC) is the charity. Using blockchain technologies will simplify the adressed charity on the global level and make these activities transparent.  At the FoodCoin Ecosystem, everything adapts to the needs of ordinary people, and all the newest and safe blockchain technologies, such as smart contract library, smart wallet, user identification and product quality checking, will be available in a simple and intuitive interface. Issuing own cryptocurrency will allow to save money on transaction expenses, as they significantly influences the final price of the products.  FoodCoin Platform was created to consolidate food sellers and buyers around the world using cutting-edge technologies and provide them a reliable marketplace with fair prices and quality products.",False

Of course, agricultural products contain the same chemical elements as the natural food do. The entire Universe contains the same elements though. And the composition is not as important thing to keep in mind as it is the correlation among the elements. Today we will tell you about how vegetables grown on different fields differ between each other, and why it is crucial to care about their naturalness.  Nobody can tell, what exactly the vegetables consist of, and in what proportions. However, the products grown on wide fields of the agricultural corporations and on farms differ a lot. This difference influence significantly on the human health.  As an example, let us pick a history of two ordinary Japanese families, Naka and Hirukawa. They always have been buying products in supermarkets, but suddenly they decided to eat only organic food during 10 days. Both of these families, besides parents, had two children each one, so the experiment was for the good of their health. After 10 days, the level of pesticides and other toxins in the urine decreased incredibly. It turned out that the intoxication of the children were higher than that of their parents, as they are more sensitive to toxins. Less the age, more sensitive they are. The families proved that the consumption of natural products makes a positive impact of the health. But what is the difference between the natural products and those bought in a supermarket?  The first difference between them lies in the input data – the seeds. They may be selected by the breeders, or genetically modified in a lab. GM seeds are several times more expensive, but yield a plentiful harvest, though, while depleting the soil. These seeds are bought once in a season, since the GM harvest is yielded only once and leaves no offspring. Using these seeds pays off only in a large scale and requires additional fertilization. This is the second aspect in which the farmer products differ from those industrially grown.  Growing vegetables is not one-minute thing (if they are not the magical beans). They need several months to accumulate the elements from the environment: the air, the water and the soil. The result – a fruit – depends on the environment conditions. Besides weather, it includes also the irrigation, chemical composition of the fertilizers, douching and quality of the soil.  No secret that the agricultural producers use pesticides, herbicides and mineral fertilizers. It is much easier than using the expensive organic fertilizers and collecting parasites by hand. But using chemicals brings a real threat – the overdose. This can actually lead to a deterioration in the quality of the crop, the accumulation of hazardous substances and even the death of plants. It is known that when nitric fertilizers are overdosed, nitrates and nitrites accumulate in the vegetables making their consumption dangerous.  The vegetables grown with organic fertilizers normally contain much larger set of macro and microelements than those grown with any complex mineral fertilizers and physiologically active substances. Even if the farmer products cost a little more than the supermarket vegetables – you will not have to buy medicaments.  The main thing that influence the product quality is the relation between the producer and the customer. A farmer would never want to spoil his reputation by selling definitely poor quality products to the customer that is often known personally. A large scale producer is not concerned at all about the end customer, as his clients are mostly faceless supermarket chains.  Of course, walking to a nearby supermarket is much easier than going to a farm, but in 1000Ecofarms you can agree upon the delivery just by contacting a farmer. 1000Ecofarms is a self-consistent and independent food market.  Cherish your health and watch for the quality of the products you have on your table – it is the best way to a happy, healthy and delicious life!      Attention everyone!!!

Without apparent reasons, the products become more expensive every day, even the most regular and popular ones, no matter of their composition. That is not to say about the products labeled as “eco” or “natural”, which became a synonym of unreasonably expensive rather than natural. Even though, those people who gather and create products with their own hands, earn only 15% of the final cost of the product: the price increases due to delivery, promotion and extra expenses. Isn’t it easier to avoid the stores and to deliver the products from the farms directly to the table? Driven by this idea, we have created 1000Ecofarms platform, which unite the farmers and customers all over the world. It was the first step to fair food market and healthy life. 1000Ecofarms is a self-consistent and independent project, but yet not the only one. Now is the time to make another step.  Frequent interest of our users to implement a tool that would accept bitcoin as a payment on our platform, gave us the first impulse. Having weighed all the pros and cons, in the spring of 2017, together with our partner Coinpayments, we have implemented bitcoin, as well as ether and litecoin, as payment currencies on our site.  This step opened up our eyes to all incredible opportunities that blockchain technologies can help us to embody. Even though they have not reached their culmination yet, we can now contribute the common progress. And now, when the blockchain technologies are tangible and understandable, we can apply them even to the basic human need – the need for food. Because of that, we consider food in many aspects, not just as products themselves, but also as the business, social responsibility and charity related with it.  That is why we have developed the Foodcoin (FdC), blockchain add-ins for the 1000Ecofarms platform. This is a unique project uniting the cutting-edge and reliable technologies at the confluence of foodtech and fintech. But the most essential – it unites people! We already can see how people can use foodcoin to cash in the café and hold charitable activities in support of the farmers and hungry people all over the world.  Our key objective is to create a global, comprehensible and safe ecosystem for agriculture and food businesses that would allow them to reduce significantly the expenses related to the production, sales and logistics of the consumable goods. Now there won’t be any trick in buying and selling the food!  We really appreciate your opinion about our project. Because of you, we become better!",False

The most complicated thing in your life is to get up on Monday morning - but even more difficult is to make clear for yourself what does the blockchain add-in consist of, especially if you are not an expert in this field. But we can help you to figure the last one out and we will gladly explain what FoodCoin Ecosystem is made of (hint: no preserving agents!)  FoodCoin Ecosystem is a blockchain add-in designed to build up a global marketplace of groceries and agricultural products based on the active 1000 Ecofarms platform. 1000Ecofarms exists as a self-consistent and independent project, but yet not the only one. At the technical level, FoodCoin Ecosystem is a peer-to-peer network (i.e. decentralized system based on the equal rights of its members) connected by data processing and storage nodes. Each node stores a full copy of the blockchain in both open and private structures of the network to provide maximum protection against unauthorized data modification.  The blockchain is build up on Ethereum basis which technology enables to create new blockchain-based applications easily enough. It is due to this feature that Ethereum caused a sensation in blockchain technologies sphere thus making the creation of blockchain systems easier in the technical aspect. Today Ethereum platform is the optimal basis to create the complete ecosystem. At the initial stage, FoodCoin (FdC) will be Ethereum token. Later it will become an independent cryptocurrency based on its own blockchain – food blockchain.  So now you know the basic principles. One more important element of FoodCoin Ecosystem is our set of tools, and primarily, the Smaco – easily customizable smart contracts designed for different tasks. But there will be no need to customize it yourself, our users will have access to a library of contracts with intuitive interface and connectivity with additional options. To make deals on the platform, the users will have to pass a remote identification based on DIGID technology. Since you cannot download your ordinary wallets in the blockchain, each member of our platform will have its own Wallok – a smart crypto wallet to interact with other platform members. We do not want transactions both in official and cryptocurrencies to take up to 2-5 days, so our own payment processor DiPay will allow executing payments faster. Due to PRORID – a system of products and goods origin authentication - the users will not have to worry about the quality of the products.",False
