About Agora Agora is a Swiss voting protocol building a decentralized digital voting ecosystem based on blockchain technology. It ensures security, end-to-end verifiability and support for multiple devices. By creating an immutable and publicly viewable digital record of elections, Agora’s technology allows both private and public organizations to eradicate fraud and corruption, reduce cost and engage voters in a modern, convenient and accessible way. Agora is also building an election supply chain tracking app and will provide decentralized application hosting on top of its custom, fair and token-free consensus mechanism.    Agora on ORCA platform Agora’s functionality will be best used in ORCA’s gamified community ecosystem — Quest which is constructed specifically with the intention to involve members of ORCA the platform. Community engagement remains one of the fundamental driving forces behind blockchain and cryptocurrency projects. Therefore, Quest ecosystem is encompassed around giving the incentive for active participators to continue showing initiative and getting immersed in internal group dynamics. In turn, these incentives help to build brand ambassadors who indirectly invite new people to come and try out the platform’s features.

This time we‘re exploring something a bit different. In the name of all the overly-intensive police dramas, we‘ll be lining up all the stakeholders – the banks, the upstarts, the customers – against a cement wall, taking mugshots and questioning their interests in Open Banking.  People say that if you want to see what man is capable of – look at his motives. We‘ll be doing just that. Dress up, cover up your badge and bring some coffee, oh and don‘t forget to put on an empty facial expression – we‘re seriously investigating this.  This article explores the potential of Open Banking. We highly suggest you read up on the general idea of it in part one and then come back for the second piece of the cake that is just below.   Suspect #1 – the FinTechs (Third-parties)  Financial technology upstarts will, no doubt, take full use of the mandated data sharing.  Finding themselves newly acquainted with the treasured customer data, they will now offer every financial service imaginable – from price comparison to instant payments to data brokerage. They will definitely be staking it all on Open Banking system to hold.   Suspect #2 – the Customers (Yourself included)  Open Banking framework will ensure that, the aforementioned products are designed to satisfy all your needs and urges. More competition meanwhile, will make them affordable and provide a more customer-centered services.  Financial applications, which display all of your bank accounts in one screen, will help you budget, and view a more accurate picture of your finances. Other apps might look at your transaction logs and combine information from multiple providers to identify the best financial products and services for you, such as a new savings account that would deliver the highest returns.  Unspent income could even be designed to be transferred into a pension account with a press of a button – helping you grow to be more responsible with personal finance. Some providers might even offer you crypto-related projects if you swing that way.  Even the most entrenched financial institutions will benefit from Open Banking, if they’re imaginative enough.  If you’re under financed or running around with a “thin” credit file, FinTechs could review your loan requests with the help of more accurate AI-powered (Artificial Intelligence) client screening technologies. Because they harness the power of AI, they just might say “Yes” to that motorcycle on credit you’ve been dreaming of.  More options can’t be a bad thing for customers. Surely, the paradox of choice is strong with this one, considering the overabundance of the new financial service providers.  But looking at the long-term, more choice, in economic terms, has always been beneficial for customers as they can slam the door to the faces of providers that treat them with high prices, neglect or indignity. Also, more choices over time reveal user preferences and allow for service offering evolution.   Suspect #3 – the Banks (The providers)  Surely, this can’t be a good thing for banks. They must anticipate new digital competitors showing up on their turf, legally using their collected data and then offering their customers FinTech services. This seems like a daylight robbery – or, at the very least, a game of Texas hold’em where one side is forced to openly display the hand.  Fearing a loss of business, they’re thus going all-in, shouting “Massive data security risk”.   Uncovered Suspect #4 – Data security  Some concerns about security and privacy are legitimate as sharing data across multiple institutions opens up vulnerabilities. Banks claim that with requests for data access and payments originating from a wide range of third parties, there will be even more targets for cybercriminals to attack.  While true, that is a misconstrued description of how things will work under Open Banking system.  In fact, with the possibility of data leaks, FinTechs will need to do some serious convincing of national regulators that their security regimes are solid and trustworthy. All will submit to annual inspections and the newcomers will also take out fraud insurance, which will be denied if their protections are not cutting-edge.  Furthermore, contrary to the chaos and anarchy predicted by some banks in the payment industry, payments will enjoy even better security, because the EU directive also demands robust authentication processes, involving a two-step verification.  So, the security is not a problem. Bank, in fact, might even learn a thing or two from the newcomers. The problem is, once again, their reluctance to innovate, which is shameful, considering the potential.   Uncovered Suspect #5 – the Potential  Even the most entrenched financial institutions will benefit from Open Banking, if they’re imaginative enough.  Lower marginal costs when delivering financial services through digital channels is an obvious revenue-adder. Banks will also rejoice audit trails that are inherent to the system of APIs (Application programming interfaces) – this new way institutions will share data is a far better option, if the alternative is information getting scrapped off the providers’ screens (see part one).  Regulated FinTechs will submit to annual inspections and the newcomers will also take out fraud insurance  It is also not hard to imagine banks making a nice profit by partnering up with these FinTech providers. Banks could employ them to screen potential applicants for loans and thus expand this market in a controlled manner. PwC, a professional services network, envisions a 186% jump in loan approvals by 2022 due to use of external data, which could be a boom for both banks and unbanked individuals.  Economies of scale would also be easier to achieve as even a small- or a medium-sized bank could aim to mimic the coverage of a national bank by assembling a portfolio of various digital products that are not offered solely by it.  Banks could also leverage partnerships to maximize consumer engagement. With the average user spending only 0.9 minutes daily on their online/mobile bank, it’s clear that banks could add a bit more spice to the mundane tasks of banking. Tips on personal finance management could be offered to the clients with low-balances; digital assistance could be provided to the well-off individuals looking to invest or save.    Criminal record #OB2368  Surely, things won’t be entirely smooth – there will be bumps and road ahead as with all good things. But if we look purely from the view of a clear motive, all of our stakeholders fit the description of a beneficiary: everyone will be better off under the system of Open Banking.  From providing capital to the unbanked to making personal finance more adoptable for regular Joes and Janes, the potential hidden inside Open Banking is a thought experiment not fully explored. Open Banking is going to reshape the financial landscape, that's unquestionable. The things that we are yet to find out are how and when.",False

We are trying to solve a few issues that are there:  Our platform will enable multiple bank account connection, displaying it on one customisable dashboard and providing access to perform various operations like money transfer, balance checking, exchange and so on.  Furthermore, we will incorporate cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets into this dashboard, expanding the range of functions accessible through our platform. Users will be able to perform operations between banks and cryptocurrency services using one convenient and easy to use tool - ORCA Platform.  What is more, ORCA will have an integrated App Center that will offer all of the most used and needed crypto services.  We are integrating ORCA AI that will autonomously help user to manage his/her assets, ORCA tokens will grant access to various crypto-trading bots and other useful features.  And the platform will incorporate a Quest, which is a feature that will let users earn ORCA tokens for being active on the platform, making it somewhat self-sustaining.

The amount of Tokens to be issued is limited, also, we will lock the Tokens as they are used in community activities, lowering the supply and increasing the value.  ORCA Tokens can be shared, so you can just send one to your friend, making him a proud member of ORCA Community as well!  We need ORCA Token to consolidate community involvement and to ensure the benefits for its' members.   Feel free to join our Telegram group - we will answer all of your questions immediately. https://t.me/ORCAalliance  Please take your time reading our White Paper to get all the insights on our project: https://orcaalliance.eu/ORCA_WhitePaper.pdf  For a short overview, take a look at our One Pager: https://orcaalliance.eu/ORCA_OnePager.pdf",False

I highly recommend reading our White Paper. It takes a while, but our project is of very broad scope and it's hard to explain it in tiny parts. Everything is explained in detail there.

The discussion is initiated by ORCA Alliance - a project aiming for rational and sustainable cryptocurrency regulations in the European Union.  THEME  How Europe should act on cryptocurrency boom?  INTENTION  Evidently, cryptocurrencies are the most revolutionary financial and technological innovations of the last decade. Legal ambiguity and lack of clear regulations remain as the biggest issues to ensure widescale adoption of cryptocurrencies and greatly support industry growth. Legal and regulatory systems are struggling to catch-up in the European Union. How can cryptocurrencies reinforce EU financial ecosystem? Should Europe bring this 250 billion Euro market out of the grey area?  The aim of the event is to present and discuss the cryptocurrency development, use cases and future adoption in European Union. During the panel discussion we will cover cryptocurrency regulation, user protection, legal and security challenges; define the regulatory system demand and recommended governance model that would be particularly adapted to the implementation of safe and sustainable conditions for the wider public adoption of cryptocurrencies in the EU.  ORCA Alliance is gathering together blockchain developers, cryptocurrency enthusiasts, professional investors, finance analytics, parliamentarians and all like-minded supporters. Assuring that crypto activists need to take an active role in shaping the future of European financial and regulatory landscape.  Taking your experience and present actions into account, we would like to invite you to join us on our mission and take part in the discussion.  _______________________________________________  Official attendees:  Peteris Zilgalvis (COM) ●    Wiebe Ruttenberg (ECB) ●    Sorin Moisa (EPP)   ●    Eva Kaili (S&D) ●    Craig Sellars ●    Debitum.network  _______________________________________________  07-12-2017 10:00 Room ASP 5G305  https://orcaalliance.eu ____ hello@orcaalliance.eu ____",False
