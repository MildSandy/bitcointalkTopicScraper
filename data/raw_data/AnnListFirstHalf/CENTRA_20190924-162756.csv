Great work managing the small issues during the ICO. I am quite new to ICOs. This looks like a great product and company and hence got some tokens. I see that the address to which we deposited ETH to receive CTR has around 8k ETH. That is the ICO sale that has happened since it started I assume. Can the experienced folk tell how good of a start that is?  I see on the whitepaper that first target is 10k for app creation and goes up till 50k being the last target. Do you guys think this target will be met?  I ask this because many on this forum were saying ICO might last only few minutes but that hasn't been the case right? Let me know if I got this wrong.
