As we wrote earlier, failure to achieve hardcap will only slightly postpone our plans to implement some points of our roadmap, and only.  Saifu is always working to encourage mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. We're making constant progress on our technology, regulatory compliance, and marketing - adhering to our roadmap and building our brand in the crypto community. Here's a brief summary of some of our recent developments: The Saifu mobile app for iOS is ready, and has been submitted for review. The Saifu mobile app for iOS will be publicly available very soon. The Android version will follow shortly, making Saifu accessible to anyone from anywhere with a phone signal or wifi.   We're excited to share two previews of the Saifu mobile app for iOS. In the videos you can see how to  exchange your crypto to fiat and send funds. The app should be out soon, and we're also working on an Android version.   We released the Saifu web app with the full functionality outlined in our roadmap. The release of the app marks a key milestone in our development, and brings a sleek redesign and improved functionality. We designed the app from scratch with end users in mind, as you’ll see from the seamless combination of form and function.   Saifu has started to integrate the cryptocurrency Dash into our platform. Previously, Saifu started work with Dash through DashPeople. The partnership helps to increase mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, giving Saifu a larger presence in our home market, and bringing awareness of Saifu’s business services.

And did not forge these transactions?  your smart contract and related addresses look very strange and confusing, where can I see the proceeds of the crypto currency and their further movement?   Greetings!    We value our reputation and are not going to deceive anyone. In addition, we are a licensed European company, and fall under all laws on AML, KYC and CTF, therefore, we conduct all our operations legally and honestly.    You can see the number of tokens after the burning at our contract address , this is 82,382,072 SFU, currently 12,469,772 SFU in turnover, the rest, 69,912,300 SFU was withdrawn from turnover for a period of 3 months to 3 years.   All operations in tokens you can see in the blockchain, the system is open to everyone.   Further, we conducted the ICO through the bookbuilding platform with the use of KYC and the restrict on the participation of residents of some countries, in order to comply with European regulation. Therefore, we accepted payments in fiat, as well as in LTC, BTC and ETH, so we can not show all the transactions, as when carrying out traditional ICO with financing only in ETH.   We believe that the legal status of our company is a sufficient basis for the confidence of the ICO participants. This also confirms that we are fulfilling our promises, which were stated in the roadmap (see our answer for asdlolciterquit).  Best regards, Saifu team  ",False

However, using their own tokens gives customers benefits in the loyalty scheme, which is the main function of the Saifu Token. Because all fees are paid in SFU, as demand for services increases, demand for the token should grow.  Saifu customers benefit from both holding and using Saifu tokens through discounts on ser- vices and/or receiving tokens back when they make purchases.

Saifu stores customer’s fiat currencies in its bank in safeguarding accounts, and can’t do anything with customers’ money without a customer order. Using established technologies from Thales – a world leader in banking security technologies – we do more to protect access to each customer’s Saifu account. Each account has an access key that is created in the Thales Hardware Security Module – and spends its entire life in the module. Because none of the keys can leave the Security Module, hackers can’t steal them. Even in the unlikely event of our systems being hacked, customer keys can’t be stolen.  Our system also uses a series of ‘Treasury vaults’ and ‘Operation vaults’ to help protect each customer’s money. Transactions can only proceed – and account keys can only be accessed – when two trusted members of the Saifu team simultaneously insert smartcards into the Security Module. For day-to-day operations, this process is transparent for our customers – even though they’re benefitting from an extra level of security behind the scenes.  Our multi-layered security measures include:  Multi-Factor Authentication – to help block unauthorized access to an account Data Encryption – to help protect sensitive information Web Application Firewall Hypervisor and Internal Firewalls Anti-Malware Software Unified Security Management – using an advanced Security Information & Event Management (SIEM) system Anti-DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Protection Intrusion Detection & Prevention System Security Patch Management Operating System File Integrity Monitoring Training Programs – for Saifu employees Source Code Audits Penetration Tests Access Rights Management Incident Response Plan",False

Quote from: darth_darth on February 27, 2018, 01:09:24 PM   The problem of this project isn't only errors and inaccuracies, but a favorite phrase 'soon'  When a project works in the legal field, there are a lot of partners, compliences and regulators from the real world that aren't as fast as in the world of crypto. As we have numerous processess that depend on them, we can't possibly provide you with a precise date or give you a promise that we might not deliver on time. So 'soon' is the only possible option in this scenario. Thank you for understanding.",False

Regarding protection and safety: first of all, Saifu IS the first financial service that brings world-class security to the cryptocurrency world. We use not just a HSM module, but a combination of hardware and software technologies to deliver multi-layered security that does more to protect your Saifu account. Our multi-layered security measures include: - Data Encryption – to help protect sensitive information - Web Application Firewall - Hypervisor and Internal Firewalls - Anti-Malware - Anti-DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) - Intrusion Detection & Prevention Syst - Security Patch Management - Operating System File Integrity Monitoring - OS Hardening - Secure Awareness Training Programs – for Saifu employees - Unified Security Management – using an advanced Security Information & Event Management (SIEM) system - Secure Architecture, including Source Code Audits and Penetration Tests - Access Rights Management - Incident Response Plan  To store private keys we use a hardware device from Thales security, a similar solution is used in many banks. The keys are created inside the device, but they can not be architecturally copied. There is access to the key, access through several levels of smart card. Even with their use, you can not extract the key. In the application, authorization via fingerprint/selfie, protection by behavioral pattern. Authorization via the web: on the phone/mail displays a message - is it you are sending a payment? Special multi-colored qr-code. The transaction is signed with a digital signature of the person. Safety from WASCO.  As for trust: at the moment we have a Small Payment Institution (SPI) license, and we can carry out activities under this license. This license already implies a trusting attitude to both the bank. In the future, as the project develops, we will receive an Authorized Payment Institution / Electronic Money Institution license and a Commercial Bank license. It will be, respectively, Saifu for business and Saifu for bank",False
