To answer your question, others in this community have weighed in avoiding some of the above.  What's strange is that TokenHub deleted the pages of the bottom five listed immediately after BCAP's ICO. Then Tean Argon has had mega posts of mine deleted from this thread by mods since this thread is not self-moderated.  https://www.wired.com/2017/03/initial-coin-offering-stock-thats-not-stock/  Quote This method is new to the ICO world, but probably warranted. The structures to help ICOs succeed and thrive in the mainstream are still evolving—like the Argon Group, which longtime Wall Streeter Stan Miroshnik founded to help oversee ICOs. Argon will bookrun the token offering on behalf of Blockchain Capital, meaning, in this case, that it will actually issue the token. “Our mission is to help this new capital market evolve,” Miroshnik says.  Firstly, exactly how does a long-time resident of Russia up to only a couple years ago be dubbed ""longtime Wall Streeter""?  Secondly, note that Stan Miroshnik is the founder of Argon Group to help oversees ICOs.  Thirdly, referring to the list above, other ICOs were presented to Investards as also entities seeking funding alongside BCAP, again, later deleted from the platform, leaving ONLY BCAP, of which I contend was the sole purpose of this piece of shit Argon Group headed by biker Marina Khaustova (or Khaoustovar), co-founder of Argon Group.  https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/04/18/this-vc-is-sure-venture-capital-is-about-to-be-disrupted/#7c9679f6324e   https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1703926/000095017217000040/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml   Note the phone number: 800-852-3030  Connected to http://maxpresence.com.ourssite.com/  https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/solutionists#/entity   Note the list of speakers here: https://www.crunchbase.com/event/seamless-2017-2017419/speakers",False

Quote The Group develops technical placement solutions including digital tokens powered by advanced smart contracts, which we operate through a digital asset placement and brokerage platform called TokenHub. We are developing NYCEX, a digital asset and crypto-currency exchange, which will be on the cutting edge of technology and compliance.  Leading up to BCAP's ICO there were 6 entities embracing their program so later to be trading on their exchange, NYCEX, owned by Stan or Nick depending on which TLD you visit.  After BCAP's ICO, all but BCAP remained attached to TokenHub, the other 5 expunged.  WHY! Is it because the TokenHub only had one purpose, namely for BCAP's ICO? That's my guess. What's yours?",False

Quote from: ICOcountdown.com on April 11, 2017, 11:24:35 PM https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/64ufyp/emission_due_diligence_for_humaniq/  Quote Everyone needs to read this about emission schedule and otherwise.  https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/64ufyp/emission_due_diligence_for_humaniq/  Reference: (Page 10) https://humaniq.co/assets/downloads/humaniq_wp_english.pdf  Final Amount determination is excercised here.  http://imgur.com/a/vMSRt  However smart contract says otherwise:  http://imgur.com/a/fFUMZ  Reference: https://github.com/humaniq/ico-contract/blob/master/contracts/HumaniqToken.sol  Token Locking is also excercised and I'm not sure for what reason:  http://imgur.com/a/WVacu  Reference: https://github.com/humaniq/ico-contract/blob/master/contracts/HumaniqToken.sol  This has been delisted from ICOcountdown.com until further notice.  Extra due diligence done by Jack from ICOcountdown Telegram:  Okay, where do I start? As first - there are no critical vulnurabilites, like 0-day or something like that, so nobody in perspective could hack the contract and get out whole funds or something, but it is still have some malicious functions, which I will describe.  https://github.com/humaniq/ico-contract/blob/master/contracts/HumaniqToken.sol      As first - look at line 88 /// @dev Function to change address that is allowed to do emission. /// @param newAddress Address of new emission contract. function changeEmissionContractAddress(address newAddress) external onlyFounder returns (bool) { emissionContractAddress = newAddress; }     it is mean that they can set any new contract in here in any time and get infinite emitient at they will. Plus, as we see, it can be not just another crowdsale contract, it could be literally any address, which means that they can set me as emissionContract and I can mint myself as many tokens as I want. And in fact it is malicious.  This problem could be solved by different ways, for example you can set iterator of changing emissionContract and set the final number of all future ways of crowdfunding rounds - in this case you can do, for example, 3 rounds of crowdfunding and emission waves but no more.  Other simple proposal to solve this problem - is specifiy type of emissionContract, therefore people can see that only real crowdfunding contract could emit new tokens and no one else could.      Locker problem. In fact, when you proceed your ICO you should forbid your buyers to transfer tokens before ICO ends - it is okay. In this case you can firstly set a phase modifiers in enum format like enum ICOPhase { Created, Running, Paused, End } and change state of the contract when it handle some events, or it can be just simple boolean modifier like lock = true In conract of Humaniq it can be found on 42 line (modifier), and this modifier lock ALL transfers of token (line 73,80).  You could say - okay, so what is problem? The problem in that their token contract have function on line 98 function lock(bool value) external onlyFounder { locked = value; } Which allow developers to lock all transactions manually in any time.  I repeat - it is not holding the ico contract, which could be useful in some kind of situation, it is lock all tokens transfer and could be used in any times even when ico is done.  When I've asked developers - why do they need this functions and why they need to use it exactly this way - in any time and not only an ICO - they have answered to me, that ""it is need to migrate. when we will create new tokens contract - we will block old one"".  Yes, that is exactly they have said, that they will just block old contracts with all balances when they developed new contract of token's. And that how we finde another problem.      Migrate function is actually doesn't exist. As you know - all balances in token contract is stored in mapping structure and you cannot just pull it out from contract - you need to use getter to get value of balance of specific address.  So, as I supposed, they must have some migrate function (or at least prototype of it) which allow them to secure transfer balances from one contract to another. It is a pretty difficult mechanism of two-sides function which must be work on both contracts - ask old one of balance of msg.sender, add this value to balance of new contract and delete same number from old balance - in this case user could choose themself migrate to new contract or not, plus, such desicion allow continue normally work of each contract without blackmailing.  What I have heard from developers - they said that ""we will not transfer balances in smart-contract logic at all, we will have non such migrate function"" - but wait, it is not even possible to do offchain cause of balances data structure - I mean really - I think many developers tryed to pull out mappings, and we are all know, that there is impossible without using of getter, and moreover - you can't do it without knowing of each key of user... so how they actually want to do this?  And all of it just for humaniq token itself and not for ICO contract.  ICO contract - https://github.com/humaniq/ico-contract/blob/master/contracts/HumaniqICO.sol  have also such function as function changeTokenAddress(address token_address) at 201 line - which is really strange thing. I don't even know how to comment it. It's like they can change token contract address in the middle of ICO and so will crowdfund two token contracts? Totally mess, I'm really don't know for what this need and how it could be exploited, it could be a real chaos with such things.      Founder's address Common problem - ico is managed by single account but not of DAO or multisig - have a possability that if key from single account will be stolen - all funds will be stolen as well.

But I couldnt get the answers to these questions after reading OM and they didnt respond my email.  I found out that Blockchain Capital’s pervious two funds’ average gross return is so low, at around %14 annually. When adjusting for %2,5 management fee and %25 carried interest, net return is hardly %10! Traditional venture capital, as far as I know, should offer around %500 total return in a 5-year-period, given the risk that the investor bears.  How can you use %50 of realized gains to make further investments and the rest for token repurchase while the BC manager is entitled to %25 of realized capital gains? (the total is above %100) If VC is under no obligation to make realization buy backs, then how can I as an investor realize capital gains in the value of the token? How can investors force the VC to make realization buy backs so that they can earn on their investments?  Another issue that bothers me is that both the VC and the manager of the VC as separate entities, are operating in Cayman Islands and in this way these companies are independent from parent companies, Blockchain Capital LLC and Argon Group. Altough people behind Blockchain Capital LLC have good reputations, there is no certainity that these people will support the VC for as long as the VC operates. In addition, there is no distribution and liquidation rights of investors. I understand that these type of token offerings are not regulated, so they are not under control of SEC or any other legal entity in another country. But doesn’t it mean that there is an unconditional trust to VC founders, because there is nothing prevent them from going away with what they raised with the ICO offering (may be except from their reputation). Even I remember reading that VC does not have to invest in blockchain related start-ups under certain circumstances. So as an investor how can I make sure that VC will be constantly investing in Blockchain start ups under scrunity and at best effort of the Blockchain Capital’s original team?   Additionaly, why do investors have to invest in tokens that BCTH issues and then why does BCTH become the single partner of BC III DLVF? Instead why don’t we invest directly in the tokens that BC III DLVF issues?  What will happen if some day US or Cayman Islands authorities or any other jurisdiriction in which Argon group operates, regulates token offerings as publicly registered offerings and hence force international investors out of the VC?     What do you include in contingent liabilities when calculating NAV? Who will audit the expense reimbursements and NAV calculations? I understand that VC didn’t plan any independent authority in such roles. But Isnt it a fundamental issue to build continious trust?",False

I did show that the dude behind Argon Group is directly connected to Carlson and even provided proof of such via a municipal meeting minutes in a county in Washington state after Marina denied that there was no connection, but kindly thanked me for my contribution to this thread.",False

I absolutely believe that can be the future, but…  The Groucho Marx problem  “I don’t want to belong to any club that will accept me as a member.” - Groucho Marx  I don’t want to put money into any private equity fund that will take my money.    Much of the excess returns that accrue to private equity come from the top funds.  Those top funds don’t need to raise money from little guys.  Why bother with a token sale when you can go get $100 million from CalPERS and TRS?  There’s absolutely a chicken and egg problem here.  It’s likely that securities become tokens, but for now it’s unlikely that the funds likely to produce excess returns want to do a token sale.  [Financegeek note: part of the excess return in private equity is due to the lack of liquidity.  If tokens improve liquidity, then we should expect the liquidity premium to go away and thus expected PE returns should be lower than historical averages.  This depends on how much of the liquidity premium accrues from the illiquidity of the underlying assets vs the illiquidity of the VC fund.]  With that in mind, I had a chance to read the Blockchain Capital document today and wanted to offer some thoughts.     Bear case:  1.  Didn’t crush it in the first two funds.  This is especially true when you realize that in this space they would have had magnitudes higher return from just buying Ether or Bitcoin.   Even a relatively naive spray and pray in crypto – buy a fixed amount of every project that passes basic due diligence – would’ve produced better results.  In general, I would not invest in a VC fund with such low visibility into their previous funds.  I was very disappointed in the lack of transparency about performance.  You have to trust their NAV.  They don’t even break out the difference between realized gains and unrealized gains.  For example, I’d like to know how much of their return is due to Coinbase’s valuation.  Also, they don’t mention the size of the previous funds, nor the fee structure for those funds.  Those are relevant when comparing their returns to funds from the same year.  [UPDATE: A Blockchain representative says that they have said that the fee structure is the same as the first two funds, and also that AuM was disclosed in the doc.  That’s true ($30m under management) - but I’d like to know the size of each fund, as well as whether all investors paid 2.5% management fee plus 25% of the gains.  I will update this post accordingly when I hear.]  Furthermore, the rates of return indicated are gross, not net.  So investors in the previous funds actually receive a significantly smaller return than what is indicated, once Blockchain’s fees are deducted. It’s disappointing to me that they only listed the gross returns, because the only thing that matters is the net returns.    2.  They aren’t believers in tokens.  I’m not excited about their thesis - they wrote their terms to allow token sales but the document makes clear that it is not a focus.   Part of the reason for their relatively low returns is that they didn’t invest in tokens or crypto.  I get it - it’s very hard to raise money to do that.  But at the same time, it didn’t happen, so it’s hard for me to give them credit for seeing just how much they should’ve pushed to get into tokens.  If they didn’t see the last big trend in this space, how can I feel confident they’ll see the next one?    3.  High fees.  The trend on fees has probably been downward, except for the top tier.  These are relatively high fees for (so far) non-top tier returns.  In general, my take on the terms was that it seemed like terms that a fund would start LP negotiations, but eventually the terms would become more investor friendly.  Perhaps Blockchain will prove me wrong by raising the rest of the fund with exactly these terms.  I’m skeptical, however.  Plus, at the risk of being repetitive, they gave gross returns for previous returns, but still haven’t told us what the actual returns for investors have been.    Bull case:  1.  Followon rights in Coinbase, String, and Parity/Ethcore, as well as a few others.  VC is a hits business.  It’s the seed rounds that produce the absurd IRR, but since you get to put more money in later rounds, so the dollar-weighted rate of return can actually be bigger.  If you think that Brian Armstrong is a great recruiter of talent and is well positioned to make Coinbase magnitudes bigger (I think he might!), then you might buy just to get some exposure to Coinbase.  Likewise for String/Parity – though presumably much of those returns will come from tokens, and you could just buy those tokens yourself in the next few months.  It’s worth noting that follow on rights are only useful if Coinbase, String, Parity, etc actually raise more rounds.  You don’t get a piece of Blockchain’s existing investments by investing in this fund.   2.  SEC regulation/lawsuits eliminate token sales for US, thus more US based companies use VC  You can imagine a future where the SEC cracks down on token sales at the behest of the rich and politically connected.  Thus, some US projects might choose VC rounds over token sales.  In practice, SEC action would probably lead to even more companies fleeing the US and would just serve to further disadvantage Americans.  Even so, if this happens, this would likely boost the returns to this fund.    3.  Token market never takes off.  I put this one last, because in my view it is already taking off, though that momentum could end and the future is hard to predict.  Blockchain Capital is one of the preeminent VC firms in the space.  Therefore if blockchains takes off but token sales don’t, then this token should do well.  In general, I tend to believe that if blockchains take off then token sales will also take off, particularly because token sales are taking off already before blockchain apps.  However, you could also imagine scenarios (such as SEC action) where token sales fizzle out, but blockchains remain strong.    Concluding thought  This is only a token sale for non-US markets.  As the sale is limited to under 100 US accredited investors, I don’t think I’d have any chance to buy their tokens even if I wanted to.  So I have no skin in the game here.  As always, caveat emptor.    Disclaimer: None of this is financial advice, I’m not recommending that you do anything. If you want investment advice you should do more than just read a blog. I know nothing of your portfolio needs, etc.    Thanks to Alex Felix from Coinfund for some critical comments on a draft on this post.",False

One more thing - you're still failing in the SEO department, SEO being Argon's exec's former fortë where they garnered over U$15M in funding themselves.  https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/argon-group#/entity   Seriously, only two links to news articles, one a paid press release? I linked to more articles espousing Argon in this post alone. Hey, maybe I can get U$100M in VC funding so I could teach folks how to do it sans ever paying a single satoshi. I'll be known as the SEO Guru-Guru.  And why did Stan remove the following off his LinkedIn page after I quoted it (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1829499.msg18485237#msg18485237)?  The Group currently employs over 100 technology professionals around the world. With its global headquarters in Los Angeles, California, the Company has offices and presence in the US (San Francisco, New York, Seattle) and globally in the UK, China, Russian Federation, and Thailand.   Could it be because Stan laid off between 50 and 90 employees during the past two days? https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/10700788/   Can folks come by and trade gold for BCAP tokens at your office located where the following is located? http://www.gold2cashexchange.com/    Quote from: Gleb Gamow on April 09, 2017, 10:28:56 PM  Marina, tackle this post -> https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1829499.msg18521886#msg18521886   Quote from: Marina_T on April 09, 2017, 11:28:03 PM Gleb (or your real name) I have no intention to. My colleagues and I have provided enough information for people to make informed decisions. All the best.  Ahhhhh, I see how the game is played now. Address all the softball questions during the ICO announcement, but when tougher concerns are presented just prior to, or at the start of the ICO, don't address a damn thing.  Fine! I'll just keep asking tough questions for you to ignore because that's what my fan base demands.  Marina, in your California charter you have the address for Argon Investment Management LLC located at 140 S Beverly Dr, ste 200 in Beverly Hills, California (rel. http://datagovus.com/colorado-business.php?id=20161610669). Who lives there?  TBC, I've been playin softball with Argon, but by Marina's latest stance I see that it's time to play hardball - AND I'M AT BAT!  http://www.bitcoinisle.com/2017/03/16/want-vc-returns-this-firm-makes-it-possible-for-everyday-people/  Quote A venture fund digital token could solve a problem in venture capital. ""My phone is blowing up with other VCs saying I want to do this — not blockchain and bitcoin VCs — because the biggest problem with venture, the thing everyone hates about venture capital, is that it’s delivered fantastic returns but no one wants to invest in an asset that’s locked up for 5-10 years. The idea you can invest in a venture fund and have liquidity is probably the most innovative thing that has ever happened in venture capital.""  That's odd! The biggest presence that BCAP has on the entire Internet is this thread. They can't even muster up a conversation on Reddit, with virtually everyone of their submissions a ghost town. And that's from folks who supposedly garnered U$15M in VC for two SEO ventures. That's not sayin' much about their SEO prowess now, eh?",False

Why doesn't Richard Branson buy all the shares, locking out all the Daddy Warbucks? Why is this thread even created? Why do we need The Argon Group made up of mostly Russians acting as a third-party thingy, especially with their bad track record? Make that a forth-party thingy cuz it's their subsidiary that's not in good standing that's overseeing the ICO.

Argon Group is an advisor and bookrunner of this offering and our website is argongroup.com  All the best  http://www.newsbtc.com/2017/04/04/blockchain-capital-releases-offering-memorandum-10-million-digital-token-offering/  Quote The BCAP Tokens are expected to be issued by Blockchain Capital TokenHub Pte.

One more thing - you're still failing in the SEO department, SEO being Argon's exec's former fortÃ« where they garnered over U$15M in funding themselves.  https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/argon-group#/entity   Seriously, only two links to news articles, one a paid press release? I linked to more articles espousing Argon in this post alone. Hey, maybe I can get U$100M in VC funding so I could teach folks how to do it sans ever paying a single satoshi.

The Group currently employs over 100 technology professionals around the world. With its global headquarters in Los Angeles, California, the Company has offices and presence in the US (San Francisco, New York, Seattle) and globally in the UK, China, Russian Federation, and Thailand.   Could it be because Stan laid off between 50 and 90 employees during the past two days? https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/10700788/   Can folks come by and trade gold for BCAP tokens at your office located where the following is located? http://www.gold2cashexchange.com/    Quote from: Gleb Gamow on April 09, 2017, 10:28:56 PM  Marina, tackle this post -&gt; https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1829499.msg18521886#msg18521886   Quote from: Marina_T on April 09, 2017, 11:28:03 PM Gleb (or your real name) I have no intention to.

The idea you can invest in a venture fund and have liquidity is probably the most innovative thing that has ever happened in venture capital.&quot;  That's odd! The biggest presence that BCAP has on the entire Internet is this thread. They can't even muster up a conversation on Reddit, with virtually everyone of their submissions a ghost town.

Of course Argon Group is on bitcointalk forum, many of our ICO investors are here and we need to provide them with the correct information on the ICO, otherwise unfortunately lots of irrelevant but most importantly untruthful information tends to appear.  Also, if you saw the original press release you could find out from there that BC's third fund is raised via a combination of traditional LP route and token offering. Token offering is only up to $10m and the whole fund is $50m.

As always thanks for all the correspondence thus far. I did have another question after discussing some risk elements  with a few of my friends/colleagues. Hate to skeptically poke and prod once again, but really need  to be clear on this: We saw the minimum lock-in time before liquidation for world  investors is 40 days while US investors have a minimum lock-in period of 1 year. So if the fund for any reason started tanking, or alternatively if it took off to a point where  we'd feel motivated to trim off some profit and trade the token, we from US soil would be asymmetrically disadvantaged by remaining locked-in while offshore investors can do what they please or could  totally bottom the fund out if decided upon exiting en masse? I understand that one upside to minimum lock-in periods is fostering long term oriented investments based on faith in the quality of assets, and avoiding pure profiteering, but need to understand why there is such a skewed difference between US and non-US investors, as well as what your motivations are behind that. Additionally understand that the crowdfunding only consists of $10 million USD while there is another larger $40 million USD accounted for by traditional investors - who are these traditional investors and do they have a lock-in time similar or longer than a year which would tremendously mitigate this risk? That would make a difference. If you can give me a reasonable justification for why this exists I will rest easier with deciding on my prospective investment.  KB",False

The need for the 1 year lock-up for US investors is to do with US securities laws. There is not much we can do around that unfortunately.  The investors in the traditional LP fund are locked in for the whole period of the fund, which is not confirmed yet, but could be around 7-10 years in line with other venture capital funds.

I have two (rather basic) questions however:  The plan is to reinvest 75% of the profits back into the fund. Obviously this should give the fund a great source for future investments, but what incentive does that bring to the token holder? If there is no plan to ever pay dividends (or some kind of bonus) to token holders, why should someone invest in the token in the first place or even be willing to pay more than the ICO price for the token when traded?  Even if the fund does exceptionally well, none of the token holders will ever see any of the profits, right?  Also, I understand that most regular people form the US won't be able to participate. Will they still be able to buy the tokens from an exchange, once the non US token holders are allowed to trade it?  Looking forward to hearing your thoughts regarding this.  Cheers, Tony",False

Thank you for the service! Will read.   Thank you for all the correspondence thus far Marina. Let me ask you a reiteration of what I and another user had asked you guys in regard to performance fees specifically:   For comparative purposes, TaaS project claims they will return 50% of fund profits to equity holders quarterly, with a remaining 25% being reinvested into the fund again. Short of stating it directly, they seem to omit what happens to the remaining 25% of fund profits which I could only assume would go to the fund managers. Essentially equivalent to a performance fee unless I am told otherwise.  The rough conclusion I reach from that offering is that you can expect to take away 50% of quarterly gains on your initial investment. Hopefully boosted by whatever accretive gains come from a 25% fund reinvestment. Fine.    Based on your team's offering description, it would sound like you are only exacting the 25% performance fee on profits gained, with the remaining 75% going back to equity holders. Aside from  the 2.5% fee on initial equity purchase of course. Would this be correct or am I missing something?   In all, somewhat more appreciative of the fact that your team is at least disclosing performance fees in an up front fashion, instead of users having to request that a missing 25% be spelled out (TaaS).

It is 25% that will be charged on profits.  2) Exactly, the remaining 75% would be reinvested into the fund, so effectively it will be token holders getting the full benefit of it.  3) Total third fund of Blockchain Capital is expected to be $50m, so it is approx. $40m in the traditional fund and $10m in the ICO fund. The investors in the traditional fund will have a very similar exposure to the ICO investors, they will be limited partners in the fund. Their fund is separated from the ICO fund even though it is meant to be investing pari passu, so they pay their own fees and do not take anything from the ICO fund.  Let me know if you have any other questions. I would recommend you to register at tokenhub.com on April 3, there you will be able to view the offering memorandum which will cover fees, fund structure and many other information in a lot more detail.

We are not doing translations at the moment but will keep you in mind for the future.  BCAP is quite different from TaaS: Blockchain Capital as a General Partner will be investing into blockchain companies directly. E.g. in the existing funds Blockchain Capital has investments into such companies as BitFury, BitGo, BitPesa, BlockCypher, Blockstream, Chain, Coinbase, Gem, GoCoin, ItBit, PeerNova, Ripple, Wave, and Xapo, among others. For an ordinary investor it is very difficult to get exposure to those. In addition to that type of investments the fund will also be investing into ICOs and this is the similarity with TaaS which will be investing into BTC and altcoins only.   Quote from: xtyling on March 25, 2017, 08:49:54 PM How to invest ? What are the options available ?  It will be possible to invest in BTC, ETH and USD wires. The sale will be held via Argon Group's issuance platform TokenHub, registration at tokenhub.com will open soon.

The fund will not be paying dividends. Rather, any profits that the fund makes will be reinvested into the fund, which would then increase its net asset value (NAV). NAV would be regularly reported and hopefully serve as a benchmark for token price. So in that case while the profits are not returned to you directly in cash, they are likely to be reflected in the token price in the aftermarket.

Crypto ICOs offer lowest liability possible, as the legal requirements to &quot;fulfill your obligations&quot; to investors are nearly ZERO :/    Geez you almost made me change my mind mate, need to think more about this   Thank you, you are raising some very valid points.  1. This ICO will be one the first ICOs to be compliant with US securities laws, so actually Blockchain Capital makes a very significant step to be compliant and regulated. Fundâ€™s net asset value (NAV) will also be regularly reported. The offering memorandum in compliance with Regulation D and Regulation S of US Securities laws is expected to be published on April 3rd.  2. Only a relatively small portion of Blockchain Capitalâ€™s third fund is raised via an ICO. If you read the some of the news articles below the target for the fund overall is $50m, with only $10m coming from the ICO. So the bigger portion of funds is targeted to come from traditional limited partner route. ICO is the way for Blockchain Capital to practice what they preach and disrupt their own industry. http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-blockchain-funding-idUKKBN16N1Z8 https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/03/16/want-to-be-a-vc-this-firm-is-making-it-possible-for-everyday-people/#64f598397b70  3. The fees are in line with industry standards for VC funds. 2.5% management fee will be charged regardless of profits. 25% performance fee will be charged on profits, and thatâ€™s the fund managerâ€™s compensation for providing a unique access to opportunities in the blockchain space that are otherwise not available to ordinary investors. For example, it is very difficult for an individual investor to get exposure to such companies as Bitfury, Xapo, Coinbase etc, and investing through BCAP gives you this opportunity. Please wait for the offering memorandum to learn about the exact mechanism of how the fees will be charged. There will be no dividends, as any profits will be reinvested into the fund, thus affecting NAV and hopefully token price in the aftermarket, as NAV will serve as a benchmark for it.",False

Thank you for your interest in the offering. The fund will invest into equity of the companies and potentially tokens as well. So yes, you could of course invest into ICOs yourselves, however to get an exposure to Series A round of a major blockchain company that would not do an ICO would be a lot more difficult as an individual investor. BCAP token gives you this exposure.  The difference with ICONOMI: it invests only in tokens / crypto and BCAP token gives you much wider exposure as per above.  The difference with Melonport: it is a fund management platform, not so much a fund itself.",False
