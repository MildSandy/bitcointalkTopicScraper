Tradable life insurance policies can include endowment, whole life, universal life, key-man, and investment-linked insurance, among others.  Most life insurance policyholders are actually not aware that their policy is actually an investment asset that can be sold to third-party buyers instead of simply surrendering their policies back to the insurer when they want to access their policy’s cash value.  The market for tradable insurance policies is currently very illiquid, difficult to access and involves using several intermediaries in the process of buying and selling policies. Hence, this asset class has never managed to grow into an attractive market for investors.  However, this is about to change as Singapore-based fintech startup fidentiaX is developing the world’s first marketplace for tradable life insurance policies. The new blockchain-powered platform will bring together policyholders and insurance policy buyers in a transparent, user-friendly and trustless trading environment.  This will not only empower life insurance policyholders to sell their policies for a potentially higher cash value to third-party buyers instead of surrendering them but it will also attract investment managers, corporations, and private investors who want to gain exposure to this interesting alternative asset class.  The most prominent features of this asset class are capital preservation, stable returns, a fixed tenure, potentially higher returns than comparable asset class, and zero correlation to stocks and bonds, among others.  https://medium.com/@fidentiaX/7-reasons-why-you-should-consider-holding-tradable-insurance-policies-in-your-portfolio-a050f5b72114",False

There are many small-to-medium size enterprises that is tackling the tradable policies market, however we do not view these companies are competitors but rather potential partners on the platform which they can utilize to expand their reach and access to cross-border customers. Purchase tradable policies cross-border is an expensive process involving escrow agents or lawyers, alternatively you can trust the company doing the sale. Furthermore, our marketplace aims to match willing sellers and willing buyers and let them determine the value to transact at thus eliminating the need for a middle-man or a trusted party.  The team behind fidentiaX has many years of experience in the industry and we partnered with Blockchain Zoo to deliver the platform. We firmly believe in doing what we are good at, fidentiaX team running the business and Blockchain Zoo deliverying the technology solution.  Hope that answers your query. Looking forward to your support.",False

The annual membership fees shall be payable via fdX tokens and any token collected will be consumed. This would effectively decrease the total float of fdX in the market.  For example:  fidentiaX’s marketplace has 200,000 users and each membership is set at 20 fdX tokens per annual. A total of 4,000,000 will be consumed that year. This will reduce the total float by approximately 3% assuming 100% of the tokens were distributed during CTC.  •   Member’s Auction  fidentiaX will hold exclusive auction for fdX token holders whereby policy will be put up for auction at a significant discount off the cash value.  For example:  fidentiaX list an endowment policy with cash value of $100,000 at 25% discount, i.e. $75,000. Holders of fdX tokens would then be able to place a bid on the policy using fdX tokens. Successful bidder would walk away with a substantial discount for a real-world asset which he could put up for sale in our marketplace.  •   Exchange for Platform Unified Token (ISX)  Transactions on fidentiaX platform will be conducted with a platform unified token (ISX) for better management of forex risk and risk management (Anti-Money Laundering).  fidentiaX will hold exclusive and limited sale for fdX token holders, giving    them the opportunity to purchase ISX tokens at a discount.

The rational behind 3 tokens can be found in the whitepaper (https://www.fidentiaX.com/whitepaper).  Here is why we are using 3 tokens:  fdX tokens: this ERC20 token is used for the crowd token contribution period as well as the various utilities covered in the whitepaper. Ethereum has the liquidity for raising funds as well as functionaly have a bigger market for trading after the token goes live. There are many exchanges that caters for ERC20 tokens which will provide a market for fdX tokens in the future.  ISX tokens, this is the platform unified token which will be used for all transactions within the platform. There are various reasons for using a Platform unified token as it allows some form of control against Money-Laundering. ISX tokens cannot be transferred unless in a sales and purchase transaction and is pegged to US$1. this pegging also adds another utility as we can mitigate the fx risk within the platform. There will be situation where by the seller and buyer's currencies mis-match and thats where ISX comes in to minimize FX movement.  Curency Rep tokens, this token effectively is transpaent to most users as it would just be a balance of the user based on their initial deposited currency. We cannot insist that buyer deposits only USD and insist that they convert their fiat/btc/eth/etc into ISX immediately. thus the need for a currency rep token on the platform.

We see them focusing on the B2B model and would require adaptation and buy-in of various stakeholders in the sale cycle. Its an amazing project and its tackling a big change in how insurance business is being conducted.  Umbrella coin focuses on General Insurance product and actually acts as an insurer to provide a different way of purchasing coverage. I think its a great idea and there are similar projects out there that focuses on IoT insurance, etc.  fidentiaX approach is not to change the world overnight, we are tackling one segment of the market (tradable policies) and we do not require Insurers to adopt our technology for the business to work however we would be pushing for adoptation of blockchain technology by setting up a open-source foundation to drive this. We are actually very happy to see more insurance blockchain solutions as it will push the industry to a tipping point.  Our solution is solving the inefficiencies in the current tradable policies market by leveraging on blockchain technology. Do read up on our whitepaper to find out more! www.fidentiaX.com/whitepaper  Thank you  P.S: We are based in Singapore",False

There are players in Singapore and Malaysia which predominately work within their host countries and U.K/U.S has a more developed market but there is no recognizable marketplace on a global scale. Furthermore, there are inefficiencies in the market which we strongly believe that Blockchain technology can use applied to address it thus fidentiaX.  We are actually looking forward to working with local players to help them extend their reach to the global marketplace by joining the platform as a trusted partner.  thanks!",False

We are putting up 100,000,000 fdX tokens for the Crowd Token Contribution at an exchange of 1ETH:500fdX, lets assume ETH is at US$330 today. 100,000,000/500*330=US$66mil.  In our whitepaper, we have allocated 70% of the fund raise towards building a model porfolio with the following objectives: -Demonstrate the benefits of having tradable insurance policies in an investment portfolio. Key statistics of the portfolio will be shared on the platform (e.g. portfolio size, average yield at maturity, average investment tenure, etc.)  -Facilitate trades on the platform during the initial stage, this will be done through direct acquisition of policies in a number of countries and listing them on the platform. This is necessary while we build market awareness of the first global marketplace for tradable insurance policies.  -Utilize the portfolio returns (3%p.a.~4%p.a) to fund future development of the platform as well as funding a non-profit foundation to proliferate the adaptation of blockchain technology in the Insurance Industry.  The total amount raised may seems to be a high number, however the insurance industry is a multi-trillion market and surrendered value in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan combined exceeds $700billion in a year.  Another point we would like to highlight, founder's token are ""vested"" over a period of 3 years from end of Crowd Token Contribution, i.e. founders will only be allowed to release 30%/30%/40% of the tokens progressively. We are in this for the long haul.",False
