We are constantly looking for new ways to apply CinemaWell.com. Translation service is our priority. We even included this idea in our trailer for filmmakers https://youtu.be/nFUz9sqn6oM We do not post such ideas in our roadmap because we have many ideas. The roadmap will be endless    2. We released only 300 million ApplauseCash tokens. And no more will be released. Almost half of all tokens is allotted to use inside the platform for payment to watch movies, leave feedback, etc. Also, after viewers are paid for watching movies, we'll do our best to encourage them to use their tokens for various micro-payment opportunities, like dating features!!!, buying best seats in the cinemas, and so on.  We are going to participate in Cannes, Hong Kong, Berlin Film Festivals. There we'll be introducing CinemaWell.com to many producers/filmmakers and to purchase ownership rights for various premieres and movies to premiere on new (2.0) CinemaWell.com platform (planned release is at the end of April). The more users we will attract by paying them for watching movies, the higher CinemaWell.com value will be. It means that the price of tokens will go up, respectively.  We do have many strategic lawful plans how to raise APLC price.  Also, we have started negotiation with stocks of crypto assets regarding APLC tokens. The value of APLC tokens will depend on the market/our platform popularity/number of users/etc.   3.Crowdfunding for fimmakers is one of the main features of CinemaWell.com! And our goal is to do it inside CinemaWell.com because it will make our platform valuable for all users of social network of online cinemas, CinemaWell.com!",False

I have a number of questions. I think it'll be cool for everybody and me learn the answers.  1. They say in some places that you get money by watching movies. Admin, how much money can I make? Coz, I can watch tons of moves!))) 2. Isn’t there risk that some Chinese folks would set up a network of computers and pre-program them to watch movies, then get the money from watching them and then withdraw them to Ethereum. Do you have any explanations on what you might be going to do in order to mitigate those risks here. 3. There’s information that marketer can connect to the system and get the “valuable marketing data”. That’s really cool, but isn’t it right that if you pay the views to view some stuff that you will make your data pretty “dirty”. 4. You speak a lot about premiers, but I can get to your system and watch the movies that are really good later on. Coz, you know, I am a copywriter and my schedule is pretty hectic and I am never gonna be able to fit in the premier. 5. There’s some info about dating. This is actually pretty cool. You can imagine some girls hinting some guys that they might be open to go to the virtual cinema and sort of have a date. It can actually turn out into a great niche use case that would eat up into the need of the ordinary users to do something together, but not like in the real world. So, how are people going to communicate at such dates? Coz, they are watching the movie and it’s pretty loud, right? 6. Can you discuss the movies while you are watching them, coz teens and, well, everybody else, would be into texting, right? 7. Are you gonna show any ads next to the screens, coz this will empower your monetize-it! effort a lot. 8. Coding – I am not very deep into coding yet. Has anyone checked what they’ve got there? 9. Aren’t you afraid of the dump effect since you sell out your tokens at the 90% discount (!) pre-sale? 10. So, I looked a couple of minutes at road maps and info around them. Look, I don’t exactly get it – when will we see the movies at your platform? Will there be an archive of cool indie movies like at IMDB with ratings and reviews and stuff, so that viewers can come and watch them?  Bottom line: I really like the idea of co-watching. This might go get catchy and viral with teens and young adults, then it might go kitties, you know. Or it might not, but it’s some steam under it.",False

Thank you! here are the answers to your questions:  1. They say in some places that you get money by watching movies. Admin, how much money can I make? Coz, I can watch tons of moves!))) Answer: We’d like to answer “tons of tokens”, but be careful, you lose the feeling of reality and can start leaving someone else’s life, like Napoleon, from watching too many movies!  2. Isn’t there risk that some Chinese folks would set up a network of computers and pre-program them to watch movies, then get the money from watching them and then withdraw them to Ethereum. Do you have any explanations on what you might be going to do in order to mitigate those risks here. Answer: Bingo! This is CEO’s favourite part Liliya got certified before in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Plus, our architects and engineers have experience with robot protection systems, espesially for all those Chinese provocateurs! But, if there’ll be the ones who’ll unite in groups, cities or even North Korean countries to get rewarded by all tokens released by us, then I’ll unveil you a secret, huge secret: due to tremendous growth of viewers and watched movies, CinemaWell.com will become very popular and the best producers would like to show their best movies on our platform!  3. There’s information that marketer can connect to the system and get the “valuable marketing data”. That’s really cool, but isn’t it right that if you pay the views to view some stuff that you will make your data pretty “dirty”. Answers: We love our users, to the moon and back… our best users! The data they’ll provide will for sure be the best one on this huge market!  4. You speaks a lot about premiers, but I can get to your system and watch the movies that are really good later on. Coz, you know, I am a copywriter and my schedule is pretty hectic and I am never gonna be able to fit in the premier. The version you have access to is legacy version. However, we already have had amazing premieres there, too. Here is what we’ve noticed: we had premiere of the movie “The Gold” with $2 mln  budget. The film company succeeded in this experiment. They decided to show their movie, first in their online cinema on CinemaWell.com platform, and only then this movie had to be released for offline cinemas. So, there were several thousands of people at this premiere, hundreds of whom entered cinema halls several hours before screening. They were waiting impatiently for the premiere, chatting with each other online:  https://www.screendaily.com/news/russia-readies-first-online-premiere/5059482.article   5. There’s some info about dating. This is actually pretty cool. You can imagine some girls hinting some guys that they might be open to go to the virtual cinema and sort of have a date. It can actually turn out into a great niche use case that would eat up into the need of the ordinary users to do something together, but not like in the real world. So, how are people going to communicate at such dates? Coz, they are watching the movie and it’s pretty loud, right?  Answer: We have cute button “watch with stranger”. This dating service allows to find, if not, second part of your heart, then, at least, new friend to watch a movie with. When you get a ticket and enter the cinema hall, you’ll have an option of private chat, which will allow all silliness that you’ll mutter to your new friend to be hidden from all audience.  6. Can you discuss the movies while you are watching them, coz teens and, well, everybody else, would be into texting, right? Answer: Also, there is public chat which is available for everyone. If it disturbs you from viewing a movie, you can hide it. https://youtu.be/7HbO9w6PlxA  7. Are you gonna show any ads next to the screens, coz this will empower your monetize-it! effort a lot. Answer: We don’t want an advertisement to be annoying. It can appear sometimes before movie starts (like in an offline movie).  8. Coding – I am not very deep into coding yet. Has anyone checked what they’ve got there? Answer: Welcome to GitHub: https://github.com/DigiMoiseus/ApplauseCashToken  9. Aren’t you afraid of the dump effect since you sell out your tokens at the 90% discount (!) pre-sale? Answer: First of all, it’s a bonus (not discount). It’s active only for 1 hour of pre-ICO and it has Hard Cap! Frankly speaking, it has its marketing trick  10. So, I looked a couple of minutes at road maps and info around them. Look, I don’t exactly get it – when will we see the movies at your platform? Will there be an archive of cool indie movies like at IMDB with ratings and reviews and stuff, so that viewers can come and watch them? Answer: Official release of our 2.0 version will launch at the end of April/beginning of May, just before Cannes Film Festival. By then we will participate in European Film Market and Hong Kong Film Festival, where we’ll purchase ownerships’ rights to propose many new interesting movies to our first users of the platform.",False

Great project. I read your white paper carefully, and I have a few questions   1) Considering the global reach of your platform and your will to offer independent films from many countries, translation is a question that was in my mind throughout my read but you did not mention it. Your ecosystem is perfect for a subtitling system similar to viki.com, with the possibility for directors to pay bilingual community members in APLC to get subtitles on the platform (or give a share of the ticket price to translators of a given language). Is it in your roadmap ?  2) As an investor, I'd like to know how and why my APLC would increase in value. What mechanism, simply put, would make APLC more valuable than the ICO price of 1$  if your company grow ?  3) You mention crowdfunding for directors several times in your white paper. Will it be a feature of your platform or would the director have to redirect its cinemawell.com supporters to a kickstarter ?",False
