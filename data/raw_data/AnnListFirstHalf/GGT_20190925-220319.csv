That is because we do not want a mad pumped fomo  rush, with investors wildly buying in.  Remember its a great responsibility handling public monies and an already existing business we want long-term considered investors and as such progress will be slow but very steady.  Thank you for your interest in this project and watch this space. We are already in talks with additional developers to begin the development of our  Gold/crypto trading platform. the Audex",False

Our ATM is being designed to accept scrap gold, weigh it, calculate its value and either pay out 94% of the market spot price to any consumer via bank transfer, or in cryptocurrency.  Most importantly any consumer in the world will be able to use the GramGold ATM to purchase at the right market price both gold bullion bars and coins electronically, which will be stored at our secure vaults.  In the near future an ATM for all precious metals including silver and platinum will also be launched. This is currently being researched.  Problem 1 – The Precious Metals Recycling Supply Chain -Too Long  Instead of a consumer selling their gold to a middleman who then sells to another middleman and so on, the consumer simply sells their gold via our innovative and ground-breaking GramGold ATM utilizing state-of the-art xrf spectrometer technology coupled with specialized custom-built spectroscopy. This will cut down the high value gold supply chain enabling the consumer to realize the best market price for their jewellery etc. Currently the GramGold ATM will only handle gold transactions, but a complete precious metals ATM is in the design phase.  Problem 2 – The Precious Metals Recycling Rip-Off  Rather than the consumer trying to negotiate a selling price against experienced gold-dealers, failing and often settling for far less than spot market value The GramGold ATM will be set to pay a fixed percentage of the spot i.e. market price for gold. The rate will be set at a minimum 94% of spot price up to 45% higher than some consumers currently receive. No more rip-off!  Problem 3 – Precious Metals Recycling Security & Safety Issues  The GramGold ATM solves both issues at one stroke. Located in the most secure areas of busy indoor shopping malls, with heavy footfall and security, the GramGold ATM includes in-built CCTV, tamper alarm and 24hr 4G monitoring. The GramGold ATM is safe secure and cashless.  Problem 4 – Lost Asset Value & Adverse Effect on The Local Economy  Receiving more for their gold items will allow consumers more disposable income and therefore more spending power in their local communities, benefiting the local economy  If a GramGold ATM is set to pay to the consumer 94% of the market price where the average paid by a middleman could be even lower than 50% (wide variance from country to country AND if the turnover of the ATM is approx $1,456,000 per annum we can estimate that one ATM puts at least $700,000 back into the global consumers pocket.  If we sited 300 machines that would equal $210,000,000 back to the consumer  If we sited 3000 machines that would equate to $2,100,000,000 back to the consumer  An exciting development of the Gramgold ATM will be the ability to buy gold and silver via our ATM terminal using either cryptocurrency, bank card our token or by exchanging your scrap gold for safely secured bullion at very little charge. You can imagine a further saving to the global consumer of around, lets estimate, £3 billion for the purposes of this whitepaper.  Total Benefit to the Consumer in financial terms  $5,000,000 per annum+ ?  The Benefits – A Shorter Fairer Safer Multi-Beneficial Supply Chain!  atm4  Other benefits include…  Cashless transaction  Ability To sell Gold for any cryptocurrency including Bitcoin Ethereum GramGold  Ability to sell Gold via bank/credit card transfer  Ability in the Future to also buy gold via ATM  The GramGold ATM*  The architecture:  Safe Cabinets dimensions are 1.8 meters high, 0.75 meters deep and 1.2 meters wide.  Build Cost Phase 1 ATM – Gold only **  1 x Custom Spectrometer XRF Analyser $30,000  1 x Custom Laser Spectroscope $75000  Custom Inline Checkweigher Baling & packaging facility $10,000  Custom Internal Manipulator $5000  Built-in PC, touch screen, Linux o/s $2000  Armored box $10,000  CCTV/Security & Face recognition $3000  ID Scanner & QR scanner $3000  Hi-Tec Alarm System with 4G Monitoring $1000  Chip & Pin Reader for ATM $500  Receipt printer & Issuer $500  Custom Receiving Receptacle/ATM style Hatch $1000  Build, Adjustment and commissioning $5000  Total $146,000  *Pat. Pending  ** Phase 2 ATM for all precious metals currently in design stage  The GramGold ATM Profit Centre Calculation  Estimated Gold Purchase per unit per annum based on (1KG per week at avg. purity 70% = 350g pure gold equiv x $40 x 52 weeks) Customer receives 94%* spot  $1,456,000  GramGold profit based on 3 % (i.e. 6% less 2% for refining costs & 1% for maintenance)  $43680  *This percentage will increase with further technological development   We have as a broad target in the first year of operation to install 30 units giving a target profit of c. $1.3million. In communities where no ATM is feasible the profit level will be approximately the same. I.e. increased cost due to overhead but likelihood of greater through-flow.  The Future  GramGold ATM’s Around the Globe  The launch of the first GramGold ATM will be in the Birmingham Jewellery Quarter, our local community, followed by as second ATM in Birmingham’s busy Bullring shopping centre. We are planning a rapid expansion after this initial launch with ATMs to be sited in all major shopping centres in the UK & the EU followed by Africa and Asia.  An exciting development of the GramGold ATM will be the ability to buy gold and silver via our ATM terminal using either cryptocurrency, bank card our token or by exchanging your scrap gold for safely secured bullion at very little charge.

To be honest we are a little overawed by what we are setting out to do here, the Gold market is worth billions USD, but we know we can achieve it with investor support. As the Birmingham Gold Company, with ten years experience in precious metals processing we already achieve these aims for our UK and EU customers albeit on a much smaller scale, but now we want to go global  If you take a look at the diagram at the top of this article you will see depicted the 4 key projects that we intend to complete.

The Audex is our own decentralized Gold and precious metals exchange where customers can buy and sell Gold, Silver Platinum and Palladium against a basket of cryptocurrencies, with prices scraped and aggregated from leading global metals markets so that the best possible buying prices are achievable. Precious metals can be then stored in our online-accessible, physical, safe and secure vaults.    Augram  Our vaults will be fully accessible online 24/7 , safe, secured and fully insured. the combination of Augram and Audex will ensure that our customers purchase and store Gold, Silver & Platinum at the best market rates.    GramGold ATMs    The GramGold ATM is one of three main initiatives in our white paper, being designed to stop the asset loss today’s consumers face when buying and selling Gold. Our ATM is being designed to accept scrap Gold, weigh it, calculate its value and either pay out 94% of the market spot price to any consumer via bank transfer, or in cryptocurrency. Customers achieve far les, sometimes less than 40% of this value when they sell scrap/unwanted Gold and lets not forget that 90% of recycled Gold comes from these customers, that is a market worth $50 billion (see whitepaper appendix)  Most importantly any consumer in the world will be able to use the GramGold ATM to purchase at the right market price both Gold bullion bars and coins electronically, which will be stored at our secure vaults. in the future the ATM will also give immediate access to our decentralized trading platform. we intend to site ATMs in major shopping centres around the world  The Gram|Gold Token GGT  This is a custom token developed on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 Token. Not only will it be a tradeable asset, more importantly it will be used to facilitate the purchase and sale of Gold around the world. It is an asset backed by Gold. When any consumer buys this token they will not only receive 100% of the their purchase in tokens they will also receive 10% of their purchase spend (equivalent in dollars) in Gold deposited in our vaults. That is actual physical Gold. They can then use our token to buy Gold from us to be stored in our vaults at 110% of the spot / market price at the time of the order via a smart contract the customer will also pay a small storage charge on an annual basis. This enables anyone anywhere in the world where it is legal to purchase Gold to buy Gold direct from us using the GGT Token but of course they may also wish to purchase Gold from us via bank transfer, cheque or credit card. This is the Augram scheme (see below).  But perhaps more significanttly than this the GGT token will fund the setting up of a decentralized exchange known as AUDEX will which be a Gold and precious metals exchange allowing for the buying and selling of all precious metals via a basket of cryptocurrency  The GGT token will be used to crowdfund the production of Gold recycling ATMs to be situated in key shopping centres throughout the world. This represents a physical asset designed to be able to accept Gold recycling scrap from all over the world to be transferred either into our token, other cryptocurrency, swapped for Gold bullion or sold for cash via bank transfer/credit card etc.  This Gold recycling eco-system will ensure that consumers receive a minimum of 94% of the market spot price for their precious metals instead of the low prices they currently are offered. This will be achieved by the design, production placement and operation of our automated precious metals recycling ATM the GramGold ATM worldwide  Conclusion Yes, its a bold and ambitious plan, but also logical and achievable with the right investment. Every part is achievable.  You may well ask yourself ""Why should I care? Because you, like most people, you might have paid too much when buying Gold & sold it for far too little. Let's change that!

We have an ambitious yet practical and achievable plan to  revolutionize the gold recycling industry using our custom token the GramGold, built upon blockchain technology, specifically the Ethereum platform.  In the course of one year, we estimate over $23 billion dollars globally is literally stolen/misappropriated from the average man in the street. People like you and people you know. Consider that 90% of the worlds recycled gold doesn't come from industrial recovery. Industrial recycling amounts to only around 10% perhaps slightly more.  Many consumers have always got a bad deal when selling and buying gold and silver. They have always bought it for too much especially bullion and sold it far too cheaply, in the main due to lack of market knowledge and also the presence of greedy and unscrupulous middlemen.  It’s an unregulated unpoliced market and whilst centralization is certainly not the answer to the issue and impossible to achieve anyway, the problem remains i.e. $23 billion lost to the consumer each year. Its staggering to consider the scale and scope of this issue and that many people don't know it exists. We have spent the past five years buying $millions of dollars’ worth of gold and silver proudly telling all our customers that we are paying 93-95% of the commodity market price (i.e. the spot price) not because we are charitable but because we believe that if we pay more, we get more customers and yet every second of every day somewhere in the world, a ring or a bracelet etc.  that we would have paid to our customer $940 to buy in is being sold by an innocent member of the public, quite happily for $500 That represents a loss of $440, totally unacceptable. That seller has just been mugged!  The seller might have been in dire straits selling cherished family assets to pay bills etc., but who cares? The question is would you be happy if this happened to you?  Of course, there are many reasons why no gold recycler can pay 100% of the market price to a customer i.e. recycling fees, infrastructure costs marketing costs etc. but let’s make it clear that the above bracelet will be sold at some point to the end processor i.e. the refiner for $995! At the same time, we also noticed that people also wanted to buy gold and many millions of them were paying way over the odds for bullion i.e. gold silver and platinum bars and coins that have no other value than the value of the metal. For example, we noticed that gold bars we would sell at $1000 were changing hands on eBay at over $3000 and were selling like hot cakes because the public wanted to invest in gold and we are talking 2017 here. Their bar would have to rise to prices over 300% to avoid a loss and so allow them to get their money back out. The Mints are no better offering bullion coins at three times bullion price and when their true value is only in their precious metal content.  Another rip-off.  if we could just buy gold from everyone in the world at 93-95% we'd be a huge global corporation to the same size as Microsoft etc. with a turnover of $50 billion plus bullion sold and an annual profit of some $2.5 billion AND every gold buyer and seller in the world would be happy at the thought of getting 95% of the market price for their gold. But this win-win isn't easy to achieve, and the reality is far different as you will see when you read this whitepaper. Many people don't even realize that there is a market price for gold and that there are companies like us (not just us!) who would pay a proper price. But ignorance is not bliss! it’s a loss!  As we considered this almost insolvable issue we realized that the latest blockchain technology could give us the resources to solve this problem on a global scale. We could in simple terms create our own custom asset via a decentralized blockchain. GramGold token (GGT) is a custom token developed on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 Token) and with that asset we could develop three key answers to the issues raised; three exciting projects to ensure that the Public all around the world get the true price for their precious metals, selling or buying. Reading this a potential investor might ask themselves ""Why should I care whether the public get the right price for their gold? The answer is simple, you ARE the public, we are all the public. Can you afford to lose close to 500 dollars in every $1000? Can your local economy afford this type of loss many times over?  $23 billion dollars a year (plus unquantifiable bullion losses in fact) is being taken out of the hands of the many (that need it) and put in the pockets of the few. $23 billion dollars disappears annually from local economies / communities that you live in; local economies that rely on consumer expenditure for their infrastructure to survive meaning less disposable cash that could have been spent on local businesses etc. This project is going to revolutionize the gold and precious metals recycling industry. It’s going to ensure the next time you buy or sell gold you do it at the right price, i.e. it’s going to protect and increase your assets. It’s going to help to protect your local economy/community but most importantly of all Its going to make us all £23 billion dollars per annum wealthier.  We believe that this is a wonderful investment opportunity led by a team experienced in business generally, and specifically in precious metals recycling and blockchain technology. We have three exciting initiatives   that will change the face of gold recycling forever and most importantly we have a token that with investor support will be recognized the world over as representing fairness and transparency in all aspects of gold, silver and platinum buying and selling.  Consider that, if nothing else ownership of our token implies more than just an understanding of the $23 billion problem. It will provide the solution. What may surprise any potential investor is that when they purchase the GramGold token (GGT) we take 10% of the investment in us and buy gold at the right market price on behalf of the investor. This gold is stored by us but wholly owned by the investor, making our token an even more attractive proposition. What’s more as this project progresses we aim to increase this percentage. Finally and probably most importantly, through our AuGram scheme, we aim  to create  a blockchain backed precious metals exchange to eliminate fraud leveraging and ultimately market manipulation.  TOKEN SALE  TOKEN SALE BEGINS 18/02/2018  TOKEN SALE ENDS 01/04/2018  We have set our token sale at a level to reflect these aims.  Total token supply: 1,000,000,000 GramGold Tokens  50% of the tokens will be distributed to ICO participants 10% of the tokens will be allocated for the Team, 35% Reserve Fund 5% Bounty  Token Price  The price for the GramGold token will be logically set at 1% of the live price of pure gold as at 01/02/2018 0700 hours GMT ($43.12) This equals $0.4312. This equates to 0.000375 eth (at coinmarketcap’s price at the same date and time)   10% Pure Gold Free to All Direct Purchaser of the GGT  Whenever the GramGold token (GGT) is bought or invested in, via direct purchase from GramGold (as opposed to trading it in pairs on a platform) the buyer receives 10% percent to the value of their purchase in the form of gold, free of charge via our AuGram scheme to be stored in an online vault and accounted for, via independent auditors. Three events take place. Firstly Any direct purchaser will receive the GramGold (GGT) token sent from us to their wallet. Secondly upon receipt of an email from the purchaser confirming all relevant transaction details we will, within 48 hours of the email, purchase and store for them pure 24 carat certified gold at the rate of 10% of their total token spend for the relevant transaction, converted into dollar equivalent. Gold will be purchased at the relevant LBMA rate for that day. The purchaser pays nothing for the gold which is stored by GramGold in an online vault on behalf of the customer. Thirdly GramGold will deposit the equivalent dollar or sterling value of the gold into a dedicated Bitcoin/Ethereum wallet to ensure that any mass withdrawals of gold are covered. Example Investor A buys 1000 GGT Tokens with Ether The transaction costs the buyer 0.1 Ether. On the day and time the transaction is recorded on the blockchain 0.1 ether was valued at $110. The purchaser sends us an email confirming all relevant transaction details GramGold buys $11 worth of 24 carat gold at the LBMA price for the day (AM or PM) and stores it for Investor A AND at the same time sends $11 to the GramGold dedicated Bitcoin/Ethereum wallet to cover the withdrawal if ever requested. ONLY GOLD CAN BE WITHDRAWN.  Token Cap  Current ICO trends have been to declare both soft and hard caps. We have considered both carefully but have decided that this token sale is to be uncapped for the following reasons;  Soft Cap.  As we are buying and storing gold on behalf of investors at the token sale stage and as we will be undertaking all developments as outlined in this white paper anyway a soft cap is simply redundant in this case. How far we get with our projects will be up to investors.  Hard Cap.  We have no hard cap. Here is why:- Re. GramGold ATM and the GramGold Foundation The global market for high-value gold recycling is worth $50 billion and our target is to reduce the $23 billion lost to consumers. If we set that as a hard cap it would be laughable. That is why we are not setting a hard cap. The token sale will begin on the 18/02/2018 Our deadline for the Token Sale to end will be 31/03/18. Token Limits = maximum 20,000 per investor to ensure that we have global coverage to raise our profile to the consumer wherever they may be.   BOUNTY  We are launching The GramGold ICO on Feb 18th 2018 and we need to get our message out there .

END DATE 17/02/2018  Trading  The GramGold token will be available to be traded in several major cryptocurrencies when the token sale has completed on the 31/03/2018.  We will be looking to launch our GramGold token on some or all the following exchanges;  Etherdelta Binance Bittrex Cryptopia   BGC Tokens  As a test marketing and logistics exercise we launched back in November an experimental token on the waves platform i.e. the BGC token. This has been successful and given us a strong promotional platform. Once the token sale has been completed holders of this token will be offered an exchange of their existing BGC Tokens to GramGold Token as follows; As at 06/02/2017 1 bgc = 0.000011 waves. (90,900 BGC = 1 waves) 1 waves = =0.00618 ethereum  1 eth= 14,708000 BGC At the GramGold ethereum price i.e. .000375 ether  5,500 BGC = 1 GramGold To date 3million BGC tokens have been issued and the largest holder has c5000 tokens. The BGC Token will be used to incentivize a marketing and promotional programme.

This will be actual physical gold, stored in a secure insured Swiss and/or or UK vault and will be audited by chartered accountants. Full details are The AuGram scheme will initially enable consumers globally to buy, sell and store gold using a basket of cryptocurrency. It will facilitate the ownership of gold to our purchasers at correct, not over-inflated market prices. Ultimately it will, via a smart contract, develop into a trading platform specifically for gold and precious metals. Purchasers of the GGT token may use that token or any other form of cryptocurrency or standard currency via bank transfer, cheque, credit card etc. to buy gold and precious metals at our decentralized trading exchange platform which will be known as known as Audex. This is currently in development By setting up our own decentralised precious metals market exchange platform we would re-move the risk of market manipulation from purchasers/consumers. We will eliminate fraud lever-aging and market manipulation by having a decentralised exchange being fed and aggregating live global market prices.  Ownership of the Gold  All gold within the AuGram scheme is managed by GramGold and owned by the token purchaser. All gold is allocated gold and secured via the equivalent cash held in the dedicated GramGold bank account  Selling of Gold  Gold is sold at the LBMA price closest to the time of order on behalf of the GramGold holder less 5% commission  Physical Gold Withdrawal  Whilst Gold is actual physical gold held by us in a secure vault and audited via independent Chartered Accountants and the purchaser may sell it at any time for a wide range of available cryptocurrencies it will not be currently possible for purchasers to withdraw their gold in physical form due to exorbitant shipping costs with the added issue of security/theft etc.    Bullion  The bullion is held in a form generally accepted in settlements of physical bullion markets around the world. All gold bars follow the definition of the UK Customs and excise 701/21 notice by being no less than 99.95% pure gold, of weight and by a manufacturer globally accepted by global bullion markets.  Bullion content  We guarantee that all gold held is part of a 99.95% minimum assayed bullion bar. Gold secured & the dedicated bank account will be counted and audited for purity by an independent registered auditing company.  Statements  Just like a standard bank account, statements are issued regularly for your offline records or tax purposes.  100% Insured  Every gram of gold in the vaulting facility is professionally insured against physical loss for full replacement value.  It is our aim to develop the AuGram scheme into a fully developed, wholly owned custom-built secure precious metals vault with “above 100 % reserve in both gold and cryptocurrency”. This will be linked to the Audex decentralized gold/cryptocurrency exchange. Its current modus operandi is an excellent test bed for this.  By setting up our own decentralised precious metals market exchange platform we would re-move the risk of market manipulation from purchasers/consumers. We will eliminate fraud lever-aging and market manipulation by having a decentralised exchange being fed and aggregating live global market prices.     Clearly to operate such an exchange with the necessary in-house expanded fully secured state-of-the-art storage facilities, full compliance, stock, liquidity etc. would involve heavy capital investment in all areas of the infrastructure with special regard to above 100% reserve i.e. in the form of both bullion and bitcoin. This is the ultimate target of the AuGram Cryptocurrency Gold Exchange.

From your road map your about to planning put ATM gold at overseas,do you planning for opening other branch too? [/quote]  As regards the ATM we aim over the next few years to have one sited in every major shopping centre in the world. It will be secure, armor plated and CCTV'd Shopping Centre security will patrol the ATM and we will train ATM maintenance engineers to check maintain and empty the ATMS accompanied at the emptying stage by professional security personnel. The ATM will be as safe as any bank ATM  here is more info  for you The GramGold ATM is designed to stop the asset loss today's consumers face when buying and selling gold. Our ATM is being designed to accept scrap gold, weigh it, calculate its value and either pay out 94% of the market spot price to any consumer via bank transfer, or in cryptocur-rency. Most importantly any consumer in the world will be able to use the GramGold ATM to pur-chase at the right market price both gold bullion bars and coins electronically, which will be stored via our Augram scheme at our secure vaults. In the near future an ATM for all precious metals including silver and platinum will also be launched. This is currently being researched.  Instead of a consumer selling their gold to a middleman who then sells to another middleman and so on, the consumer simply sells their gold via our innovative and ground-breaking GramGold ATM utilizing state-of the-art xrf spectrometer technology coupled with specialized custom-built spectroscopy. This will cut down the high value gold supply chain enabling the consumer to realize the best market price for their jewellery etc. Currently the GramGold ATM will only handle gold transactions, but a complete precious metals ATM is in the design phase.   * Pat. Pending   Rather than the consumer trying to negotiate a selling price against experienced gold-dealers, failing and often settling for far less than spot market value The GramGold ATM will be set to pay a fixed percentage of the spot i.e. market price for gold. The rate will be set at a minimum 94% of spot price up to 45% higher than some consumers currently receive. No more rip-off!    The GramGold ATM solves both issues at one stroke. Located in the most secure areas of busy indoor shopping malls, with heavy footfall and security, the GramGold ATM includes in-built CCTV, tamper alarm and 24hr 4G monitoring. The GramGold ATM is safe secure and cashless.  Receiving more for their gold items will allow consumers more disposable income and therefore more spending power in their local communities, benefiting the local economy    If a GramGold ATM is set to pay to the consumer 94% of the market price where the average paid by a middleman could be even lower than 50% (wide variance from country to country AND if the turnover of the ATM is approx $1,456,000 per annum we can estimate that one ATM puts at least $700,000 back into the global consumers pocket. If we sited 300 machines that would equal $210,000,000 back to the consumer If we sited 3000 machines that would equate to $2,100,000,000 back to the consumer  An exciting development of the Gramgold ATM will be the ability to buy gold and silver via our ATM terminal using either cryptocurrency, bank card our token or by exchanging your scrap gold for safely secured bullion at very little charge. You can imagine a further saving to the global consumer of around, lets estimate, £3 billion for the purposes of this whitepaper.

Our token, GGT is 10% backed by goid initially. This percentage will rise over time as the GGT token becomes more established and we become established on the global scale. It is not possible to have a token 100% backed by Gold for many reasons, not least the cost of buying/storing/shipping gold. Any investor should be vary wary of any scheme claiming that their token is 100% backed by gold.  What you are proposing is a massive undertaking How can I be sure this will succeed ?  There are no guarantees of success anywhere in life With this project and any other any potential should examine the facts and weigh up the risks. Consider that firstly we are not a start-up ICO and have a proven track record in the business sector we operate in. The GramGold  project is a natural extension of our operations. We have clearly examined the global need and demand for  more honest, transparent and fairer gold markets whether for buying or selling, in local communities or on trading markets . The five  key elements of the GramGold project ie the GGT token itself,  the Augram scheme (buying /selliing storage of gold), the  Audex (decentralized trading exchange), the Gramgold ATMs for recycling gold scrap and the GramGold Foundation are all designed to meet these identified global needs;  ie the need to be able to buy gold at fair market prices without fear of being ripped off or  scammed in the many ways we have outlined AND the need to be able to sell gold, whether in the form of scrap jewellery right through to bars and coins at the best possible market rates.  What is The GramGold Token ?   GramGold token (GGT) is a custom token developed on the Etherium blockchain as an ERC-20 Token. Besides being a tradeable asset it is 10% backed by Gold & will be used to fund, the AuGram Scheme, the Audex, the GramGold ATM and the GramGold Foundation. The percrentage of gold backing will increase in the future to 50% and 95% depending on the success of the GGT  What is the Augram Scheme ?  Quite simply its a gold purchase sale and storage facility. The AuGram scheme will facilitate the ownership of gold to our investors at correct, not over-inflated market prices & will enable consumers globally to buy, sell & store gold using cryptocurrency. So if you use our ATMs (see below) to buy gold from, the gold will be sold by us at the right, fair market rate, and stored by us on your behalf in secure insured vaults. If you buy the GGT token, 10% Gold on top of your token purchase will be stored on your behalf, in our vaults, yours to keep or sell at any time . The long-term  objective of the Augram scheme is the construction of wholly-owned GramGold bullion vaults, in the UK  What is Audex?  Quite simply its a decentralized gold  trading platform, linked to the Augram scheme.  The Audex decentralized gold/cryptocurrency exchange.will be set up via smart contract  to allow GramGold token holders and eventually any cryptocurrency holder to buy sell and exchange tokens and cryptocurrency on a decentrailzed trading exchange that will “scrape and aggregate daily gold prices from the major gold markets around the world without the penalties of heavy trading fees  Gold & precious metals bought will be stored via the Augram scheme and can be sold from there also.  What is the the GramGold ATM ?  Simply put its an ATM that consumers can use to sell there physical gold at the best market prices. its worth remembering as have pointed out in the Whitepaper, that this market alone is worth $50billion annually .We are developing the GramGold ATM to ensure the customer receives the right price when buying & selling Gold. The only way to reduce the over-long & corrupt precious metal purchse & supply chains. Any customer will also be able to buy gold via the ATM, through the Augram schem and trade it on Audex.  What is the GramGold Foundation ?  The GramGold Foundation (The GGF) will not only promote all Gramgold schemes, including the Augram scheme, the Audex and the ATMs together with good buying/selling practices globally, ie to consumers and local economies alike, it will also provide training, & support to candidates selected to maintain the GramGold ATM. . Why is there no Soft Cap in the ICO ?  As we are buying and storing gold on behalf of purchasers at the token sale stage and as we will be undertaking all developments as outlined in this white paper anyway a soft cap is simply redundant in this case. How far we get with our projects will be up to purchasers.  Your team looks small for such a large project . Why is this ?  Much like as any blockchain grows, or indeed any organization,  our team will grow in line with the growth of the project . Many ICOs recently have stuffed their team pages full of advisers and personnel at the very beginning of the ICO only for investors to find out later on that personnel they have believed in and indeed invested in,  have either never worked on the project or have left. We have taken the opposite approach. Our team are currently  working on all aspects of the GramGold project and we are in talks with additional staff currently to meet future needs .  This Gold market revolution is a massive undertaking Do you have Government Support for this ?  No, there is no Government support schemes for this typoe of initiative however through our GramGold Foundation we will be in talk with local Governments and community leaders around the Globe, promoting the cause of the GramGold project generally and our ATMs specifically  . This project will succeed with the support of our investors.  How does the additional 10% Gold initiative work?  Whenever a registered purchaser buys the GramGold token from us i.e. after registration, three events take place. Firstly, they will receive the FULL amount of GramGold (GGT) tokens sent from us to their wallet Secondly upon receipt of an email from the purchaser confirming all relevant transaction details we will, within 48 hours of the email, purchase and store for them pure 24 carat certified gold at the rate of 10% of their total token spend for the relevant transaction, converted into dollar equivalent. The rate of ETH/USD conversion and then USD/GOLD conversion will be calculated on the day the Gold is bought using the ETH/USD & the relevant LBMA rate AM or PM for that day. The purchaser pays nothing for the gold which is stored by GramGold in an online vault on behalf of the customer. Thirdly GramGold will deposit the equivalent dollar or sterling value of the gold into a dedicated Bitcoin/Ethereum wallet to ensure that any mass withdrawals of gold are covered.",False

""Why should you care?  Because you, like most people, have probably paid too much when you bought Gold and when you've sold it, got far too little back. ...We're going to change that. Use GramGold & Cryptocurrencies to buy, sell & exchange Gold""  Executive Statement Consumers globally are selling their gold for far too little and buying it, if and when they can, at far too high a price, thanks to greedy middlemen, unfair & unscrupulous dealers and manipulated exchange markets. We are going to change all that.   The GramGold project  https://www.gramgold.net is a unique proposition in the world of cryptocurrency today. It’s not just an ERC20 token backed by Gold and a Global Gold Asset Trading Platform based on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, It’s a lot more besides, as this whitepaper will show."" GGT 10% Backed By Gold Limited to 20,000 GGT per purchaser We have been asked two questions, several times, leading up to the publication of this white paper. Firstly, why we are backing our ERC20 token (GGT) with 10% Gold to begin with, (when you buy our token you get 10% extra in gold free, in a vault), and secondly why we are limiting the ICO/Token Sale to a maximum of 20,000 GGT per purchaser. Firstly, we do not believe currently that any crypto asset can be 100% backed by gold and any claims to the contrary should be examined very closely, given costs such as trading & exchange fees, storage costs commissions etc. Even more relevant is the fact Cryptocurrency is far less stable at the moment than Gold. We are currently offering 10% backed by gold, but in the future, we hope to be offering 50% and then up to 95% backed by gold. It all depends on the strength of our token after sale. It is not possible nor feasible to start at 100% backed by gold. Our token would enable the global consumer to buy and store physical gold with us from anywhere that is allowed in the world. This might not be a big issue for affluent people with large disposable income and access to gold exchanges and bullion vaults in their locality BUT for those that can only buy gold at a ridiculous premium or not at all, due to lack of facilities etc. we have just the answer. It is to these consumers that we wish to appeal, which is why, to answer the second question, we have limited the supply of GGT Tokens to 20,000 per purchaser. We do not want whales. We want the person in the street to benefit, not the centralized powers. Isn't that partly what blockchain should be about? GramGold The Bigger Picture But Gramgold is far more than just a token. There are several serious and pervasive problems to be addressed in the global marketplace for gold and precious metals and the GramGold token GGT helps to solve them all. 90% of the recycled supply of gold comes from the consumer (not industrial scrap) i.e. when the consumer sells their jewellery/scrap. We have proof that from this $50 billion industry the consumer, through overlong supply chains filled with many rogue middlemen, gets short-changed to the tune of some $33 billion (see appendix 2) taking money from the pockets of those who need it and away from the local economy, having an impact on local revenue and employment.   The second issue is one we have just touched upon. Purchasers all over the world are often paying far too much for gold bullion bars and coins. We can estimate that consumers waste over $2 billion per annum of their assets either through paying too much for their gold bars and coins or through getting scammed as well as being physically mugged etc. The third issue is one of Gold markets. Current Precious metals exchanges also cause consumer losses with often-cited accusations of fraud and manipulation. Even the Federal reserve and large Banks have been accused of manipulating prices. Solutions We have outlined the problems faced. We have four solutions to these issues. The GramGold Token GGT The GramGold token (GGT) is a custom token developed on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 Token. This has a twofold function. The first is that it can be bought at any time and is 10% backed by Gold, via the Augram scheme. It can then be used to buy gold at preferential rates. The second function of the Gramgold token is to fund the other 3 initiatives we intend to launch to combat the problems we all face when we buy and sell gold and precious metals.  The Augram Scheme The Augram scheme Initially will facilitate the ownership of gold to our purchasers at correct, not over-inflated market prices but ultimately will enable consumers globally to buy, sell & store gold using a basket of cryptocurrency leading to the creation of a blockchain backed precious metals exchange to eliminate fraud leveraging and gold market manipulation in current exchanges. Not only will it provide the small purchaser with the ability to buy and secure gold at the right price and store it online securely, it will enable them to trade gold and other precious metals in a non-manipulated decentralized exchange via a basket of cryptocurrencies. By setting up our own decentralised precious metals market exchange platform we would re-move the risk of market manipulation from purchasers/consumers. We will eliminate fraud lever-aging and market manipulation by having a decentralised exchange being fed and aggregating live global market prices.  The GramGold ATM We are developing the GramGold ATM to ensure the customer gets the right price when selling physical Gold for recycling i.e. jewellery & scrap. The ATM will also allow for purchases of gold bullion via our Augram scheme either via bank account transfer, cryptocurrency or the swap of scrap for bullion. The GramGold Foundation The GramGold Foundation (The GGF) will not only promote the GramGold ATM and good buying/selling practices globally, it will also provide training, and support to candidates selected to maintain the GramGold ATM. Please consider this consumer project which we believe will revolutionize not only the gold & precious metals recycling industries but also current trading platforms.   TOKEN SALE  TOKEN SALE BEGINS 18/02/2018  TOKEN SALE ENDS 01/04/2018  We have set our token sale at a level to reflect these aims.  Total token supply: 1,000,000,000 GramGold Tokens  50% of the tokens will be distributed to ICO participants 10% of the tokens will be allocated for the Team, 35% Reserve Fund 5% Bounty  Token Price  The price for the GramGold token will be logically set at 1% of the live price of pure gold as at 01/02/2018 0700 hours GMT ($43.12) This equals $0.4312. This equates to 0.000375 eth (at coinmarketcap’s price at the same date and time)    10% Pure Gold Free to All Direct Purchaser of the GGT  Whenever the GramGold token (GGT) is bought or invested in, via direct purchase from GramGold (as opposed to trading it in pairs on a platform) the buyer receives 10% percent to the value of their purchase in the form of gold, free of charge via our AuGram scheme to be stored in an online vault and accounted for, via independent auditors. Three events take place. Firstly Any direct purchaser will receive the GramGold (GGT) token sent from us to their wallet. Secondly upon receipt of an email from the purchaser confirming all relevant transaction details we will, within 48 hours of the email, purchase and store for them pure 24 carat certified gold at the rate of 10% of their total token spend for the relevant transaction, converted into dollar equivalent. Gold will be purchased at the relevant LBMA rate for that day. The purchaser pays nothing for the gold which is stored by GramGold in an online vault on behalf of the customer. Thirdly GramGold will deposit the equivalent dollar or sterling value of the gold into a dedicated Bitcoin/Ethereum wallet to ensure that any mass withdrawals of gold are covered. Example Investor A buys 1000 GGT Tokens with Ether The transaction costs the buyer 0.1 Ether. On the day and time the transaction is recorded on the blockchain 0.1 ether was valued at $110. The purchaser sends us an email confirming all relevant transaction details GramGold buys $11 worth of 24 carat gold at the LBMA price for the day (AM or PM) and stores it for Investor A AND at the same time sends $11 to the GramGold dedicated Bitcoin/Ethereum wallet to cover the withdrawal if ever requested. ONLY GOLD CAN BE WITHDRAWN.  Token Cap  Current ICO trends have been to declare both soft and hard caps. We have considered both carefully but have decided that this token sale is to be uncapped for the following reasons;  Soft Cap.  As we are buying and storing gold on behalf of investors at the token sale stage and as we will be undertaking all developments as outlined in this white paper anyway a soft cap is simply redundant in this case. How far we get with our projects will be up to investors.  Hard Cap.  We have no hard cap. Here is why:- Re. GramGold ATM and the GramGold Foundation The global market for high-value gold recycling is worth $50 billion and our target is to reduce the $23 billion lost to consumers. If we set that as a hard cap it would be laughable. That is why we are not setting a hard cap. The token sale will begin on the 18/02/2018 Our deadline for the Token Sale to end will be 31/03/18. Token Limits = maximum 20,000 per investor to ensure that we have global coverage to raise our profile to the consumer wherever they may be.

We will be looking to launch our GramGold token on some or all the following exchanges;  Etherdelta Binance Bittrex Cryptopia   BGC Tokens  As a test marketing and logistics exercise we launched back in November an experimental token on the waves platform i.e. the BGC token. This has been successful and given us a strong promotional platform. Once the token sale has been completed holders of this token will be offered an exchange of their existing BGC Tokens to GramGold Token as follows; As at 06/02/2017 1 bgc = 0.000011 waves. (90,900 BGC = 1 waves) 1 waves = =0.00618 ethereum   1 eth= 14,708000 BGC At the GramGold ethereum price i.e. .000375 ether   5,500 BGC = 1 GramGold To date 3million BGC tokens have been issued and the largest holder has c5000 tokens. The BGC Token will be used to incentivize a marketing and promotional programme.

What makes this project special is not just the fact that we have years of industry experience behind us,  its more to do with the demand. All over the world consumers know that when they sell or buy gold they are going to be in for a hard time and be unable to realize anywhere near the true value of their assets (or pay to much for them in the first place)  Our three solutions to this issue ie with our Goldgram ATM, the Augram scheme and the GoldGram Foundation, all funded via our ERC-20 token (GGT),  address each aspect of the problem ie the lack of a local facility to sell gold at the right price, the lack of a facility to buy gold locally at the right price, and  generally the lack of consumer knowledge in the buying and selling gold and precious metals.  We are the first in the marketplace to offer this project. We already have a committed team, not of fancy over-qualified semi-decentrailzed advisers paid to look good on a whitepaper, but rather a focused, globally located  team that really believe in what we are doing .  Investors of our erc-20 token will receive 10% of their investment in the form of gold stored by us in secure vaults, fully insured and audited, enabling us to create a bridge between the decentralized world and the world where gold is still the stable hedge of choice.  So why us ? Tangible solutions to the issues, including an exciting roadmap , a committed team, a token which can only appreciate in value over time (no to da moons here, we envisage a slow but steady start )    what more can we say ??

We have  3 key solutions using blockchain technology to ensure the next time the consumer buys or sells gold they do it at the right price, i.e. it’s going to protect and increase your assets and  it’s going to help to protect your local economy/community. We intend to  change the face of gold recycling forever with a token that  will be recognized the world over as representing fairness and transparency in all aspects of precious metals  buying and selling. The solutions are 1/ The GramGold ATM   https://gramgold.net/index.php/the-gramgold-atm 2/The Augram Scheme https://gramgold.net/index.php/the-augram-scheme 3/ The GramGold Foundation https://gramgold.net/index.php/the-gramgold-foundation",False
