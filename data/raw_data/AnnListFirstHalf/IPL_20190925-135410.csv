I am satisfied with progress and communication. Keep on goin Insurepal team!   “When new exchanges?” is the questions we continue to receive month after month following the crowdsale. This week we had a short talk with Maxim Streltses, InsurePal’s CFO, who told us all about what’s happening in the financial section of InsurePal.  So if you are one of those people who are constantly wondering what is happening with new exchanges or if you are just curious who Max is and what is his initial role in the company then continue reading.  To start this conversation in the right manner, can you please explain when did you join the InsurePal team and why? What pulled you towards the project?  Max: I have joined the project just a few months before the ICO started. I was lucky to be invited — that’s really the answer, but from my side, and for a while back I was fascinated by the Blockchain technology and its practical implementation in the the real economy. When I came across Insurepal and met the founders, I immediately saw the huge potential in the project. The idea was great, the founders had practical and applicable experience in the end markets we were about to disrupt, and the concept was truly value adding to all participants of the value chain. I knew that there will be many challenges, but i also knew that the underlying concept and the team behind is strong enough to get this done.  What is in your opinion the hardest part of preparing the IPL token for exchanges?  Max: There is no particular part which is the hardest. I would say its a combination of factors such as; (i) screening existing, new and up and coming exchanges for their propositions, for their reputation, who stands behind them, their potential and risks. (ii) screening the offers to “help listing” as many of them are true and credible, but many are just an attempt to squeeze money out of us. (iii) Application process itself is not easy either, as there are long application forms, and detached communication. In general I would say that the main difficulty is getting the right exchange for the right amount of capital and with the right reputation. The industry of exchanges today is incredibly profitable, the incumbents have very strong pricing power and are charging extremely high rates, and because of that new exchanges are popping up all the time trying to share that extra-ordinary profit. Many of these have great prospects, but with that all of them carry regulatory risks which can not be ignored.  So when can the community expect new exchanges?  Max: This is not a question I can answer with exact dates. Typical listing process (if such a thing even exists) is a few months long for a large established exchange. It is shorter for the new and smaller ones. We have recently added IPL to a new US based exchange which comes with great prospects (as it is supported by very influential developers and investors of the crypto world) and hope to announce a few more in the next 2 months. The focus is now to list on another large exchange, and add smaller with high prospects, but in a way that we diversify our geographical exposure.  What is the IPL token economy?  Max: IPL Token economy refers to the ecosystem that will be built on the use of our Social Proof concept. The economy is based on the need to use the token as means of payment for services in the eco-system. In other words we are trying to integrate our Social Proof model into areas such as car insurance, health insurance, geek economy and general crypto economy which can benefit from building trust and economical sharing of such benefits.  And referring to the previous question. Can you tell us in detail how will the IPL token work? How and for what will users be able to use it?  Max: We look to integrate the token step by step as we build the eco-system, and as we incentivise non crypto users to become such. This approach works for everyone’s advantage. It enlarges the crypto user base on one hand, and it creates virality effect for the token on the other. The plan is to start with token as an incentive for endorsement, then token as means of partial or full payment for services, and then token as mandatory means of payment for services.   https://medium.com/insurepal-blog/short-stories-with-the-management-team-maxim-streltses-cfo-2ad8e17543f4",False

Q: Will the pilot insurance provider be tracking data that can be used as a roadmap for other insurance providers of interest?

What's the biggest obstacle right now related to this project and how do you intend to overcome it?    Currently the biggest obstacle we're facing with is to communicate work being done (and create an understanding about the time this takes) towards the community. This is now done with consistent marketing actions and support across all our channels. The launch of the new website will definitely help there too.   Will the pilot insurance provider be tracking data that can be used as a roadmap for other insurance providers of interest?   InsurePal will keep track itself on the results and all the necessary data. As a consequence it can show other insurers the effect of social proof and the pitfalls that should be avoided.    When new website? and any update in roadmap?   New website will be up and running by the end of June. The initial roadmap, which we presented on the webpage still holds.    Have you held any negotiations with govern-based regulators?  Yes, we did. In fact we had many meetings with regulators. In many cases these were on exchange of opinions basis or introducing our project and implications that might have on insurance market.

Nevertheless, the similarity of these insurance covers prompts competitors starting a price war. This actions result in decreasing customer loyalty and increasing acquisition costs.  How can insurance providers innovate car insurance to make it awesome, attractive and profitable? #1 Provide instant feedback if the motorist drives well Driving a vehicle gives close to nothing assuming any, immediate feedback if a driver could improve the situation. Creative innovation makes it conceivable to provides quick feedback, helping drivers to enhance their driving style and urge them to improve the situation.  #2 Point out danger areas if approaching Much the same as Waze (the notorious cop-spotting application); a mobile app that has been branded by the Insurer continuously informs the driver of the locations that accidents frequently occur. If drivers are approaching these locations, they are cautioned and be aware.  #3 Avoid risky situations by showcasing common accidents By understanding the frequent causes of road accidents, preventing them and keeping the drivers safe become possible. Presenting a video series with easily followed suggestions branded by an insurer, a policyholder’s involvement in an accident will be reduced.  #4 Text loved ones if the driver is speeding With state-of-the-art innovations (e.g., smartphones, Internet of Things) it is viable to move towards “push” strategies, with the goal of changing the driving behavior of people through an app (or inherent gadget in the car) that messages parents, spouse or friends.  #5 Hinder drivers from texting if driving It is illegal to ‘text and drive’ in most states of the United States. This conduct is a primary cause of car collisions. Insurers can provide a mobile app that blocks policyholders from driving and texting at the same time.  #6 Challenge colleagues and relatives on driving safe Make great driving a challenge to people you care. Risk carriers can provide a branded app that sets up contests for colleagues, loved ones, and friends.  #7 Reward drivers from parents and family if driving safe Acknowledgment and reward should reach a safe driver from time to time. A gadget can recognize safe driving conduct and foster sincere and honest feedback from real humans.  #8 Appreciate developing driving skills When it comes to driving, experience behind the wheel is matters more than a person’s age because the first step to averting risks is anticipating hazards. Building such a skill takes a lot of time. Why not count the mileage of the drivers like a car or a plane? “Miles” can be gathered and traded inside a portable application provide by a safety net provider.  #9 Grant free safety training if shown good manner Driving sheltered and watchful can be rewarded. At the point when drivers are given a free safety feature, they will do even safer.  #10 Reward exemplary drivers with towing service Insurers can offer drivers the option of trading their accumulated scores (e.g., stored by an application) for a free towing service if there should be an occurrence of an accident or a breakdown. By doing this, a policyholder gets an extra security highlight from his insurance carrier.  In a Nutshell It takes a great deal of effort innovating car insurance and making it attractive for profitable policyholders.

You say in your whitepaper ""To receive the InsurePal insurance, clients will be asked to take and upload a photo of their existing insurance policy. The InsurePal will then calculate and offer each client  a discount, proportionate to the size of their endorsers` guarantee. This way, every client will receive a specific number of tokens, representing the exact amount of their  estimated discount according to a current market value. In the first phase, the client will also be able to opt out for the cash discount in the form of lower premium price. In this  case, the cash discount will account for approximately 20% less than the value of the estimated token discount. ""   Answer 1: starting point of underwriting process for any new risk would be entering the basic data needed to calculate premium or just uploading existing insurance policy. In both cases data would be copied to the system, which will calculate InsurePal’s offer. This will be the entry point to the endorsement process. InsurePal’s offer will be bases on the maximum level of endorsements, which the user can obtain. On the other side endorsers will get rewards in tokens in the value of certain % the amount which will they endorse. Getting cash instead of tokens will also be on option, but while we will prefer tokens to build token economy, the amount of cash will be reduced.  Ales, [20.05.18 10:17] Question 2:  One selling point of your product is that you say it will reduce the impact of fraudulent claims. A search of Google suggests that the average cost of a fraudulent UK motor claim is £12k (ABI data) If a typical car insurance premium costs somewhere in the region of £500-£1k, and a social proof guarantor agrees to place themselves on liability for a proportion of this premium, there is still another £11k+ of each average fraud claim unaccounted for.   The vast majority, more than 90%. (Furthermore - albeit a less significant point - fraudulent operators can simply collude and obtain an upfront discount on their policy AND a bonus of IPL tokens to sell too.  This gives them additional upfront financing for their fraud exercise!).  Why would you expect this system to make a significant impact on reduction of motor fraud?   Answer 2: this was explained by Matt. Just to summarize: basic idea is to reduce fraud. Insurance companies are mainly competing on premium side, but do almost nothing on claim side. So reducing the fraud would have significant effect which could in the end also lead to the premium reduction. Nowadays everyone is paying for big discount given to known people, fraudulent claims, for people who are not paying at all and many more examples… Our opinion is, that this can be reduced by using the social proof concept.  Ales, [20.05.18 10:18] Question 3:  Can you please confirm what happens when someone makes an at-fault claim? For example: -  Are they thereafter excluded from potential future insurance with InsurePal? -  Is their score and the score of their endorsers negatively affected? -  Does it matter what type of claim has occurred?     Answer 3: Firstly: claims are happening and will happen in the future. Social proof will not eliminate them. So in the case of claim endorsers will be asked to cover they part if needed of course – depends on the claim value. Users will not be excluded from future usage of InsurePal’s platform. Depending of the type of claim there will be some effect on score card of all stakeholders.  Ales, [20.05.18 10:18] Question 4: Can you please confirm precisely what your approved patent covers.  For example - does your patent prevent any competitor from using the entire system of social proof deductibles in insurance?  Or is it more specific to your implementation with InsurePal software/ IPL tokens / etc. It is not obvious to me why a competitor cannot simply implement the social proof deductible idea in car insurance but without the complication of use of the blockchain / IPL tokens.  Less barriers to entry, less requirements for shifts in existing systems, easy to sell to consumers. Does your patent really blanket guard against all other usage of this concept in insurance?  You're of course welcome to point me towards the patent text if it's a question I can answer myself by reading!  But your interpretation would be appreciated, especially if it's a complex legal document   Answer 4: The patent was filed-in. Generally is a broad definition of insurance process (method/computer system) for risk segmentation where mutual recommendations can be taken into account (financial guarantee).  Ales, [20.05.18 10:18] Question 5:  UK insurance regulation is tough and increasingly complex.  In the context of your UK motor pilot - Is this something you are specifically addressing in your development? Can you please give a brief summary of how?     Answer 5: Basically speaking (does not link to UK or motor insurance) we are targeting groups of risks for which we believe that are bottleneck for insurance companies. Normally these groups have higher premium than average ones. With social proof help, for these groups of risks we can extract the good ones, which can then as a consequence be offered better pricing on one side and better risk segmentation for insurance company’s side.  Ales, [20.05.18 10:19] Question 6:  Will the UK pilot be an exclusive arrangement with one selected UK insurer?  If yes - then in future implementation after the pilot phase, would the implementation remain exclusive with one partner or do you envisage it being a service that can partner with multiple supporting insurers?   Answer 6: While there is crowdie at the door, our intention at the start is to work with one insurance company per market and per line of business. In the future we will open platform to become real marketplace.  Ales, [20.05.18 10:19] Question 7:  Can you please confirm the exact relationship between insured, yourselves and the underwriting insurer?   For example, is the following correct:- '- InsurePal fronts all elements of the policy sale to the insured, perform all interaction with the prospective policyholder. - InsurePal derives the premium rate based on THEIR risk models and the contract is signed via the InsurePal app - InsurePal perform the risk selection.  They decide who to accept and reject (?) - BUT the policy is underwritten by a partner UK insurer.  - Claims are filed by policyholders in the InsurePal app, but the the partner insurer is responsible for claims management  I'm sure there are elements that I have misunderstood or guessed here and so please correct my understanding as it is not clear to me exactly how the arrangement would work.     Answer 7: InsurePal is the platform for endorsement process. It will be, so to say, incorporated in the insurance underwriting process. There are many ways how to do that, so final form will be discussed with every insurance company separately. One way for example is that in the middle of underwriting process on some insurance company’s web page or portal you are offered the link to InsurePal’s platform to get better premium offer. In behind of course is our risk model. Insurance policy in this case will be underwritten under insurance company (also other options exists). Claims could be filed either through our platform or directly to insurance company, which is then responsible for whole claim process.     I hope that these answers give you better insight what will be going on. Thank you and we are in touch.",False

This is what we set out to discover in this exclusive interview with Matt Peterman, co-founder of InsurePal, a new business that has recently closed an $18m ICO on the promise of developing peer-to-peer insurance based on social proof endorsements.  Thanks for speaking with us Matt – could you tell us the story of how InsurePal got started? [Matt Peterman:] Thank you for taking the time to interview me. The insurance industry is all about dealing with trust and risk, and we actually think people are pretty good at this between themselves… it just gets less accurate and more difficult when you do it at scale without a human face. So in 2015 we identified the science of social proof as a possible solution and invested close to $500,000 to develop our model and web app demo, filing a patent in the US and worldwide.  Calibrated mathematical algorithms confirmed that our model brings from 30% up to 70% cost reduction. We pitched the idea in Silicon Valley but ended up refusing an offer of several million dollars in order to be able to develop InsurePal on our own terms.  After conducting our methodology and viability assessment, and a legal review of the project, we identified the missing piece: blockchain. Our core team are mostly people with a background in the financial and insurance industry – we have a really strong insurance knowledge base – and we held several meetings with cryptocurrency think-tanks. We are working on making the InsurePal platform the global “go-to” solution for social proof insurance, leveraging blockchain technology.  You mentioned you’ve patented your solution for “social proof for the insurance industry” – can you summarize the technology involved? The InsurePal platform improves risk selection, segmentation, and trust. For the end user, the InsurePal decentralized app will serve as an entry point to our insurance ecosystem, and we set up white label partnerships so businesses can sell social proof insurance. We feel that the social proof idea will reshape insurance back to its roots.  Decentralization is a key change we see coming to many technologies, and it’s great for insurance. Blockchain technology has three different but complementary definitions:  Technically, the blockchain is a back-end database that maintains a distributed ledger that can be inspected openly; Business-wise, the blockchain is an exchange network that operates 24/7 and allows you to move value peer-to-peer without the assistance of intermediaries; Legally speaking, the blockchain can be seen as a validation mechanism for transactions, replacing middlemen. Having that in mind, blockchain technology can add significant value. Here are a few areas we can improve:  insurance conditions and automated claims processing through smart contracts; a reliable and transparent payment mechanism for the client; identity check (KYC/AML) and better fraud control; bringing to market innovative insurance product offerings. Regarding new insurance products, we’ve seen a lot of ideas realized recently: property CAT XL (a type of excess of loss reinsurance), flight delay insurance, crop insurance, drone insurance, smart car and smart home insurance, and battery insurance. Social-proof based insurance is another of these rapidly emerging areas of innovation.  What does this all mean for consumers? Well, we can say that insurance is boring. How many times a year do you interact with insurance company? As seldom as possible, right?  We want to change that and build a community that has common goals regarding lifestyle, for example diligent drivers who want to be rewarded for their habits. Social proof is a natural, in-built mechanism within all of us, where we reference the behaviour of others to guide our own actions.  InsurePal translates social proof into a form of financial commitment. An endorser financially guarantees someone, and to do this they use their own due diligence since the risk is losing their money. Through many such endorsements and guarantees, the network as a whole whole becomes more risk aware, and will actually encourage a change in people’s behaviour.  We anticipate that the InsurePal platform will serve as a replacement for many types of insurance as we know today, and offer completely new types of coverage for areas of life and business that are emerging rapidly in a digital world.   The magazine Insurance CIO Outlook has ranked InsurePal in the top 10 blockchain solution providers in 2018  What does your roadmap look like? We launched the InsurePal token (IPL) crowd sale on 16th January 2018, and closed it successfully in the first 80 seconds!  Before and since that public sale, we’ve been hard at work in both R&D and marketing. We have a pilot project in the UK which also involves some global services and at the end of the summer social proof modules will be ready for testing with our community. While we are setting up token economics a lot of blockchain knowledge will need to be integrated in our solution.  On the other side, extensive legal and regulatory preparations are ongoing, with our goal to obtain an EU passport license and join the FCA global sandbox. Beyond this, we will be seeking partnerships with interested third parties, and from a PR point of view all InsurePal activities will be promoted on a global scale.  Our roadmap can be found on our website at: https://insurepal.io/roadmap   InsurePal have set up offices in London with an eye on the excellent global fintech and insuretech ecosystem here     With the experience you’ve gained so far in the brand new world of blockchain technology, what’s your outlook and advice for fellow entrepreneurs? One thing is certain: in the blockchain business, there is always something new happening! Basically it’s going to affect everything: if you run through predictions for how things work in the year 2025, you’re going to have cryptocurrency banks and crypto-insurance companies, DAO will be a generally accepted company structure, we will use digital wallets, business logic and contracts will be recorded on blockchains, digital securitization of goods will become the norm (gold, diamonds, physical property)…  Would you like more? Medical documentation will be available on blockchains, laws and restrictions will be directly checked on the blockchain, taxes will be calculated and paid on the blockchain, stock exchanges will use blockchains to validate transactions and traders will use them as a means of payment, the decentralized protocol will become commonplace, special blockchain browsers will be developed, the language of smart contracts will prosper, open source protocols will gain, university programs of cryptography and game theory will prosper, decentralized cloud computing will gain…  So what can we sum up? One needs to stay flexible for 100% change from the position which is known today.  Doing business in an environment like this takes even more effort than the usual entrepreneurial life. My advice: be flexible and run towards your goals or others will get there first!",False

The money insurance companies collect from policyholders must at least match all insurance claims. The more diligent drivers a company insures, the lower insurance price it can charge. Peer-to-peer insurance enables individuals to profit by telling who is naughty and who is nice.  Lessons from peer-to-peer lending With peer-to-peer insurance, the role of insurance companies is changing. Something similar has started happening with banks a few years ago. Traditionally, banks allocated savings of individuals to the most suitable borrowers, as they have been considered to have the most expertise in selecting such borrowers and being the most efficient in doing so. However, in the last few years, banks have been partially replaced (especially in the allocation of credit to smaller borrowers) by peer-to-peer lending platforms, which connect borrowers and investors in a faster and, as it seems, also a more efficient way.  https://medium.com/insurepal-blog/can-peer-to-peer-insurance-replace-insurance-companies-65b8e374dcbb",False

The result: only 1.8% of listings successfully collects funds in the lowest credit category, as opposed to 30.9% of listings funded in the highest credit category (Iyer et al., 2009). However, empirical studies have provided evidence that some lenders use decision methods that many national legislations would consider illegal if done by institutions.  Borrower’s appearance deducted from the enclosed picture can account for as much as 25 to 35% difference in the likelihood of receiving a loan and 60 to 80 basis points[4] difference in the interest rate. Moreover, borrowers who avoid providing a picture suffer adverse consequences from lenders. Investors also discriminate against the elderly and the overweight but in favor of women and those that signal military involvement (Pope and Sydnor, 2011). Similarly, trustworthiness based on appearance judgments allows borrowers to promise a lower interest rate compared to the average borrower and keep the same probability of obtaining a loan. In fact, such individuals also pay lower interest rates if they get funded (Duarte et al., 2012).  Is such bias economically irrational? In other words, are investors seeking for the highest risk-adjusted return on their investment making an efficient decision? Apparently, yes. Duarte et al. (2012) and Pope and Sydnor (2011) provide evidence that appearance attributes can explain a part of the variation in default probabilities. The explanation for such observations might be that lenders understand correlations between appearance features and “important characteristics for predicting default that they cannot perfectly observe, such as education and social-support networks”   very interesting!",False

I will not comment the price of the token; especially I will not comment possible trends. Still let me add few thoughts. Some people are extremely happy. Unfortunately, they are quite on telegram, but I received many thankful messages. (Including some dinner invitation from some selling early and profiting a lot and rebuying now) The token trade volume is picking up, which is a good sign, for any token sold there is someone who believes in this token and is buying it. We will not be manipulating market and you did not contribute to the project that we do that. Our task is to do the project and we are progressing extremely well. Many posts will follow from our side to inform you what we are doing. I strongly believe that at the end this has to reflect in the price of IPL. However, no one can promise this including me.  We are acting in the interest of InsurePal on medium and long run. Sometimes short-term solutions community would like to see to cause a quick price increase are in contradiction with medium and long-run effects. It is impossible to please everyone and to do a good project at the same time.  If there was any miscommunication with win-win we are sorry and I hope he can accept our excuse and please let us continue discuss this with win-win in a private chat.   I hope that you will continue supporting us and we will try to onboard many more people to join our great community.

Francois noted how ING successfully swapped €25 million worth of liquid assets using the collateral lending application of fintech startup HQLAx on R3's Corda distributed ledger platform.  ""We did this live transaction last month. We will be in production by year end. It's been a close walk with regulators, and we are now talking to more of them in Asia,"" he said.  That's not to say insurance doesn't have hurdles.  Matt Peterman, CEO and co-founder of InsurPal, agreed that fraud detection is an area ripe for standardization. As it stands, he said, the industry takes invasive measures to fight fraud.  Volk concluded by pointing out some differences between insurance use cases and those in banking, which hinted that perhaps blockchains are a more intuitive fit for the insurance industry.  ""When you talk about blockchain and scale it's a little bit easier for the insurance industry than in financial services,"" he said. ""In terms of transactions per second, we don't have that many so that's not really a limitation for us.""  In this way, he sought to explain the situation merely as one of two different sectors charting their own course toward perhaps inevitable efficiencies.  https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-slump-banks-may-fatigued-insurers-pumped/  Volk concluded:  ""We are simply starting with the easiest contracts and working forward.""",False

It will serve as a replacement for insurances as we know and oﬀer a completely new type of coverage for areas of life and business that began to emerge with the evolution of blockchain and transactions being carried out on the distributed ledger.  ▄▄ SOCIAL PROOF  Social proof is an in-built mechanism within all of us, representing people`s moral compass. InsurePal embeds social proof in a form of financial commitment.

IPL tokens will be used:  1. FOR INSURANCE OF BLOCKCHAIN BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS This type of insurance will be conducted in IPL tokens solely. The incentives for the endorsers will be paid in IPL tokens as well, whereas their guarantee can be done with other means as well. All fees coming from the side of possible participating insurance companies and other third-parties will have to be paid with IPL tokens too.  2. AS AN INSURANCE PREMIUM BONUS To obtain new insurance, the insured will have to upload a photo of their existing insurance policy so that InsurePal can calculate a discount. Doing so, every client will receive a specific number of IPL token (20% less for a cash discount), growing proportionally with the number of endorsements received.  3. AS AN UPFRONT INCENTIVE For each new social proof guarantee, the endorser will receive an incentive in local fiat currency or in IPL tokens. The endorser will be able to sell the IPL tokens immediately, speculate and wait for an even higher market value or save them to buy/renew their insurance policy in the future or to pay some services at shops where they will accept IPL.  4. AS CREDIT SCORE AND SOCIAL PROOF SCORE Social proof endorsers will be able to make the guarantee with the credit card or via a smart contract. Their social proof guarantee will consist of relevant information on the client (the insurance holder) and will serve to them as a credit report. If several endorsers will guarantee for the same person, their credit score will proportionally increase in value. In parallel to token transactions, these information will be stored in the general ledger being partially encrypted and partially public. The encrypted part will only be disclosed publically if its holder approves.  5. AS A SOCIAL PROOF IDENTITY The clients holding IPL will be able to identify themselves within the InsurePal Community. In the long run, they will be able to sell their own social proof guarantee without revealing their identity to institutions or reinsurers in order to get the guarantee and a proportionate share of their insurance premium.  6. AS CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT In the future, the InsurePal may appoint some members of their InsurePal community to process and report on the claims, a service that will have a financial incentive. Claims which will go beyond an agreed threshold (exact amount to be decided) will be decided by professional claims adjusters who will report their recommendations to InsurePal before informing the client. In essence, there will be no need for an insurance company involvement as everything will be settled by the community on the bases of blockchain and smart contracts.",False

There’s promising news from European regulators as Liechtenstein announces that they’ll be taking a light-handed approach when it comes to blockchain technology.  Liechtenstein is one of many small European nations establishing itself as a blockchain hub over recent years. With a population of just 40,000 people, Liechtenstein is the sixth smallest country in the world and is home to more businesses than actual citizens due to the low tax rate. Liechtenstein is particularly attractive to blockchain businesses due to the extreme ease with which they can set up – it’s not necessary to open a bank account to start a company, and the whole process can be handled with Ethereum or Bitcoin following the country’s leading financial institution Bank Frick accepting cryptocurrency directly. Aeternity blockchain creator Yanislav Malahov recently set up shop in Liechtenstein, telling Forbes “they’re making it really easy to incorporate a cryptocurrency business”.  Crown Prince Alois is even interested in using blockchain for administrative government uses as well as stating his family’s interest in cryptocurrency investment, among the richest royal families in Europe. With all that in mind, it’s no surprise that the nation is planning to take it very easy on blockchain regulation in their upcoming legislation known simply as “The Blockchain Act”.  Prime Minister Adrian Hasler states that far from simply regulating the spending, tax, and issuance of cryptocurrency, the law aims to “provide the necessary legal framework for a wide range of new services and business models relating to these technologies”, saying that it “goes much further than the blockchain legislation of other countries” in his speech at a Finance Forum in late March.  Liechtenstein is one of many small nations punching above their weight in the blockchain space, perhaps capitalizing on the inherently slower regulatory efforts made by larger countries. Switzerland is another rising blockchain hub with cryptocurrency adoption widespread in cities like Zug, while the Prime Minister of Malta personally welcomed the proposed relocation of Binance HQ to their small island, while announcing his support for blockchain technology and calling on other EU leaders to join him “on the frontline in embracing this crucial innovation” and create the “Bitcoin continent of Europe”.  Liechtenstein certainly appear to be among those answering the call, with their Financial Market Supervisory Authority at the helm officially processing over 100 blockchain and cryptocurrency-related enquiries so far in their effort to establish themselves as a leading nation in blockchain innovation.",False

Would they purchase tokens just as we have or is there a different role to play for VCs?  Industry oriented VC’s can present an opportunity for global scale up. They can help launch multiple products across multiple lines and to provide significant capital to do it quicker. Discussion with VC’s is a lengthy one and we are in an opportunistic position to interview them to see if WE see them as the right fit , as much as they interview us to see if they want to invest. These meetings are very important as we are creating a landscape for the future. Also please bear in mind that these are senior people very well connected within the biggest insurance names. To your question regarding tokens , the details of investment were not discussed yet (too early) but in my experience it doesn’t matter - equity and token have a strong positive correlation such that positive news flow will move both , one directly and the other indirectly . Bottom line - it’s great to have interest and it works for the benefit of all. But these meetings are early stage and have to be seen as validation of potential for now",False

I assume a partnership would make more sense since the regulations and licensing is already approved.  Max Streltses, [05.03.18 19:21] Most probably partnership. This is indeed the faster route to achieve what we want.  Max Streltses, [05.03.18 19:23] But the deal needs to have the right economics and the right partner to ensure insurepal gets the benefit  Paulekas Asa, [05.03.18 19:24] When you think first policies might start?  Max Streltses, [05.03.18 19:25] Don’t know. And don’t want to say what I am not sure of - too many variables  CryptoBigDawg, [05.03.18 19:32] [In reply to Digibyte King] What's the current workflow you have and how will ipl disrupt your specific business? As insurepal is creating a platform is this something your business can utilize and benefit from?  Digibyte King, [05.03.18 19:48] [In reply to Paulekas Asa] Your just speculating. I'm really an insurance professional 😉  Digibyte King, [05.03.18 19:50] [In reply to CryptoBigDawg] Difficult to say how it would affect me directly. But it will definitely influence or at least disrupt and capture market share, for sure  Digibyte King, [05.03.18 19:53] The typical IPL client will probably be the younger generation. The concept would be too weird or controversial for the older/traditional insurance client  CryptoBigDawg, [05.03.18 19:55] this is true, however the younger generation might have parents for example back them  CryptoBigDawg, [05.03.18 19:55] parents can then see how the idea is good and extend the idea within their circles  Digibyte King, [05.03.18 20:01] [In reply to CryptoBigDawg] Older people don't like change. They like to stick with what they know. It is a mindset that is difficult to change. It is just the nature of the beast  CryptoBigDawg, [05.03.18 20:02] yes can't change human nature  CryptoYoda, [05.03.18 20:20] finally interesting debate  Cryptopiece .com, [05.03.18 20:26] There are no bubbles. Just mysteriously floating candles.  Digibyte King, [05.03.18 20:40] Realisticly thinking, IPL is a total new concept. Yes it is a concept. It is not a proven success...... yet.  Time will tell. With more than 20 years experience in the industry, I do however feel confident about IPL. The industry need a shake-up and a new way of thinking It is time...  Max Streltses, [05.03.18 20:51] Re old people .. let’s not write them off .. the reason older people are less likely to be early adopters is obvious - because they have a long track record and therefore a very low premium and because they are not typically happy to use their social network and finally because they for them the hastily of learning a new tech and switching to a new provider tends to put weight the benefit ...  Max Streltses, [05.03.18 20:52] However - it’s not always the case because many “older”people have had enough time to have made an honest mistake.. a mistake that has put a mark against their name for insurance purposes ..  Max Streltses, [05.03.18 20:53] But most such people have learned their lesson the hard way and will be the best drivers to insure ...  Max Streltses, [05.03.18 20:53] For classical insurance providers however is very difficult to identify these - and here our concept brings a lot of value  Max Streltses, [05.03.18 20:54] But yes - early adopters are likely to be younger - or shall I say medium to high risk classification whereby the risk is not justified and is a function mainly of lack of data  Max Streltses, [05.03.18 20:55] But that’s just one side to the argument  Digibyte King, [05.03.18 20:57] Older people are loyal to insurers, especially if they've been treated well for many years and are very unlikely to easily change. Younger insurance consumers come into the market with no existing ""baggage"" and are free thinkers and would easier adapt /convert to new concept like IPL.  Never forget that insurance is a grudge buy. Nobody is in love with their insurance product........ especially younger people with smaller cash flow  Max Streltses, [05.03.18 20:59] [In reply to Digibyte King] 100% .. the barriers to switching are much higher for older - loyal population .. but it’s only the case for as long as their premiums are low ... once they lose their no claims and their track record - they get upset with prices as their loyalty is no longer rewarded  Max Streltses, [05.03.18 20:59] 100% agree that is  Digibyte King, [05.03.18 21:03] [In reply to Max Streltses] Remember that traditional insurers are more forgiving to older long standing clients with a vehicle accident once every eg. 7 years. An older person with regular claims eg. 3 claims in 3 years is a bad client....  Digibyte King, [05.03.18 21:03] You want to get rid of him.  Digibyte King, [05.03.18 21:06] Social insurance will make such a person a risk for his friends also. If they stop to vote./sponsor him he will become isolated and start to pay even more than ever before to get cover.  With social insurance the real good guys are going to win/score big.  Digibyte King, [05.03.18 21:08] [In reply to Max Streltses] I agree  Max Streltses, [05.03.18 21:11] [In reply to Digibyte King] Fair point .",False

Max Streltses, [28.02.18 20:52] “Last week we have commenced discussions with first real customer in Russia for piloting our social proof for automotive insurance purposes. This follows additional 11 companies both from mainstream insurance space and from new tech. This covers mainland Europe and Asia. As promised , we are deep into the operational activity in the UK and recently established a dialog with a few insurance companies in the UK. An office has been established in the UK and the product is being fine tuned.  Please understand that despite how much we would like to involve you in our detailed actions and despite how much keen we are to brag regarding our achievements - our business is very sensitive and we can not disclose any details of cooperation until these hit the mass market.   insurepal management and founders are constantly travelling between 4-5 destinations to make sure that our product gets real life adoption as soon as possible.  Max Streltses, [28.02.18 20:53] In some instances our product launch might start with smaller size projects.

It will serve as a replacement for insurances as we know and oﬀer a completely new type of coverage for areas of life and business that began to emerge with the evolution of blockchain and transactions being carried out on the distributed ledger.  ▄▄ SOCIAL PROOF  Social proof is an in-built mechanism within all of us, representing people`s moral compass. InsurePal embeds social proof in a form of financial commitment. The endorser who financially guarantees for someone has to use its own due diligence when providing the guarantee to at the risk of losing their money. Through such endorsements, the network in whole becomes more risk aware.  ▄▄ PATENT  This is the first time we have successfully reinvented the social proof for insurance industry. The innovative approach has been filed for patent protection in US and worldwide.  ▄▄ BUILDING THE INTERNET OF INSURANCE  The future of blockchain is identity without authority. The crypto is expanding from digital trading to something that will become a parallel economy, constituting fundamental changes. The mass adaptation of digital currencies of is just around the corner, and the need for blockchain identity and transaction regulation will soon arise. For that, InsurePal is making important strategic partnerships already today to build the three basic pillars of future business that will help grow confidence among trustees and speed up their business operations on the blockchain.   www.Insurepal.io",False

After three days of back to back meetings in London with key insurance gate keepers, members of the top 4 consulting group and operational actuaries, InsurePal can proudly say we are putting our foot to the pedal.  Those of you who have been following us from the very beginning and are already familiar with our roadmap, know that we`ve chosen to launch InsurePal pilot project in UK. Despite the market being extremely demanding and the barriers are high, there are several reasons supporting this decision — the biggest one being the certainty that successfully entering UK benefits all other aspects of business as well.  The fast-moving nature of political, economic and market conditions in 2017 resulted in a highly unstable market in UK, giving InsurePal even more opportunities to move quickly and present ourselves in due time. Therefore, it is of our strategic importance for us to establish a branch office and partnership network to start the cycles of our UK pilot project as quick as possible.  And, we`re glad to say the meetings we attended past week were extremely fruitful. Although we can`t disclose details until the agreements are concluded, we are positive the way things unfolded.  A part of our team is already located in London, providing us with the insights necessary to make the right decisions and quickly act upon them. Maxim Streltses, InsurePal CFO and Peter M. Moricz who expanded his ICO advisory role into a longer cooperation as a strategy advisor and connector for the blockchain economy are on the mission of establishing InsurePal UK branch and growing a trusted partnership network.

To change this narrative, internet came as a first big breakthrough, making information widely available, and consequently allowing us to speak-up and engage in conversation with the companies.  Blockchain is the next big thing as its true benefit doesn’t come from high earnings, as one might assume. In reality, its long-term value is reflected in the revolutionary paradigm of decentralization that empowers individuals and restores back our dignity. Now, we really are at a junction of how our future might look like.  We`re witnessing the rise of peer-to-peer organizations who have made it their priority to listen to the end-users and above all, adapting to their needs. We all know that payment for a certain service is necessary and do not object to that. But, as consumers, we wish the price of that service reflects its real value and is most of all, tailored to our personal needs.  But, insurance companies haven’t made that transition yet: either because they are too big, too traditional or just subjected to too many challenging regulations. They still spend the most money on expensive and extremely invasive methods through which they segment their customers, so they can bill them more.  The reason is perfectly illustrated in this statement:  “There is no longer any anonymity on the Web — unless we mandate it. The most personal information about your online habits is collected, bought and sold, often instantaneously and invisibly. Data collection is a business driven by profits at consumers’ expense.” Therefore, their objective is to turn data into information, providing them with the best insight on your interests and personal behavior.  In the now, many insurtech are already challenging this rigid structure. However, InsurePal is the first industry startup fully harnessing the power of blockchain. We have decided to look on the insurance differently and put ourselves in customers` shoes.  Why should only insurances profit with our personal insight? And how can we make the process beneficent for all? The answer is social proofing. It is perhaps the most innovative model of risk selection and, when put on blockchain, it makes the need for a centralized institution redundant.  Our platform will act as a global provider of various insurance modules, based on social proof mechanics and it will represent an entry point to the entire insurance ecosystem. The social proof will be gained by receiving or giving endorsements and will also be applicable to having more than one endorses. As each new endorser also has their own social proof network, a hierarchical social proof virtual network will soon establish.",False

My name is Cosmin R. and I purchased tokens evaluated at roughly $200.000.  As an investor, I would like to let you know that we did not pay for the tokens so that you and your team can travel, spend money on food, drinks, hookers and attend various events around the world on my expense.  I understand that networking might be good but you could have done that before launching the ICO on your own expenses, or in the case that you actually have a product to present to various retail and potential partners.  The second thing that I would like to address is the adviser board. You have provided those people with tokens and my question is what for? Other than a few tweets from Charlie Shrem which could count as marketing expenses, I have not seen any piece of work provided by these advisers. Haven't any one of them told you that for a token to be at least partially successful one of the main things it needs its volume (proper exchanges with marketing done behind the listing or certain promotions). Which brings me to part 3.  You can't market this as crowdsale with public offering and secondary markets benefits if you haven't actually provided the secondary market.  You can't list this on hitbtc with 1 parity (cheapest package option) and then have them charge people 750 IPL (now 250) to deposit. It is ridiculous and outrageous.  This is a mere warning but I would like you to provide proof of actual work, not trips and meals posted on Twitter and Facebook. When I invested in this, you didnt advertise it as a call girl from Instagram. Show progress, show the status where you are in with the current roadmap and platform development, show partners if any or at least some potential ones. If not, I will be forced to unite my efforts with other fellow investors and report your asses to your local authorities and commerce & trade commissions for fraudulent advertising, money laundering and ponzy scheme.

Despite the market being extremely demanding and the barriers are high, there are several reasons supporting this decision — the biggest one being the certainty that successfully entering UK benefits all other aspects of business as well.  The fast-moving nature of political, economic and market conditions in 2017 resulted in a highly unstable market in UK, giving InsurePal even more opportunities to move quickly and present ourselves in due time. Therefore, it is of our strategic importance for us to establish a branch office and partnership network to start the cycles of our UK pilot project as quick as possible.  And, we`re glad to say the meetings we attended past week were extremely fruitful. Although we can`t disclose details until the agreements are concluded, we are positive the way things unfolded.   A part of our team is already located in London, providing us with the insights necessary to make the right decisions and quickly act upon them. Maxim Streltses, InsurePal CFO and Peter M. Moricz who expanded his ICO advisory role into a longer cooperation as a strategy advisor and connector for the blockchain economy are on the mission of establishing InsurePal UK branch and growing a trusted partnership network.

We want to thank you for all the support and share the achievements of the effort we invested in our Crowdsale campaign.  Crowdsale recap InsurePal crowdsale was divided into two distinct phases: Phase 1: Whitelisting-presale This phase began of 10 December 2017 and was closed on 3 January 2018 at 15:00 UTC. InsurePal sold-out all 70% of tokens available. Due the immense growth of Ethereum, we have also proportionally refunded our contributors. Phase 2: Public sale The public sale began on January 16 on block: 4918135. We sold-out all the tokens available in 5 blocks, accounting for 80 seconds.  During this time, we gathered a staggering number of supporters. Altogether, 23.834 unique users have been whitelisted, of which 18.750 have also successfully passed the KYC verification process. Due the legislation, members from USA, Canada, China, Singapore and Korea were not able to participate.  Contribution Summary Total transactions: 1023 Total IPL tokens created: 300,000,000 IPL Total IPL tokens sold: 201,000,000 IPL  On the day of the public sale, InsurePal has generated 300,000,000 IPL tokens which were distributed in the following manner: 67 % whitelisting presale + crowdsale 22 % IPL for founders and team 6% IPL for advisors and ambassadors 3% IPL for platform incentives 2% IPL for early investors in pre-token  Social media re-cap It is all about the community!

In insurance, the social proof protocol will evaluate and reduce the insurance prices to policyholders in such a way that InsurePal algorithms will recalculate policyholders` previous premiums and offer them a generous discount according to the client`s social proof score. We have filed a US and worldwide patent to protect the intellectual property behind social proof methodology as we believe it will be useful not only to insurance but it will be widely applicable to many other industries.   Social proof will provide companies with an objective assessment of an individual and give a comprehensive insight into one`s character. This proof, working as a third-party deductible, will then be recorded and stored into the blockchain ledger, meaning it will be given into the direct ownership of our protocol users. That is why in the future, social proof will be truly versatile and widely applicable, as it will serve as an all-in-one replacement for various expensive, invasive but also ineffective methods of segmentation.  InsurePal social proof network will exponentially expand in order to allow multiple endorsements and mutual recursion, providing the community with a precise insight of who is endorsing who and for how much.  https://medium.com/insurepal-blog/insurepal-friends-network-application-of-social-proof-is-endless-ccaa98c461e1   RECCOMMENDED READ",False

Becouse of this facts    InsurePal Token  Also key to the InsurePal model are the InsurePal (IPL) tokens, the currency behind the insurance transactions. First, they will be used to provide endorsers with their reward, which can be sold for cash on the IPL exchange.  The tokens also are the currency used to buy InsurePal’s products. The InsurePal platform uses different incentives to motivate participants, the website said. “Discount conversion to tokens will be incentivized, therefore InsurePal will have to convert a significant percentage of each new premium into IPL tokens and give them back to the policyholders and their endorsers,” it added. “All third parties selling their social proof insurance will also be obliged to use IPL tokens and trade them on exchanges.”  Peterman described IPL tokens as crypto-tokens, housed on Ethereum’s blockchain platform. They are unique to InsurePal’s platform.  When asked if the InsurePal tokens could escalate in value, similar to bitcoin, a representative said that the company does not speculate about the price of the token.  However, Peterman noted that the tokens are digital and can be split into smaller parts, which “means that as a reward in case of growth of IPL token, endorsers get a fraction of a token, not the full token.” (The value of the token will be defined by consumer demand and will rise and fall in value).  Funding  InsurePal has raised $18 million in recent token sales. People participating in the sale bought IPL tokens up front, which can be used later to buy insurance products from the InsurePal platform, said Volk. He noted that the sale was “extremely successful” and, in fact, was oversubscribed by $114 million, which had to be returned to participants.  l The funding will be used to roll out the next phase of the company’s evolution, which is to offer U.K. motor car insurance via a managing general agent as its licensed insurance partner or through a partnering with a licensed insurer.  Peterman said they have had discussions with various insurers, reinsurers and consultants who have checked out the InsurePal model and believe that it works.  “Now it’s up to us to prove that it works. We are pretty convinced that this model will be the next big thing,” said Volk.   Future is bright for Insurepal  https://www.carriermanagement.com/features/2018/02/07/175349.htm?bypass=0b9e525e6eb924a4db96f217d467f68d",False

For example, if a person living in central Africa sells a mobile phone to someone in Albania on eBay, eBay acts as a third-party guarantor of the transaction. Using InsurePal, however, any two parties could do business together without an intermediary like eBay, as long as the transaction is insured and they have social proofed endorsements and a Social Proof Trust Score. Then, instead of eBay, their local insurers, insuring their liability, would act as guarantors for the transaction.  InsurePal’s blockchain business transactions module, using a smart contract, would permit two parties to form an upfront agreement in which they specify the terms and conditions of their transaction, the penalty for breaching a contract, and what to do if a dispute can’t be resolved, according to a commentary on the InsurePal site. Both parties would agree that the final compensation for any breaching of the agreement is a financial compensation up to a maximum fee agreed upon in the contract.  If their contract is breached, insurance pays the penalty partly from an InsurePal insurance pool and partly by collecting deductibles from the endorsers of the party causing the breach, according to a white paper titled “Distributed Social Proof Insurance,” which was authored by Peterman and Volk and is available on the company’s website.  “By insuring the financial compensation of an unrealized deal to the injured party, we will establish trust among all the stakeholders and greatly accelerate the quality and quantity of all future blockchain business transactions,” the white paper said.  This module for blockchain business transactions insurance will be available in six to nine months, Peterman and Volk affirmed.    Amazing!",False
583,msg29926818,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2495721.0,,12136,Announcements (Altcoins),2018-02-09 12:44:35,GT-RR,Member,257,10,,[ANN] [IPL] InsurePal | Distributed social proof insurance,"Social Proofing Explained  Volk explained how social proofing would work in auto insurance, which is the first product the company will offer with partner insurers in the U.K. To illustrate the concept, he described a responsible driver named John who pays $1,000 every year for his car insurance, despite the fact that he has not had any at-fault accidents in years.  On the other hand, InsurePal could provide John with a much better deal, reducing his premium by $400, as long as he can get a friend or family member—an endorser—to vouch for his good driving record.  When John gets his friend Mary to be his endorser, she immediately receives an upfront reward of $100 worth of InsurePal tokens (IPL tokens), which can be instantly sold for cash on the token exchange where IPL is listed or invested in InsurePal services. The InsurePal website describes the IPL token as “the fuel of InsurePal platform, used by clients and third parties worldwide.” (See below for more detail on IPL tokens.)  In this model, Mary gets an immediate bonus while John ends up with a cheaper premium. For her participation in the deal, Mary must assume limited financial responsibility for a third-party deductible—in this case $550—if John files an at-fault claim.  “We want to partner with traditional insurance companies and provide them with a tool to do a better risk selection with our innovation: the social proof.” Tom Volk, InsurePal The insurer, using the InsurePal platform, will only deduct the $550 from Mary’s credit card if there is an at-fault claim. “To be John’s endorser, Mary has to be pretty sure that she is endorsing a diligent and responsible person, otherwise she will be losing money,” said Volk.  Volk noted that this third-party deductible is similar to a co-signed loan in banking, when parents co-sign loans for their children. With the InsurePal concept, however, the co-signee is only exposed to the limit of the deductible, rather than the full amount of the insurance liability.  Volk explained that the $550 charge is calculated from the $400 that John saved, Mary’s $100 worth of IPL tokens and a $50 penalty. The excess above that amount is covered by the insurer, Volk continued.  How is the premium determined? InsurePal will, based on the pricelist submitted by the insurer, do a classical calculation of the price quotation, just as insurance companies do every day for traditional motor insurance. “Then, we undercut the price with the social proof,” Volk said.  If John can get two people to vouch for him, he will save even more money on his annual auto premiums because he is more trustworthy than someone else who has no endorsers, said Volk.  “If your friends trust you, we trust you,” he said, repeating one of InsurePal’s catch phrases, used in its marketing.  Further, Mary and John can adjust the amount of the deductible. “Mary can say, ‘Yes, I trust John, but I don’t want to take a $550 exposure; I’ll take a $100 exposure instead,” which Volk explained would reduce John’s premium discount and Mary’s reward in IPL tokens.  In addition to allowing John to find more endorsers to further cut his insurance premium, InsurePal also will accept mutual endorsers, or couples. Mary and John can mutually endorse each other, as an example. The policy due dates don’t need to overlap, Peterman explained.  While InsurePal’s initial focus is on at-fault jurisdictions across the globe, Peterman explained that social proofing still would be effective at reducing premiums in no-fault jurisdictions such as those in 12 U.S. states, but with a smaller overall effect. However, by helping with underwriting and risk assessment, social proofing would help insurers offer a slightly better rate to drivers, he explained.  https://www.carriermanagement.com/features/2018/02/07/175349.htm?bypass=0b9e525e6eb924a4db96f217d467f68d   ",False

And while our product and development team already deploy into the functionality of first social proof module specified for motor car industry, we think of a future much bigger in which social proof will enable many individuals to access and gain benefits across industries hassle free.

We have filed a US and worldwide patent to protect the intellectual property behind social proof methodology as we believe it will be useful not only to insurance but it will be widely applicable to many other industries.   Social proof will provide companies with an objective assessment of an individual and give a comprehensive insight into one`s character. This proof, working as a third-party deductible, will then be recorded and stored into the blockchain ledger, meaning it will be given into the direct ownership of our protocol users. That is why in the future, social proof will be truly versatile and widely applicable, as it will serve as an all-in-one replacement for various expensive, invasive but also ineffective methods of segmentation.  InsurePal social proof network will exponentially expand in order to allow multiple endorsements and mutual recursion, providing the community with a precise insight of who is endorsing who and for how much.  This valuable data will serve us to generate Social Proof Trustscore, a factor that will calculate a real-time average value directly reflecting who is trustworthy to make different transactions and agreements with.

If your friends trust you, we trust you”  Every market has its failures; and insurtech is no different. And one of the most talked about in terms of the UK market has been the demise of peer-to-peer start-up Guevara.  Not to be put off though, Slovenian-based Insure Pal is not only planning to launch in the P2P space. But it is powered by blockchain platform Ethereum; and raised $18m through a cryptocurrency crowdsale earlier this month.  P2P, blockchain and bitcoin, that is some heady combination.  Don’t worry if you missed out on the the initial coin offering [it sold out in an impressive 80 seconds] Insure Pal notes these ‘IPL tokens’ will soon be listed on several exchanges. Therefore, Insure Pal will start trading almost immediately, giving latecomers the opportunity to buy them.  The USP behind Insure Pal is to only accept customers that have been endorsed by family and friends who needs to offer a financial guarantee, like a credit card, on behalf of the policyholder.  Insure Pal believes that form of peer pressure could drive down the risk for the company, and accordingly, the premium.  In terms of going live, Insure Pal CEO and co-founder Matt Peterman claims it has already had talks with several insurers and the UK regulator ahead of a UK motor pilot within six months.  I wonder if the fact the only [re]insurer its follows on Twitter is Munich Re [as of Friday 19th January] might be an indicator of where some of its potential capacity may come from?  Peterman is a veteran of working in insurance and private equity and is currently on the board of detection company Salviol, while his co-founder Tom Volk was involved in insurance IT start-up Adacta.  Among the executive management team are former Neos chief marketing officer Gavin Conway [who is chief growth officer] and the former managing director of Langton Syndicate Management at Lloyd’s, Thomas Manson [chief insurance officer]. Also along for the ride is adviser Damian Arnold who worked for Direct Line for over a decade both in the UK and Italy.",False

Here is a quick recap of our efforts and everything we`ve achieved so far that helped us to reach the set goal of $18 million.  Crowdsale recap InsurePal crowdsale was divided into two distinct phases: Phase 1: Whitelisting-presale This phase began of 10 December 2017 and was closed on 3 January 2018 at 15:00 UTC. InsurePal sold-out all 70% of tokens available. Due the immense growth of Ethereum, we have also proportionally refunded our contributors. Phase 2: Pubic sale The public sale began on January 16 on block: 4918135. We sold-out all the tokens available in 5 blocks, accounting for 80 seconds.  During this time, we gathered a staggering number of supporters. Altogether, 23.834 unique users have been whitelisted, of which 18.750 have also successfully passed the KYC verification process. Due the legislation, members from USA, Canada, China, Singapore and Korea were not able to participate.   Very good article!

They returned some ETH back to us early investors so they still honored that some money could come in crowdsale and it did.  Me personaly am mad that there was even a crowdsale becouse they returned ETH back to me so that they could make a room for crowdsale. This was one of the bect ICOs and project youll ever see.

By ensuring the financial compensation of a breached business agreement to the injured party we will establish the trust among all the stakeholders and greatly accelerate the quality and quantity of all future blockchain business transactions.  Safe drivers can finally stop paying for the mistakes of bad drivers. All you need to do is to find a trusted endorser who will guarantee for your exemplary behavior. This person will also be financially responsible only if you cause damage by your own fault. For making social proof endorsement, your friend will receive an immediate incentive, whereas you`ll end up with a considerable premium discount.  John is a responsible, diligent driver who hasn’t had an accident in years. But, the price of John`s insurance is $1000 per year. He feels bad for overpaying for his mandatory car insurance. He finds out about InsurePal insurance, which offers him an upfront saving of $400 on his car insurance. Everything he needs to do is to find an endorser who will guarantee for his good driving record. He immediately thinks of his friend Mary and sends her an invite, whilst also explaining her the idea behind the new insurance. Mary guarantees for John with a credit card and immediately receives an upfront reward $100 worth of IPL tokens. This token transaction also contains the social proof information. When Mary enters her credit card data, she exposes herself to a potential payment of $550 ($400 of John’s savings, $100 of her cash-back bonus and $50 of penalties). It is important to note that Mary’s credit card will only be charged in case John files an at fault claim within the next year. In other words, if there is no claim, John paid only $600 for his insurance and Mary got $100 of IPL tokens, which she can sell on an exchange and spend or keep as an investment. John can find more endorser to further reduce his insurance price and at the same time promote InsurePal, helping the product to grow virally. And because John understands the benefits of InsurePal, he will also be willing to endorse Mary who is safe driver as well, when her car insurance policy will be due.  Social proof is a form of financial commitment, backing up your credibility with third-party endorsement. As InsurePal social proof network will exponentially expand, it will allow you to give and receive multiple endorsements, providing the community with a valuable Social Proof Trustscore, a real-time average value directly reflecting one`s diligence and business background.  https://insurepal.io/crowdsale",False

When does the crowdsale start? InsurePal crowdsale is set to begin on January 16 at approximately 13:00 UTC. To make sure you are on time, check this interactive time zone map: https://www.timeanddate.com/time/map/. Please, also note the start estimation is not necessarily 100% accurate, as we begin on a block.   All who wish to participate are advised to whitelist as soon as possible as KYC process takes time and spots are getting extremely limited.   The crowdsale will go live once a specific block is reached. We will calculate and publish the block a few hours prior on the day of the crowdsale.   When the crowdsale is LIVE, we will make an official announcement and publish the public wallet address here: https://insurepal.io/crowdsale. We will also livestream the event on our Facebook page.   Who can contribute in the crowdsale? Only those who have successfully passed KYC process will be able to contribute in the crowdsale. Our team is working around the clock to make sure all your requests are handled in due time. However, the demand is increasingly higher. For that, we will be able to provide KYC verification only to those users who will submit the application form by Sunday, 14 January. To those who will sing up later, we cannot guarantee to be processed until the crowdsale begins, but we will certainly do our best.  To whitelist, sign up here: https://insurepal.io/whitelist  Reminder: If your KYC was already approved for the presale, you do not have to do it again. But, it is important and necessary to whitelist your wallet from which you’ll contribute during the crowdsale. The unique addresses that were given to you during the presale are no longer valid in the crowdsale.  Is there a minimum/maximum for the crowdsale participation? No, there is no minimum for the crowdsale contribution, but the amount must be transferable. For each transaction from your wallet, you will need some “gas”, which is the fuel for the Ethereum network, that validates and confirms your transaction. Gas is paid in Ethereum (ETH). In practice, you will need an additional small amount of ETH to send ETH from your wallet. Check https://ethgasstation.info/ for the current status of Ethereum network and sufficient Gas price.  Is there any bonus available in the crowdsale? Yes, there is a 10% bonus for those that will contribute in the first 96 hours and for those that will contribute more than 50 ETH.  Last-minute reminders for our InsurePal community: Double-check the wallet address. Before sending your ETH, please check the wallet address on our subpage and DOUBLE check it by following our live stream.  Do not send ETH before the crowdsale start time. We will disclose the wallet address publicly on January 16. However, you have to wait for the crowdsale to actually begin, before sending in your ETH. Beware of scamming pages. Some shady websites have already tried to scam you. Double check all webpage addresses and watch for spelling mistakes. It is best you save the https://insurepal.io in the taskbar. NEVER click on any links or open any emails that look suspicious.  Do your diligence and know before you invest. We urge you to visit our website and read InsurePal whitepaper in which we laid out the company`s risk and opportunities.  Be aware that ICOs are extremely risky and highly speculative investments. Never invest money that you can’t afford to lose. Make sure you read and understand the Terms & Conditions.",False

The amount of gas depends on the amount of computation required to complete the transaction.  Gas Limit is the maximum amount of gas allotted to the transaction, 21000 being sufficient for simple transfers and much higher amounts for transfers to smart contracts like those in ICOs.  Insufficient gas in the Gas Limit will result in a failed transaction, the fee paid will be lost, but the ether transferred never leaves the wallet since the blockchain was never updated.  Gas Price is the price of each gas unit measured in a fractional amount of ether, typically gwei. Gas price varies, but 20-30 gwei is average as of writing this.  Current Gas Price can be checked online ( Etherscan or EthGasStation ), and the Gas Limit for things other than simple transfers can only be known by looking at the smart contract code or by looking at what the organization behind the ICO / smart contract says is appropriate for their smart contract.  Understanding how gas works is crucial for Ethereum users interested in participating in ICOs, using smart contracts, and even making simple transfers between wallets. In this post, I hope to explain what gas is and how it works. Skip to the end for a simple summary of things. To start off, we need to understand some basics about the Ethereum Virtual Machine.  Ethereum Virtual Machine and Gas The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a major part of the Ethereum ecosystem, but I'll be heavily glossing over this so we can focus on how it relates to gas. In short, the EVM is an environment where arbitrary code of smart contracts and other operations can be executed. Every node in the Ethereum network executes operations within the EVM to ensure redundantly correct execution and relies on consensus to agree on the answer.  All transactions, from simple transfers to ICO smart contracts, require some amount of operations to perform. Each of these operations has an associated cost in gas. Thus, simple transactions like transfers will require less gas to perform than more intense smart contracts.  For example, a simple operation like if(var > 1) may cost 1 gas, but a more complex operation to store a variable could cost 100 gas. The cumulative sum of all the operations is the total gas cost for the transaction.  Gas Limit When on a site like MyEtherWallet, you're going to see a field called Gas Limit. This corresponds the the MAXIMUM amount of gas you are willing to spend on the transaction.  Important to note:  Different types of transactions will require different amounts of gas to complete Providing too little gas will result in a failed transaction, the fees are kept by the miner Extra, unspent gas is refunded automatically What happens if I specify too little gas? Your transaction will start to be executed, but will eventually run out of gas and be stopped. When this happens, you will not get back ether spend on the gas used, but since the transaction did not complete, the blockchain does not reflect a transfer, so the main funds essentially never left the wallet.  So I should always specify a large gas limit since I'll be refunded? No. The minimum gas limit for transaction is 21000 + the amount to execute any fallback functions if it's sent to a contract, but the actual blocks also have a gas limit that specifies the maximum amount of gas all transactions in the block can consume. This is comparable to Bitcoin's block size in bytes, but ether miners have the option to increase or decrease the gas limit of blocks so that they are propagated quickly. You cannot exceed this amount if you wish for your transaction to be processed. Also, miners only get paid for the actual gas consumed by a transaction, so putting a high value for the gas limit fills up the block gas limit, but isn't computationally-dense enough for miners to want.  Gas Price Gas price is the amount of ether you are willing to spend on every unit of gas. Yes, you determine the price of gas AND maximum amount of gas you want to spend on performing a transaction on the Ethereum network. Although gas limit is just a simple quantity, gas price is measured in ether (specifically some amount of wei, usually gwei). The value of gas is driven by the market and the nodes that prioritize higher gas prices when mining transactions. The current gas price can be seen on Etherscan or EthGasStation. As I mentioned, gas price is usually some amount of gwei.",False

So here is my question  My whitelist was accepted before the presale. I now want to participate in the crowdsale.  Can you confirm the below are the right steps I should follow:  - Transfer ETH to my wallet on MyEtherWallet - this is also the ""refund address"" given during the KYC subscription. - On the 16th of January, 1pm UTC, a ""public"" address will be provided by InsurePal on www.insurepal.io/crowdsale - Transfer my ETHs from MyEtherWallet to that public address.  Other questions:  1) After I send the ETH, what will be your criteria to identify that is ""me"" who send you the ETH? Is it based on th wallet address? How can I double check if the wallet address I gave before the presale is good?  2) The whitelist approval.  Reminder: If your KYC was already approved for the presale, you do not have to do it again. But, it is important and necessary to whitelist your wallet from which you’ll contribute during the crowdsale. The unique addresses that were given to you during the presale are no longer valid in the crowdsale.   If I received this email:  ""InsurePal KYC Status: Your KYC is approved!"" After reviewing your whitelisting submission, we confirm you have successfully completed the identify verification process. YOUR KYC STATUS: APPROVED  Does it mean my ""WALLET"" was approved? Or is it about my account?  3) The account.  Is there a way to log in to insurepal and see my contribution status after the crowdsale? If not, will I receive an email confirmation with the amount indicated? How long after te crowdsale will the IPL be available on exchanges? On what exchanges?  Thanks for your help.",False

This has caused us to exceed the pre-sale hard-cap set on $12,6 million. As a consequence, the surplus of funds will be proportionally returned to all pres-ale contributors.   In total, we are raising $18 million of seed capital. Of 300,000,000 IPL tokens issued, there are 201,000,000 IPL available in the token sale in the following manner: - Pre-sale: 70% (140,700,000 IPL) - Crowdsale: 30% (60,300,000 IPL)   The growth of Ethereum affects presale contributions In the whitelisting pre-sale, we aimed for $12,6 million and sold-out all 70% of IPL tokens available (with an additional 10% bonus included). Our pre-sale contributors have contributed with Ethereum, whereas InsurePal pre-sale and crowdsale hard-caps are defined and limited with USD dollar. Since we began with the whitelisting process, the crypto marketplace has witnessed a tremendous growth of Ethereum. As a consequence, the contributions made in pre-sale have surpassed the initial pre-sale hard-cap goal.  All presale contributors will be proportionally refunded We have considered a number of options for returning the surplus of funds invested and decided the best way is to use the method of “hair-cut”, meaning we`ll return them proportionally to each and every presale contributor.  Doing so, we will achieve two important advantages:  - All pre-sale contributors, regardless of their input, will receive an unchanged amount of IPL tokens  - All pre-sale contributors will also be refunded with a proportionate share of Ethereum returned back to their wallet address.  We are convinced that this solution is in the fairest for all of you who believed in our project from the beginning and have shown your support in such a large number. By doing so, you will not only get your IPL tokens, but also gain on the extra Ethereum.  The process of returning funds to early contributors will be initiated on January 16.  Last-minute Crowdsale Details InsurePal crowdsale is set to begin on January 16, once a specific block is reached. We will make an official announcement and publish the InsurePal crowdsale public wallet address here: https://insurepal.io/crowdsale. We will livestream the event on our Facebook page, so stay tuned!  Please, also note the start estimation is not necessarily 100% accurate.

We have gathered some of the most frequently asked here. For more, join us on Telegram.  How can I participate in the crowdsale?  If you wish to participate in the crowdsale, you’ll have to get your KYC approved and whitelist a wallet from which you’ll contribute. We urge you to do that immediately on this link: https://insurepal.io/whitelist. All the transactions from non-whitelisted wallets will be bounced and all the contributions from the members who did not complete or their KYC was not approved will be returned.  Is there a minimum for the crowdsale participation?  No, there is no minimum for the crowdsale contribution, but the amount must be transferable. For each transaction from your wallet, either for sending ETH, IPL Tokens or some other Tokens, you will need some “gas”, which is the fuel for the Ethereum network, that validates and confirms your transaction. Gas is paid in Ethereum (ETH). In practice, you will need an additional small amount of ETH to send ETH or IPL from your wallet. In time of network congestions, you should modify Gas price to provide enough fuel for your transaction. Check https://ethgasstation.info/ for the current status of Ethereum network and sufficient Gas price.  Is there any bonus available in the crowdsale?  Yes, there is a 10% bonus for those that will contribute in the first 96 hours and for those that will contribute more than 50 ETH.  I have my KYC approved for the presale, do I have to do it again for the crowdsale?  If your KYC was approved for the presale, you do not have to do it again for crowdsale. But, it is important and necessary to whitelist your wallet from which you’ll contribute during the crowdsale. The unique addresses that were given to you during the presale are no longer valid in the crowdsale.  How many IPL tokens will I get for 1 ETH?  The ETH price will be locked on 16th January, just a few hours before the crowdsale. This price will be applied for the presale and for the crowdsale.  My KYC is approved, but presale is closed. Can I send my ETH now or do I have to wait for January 16th crowdsale?  No, you cannot send your ETH right now. As all contributors, you’ll have to wait for the January 16th when the public crowdsale starts. We will announce the block with which the crowdsale will start and the contribution address on this link: https://insurepal.io/crowdsale .  We warn you: beware of the phishing attempts! Always make sure that you are visiting InsurePal official site (www.insurepal.io). To avoid scams, we advise you to add the website address in your bookmarks. Make sure that you are well informed about the start and end of the crowdsale. And if the offer is too good to be true — it usually is!

Major steps for your safe investment: Open a private Ethereum Wallet Acquire Ethereum Transact Ethereum to your private Ethereum Wallet Register and pass the KYC process Contribute If you already have fulfilled any of these steps (when investing in cryptocurrencies before), you of course just do remaining steps to closeup the investment.  Disclaimer: All instructions and steps are based on best practices on security and ease of use. There are several other approaches and solutions, that are not appropriate for users without advanced knowledge on the blockchain technology and software.  Whitelist pre-sale and Crowdsale features and warnings ONLY Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency will be accepted in contributions.  In order to acquire IPL Tokens on Whitelist pre-sale or Crowdsale, you will be able to contribute Ethereum Cryptocurrency only. Sending other cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin — BTC, Litecoin — LTC etc.) at the process of contributing will result in a permanent loss due to technical limitations of the process.  WARNING: Use PRIVATE Ethereum wallets for contributing, NOT Online Exchange accounts.  Please do NOT send Ethereum from Online Exchanges (Bitstamp, Kraken, Bittrex, Livecoin, Bitfinex etc.). Each of Ethereum addresses at Online exchanges are specially dedicated for only one cryptocurrency (e.g. Ethereum) and are unable to handle issued IPL Tokens. Sending Ethereum directly from Online Exchange account will most probably result in a permanent loss of your IPL Tokens or at least months of negotiating with Online Exchange’s Support.  Create and contribute from your own, private, ERC-20 compatible, Ethereum wallet. There are several ways to create your own wallet, we will describe some in later steps.  Phases are time limited Contributions in Ethereum will only be accepted in certain time frames, that will be publicly announced on our webpage and social media. Please be sure not to miss your opportunity to contribute due to preparation process. Be aware that some steps can be time consuming, for example:  verification (if needed) on the Online Exchange (up to 2 weeks), bank transfers (2–5 working days), confirmation of your KYC personal data (depends on the amount of applications). STEP 1: Open a private Ethereum wallet There are several ways to open your private Ethereum wallet. What does it mean that it is “private”? It means, that you have the access to your private key, a string of numbers and letters, that must always stay secured — never share it with anyone. For security reasons, these private keys are often additionally encrypted with your own password.  General (most common) Ethereum wallet use-cases:  keystore file (UTC/JSON) + password, generated on MyEtherWallet.com web page and saved on several secured locations (recommended option), full node, desktop software solutions — Mist, Parity. Wallet synchronization can take up to several days. (good choice for advanced users), hardware wallets, such as Trezor and Ledger, that will keep your private keys secured (advanced use-case, recommended for increased security) and metamask for usage in browsers (for advanced users only). Creating private Ethereum wallet with MyEtherWallet.com We will describe the most common use case: Opening a private Ethereum wallet with myetherwallet.com If you already have an ERC-20 compatible wallet, please go directly to Step №2 below. If you do not have it yet, please read the instructions below in every detail.  WARNING: When using myetherwallet.com in your browser, always check, if you are on a legit website. Never click on links on other webpages or in mails, that can lead you to malicious phishing websites, that are perfect copies of original site. Using these malicious sites you will reveal your wallet (keystore & password) to hackers, that will irreversibly take all your funds from your wallet! You must see a proper address and certificate:   IMPORTANT: myetherwallet.com site operates offline and will only propagate signed transactions to Ethereum blockchain. Be sure that a computer which you use to open this website through a browser, is properly secured with a firewall and an antivirus software.  To open/generate a wallet on MyEtherWallet, please visit https://www.myetherwallet.com/ and choose a strong password (e.g. not less than 15 characters long, consisted at least from one lowercase, one uppercase, one numeric sign). Choose the “Create New Wallet” button to confirm.  more is here with pictures  https://medium.com/insurepal-blog/full-step-by-step-guide-for-contributing-on-insurepal-whitelist-pre-sale-and-crowdsale-6d6e880c80b0",False

The IPL tokens issued by Insurepal can be used to:  Insure blockchain business transactions– Fees and incentives for endorsers will be paid in IPL tokens.  Credit and social proof score– Social proof endorsers can make a guarantee with either a credit card or smart contract. When several endorsers guarantee the same person, their credit score will proportionally increase in value.  Award Insurance Premium Bonuses – By uploading a copy of their existing insurance policy, clients can receive rewards in tokens. This premium will grow more valuable with the number of endorsements a client receives.  Pay Incentives– Endorsers will also receive incentives for guaranteeing other users in IPL tokens (or fiat currency). Endorsers will then be able to sell their tokens or speculate and wait for a higher market value. They can of course also use these tokens to buy or renew insurance policies in the future or even to pay for services at shops that accept IPL.  Prove social identity– IPL token-holders will be able to identify themselves with the Insurepal community. Eventually, users will be able to sell their own social proof guarantee completely anonymously to receive both the guarantee and a proportionate share of their insurance premium.  Adjust claims – Insurepal’s tokens will also be used to process claims, and where necessary, make adjustments. The community will decide, in other words, on the basis of smart contracts held on the chain, what the settlement will be. Insurance companies no longer have to be involved.",False

Matt Peterman has more than 15 years of experience in insurance business and venture capitals. Currently he is the executive and business developer at Salviol Ltd. Tom Volk is the founder of Adacta Group. Aside from the two co-founders, the project also lists 8 managers and a group of 9 advisors. The latter serve as the primary source of blockchain experience for the project.   Idea & Token Functions Although the effects of blockchain on the financial field have been noted repeatedly, and the potential is on the way to realization through various projects, the field of insurance by contrast has been somewhat less explored. This is precisely the direction of InsurePal’s work. Not only does the project promise to bring changes into traditional insurance business, but also to support the insurance in new fields emerging with the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. It’s easy to see the potential of creating a more transparent system that also loses the need for expensive middlemen. The platform’s ERC-20 token, titled IPL, is a utility-token used for identification and tokenization of insurance assets, as well as digitizing associated records on a distributed ledger. The token supports a number of functions, including:  Insurance of blockchain business transactions; Premium insurance discounts; Social proof identity; Claims adjustment.  Summary  In general the community seems to have a great interest in InsurePal. This is evident based on the project’s very successful presale. We expect InsurePal will be able to raise the rest of the required funds during crowdsale with relative ease. InsurePal have also patented the application of social proof to insurance, although one has to remember that this model has not yet fully demonstrated itself in action. We do like the fact that potentially more affordable insurance and the implementation of modern technologies may attract clients who until now have not been likely to insure.   We are keeping an eye on the project and awaiting further developments!",False

Using a blockchain structure, and utilizing the unique capabilities of a decentralized trustless network, InsurePal aims to help identify a global community of low-risk clients. Utilizing “social proof” recommendations, users will be able to lower their insurance costs and earn money by referring and guaranteeing other users.  This will create a win-win for both customers and firms. Insurers will be able to dramatically cut costs of compliance and claims adjustment by identifying lower risk customers. And consumers will be able to earn money in the form of rewards and lowered premiums by financially underwriting the people they recommend.  We recently sat down with Matt Peterman, the CEO of InsurePal to have a chat with him about the project as well as finding out his thoughts and insights.  On the other hand, InsurePal’s co-founder Tom Volk is also a co-founder of company ADACTA, a leading European vendor for insurance core software, generating $25million revenue and employing 450 people in Ljubljana, Zagreb, Belgrade, Moscow, Brno and London.  As we have known each other for a long time, we decided to cooperate on finding an effective and agile solution for the insurance industry which is stubbornly resisting to change. We´ve designed an accurate mathematical model, calibrated on a real motor market data which proved us that the top 1% of the safest drivers overpay their insurance for a whopping 80% and the top 10% overpay for 70%. All this data served us as a confirmation that it`s time for a change, which we started with InsurePal social proof insurance on blockchain.  https://www.chipin.com/insurepal-ceo-matt-peterman-interview/",False

Which element came first, Insurance or Blockchain? And how do you intend to ramp it up? Blockchain is more than a technology. It comes with a premise we can do business differently, more transparently and most of all, fairer to the end-customers. It enables the emergence of new peer-to-peer services which connect customers through smart contracts without the control of a centralized institution. For that reason, it also gives them back the power to manage their own data and assets. In the case of InsurePal, the insurance part came first. But, when we thought of the appropriate solution for the implementation of social proofing, blockchain seemed a perfect fit. Several recent successful projects in the blockchain space confirmed this is the right way of ramping up products and, we also have some “secret ingredients” to speed up the process itself.

We have gathered some of the most frequently asked here. For more, join us on Telegram.  How can I participate in the crowdsale?  If you wish to participate in the crowdsale, you’ll have to get your KYC approved and whitelist a wallet from which you’ll contribute. We urge you to do that immediately on this link: https://insurepal.io/whitelist. All the transactions from non-whitelisted wallets will be bounced and all the contributions from the members who did not complete or their KYC was not approved will be returned.  Is there a minimum for the crowdsale participation?  No, there is no minimum for the crowdsale contribution, but the amount must be transferable. For each transaction from your wallet, either for sending ETH, IPL Tokens or some other Tokens, you will need some “gas”, which is the fuel for the Ethereum network, that validates and confirms your transaction. Gas is paid in Ethereum (ETH). In practice, you will need an additional small amount of ETH to send ETH or IPL from your wallet. In time of network congestions, you should modify Gas price to provide enough fuel for your transaction. Check https://ethgasstation.info/ for the current status of Ethereum network and sufficient Gas price.  Is there any bonus available in the crowdsale?  Yes, there is a 10% bonus for those that will contribute in the first 96 hours and for those that will contribute more than 50 ETH.  I have my KYC approved for the presale, do I have to do it again for the crowdsale?  If your KYC was approved for the presale, you do not have to do it again for crowdsale. But, it is important and necessary to whitelist your wallet from which you’ll contribute during the crowdsale. The unique addresses that were given to you during the presale are no longer valid in the crowdsale.  How many IPL tokens will I get for 1 ETH?  The ETH price will be locked on 16th January, just a few hours before the crowdsale. This price will be applied for the presale and for the crowdsale.  My KYC is approved, but presale is closed. Can I send my ETH now or do I have to wait for January 16th crowdsale?  No, you cannot send your ETH right now. As all contributors, you’ll have to wait for the January 16th when the public crowdsale starts. We will announce the block with which the crowdsale will start and the contribution address on this link: https://insurepal.io/crowdsale .  We warn you: beware of the phishing attempts! Always make sure that you are visiting InsurePal official site (www.insurepal.io). To avoid scams, we advise you to add the website address in your bookmarks. Make sure that you are well informed about the start and end of the crowdsale. And if the offer is too good to be true — it usually is!

To change this narrative, internet came as a first big breakthrough, making information widely available, and consequently allowing us to speak-up and engage in conversation with the companies.  Blockchain is the next big thing as its true benefit doesn’t come from high earnings, as one might assume. In reality, its long-term value is reflected in the revolutionary paradigm of decentralization that empowers individuals and restores back our dignity. Now, we really are at a junction of how our future might look like.  We`re witnessing the rise of peer-to-peer organizations who have made it their priority to listen to the end-users and above all, adapting to their needs. We all know that payment for a certain service is necessary and do not object to that. But, as consumers, we wish the price of that service reflects its real value and is most of all, tailored to our personal needs.  But, insurance companies haven’t made that transition yet: either because they are too big, too traditional or just subjected to too many challenging regulations. They still spend the most money on expensive and extremely invasive methods through which they segment their customers, so they can bill them more.  The reason is perfectly illustrated in this statement:  “There is no longer any anonymity on the Web — unless we mandate it. The most personal information about your online habits is collected, bought and sold, often instantaneously and invisibly. Data collection is a business driven by profits at consumers’ expense.” Therefore, their objective is to turn data into information, providing them with the best insight on your interests and personal behavior.  In the now, many insurtech are already challenging this rigid structure. However, InsurePal is the first industry startup fully harnessing the power of blockchain. We have decided to look on the insurance differently and put ourselves in customers` shoes.  Why should only insurances profit with our personal insight? And how can we make the process beneficent for all? The answer is social proofing. It is perhaps the most innovative model of risk selection and, when put on blockchain, it makes the need for a centralized institution redundant.

The social proof will be gained by receiving or giving endorsements and will also be applicable to having more than one endorses. As each new endorser also has their own social proof network, a hierarchical social proof virtual network will soon establish.  “Data is precious and will last longer than the systems themselves”, Tim Berners Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web once said. In other words, digitalization made it happen that our own data are the most intimate (and therefore growingly valuable) data we possess. The tokenizing will allow InsurePal to uniquely identify insurance assets, whereas you will be able to transfer the information to other types of business via a digital record. This is how you as consumer will finally be able to enter into a dialogue in an equivalent position when engaging with companies. And in return, to actually make a profit when exchanging your social proof information to them.

His rich entrepreneur experience in managing crypto and non-crypto companies will serve as an important guidance to developing InsurePal social proof platform for mass adoption.  InsurePal is set to revolutionize the insurance industry by harnessing blockchain technology and merging it with social proofing, bringing cost reduction and a positive societal impact. The startup company is the voice of change that promises to bring disruption to the old insurance paradigm by challenging its sole core. To help us in navigating the challenges and direct the platform development in the direction envisioned, it is crucial to work with individuals and visionaries who possess a unique knowledge and insights from comprehensive areas.  Blockchain advancement, Adoption and User-Centricity as Key Strategic Points As a Bitcoin pioneer, a social economist, digital currency trader, and ultimate crypto insider, Charlie Shrem is at the epicenter of the crypto universe. He has advised more than a dozen digital currency companies and launched and managed numerous partnerships between crypto and non-crypto enterprises.  He recently founded Crypto IQ, a media and advisory business with a team of seasoned Wall Street veterans that aims to simplify the crypto world and bring virtual currencies mainstream. InsurePal works on a similar premise and aims at wider acceptance of the crypto economy by fortifying new insurance services on the blockchain.  “I’m excited to join the advisory team on this project, and our company, Crypto IQ, is getting involved as well,” Shrem said. “InsurePal is a very interesting concept, and I like to get involved in blockchain projects that are not finance-related. This team has its past success. It has been involved with other companies and has performed well. I believe we can be the bridge between crypto and non-crypto insurance, which will be a very interesting thing.” In taking an advisory role, Charlie Shrem will help InsurePal become a bridge between tradition and innovation that will shape the insurance industry moving forward. With his connections, business insights and interdisciplinary experience, he is one of the most well-known names in the cryptocurrency community and will help InsurePal achieve and exceed its goal of developing a technologically advanced blockchain platform that is easy-to-use for the widest audience.  “InsurePal will bring this innovative concept of social proof and blockchain insurance to the people who have yet to be involved in crypto and provide an insurance solution for them,” Shrem said. “That is the most interesting part of it.” Vision, Experience and Industry Know-How Crucial For InsurePal’s Long-Term Success The dedicated experts at InsurePal have lived for the project since day one. Our efforts have been recognized by many individuals, who are respected in the industry as well as principals at established blockchain startups, among them Mattereum and Hive. The team also recently welcomed Peter M. Moricz, founder and CEO at Moricz.io, in an effort to build strategic partnerships and give its endeavors credibility. This will ensure the long-term success of the InsurePal platform.  “I think we all have to understand this is the beginning of the long process,” Moricz said. “InsurepPal is building something from the “get go” to make sure that people can see what opportunities are out there. And I think that people should come along, join their team and ICO to make sure it works out in the long run, as it is a great ride to be on.” Charlie Shrem and Crypto.IQ join a well-rounded team of experts, partnering on projects that will harness the power of social proofing on the blockchain and help InsurePal lead the way to a different future for the insurance industry. The public is invited to help make this vision reality by participating in a public token crowd sale, beginning Jan. 16.

InsurePal uses the ethereum blockchain as a platform for transactions. It claims to offer lower premiums for customers that are able to gain “social proof” endorsements, a system where friends can vouch for each other’s driving with a financial commitment, such as credit card details, as a guarantee.  Guarantors are then rewarded with tokens that can be used for their own discounts, sold or kept as an investment.

It`s about social proof insurance returning power from insurance institutions back to an individual user. It is also about insuring assets and arrangements that have so far not yet been covered. It`s about making insurance work for you!   That is why we are counting: the moments until the New Year and those that separate us to reach our ultimate goal. January 16, the date of InsurePal token crowdsale, is approaching fast and our team can hardly wait to put things in motion.   We are incredibly proud of the growing number of supporters; positive media mentions and respected industry experts who decided to publicly support InsurePal. All of you have made it possible for us to achieve an exceptional milestone already now: we reached Soft Cap of $5 million right before New Year`s. This incredible achievement confirms strong interest from all over the world and serves as even greater motivation.   Our ambition is high and we believe the 70% of IPL tokens will be sold before the public token crowdsale. That is why we invite you to claim your share and receive 10% bonus by contributing in the pre-sale whitelist which is open only by 8 January.   InsurePal surely enters the 2018 year full of optimism and dedication to make social proof insurance on blockchain a reality. We sincerely thank you for all the support and wish you all the best.

InsurePal is making important strategic partnerships already today to build the three basic pillars of future business represented by blockchain ID, arbitrage and insurance. They will help grow confidence among all the stakeholders and massively speed up the business operations on the blockchain.  InsurePal platform use different incentives InsurePal platform will use different means to motivate participants. Discount conversion to tokens will be incentivized, therefore InsurePal will have to convert significant percentage of each new premium into IPL tokens and give them back to the policyholders and their endorsers. All third-parties selling their social proof insurance will also be obliged to use IPL tokens and trade them on exchanges.  IPL tokens will be used  FOR INSURANCE OF BLOCKCHAIN BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS This type of insurance will be conducted in IPL tokens solely. The incentives for the endorsers will be paid in IPL tokens as well, whereas their guarantee can be done with other means as well. All fees coming from the side of possible participating insurance companies and other third-parties will have to be paid with IPL tokens too.  AS AN INSURANCE PREMIUM BONUS To obtain new insurance, the insured will have to upload a photo of their existing insurance policy so that InsurePal can calculate a discount. Doing so, every client will receive a specific number of IPL token (20% less for a cash discount), growing proportionally with the number of endorsements received.  AS AN UPFRONT INCENTIVE For each new social proof guarantee, the endorser will receive an incentive in local fiat currency or in IPL tokens. The endorser will be able to sell the IPL tokens immediately, speculate and wait for an even higher market value or save them to buy/renew their insurance policy in the future or to pay some services at shops where they will accept IPL.  AS CREDIT SCORE AND SOCIAL PROOF SCORE Social proof endorsers will be able to make the guarantee with the credit card or via a smart contract. Their social proof guarantee will consist of relevant information on the client (the insurance holder) and will serve to them as a credit report. If several endorsers will guarantee for the same person, their credit score will proportionally increase in value. In parallel to token transactions, these information will be stored in the general ledger being partially encrypted and partially public. The encrypted part will only be disclosed publically if its holder approves.  AS A SOCIAL PROOF IDENTITY The clients holding IPL will be able to identify themselves within the InsurePal Community. In the long run, they will be able to sell their own social proof guarantee without revealing their identity to institutions or reinsurers in order to get the guarantee and a proportionate share of their insurance premium.  AS CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT In the future, the InsurePal may appoint some members of their InsurePal community to process and report on the claims, a service that will have a financial incentive. Claims which will go beyond an agreed threshold (exact amount to be decided) will be decided by professional claims adjusters who will report their recommendations to InsurePal before informing the client. In essence, there will be no need for an insurance company involvement as everything will be settled by the community on the bases of blockchain and smart contracts.

Insurance left the door open for disruption, which is happening right now. Their vanity has resulted in biggest challenges the insurance industry is facing today: poor risk management based on bad market segmentation which they are trying to overcome with the use of expensive privacy invading technological solutions and tracking methods. And their size prevents agile response to the needs of the evolving market, rising needs of modern consumers and their expectations.  Driving forces of business today have the potential to build tomorrow’s society based on trust and transparency. Technology as the key component of that future enables new approaches to social contracts and is disrupting all industries, from medicine to governmental services, from automotive industry to farming. InsurePal aims to be among the early adopters of blockchain technology in insurtech, to offer modern insurance at an affordable price by leveraging the habits and needs of the future generations and bringing personal data back from insurance company to users.  InsurePal Uses What is Good and Improves What Is Not  We believe that future society will be successful only if we share common values, such as responsibility and reciprocity. Through the concept of social proof insurance, we are able to impact not only insurance industry, but also other industries that strive to make our common future more healthy and prosperous.  Our idea is to offer a significantly lower premium to all insureds that get a proof of trust from one or more people. All actions generate a certain amount of information reflected in the Social Proof Trustscore, factor that tells if a person can be trusted or not and to what extent. Use of social proof will allow non-invasive information gathering to improve the current system, since information is held by you and only you have the key to pass it on.  Social proof hits the eye of existing insurance challenges — namely the fraudulent claims, which are causing huge costs to insurers as in some cases 1% of fraud claims makes for 10% of all claims costs. With diligent individuals who act responsibly to themselves, their trustees and the society as a whole. With responsible individuals who look after each other, the social proof psychology will improve the safety of our neighborhoods, streets and cities we live in.  Where is insurance today?  For the most part, it is where is has always been. In the hands of heavy centralized players, who dictate the terms of service, from package content to premiums. Insurtech today is trying to implement new technologies into existing pools of insurance packages, scratching only the surface of insurance industry. Underwriting of insurance consumers relies heavily on user data, sophisticated analytics and complex centralized systems.  Insurtech has been challenging the existing models for a few years now, and the incumbent market has started reacting just recently. This rigidness has caused emergence of insurtech companies, that are counted in thousands already and I am sure 2018 is going to be a breaking year for the industry.  Why do we need insurance of tomorrow?  InsurePal aims to change and improve the current conditions of insurance. On one hand, it gives the leverage to lower the prices to users and on the other hand, it also gives privacy back to users.  Why do we need insurance of tomorrow?  InsurePal aims to change and improve the current conditions of insurance. On one hand, it gives the leverage to lower the prices to users and on the other hand, it also gives privacy back to users.   The approach of InsurePal’s social proof mechanism delivers services one step beyond of merely insurance services. It impacts the individual responsibility and has the implications to improve human behavior within society. It empowers individuals to take on responsibility for their actions and rewards them for fair play.  The P2P (peer-to-peer) model which can best leverage blockchain revolution when it becomes widely adopted, enables our generation to experience new forms of insurance adjusted to the needs of today, our modern lifestyle and heavy use of new technology. It is also our non-invasive answer to the semi-digital transformation that the incumbents first adopted in forms of expensive, privacy invasive electronic ware (telematics, wearables, IoT) to improve segment information for improved risk assessment.",False

Insurance of tomorrow InsurePal aims to become a first-of-a-kind blockchain-based decentralized insurance platform powered by social proof guarantee. InsurePal is a next generation of peer-to-peer insurance based on social proof endorsements, fully harnessing the power of blockchain innovation. It will serve as a replacement for insurances as we know and offer a completely new type of coverage for areas of life and business that began to emerge with the evolution of blockchain and transactions being carried out on the distributed ledger.  2. The science of social proof Social proof is a natural, in-built mechanism within all of us, representing people`s moral compass. In other words, people reference the behavior of others to guide their own behavior. InsurePal embeds social proof in a form of financial commitment. The endorser who financially guarantees for someone has to use its own due diligence when providing the guarantee to at the risk of losing their money. Through such endorsements and guarantees, the network in whole becomes more risk aware, consequently inducing a change of people’s behavior.  3. Worldwide patent This is the first time we have successfully reinvented the social proof for insurance industry. The innovative approach has been filed for patent protection in US and worldwide.

It's also a huge plus that endorsers will only get charged in case the person will file a fault claim so if they ended up not filing a fault claim then you can get tokens that's worth $100 for free so as an endorser and that's a huge benefit.

Also this is very nice article to understand better   The secret behind InsurePal`s disruptive model Isn`t insurance supposed to help people overcome their distress? Years of working in the industry proved me the opposite. I witnessed the rise of insurance prices and the reduction of benefits to the good clients on the one hand, as well as numerous frauds and mischief on the other. This is when I became intrigued: what has happened to the integral values and how could we get insurance back on track?  Insurance is as old as society itself. Through evolution of social systems, it became more and more complex. And complexity also brings different levels of categorization of insured parties, which are currently very unfair. Young and good drivers, for example, have an unfair disadvantage, just because of their youth. They pay full and expensive premiums, in other words: they pay for the mistakes of bad drivers.  Tom (InsurePal co-founder) and I spent almost three years developing the idea that could change and disrupt the old stubborn insurance goliath. We both share the belief the insurance should be fairer and much more affordable than today. Even more, it should play on our personal responsibility and award the behavioral patterns that benefit us all. That is why we are developing InsurePal platform on blockchain technologies that can fully support our idea, our view for the future and bring them to life.  Through social proof even new drivers can get more affordable premiums, because their friends and family guarantee for them. Who knows best what kind of driver are you? Friends and family, of course. And it’s not only for the drivers. The application of InsurePal platform can and will extend to any insurance product, mainly to those are not even yet invented.  “Social proof is something we witness every day. Each time we believe, buy or support something, we (usually) do it because we trust others who support the idea too. Every time we make a conscious choice about where to eat, we (subconsciously) choose the place with the best reviews. Trust is the key word.”  Think about it. Trust plays an integral role when making a arrangement or business transaction, even more on blockchain where the identity is mainly unknown. Can you imagine the boost this will do to the arising new economy? All that, combined with the transparency of blockchain can and will have an enormous impact on society and the way we conduct business. And as more participants engage in projects based on blockchain transactions, the more need for cryptocurrency there will be.  Scaling blockchain solutions and exchanging cryptocurrencies will boost the growth of crypto economy and our hopes and bets are up high. We aim to be a recognizable partner in an enormous insurance business and we invite you to join our journey. It is time we change the perception of dull insurance into something exciting, with new features and possibilities. It is time we engage our extensive experience in insurance and deliver a first-of-a-kind distributed insurance platform powered by social proof guarantee.  There is no better time to be alive and develop amazing ideas on this new technology. It is time we do our part and bring insurance to new demographic.

Harnessing the power of blockchain, they introduce a completely new model of risk selection, guided by the science of social proof. In other words, their network uses peer-to-peer endorsements to improve segmentation, lower premium costs and offer incentives to their users.  Insurance is one of the sectors that are not usually a part of blockchain discussion. One of the reasons is the industry is so tightly regulated that not many businesses can compete, as they have to undergo severe legal and financial procedures to prove their models` sustainability. The other is its organizational structure, as it is an industry controlled by big corporations with a rigid structure, meaning the entry point is extremely high. And the later, but certainly not the least, is the challenge of how to effectively apply blockchain in insurance. It is not easy to come up with a disruptive new insurance structure that can work as an agile self-adjusting platform, store information the ledger, offer cheaper insurance and attract masses, all at the same time.  However, InsurePal is set to do everything mentioned above. The distributed insurance platform has reinvented the science of social proof to work similarly as a third-party deductible in banking. This means that the policyholder will be able to lower the price of his premium with the help of his trusted contacts. In other words, his endorsers also accept financial responsibility in case the policyholder makes at false-claim. The simplest application of social proof would be in motor insurance, as explained in their whitepaper: John`s best friend Mary knows his driving habits and therefore endorses him. For that, she gets an immediate bonus, whilst John ends up with a cheaper premium. If nothing goes wrong, that is pretty much it. However, if John files an at-fault claim, Mary is the one held liable.  Therefore, social proof is peer pressure put to good use: it motivates beneficiary behavioral patterns and changes groups, and even society for better without aggressively invading privacy. And, blockchain`s immutable record is an impeccable way to store the social proof into the ledger. As such, it can serve as an important sign of one`s diligence and can be used to gain benefits across various insurances and even across different industries.  One of the InsurePal`s most exciting use cases is definitely the insurance of blockchain business transactions. The team is convinced this type of insurance will bring in the missing trust among all the stakeholders and serve as an additional boost to the rising decentralized economy. Certainly, the platform also promises many interesting features to incentivize both, the engaged crypto users and those who have not yet meet with the world of crypto.  The InsurePal team is 30 members big, comprised of experienced and renown insurance professionals and blockchain, IT and communications experts with a track record of successful projects; a PoC published on GitHub and, what is rare but very promising, an innovative solution that was filed for patent protection in US and worldwide. For more information, please visit their webpage or read their whitepaper and mark January 16 as the starting day of their crowdsale.  https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/insurance-about-to-make-a-big-jump-into-crypto-world-insurepal-ico-starts-on-january-16   What if ETH prices will reach 1000$ or 1500$?

It will serve as a replacement for insurances as we know and oﬀer a completely new type of coverage for areas of life and business that began to emerge with the evolution of blockchain and transactions being carried out on the distributed ledger.  ▄▄ SOCIAL PROOF  Social proof is an in-built mechanism within all of us, representing people`s moral compass. InsurePal embeds social proof in a form of financial commitment. The endorser who financially guarantees for someone has to use its own due diligence when providing the guarantee to at the risk of losing their money. Through such endorsements, the network in whole becomes more risk aware.  ▄▄ PATENT  This is the first time we have successfully reinvented the social proof for insurance industry. The innovative approach has been filed for patent protection in US and worldwide.  ▄▄ BUILDING THE INTERNET OF INSURANCE  The future of blockchain is identity without authority. The crypto is expanding from digital trading to something that will become a parallel economy, constituting fundamental changes. The mass adaptation of digital currencies of is just around the corner, and the need for blockchain identity and transaction regulation will soon arise. For that, InsurePal is making important strategic partnerships already today to build the three basic pillars of future business that will help grow confidence among trustees and speed up their business operations on the blockchain.   ▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄ INSUREPAL PLATFORM  InsurePal sees the blockchain innovation as an opportunity to improve transparency and outcomes across the entire value chain. The platform will work as a dAPP for B2C customers and as a service for B2B partners that will resell social proof insurance by using InsurePal solution.    B2C InsurePal will provide a customer-centric experience, allowing the users to easily navigate through the process and obtain the most favorable insurance premium via their mobile device dAPP.  B2B The InsurePal platform will act as a glob al provider of various insurance modules based on social proof mechanics. That way all interested third-parties will be able to use the platform as stand-alone providers by paying a predetermined fee.   ▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄ MARKET  We believe the insurance of tomorrow should explore the technological improvements and reestablish the relationship of trust by application of peer-to-peer and mutual markets. Insurance industry is a 7 trillion global market representing a huge opportunity for us to reach our expected target 1 % (70 billion).   ▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄ TEAM  Everyone needs an insurance, that will not change. But, we are dedicated to convert the incremental approaches of the past and invent new ways to make insurance simpler, better and fairer to you.
