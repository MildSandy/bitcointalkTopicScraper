PrizmCore 1.9.18 Changelog.  Source Code - https://github.com/prizmspace/PrizmCore  1. The Big Things  1.1. Enforced SSL encryption - increased privacy and security  When you start PrizmCore for first time with prizm.apiServerHost=0.0.0.0:  - PrizmCore generates self-signed SSL certificate  - There is a ""SSL CERTIFICATE SHA1 FINGERPRINT"" message in your log during first run - note the SHA-1 fingerprint of generated certificate. You can compare this fingerprint to the one shown in the browser. If they are equal you can be sure that there is no man-in-the-middle intercepting your connection.  - PrizmCore enables SSL encryption using this certificate  - to open PrizmCore web interface you have to open https://localhost:9976, not the http:// one  - SSL usage is enforced only if the web interface is expected to be accesible from the outer world  - whenever you want you can set up your own self-signed or trusted SSL certificate inside prizm.properties  - browser will warn you, that ""Your connection is not private"". It is OK for self-signed certificates - encryption is still works as expected, but your browser does not trust such certificate.  - you can disable SSLEnforce by setting prizm.apiServerEnforceSSL to ""false"" in prizm.properties  - most significant thigs the SSL does: encrypts your adminPassword (when using administrative APIs), encrypts passphrases of forging users, increases privacy of Web Interface users, protects from man-in-the-middle attacks  1.2 New API: GetAccountChildren - more info about your account  - response contains direct disciples of given account  - response includes balance, amount and disciples count for every of your disciple  - this is ""HierarchyAPI"" request, so it is available only from localhost by default  - this is not performance-heavy API, so you can open it for outter world  1.3. PrizmCore Web Interface feature ""Disciples""  - you can inspect your disciples, their balances, amount, their own disciples count inside the PrizmCore Web Interface  - feature is based on GetAccountChildren API  - this feature is only accessible from localhost  - if you want to make it available for remote clients, set prizm.allowAPIHierarchyOnlyLocalhost to ""false"" and prizm.allowAPIHierarchyWithoutPassword to ""true"". It is also recommended to add ""GetAccountHierarchy"" to prizm.disabledAPIs to avoid violations  - Feature is available in the side menu for your account, and in ""Disciples"" tab in any account modal window  - Inside ""Disciples"" tab displayed disciples count is limited by 100  1.4. Adaptive validation - blockchain sync is faster then ever  - significantly increases blockchain download speed  - blockchain download speed increases with every downloaded block  - max blockchain download speed is reached approximately after 2000 downloaded blocks  - hard/solid drive read time is decreased  - database lock time decreased  - garbage collector delays decreased  1.5 Blokchain recovery - stable and reliable  - PrizmCore now can recover almost any blockchain files inside prizm_db directory  - PrizmCore now can detect blockchain errors during runtime and fix them automatically  - PrizmCore stability is greatly increased  2. The small things:  - change white background under generated passphrase in PrizmCore Web Interface  - generated passphrases in PrizmCore Web Interface now has 19 words instead of 12  - generated passphrases in PrizmCore Web Interface now starts with ""prizm"" keyword  - generated passphrase entropy bits increased from 128 to 192 bits  - fixed ""sidebar not showing during first logon into PrizmCore Web Interface"" bug  - forbbidden ""GetBlockchainTransaction"" for GENESIS account, because bad guys were overloading nodes with public API by spamming this request, you can inspect latest GENESIS transactions inside it's Account Ledger  - fixed PrizmCore Web Interface translation inaccuracies  - fixed ""Error of 364696 block""  - fixed some garbace collector overhead possibilities  - fixed API ""getParent - activated by PPPP"" error  - fixed PrizmCore hang up during parsing broken transaction bytes  - increased clearness of log messages.  #PRIZM #PZM #PrizmCoin #paramining  Source: http://cwt.top/en/news/2854/prizm-is-now-more-fast-stable-secure-and-detailed",True

But there is not at all any requirement to the computer /machine because it is not like classical mining in pow but in how it is in all pos coins.  The advantage of prizm Coin is that apart from possibility of forging - 1. You can have a node either on the computer or on the remote server. 2. Yes it is possible , I can send you the database in pm on your request, as I‚Äôm not having it in hand with me while writing this post- - Prizm is using unique PARAMINING technology.

This ideology unites people of different countries, different cultures, religions and confession for the sake of one goal - to become free from the domination of world financial corporations.

PRISM is the solution of the CWT Public Movement, the result of the work of a strong international group of programmers. PRISM doesn't have an issuing center and can be used as an absolutely transparent and decentralized payment method. But most importantly, Prizm is devoid of the shortcomings of bitcoin and, as it develops, will become even more decentralized, which excludes the very possibility of seizing power over the system.

Two years ago this piece of work made a lot of noise among economists and made the society take a fresh look at the modern world order, in which everything is subordinated to the interests of corporations, and the propaganda brochures of politicians remained the only refuge of justice. The second edition of The Ideology of CWT completely retained its focus, however, some parts of the book have been updated taking into account recent events, and in addition, the book has a completely new chapter devoted to the advanced cryptocurrency Prizm.[/i    ‚ÄúThe ideology of CWT‚Äù by Alexei Muratov is a pamphlet in the best traditions of this beautiful and undeserved genre that has been forgotten in our days. Like the classics of European literature, the author already in his ‚ÄúForeword‚Äù denotes his subject of criticism and then, in almost 200 pages, mercilessly denounces the world financial corporations that de facto usurped the right to real power. Alexei Muratov, point by point, deals with their crimes and, in the end, equips the readers with an effective tool to combat financial tyranny.  It is rather difficult to determine to which literature the ‚ÄúIdeology of CWT‚Äù, political or economic, refers to? The topic chosen by the author is so complex and multifaceted that there is no unambiguous answer to this question. However, for the reader this circumstance does not represent any problem at all. The ‚ÄúIdeology of CWT‚Äù organically combines features of both political and economic work And could it be otherwise, given that the author talks about a very large amount of money, which in due time was silenced, and in fact bought the political elites around the world.  The process was not rapid but progressive, as a result of which around 100 years ago, humanity came to the conclusion that all the real power in the world is concentrated in the hands of a very small group of people, families of financiers whose representatives are controlling the largest transnational corporations from generation to generation. Their power is built on total control over natural and human resources. People for them are nothing more than a medium for the consumption of goods or functions that ensure the uninterrupted operation for the instruments of production.  It is easy to imagine such a system of legal relations in the form of a pyramid, at the top of which the celestials are located, and at the bottom ‚Äì billions of ordinary people forced to spend their entire life and health on attempts to somehow improve their financial situation, to earn enough money in order to escape poverty .  Alexei Muratov is convinced that this state of affairs is fundamentally unfair. Mankind has been fraudulently imprisoned, the illusion of freedom was created which, in fact, enslaved the humanity even more than the most terrible slave system. The author reasonably argues that while society blindly worships the Golden calf in the form of an American dollar, none of us can consider ourselves truly free. Although, in fact, in the last 50 years (since 1971, since the cancellation of gold security), the dollar is nothing more than a colored paper cut into rectangles, the real value of which at its best is calculated at a few cents.  But Alexei Muratov book ‚ÄúThe Ideology of CWT‚Äù is not just a narrative on a given topic. The author skillfully keeps the reader‚Äôs attention, by periodically suggesting to answer the seemingly simplest questions. Who prints dollars? Who owns the power over the financial system of any country in the world? Why there were no serious discoveries in medicine industry for a long time? Why does the education level fall steadily?  Answers to these and many other questions will cause confusion even for a prepared reader. After all, the release of dollars in circulation is managed by a commercial organization that receives fabulous revenues from the difference in costs of printing the green candlesticks and their nominal value (‚Äúseigniorage‚Äù). The power over any national central bank belongs to the Federal Reserve System, and the medicine and the education respectively have not accidentally switched to treating only the symptoms and to providing just superficial knowledge.  The system is so confident in its abilities that it does not even try to make a secret out of it. What for? The powerful people of this world are convinced that they will cope with any action against themselves. And it should be said that they have reason to believe so:John Kennedy, Charles de Gaulle, Hugo Chavez, Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi‚Äì they all paid very dearly for trying to question the right to dominate the world‚Äôs financial elites.  Does this mean that a fight is meaningless a priori? Of course not. Alexei Muratov is convinced that humanity is simply obliged to fight for a fair resource-oriented economy, but it is necessary to do this very carefully, without causing the anger of the world financial elites for the time being. According to Alexei Muratov, it is possible to turn to an open confrontation only after a large International Public Association is created that represents a real force in the world political arena. The author proposes to unite under the banner of the social movement ‚ÄúChange the World Together‚Äù to his supporters.  So what is proposed as a weapon of fight? Cryptocurrency! Alexei Muratov reasonably believes that the world financial corporations can be weakened only by the complete stop of using the dollar and making payments in cryptocurrencies. The author of the ‚ÄúIdeology of CWT‚Äù says that financial tycoons have already felt a threat from the cryptocurrency and are making effort every day to establish their control over this community. Decentralization and anonymity of Bitcoin can already be referred to in the past tense. Its fate is doomed and other cryptocurrencies out of the TOP100 will repeat Bitcoin‚Äôs fate.  Nevertheless, Alexei Muratov is convinced that in order to save the situation, it is necessary to shift the attention of the crypto community from the overpaid Bitcoin speculators to the cryptocurrency, which can really become a convenient and an anonymous means of payment. What is this currency? The answer to this question is in the new chapter of the book ‚ÄúIdeology of CWT‚Äù, which is called ‚ÄúAdvanced Cryptocurrency Prizm‚Äú. We can say that it was for this chapter that the re-edition of the ‚ÄúIdeology‚Äù has been done. Alexei Muratov analyzes in great detail the disadvantages of Bitcoin, Ethereum and their forks in it, and offers a real alternative in the form of cryptocurrency Prizm. Prizm has no emission center, it is devoid of shortcomings of Bitcoin and will become even more decentralized as it develops. How and through what? Answers to these and many other questions can be received after the publication of the second edition of Alexei Muratov book ‚ÄúThe Ideology of CWT‚Äù. It‚Äôs not a long wait at all.

And the money that was supposed to be spent on flowers, were transferred to the charity Fund ""Life line"".  PRISM community leaders in the region note that in the plans were to hold an action only in the territory of large Sochi, but suddenly the Stavropol region joined in. Representatives of the PRIZM community sponsored the event: all participants received memorable prizes - branded cups with the PRIZM logo.  Now the final stage of the action is in progress. Teachers from the art school will choose 3 winners. Three more prizes from PRIZM will be given to three main winners already this week. It is planned to send to Stavropol a PRIZM representative, who will give to participants memorable prizes and a letter of thanks to the head of the class.    A motor rally was held in the region in order to consolidate a positive image and even more popularize the PRIZM advanced cryptocurrency. PRISM leaders in the region note that the advanced crypto currency is gaining popularity. And now it enjoys active and very serious business support. For PRIZM coins in Sochi, you can buy almost everything from services such as haircut or manicure, to buying real estate. And also very easily you can pay by PRIZM coins in a restaurant or car showroom.    Also in Sochi there was a conference organized by PRISM leaders in the region.  They represented the ""prism-turbo"" program - a project of the regional community, which allows receiving additional partner rewards from the work of the team.  The team from Sochi also reports on the launch of the exchanger with a fixed exchange rate at the level of one dollar. A conference was also held in Abkhazia, which can be called a kind of basic combat training course.

The leaders of CWT Uganda held a coordinating council on the Birth day of Lenin!   ""Lenin believed that the disintegration of the system of money circulation is the best way to destroy the capitalist system. Lenin was absolutely right. There is no more correct and effective way of overthrowing the foundations of the existing social system than the undermining of the monetary system""  JM Keynes    Today, anyone who uses cryptocurrencies has a real opportunity to participate in the emission of the future. This opportunity is double relevant for residents of countries which are in need of development. A fair financial and economic arrangement is especially important for people who are living in similar parts of the world.    On April 22nd, in Uganda, in the ""Javas"" cafe, an off-line meeting of major leaders, who are already developing PRIZM, took place. Crypto experts gathered at the Coordination Council to sum up the results, discuss plans and develop a common strategy for the further development of PRIZM not only in Uganda, but also in other countries.  In general, the attention of the gathered crypto experts was on the following topics:     * Sharing methods of the ideological foundations of PRIZM and the principles of the operation of this crypto currency to ordinary users. Regional leaders of PRIZM discussed how to maximize the availability of information on how the PRIZM Crypto currency appeared, how it works, how Crypto currency PRIZM will be used as a convenient and decentralized payment instrument in the future. * Explanation methods of how exactly the crypto currency PRIZM is useful for African society ‚Äì to the local population. Today, most families in Africa face the problem of saving for the future - people are afraid to deal with banks, fearing additional fees. Often, such conditions are real when collection is up to 200% of the deposit amount - therefore, the use of banking services has no practical sense and people continue to keep their money at home, in cash. Thus, by using the PRIZM crypto currency, people in Africa receive financial freedom, not only conveniently saving money and making transactions, but also earning with the help of Paramining. People will not just stop overpaying, by giving the banks solid amounts as fees, but, on the contrary, they will begin to accumulate savings, which will be replenished with the help of mechanisms prescribed in the source code of the crypto currency. * What strategies should be laid as foundation for the development of PRIZM crypto currency in Africa. Each local leader PRIZM, who attended the event, spoke about his ideas, and described how the PRIZM crypto currency should develop.  It was decided in the future to develop PRIZM in the following areas:  * Merging of the site and tools of the crypto currency with popular online stores * Offline work with communities * Start of the off-line and online presentations to get people's attention to the cryptographic world. * Creation of autonomous offices for the sale of PRIZM in Africa. * Also, the focus was made on promoting the ideology of the International social movement ""Change the World Together"". This priority was   due to the activity and attention of users to the movement. In addition, the leaders decided to release the first copies of the book ""CWT   Ideology"" for PRIZM users.",True

That is why today thinking people from around the world join CWT to change the world for the better, by building the world order on fair terms and by directly seeing the results of their activity and their sincere enthusiasm.  This time, Mr. Alexei Muratov conducted a whole tour in Asian countries, which included large-scale meetings with CWT activists from India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand        The chairman of the International public movement commented ""Change the World Together"" Alexei Muratov commented on this statement by Andrew Left: ""He's right: Bitcoin and Etherium are bubbles, same like the world financial system, the banking system. The largest pyramid is the US dollar. Many national currencies, which are based on the US Dollar and the Euro, are pyramids built on the pyramids. ""  To be fair, it should be said that today many world experts are confident that the crypto-currency industry as a whole is not a ""bubble"", but more is a ""needle"" that will burst the current unfair financial system of the world.  For example, Mr. John Matonis is confident that the current economy of the planet goes from fiat money imposed by the banking system, and decentralized assets directly support this revolutionary trend.  ""People who claim that the Blockchain technology itself is a bubble, I will answer that it is a needle that will pierce the bubble. The bubble is an insane stock markets and securities that central banks support. These are bubbles, ""- said Mr. Matonis.  Activists of CWT and PRIZM support this trend - it is these ideas that the members of the movement are trying to convey since 2011. The world begins to wake up, the illusions start going away.  ""There is no doubt that decentralized crypto-currencies are a more progressive comparing to the currencies of the world. Blockchain technology will directly benefit our planet - this is difficult to argue with. But the main thing that we should not allow today is the replacement of ""sew into the soap"". It is necessary to rely on decentralized crypto-currencies, not on those that are just covering with this decentralization, while remaining projects managed by a group of unknown persons who have concentrated control over the nodes in their hands, who own mining pools and the lion's share of tokens. The rate should be made for progress - today PRIZM crypto currency is the tool which is more advanced in the technical execution in this innovative market.  PRIZM is a truly decentralized crypto currency, which, as it develops, does not become a centrist model, but even becomes more dispersed. PRIZM provides equal rights and opportunities for all users. This is real decentralization.",True

The income does not come from the growth of the price of coins, but due to a constant increase of the number of coins in a personal wallet with a stable exchange rate.

In Prizm, it's not so difficult to reach 15% per month with Paramining. http://prizm.club/en/marketing/  And here you can calculate the profitability of prizm http://ru.onlinemschool.com/math/assistance/percent/percent5/ For example, 60 thousand rubles (1000 $ or 1000 prizm), 15% a month, 10 months, and we get 241,733 rubles (4000 $ or 4000 prizm) after 10 months.

But for $ 0.7, very less people willing to sell, if the exchangers take back Prizm at the rate of 1 dollar. The rate is maintained as in all crypto-currencies due to the increase in demand and the number of users.

But most importantly ‚Äì conceptually! It will not become centrist! I call this a national crypto currency, because, I still would like to see this crypto currency born in Russia. But this does not mean that the emission and control should be with the Central Bank, usurped in the hands of the Central Bank. It should be truly decentralized ‚Äì then it will be popular not only in Russia, but all over the world. Today, with the help of the PRIZM blockchain, we showed how you can solve the centering problem, and how you can speed up transaction confirmation, and reduce the cost of transactions! PRIZM today outperforms Bitcoin! Yes, this is a young technology, it‚Äôs a young blockchain, but the future is precisely behind such crypto-currencies. Now we are working on the creation of Discovery PRIZM ‚Äì the visualization of the blockchain, this system development just begins, ‚Äúsaid Mr. Alexei Muratov.",True

Every day the cryptocurrency industry becomes more interesting and foreground for offline media - newspapers, magazines, radio, television channels.  It is difficult not to agree with the fact that the hottest topic of this week was an unexpected ban of crypto-instruments in China, which provoked a sharp drop in the rates of crypto-currencies (mainly working on PoW) and caused a flurry of panic among users around the world.  The above topic was broadcasted on the air of ‚ÄúRBC‚Äù Channel where Mr.Alexei Muratov - the founder of the crypto currency PRIZM and the chairman of the International Public Movement ""Change the World Together"" - commented on it.  ""The main problem of Bitcoin and all other crypto-currencies are stock speculators. And the fact that today Bitcoin‚Äôs rate has fallen to $ 3,000, but literally in the last three hours (with the news that the regulator extended the period of work of the crypto exchanges in China and they will not be closed), the price has grown by as much as $ 500.  Of course, this are all media injections - there will be information about the fact that cryptocurrencies are allowed, then that they are banned. Because of this, there will be fluctuations in the exchange rate, on which exchange speculators will win, and this cannot be avoided, today it is a minus of all crypto-currencies, they are very susceptible to these fluctuations. The market of crypto-currencies today resembles the Wild West, the period of the formation of the banking system in a period of chaos.  It is impossible to ban the usage of crypto-currencies, so as a result, in each country a law on legal turnover will be adopted. The state will regulate the turnover exactly on the platforms, where one can convert the crypto currency into Fiat - there are simply no other tools.  Banning Blockchain and crypto currency today is a big mistake. You can ban the Internet in a separate country, but if it exists around the world - the country will be plunged into a backlog in IT-technologies. The same thing is happening now with Blockchain technology and the crypto currency market.  Blockhain is a technology. While there is no regulatory framework, where Bitcoin or other tokens are registered. Someone calls it shares, someone currencies, someone - tokens. When the regulatory framework becomes available, then other legislative acts will also be based on this.  Until the State starts to regulate the market of crypto-currencies you cannot say that it something bad, no one tried to avoid taxes. Blockhain is an open technology and a transparent tool. If you want, you can see the history of all transactions - not just any controlling body, but any participant can do it. You can see the whole story ‚Äì from where these Bitcoins appeared in the wallet and where did they go further. This is the more transparent tool than today's banking system.  It is necessary to pass a law. Today in Russia several teams are engaged in this - the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance and the State Duma, in some ways their positions are different. Personally, I believe that this is a technological revolution and it is impossible to ignore it.  Today Bitcoin is imperfect - very expensive transactions. If you want to pay with Bitcoin, let‚Äôs say, for a cup of coffee, then you will have to pay about $ 20 for the transaction, so that it is confirmed more or less quickly - and then, it will happen within 10 minutes (conditionally).  In the crypto currency PRIZM, let‚Äôs say, you can do it. A large number of new crypto-currencies appear, technically more sophisticated. In the nearest future they will also become a payment method. Already today it is possible to connect new and more advanced crypto-currencies via API to online shops, trading platforms, ID, etc.  What will be the law? Now there is a battle of teams. Personally, I'm in favor of a different approach. Today, all the crypto-currencies (including Bitcoin) become centrist as they develop, despite the decentralization, which is mentioned - be it Proof of Stake or Proof of Work. In process of development all cryptocurrencies become centrist. For example, if this is Proof of Work, then all the power is in the hands of mining pools - new coins are issued and pools can change the rules for all the participants.  I believe that Russia's way is to study this technology and create its national crypto currency, which technically and conceptually will outperform the rest. Which will not be centrist, but will remain a decentralized tool.  We have contacts with working groups, some of them listen to us. Now there are several teams in Russia - in some ways they have similar positions, somewhere they are fundamentally different. Let's see which one wins.  ‚ÄúIn the end, we have a commander-in-chief - I think that he will make the right decision! "", - Mr. Alexei Muratov comments on the development in the industry.

It is this ambitious goal that prompts activists to regularly participate in major events, forums and conferences dedicated to Blockchain, crypto-currencies and related technologies.  On September 21st 2017, the PRIZM team attended the ‚ÄúCryptoBazar Pre-ICO Day‚Äù event, which was attended by top projects preparing for the ICO. The blockchain-playground that was held at ‚ÄúIzvestia Hall‚Äù was a big event in the industry of the crypto-currencies, the business community and other spheres of the economy. Representatives of startups told about the idea of their projects and spoke to potential investors. The event was attended by more than 1,300 people ‚Äì among them: the founders of projects, investors and key members of the crypto-currency industry. Among the guests of ‚ÄúCryptoBazar Pre-ICO Day‚Äù there were also representatives of the State Duma, large companies, business analysts, economists from various fields and, of course, journalists.  Meanwhile, in the industry ‚Äì the trend is towards the transition to Proof of Stake. Today, in the industry of crypto currencies, emerged a very interesting trend, directly related to PRIZM. Simultaneously with the development of advanced crypto currency in the market, such a trend is gaining popularity as a transition to an alternative way of creating new coins ‚Äì Proof of Stake. First of all, this trend is caused by the emerging problems in the network of the second most popular crypto currency ‚Äì Etherium. A few days ago the Byzantium test network was attacked by unknown intruders. Hackers filled whole blocks with spam contracts for large sums. Also now in the community of crypto-currencies there are active discussions about the hard-core in its network. As you know, in the coming weeks hardfork is planned in Ethereum. It will be activated on the block 4,370,000 (if the generation speed continues, it will occur on October 17). At the same time, the creator of the crypto currency, Vitalik Buterin expressed his wish that the haphazard happened much later ‚Äì at the end of October, but because of the upcoming Devcon conference in early November, his decision has changed. Thus, even the creator of Etherium realized that the crypto currency has been dependent on the business of mining pools and it‚Äôs time to change it. ‚ÄúWhen we move to the Proof-of-Stake protocol, the need for ether mining will drop dramatically at the first stage. Proof-of-Stake uses an algorithm that does not require a large number of computers to constantly make calculations. This is an algorithm where a coin is used inside the platform itself. The consensus will become much cheaper and safer. And in fact, miners may lose their business, ‚Äù ‚Äì stated Vitalik Buterin.  Let‚Äôs sum it up. In turn, PRIZM was originally built on a more modern, reliable and decentralized technology ‚Äì while giants of the market like Etherium are unevenly exploring new technologies.

Regulation by the US was an actual topic discussed at the conference  Also one of the topics discussed was the latest active actions of the Ministry of Finance of the United States of America, which influenced the work of the crypto-currency industry. According to Ms. Sigal Mandelker, Deputy Minister of Finance for Combating Terrorism and Financial Intelligence of the United States, cryptocurrencies should be regulated by the international community to prevent crimes in which they are used as a financial instrument for the circulation of funds (the main quotes from her speech are published on the website of US Treasury). Ms. Sigal Mandelker also noted that US government bodies should outstrip the development of the cryptocurrency industry in terms of regulation and the formation of new legislation.  ‚ÄúWe are very concerned that cryptocurrencies can be used for illegal activities. We must be very careful in this regard, must stay ahead of technology. We also call other countries to deal with this problem, ‚Äú Ms. Mandelker said.  In addition, Mandelker clarified that the Office for Combating Financial Crimes (FinCEN) regularly monitors compliance with legislation by industry activists in the cryptocurrency industry. It should be noted that in the end of July this year FinCEN imposed a penalty of $ 110 million on BTC-e crypto-exchange for ‚Äúdeliberately violating US anti-money laundering laws‚Äù.  Naturally, PRIZM, as an active and expert player of the industry, has an opinion on what is happening.  ‚ÄúA new world financial system is coming to the world. A worthless monetary monopoly can not stop it. That is why the financial elites will try to regulate it as much as possible, and also take control of the bulk of the infrastructure created for it. That is why the US attacked this crypto-exchange, the founders of which are Russian citizens. Exchange BTC-e is not better and not worse than hundreds of top-end crypto-exchanges. But not accidentally it is BTC-e which became the victim. This is a simple redistribution of spheres of influence in the new financial market. It is just the begining, ‚Äú- thus, Alexei Muratov comments on the recent actions of the US authorities, which have influenced the crypto-currency market.",True

The relations between wallets is written inside blockchain, at the moment of first transaction. The more the volume of your team, the faster paramining produces the new coins.  Prizm is the only DECENTRALISED cryptocurrency where referall system is implemented inside its block chain. All the others so-called ""cryptocurrencies"" (there are hundreds of them) which claim to have the automatic referral system inside it - are simply HYPE projects!!!  One doesn't need much brains to make a copy of bitcoin code, to claim that it is some unique blockchain, and then issue huge amount of pre mined coins, and start to distribute the same coins inside the structures -usually absolutely manually.  Networkers who drag the people in such so-called shit-coin projects are risking: 1. Their accounts can be blocked any time, 2. The structure built can be shifted anywhere any time 3. The rate of such coin can be dropped any time, due to absolutely huge and uncontrolled pre-mined amount of coins.  People are fed up to trust to such owners who invite them to participate, are fed up with all these technical support issues, tired of trusting to unknown programmers, and other issues with their servers, software etc.  That is why - only really decentralized projects, where there is no interference from the side of someone or something but everything is transparent in the source code and absolutely decentralised - are having such a success nowadays.  Prizm is one of such projects, and if you take closer, is even more decentralised than Bitcoin, because in Bitcoin nowadays miners become very choosy and want to confirm only transactions with higher commission. Here in PRIZM - the commission is fixed, and confirmations of transactions happen automatically without interference of prizm miners.  By the way, in PRIZM any user can install the node (server) on his/her computer, even person without any special technical knowledge and without having any mining equipment can become a miner and do the forging of blocks in Prizm.   No need to calculate the huge amount of hash garbage and waste so much energy for mining in Prizm!

On June 22nd 2017, CWT took part in another large-scale event dedicated to Blockchain and crypto currencies. The conference was held in St. Petersburg under the title ""Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference St. Petersburg"". The event gathered not only the participants of the projects based on Blockchain, but also - entrepreneurs of the IT industry, representatives of banks and many more who turned their attention to the world of crypto-currencies, innovative services and decentralization in the economic sphere.  The results of the conference were summed up by ‚ÄúCWT‚Äù Chairman Mr. Alexei Muratov and crypto-pirate Mr. Ruben Fischerman (the last meeting of colleagues occurred at Blockchain conference ‚ÄúDigital October‚Äù).  Ruben Fisherman: Good afternoon, friends. We met Mr. Alexei Muratov at this wonderful blockbuster conference in St. Petersburg and decided to understand what's more attracting: investing into crypto currency or mining of crypto currency. Alexei will tell from the side of mining, and myself - from investment point of view.  Alexei Muratov: Well, probably, from the side of mining it will be difficult for me to tell, because I am a supporter of PoS-technologies.  Ruben Fisherman: Could you please tell us what is PoS - for the ""unenlightened"", those who don‚Äôt know it. What is the difference between PoW and PoS?  Alexei Muratov: Just imagine the same thing, when you do not have to do an unnecessary job.  For example, imagine, there are coins on the table. I‚Äôm representing the PoS (Proof-of-Stake), so I will simply approach the table and take the coins, and you, who is representing PoW (Proof-of-Work), will have to do squat 100 times before taking the coins. Then again, I come and take 150 coins without doing anything, and then you do squat 150 times squats, because, the work gets more complicated. I'm taking it again, and you're already doing 200 times and so on and so on‚Ä¶  Therefore, dear friends, the opinion of CWT community: the future is behind the technology of ""Proof of stake"". And this unnecessary mining equipment, I think, will soon go down in history. Those crypto-currencies that will not be restructured also become risky and will go into history.  Ruben Fisherman: I can share my point of view about this story. Of course, it is not as radical as that of Alexei, but I believe that recalculation of the ""garbage"" hash (that is, the calculation of ""garbage"" functions) is at least inhuman from the point of ecology. Because, in order to produce electricity, it is necessary either to burn coal, or build a dam, or something else ... Accordingly, this energy goes away. Therefore, I think that in the nearest future there will be a certain blockchain, which will load the mining capacities with some useful calculations and tasks, and the coins will be given for these tasks. So let's see what kind of opinion will win. Therefore, I agree with Alexei that this is not a dead-end and it will soon be replaced. Probably with PoS.  Alexei Muratov: I have a counter question. And how do you feel about the fact that every day more and more people start investing into crypto currencies, using them as a means of payment?  Ruben Fisherman: My point of view is that doing it without any special knowledge is extremely risky. First, it is unclear what kind of coin to invest into, and second, it is not clear how to work with a wallet - that is, you can lose your password and lose all the money (there is no technical support in most crypto currencies), third, you need to have certain knowledge about the safety of your wallets and certain understanding of what kind of market it is. Therefore, if someone has a lack of knowledge, or lack of self-confidence, you can visit INBITCOIN.CLUB web-site and get education there as part of investment in crypto currency and trading.  Alexei Muratov: My dear friends, we will meet at the next conference. Come in, read the CWT.TOP website, the ideology of the CWT movement. I'm sure that we will change the world. I am confident that we will build a new, decentralized financial system! See you next time!  Ruben Fisherman: By the way, a very good community. I myself am present in it, I recommend it to everyone.  https://postimg.org/image/ta2dvqsgl/ https://postimg.org/image/pdc92g0sv/ https://youtu.be/_a8JvQ114gA  #AlekseyMuratov #cwt #cwt blockchain #bitcoin # bitcoin russia  Source: cwt.top",True

The leader in terms of tension, of course, is Bitcoin - sharp drops and takeoffs of the rate of this cryptocurrency gave worries not only to ordinary users, but to big investors and, apparently, allowed ... mining pools to earn extra.  Crisis and subsequent speculations in Ethereum  Such speculative behavior of most of the miners at the moment can be seen during the congestion of the blockchain in Ethereum - immediately after the beginning of the next crisis of this crypto currency, representatives of the mining pools immediately increased the throughput of transactions. According to CoinDesk (which in turn refers to the indicators of the well-known analytical platform Etherchain), a massive jump in the ""gas limit"" in the blocks of Ethereum crypto currency network occurred on Thursday, June 29th.  This chart shows that within a very short time the ""gas limit"" in the network of Ethereum crypto-currency increased by about a third.  ""Gas"" is the unit of computing power in Ethereum crypto currency. The term ""gas consumption"" is designed to clarify the processing power required to perform an action in the network.  It is well known that the price for ‚Äúgas‚Äù is formed by the Ethereum miners. Thus, the higher limit implies an increase of the actions in the block. Therefore, such loads on the blockchain are beneficial for mining pools, but not for ordinary users of crypto currency.  Bitcoin in a dead end of discussions. Is it miners again?  To date, Bitcoin network is completely immersed in discussions on the topic of scaling the SegWit2x network. Many users view this initiative as a ""golden mean"" as a solution to the urgent issue of scaling Bitcoin. The initiative includes the activation of the Segregated Witness protocol by the miners. In addition, it is being planned to expand the block size further up to 2Mb.  The scandal and controversy of the topic also lies in the fact that a huge number of Bitcoin users are negatively opposed to the implementation of SegWit2x. Part of the community openly considers the scaling project as not only an unfinished one, but also as a technically too raw project. In addition, in the community, the assumption was that the scaling project is the result of agreements reached by the large representatives of the bitcoin industry-that is, the most ambitious mining pools.  Consequently, there is a probability of speculations of the top miners of Bitcoin and the artificial reversal of the situation for their purposes.  PRIZM - a rescue from artificial control of the situation by the miners  The current situation in the networks of leading crypto-currencies is a clear demonstration of how imperfect Proof-of-Work technology is. It creates sharp discussions in communities and the so-called ""fever"" in networks, allowing the speculators from major mining pools to earn millions of dollars for processing unnecessary information - in fact, informational garbage.  The advanced crypto currency PRIZM excludes these disadvantages in its work due to the generation of blocks using Proof-of-Stake technology.  Chairman of the Board of the International Public Movement CWT (‚ÄúChange the World Together‚Äù) Mr. Alexei Muratov about crypto currency PRIZM: ""It has been almost 10 years since the appearance of the first crypto-currency, which according to the plan of its creators was to become a convenient, anonymous means of payment.  It could replace money, but in this world there are forces for whom this currency, which cannot be controlled, is the collapse of their established positions, at the top of the global governance system.  And in order not to waste energy in combating the phenomenon, the power of which repeatedly exceeds the existing way of the world financial system, the minds and attention of people who realized the power crypto currency have been deployed in the opposite direction.  Crypto currency has evolved from a payment instrument to an investment tool. It lost its power in the speculative struggle on the stock exchange. And the race of mining capacities led to the fact that today in order to pay via bitcoin for a cup of coffee worth $ 1, you need to pay more than $ 20 to the miners for the confirmation of this transaction. The high cost of transactions today is a problem for absolutely all top crypto-currencies. The greed of stock speculators and miners is the scourge of bitcoin.  In this way the world's elites were able to subordinate something that cannot be fought.  Today, before it's too late, people must correct the situation and return the crypto-currencies to the state of convenient and anonymous payment method. Method which already is ready to replace the existing monetary system.  The turn is possible! And the concept of PRIZM is this Reversal.  Today the new generation cryptocurrency PRIZM is:  - 100% POS  - Fixed minimum reward to miners for the confirmation of the transaction,  - There is no need to sort out the hash garbage,  - It is not necessary to have huge mining capacities to ensure the operation of the system and to waste huge amounts of electricity.  - All this allowed to provide instant transfers and low cost, maximum decentralization and equal opportunities for all PRIZM participants.  The PRIZM.STORE system - is single rules for the circulation of PRIZM crypto currency. They allow you to maintain a stable rate throughout the entire period of mining of new coins.  Following these rules, people create a decentralized network of private banks. Banks, which will ensure a stable rate of crypto currency PRIZM in future.

Today, it is interesting to observe this development, marking the stages which a new and advanced cryptocurrency is passing. As in many other stories of formation of any crypto-currency, the growth of PRIZM has been marked with important stages. Frist, the listing on monitor services and sites, the evaluation of capitalization, and the explosion of attention from the global leaders ... However, an equally important stage is the formation of any crypto currency as a media object. As a rule, this extremely important process begins with media attention and discussion in the world of show business.  Speaking about the last stage, we would like to emphasize that at the moment the activists of the project and just people who are attentive to the world of cryptocurrency are witnessing the beginning of PRIZM discussion in show business. Recently, during one of the Russian show-biz parties a number of actors, businessmen, musicians and other representatives of show business told their opinion about the recently launched crypto currency.  Of course, opinions were divided and, logically, business representatives were more aware of the world of crypto currency than the people of the cinema and music industry.  Nevertheless, regardless of awareness, some people of show business prefer to use traditional methods of transactions and banking without planning to test new technologies. Such person, for example, is Mr. Boris Grachevsky.  ""Now there is a lot of ... QIWI money, Yandex-wallets and so on. But I have a card, I pay directly and everything on instance"", the director claims.  The Creator of CWT and PRIZM ideology Mr. Alexei Muratov comments on the project‚Äôs growing attention to the project: ""Today, the crypto-currency market is reminiscent of the formation of the banking system - it's like ‚ÄúWild West"". A market which is not regulated. But I am sure that the crypto currency will be the basis of the new world financial system. It is coming into the world. This is just as promising as ""Wild West"" was a promising emerging banking system. ""  ""Dear friends! Study the technology, study about blockchain, start using crypto-currencies ‚Äì it is the future. I am sure that the government will soon start regulating crypto-currencies, regulatory legal acts will be adopted and they will establish the status of the crypto-currency. From the ""Wild West"" period we will come to the civilized world!

ALEXEI MURATOV SPOKE ABOUT THE EVENTS HAPPENING TODAY IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY  The same way like the global financial system in general, the Crypto currency industry is changing rapidly. In the light of the current developments related to the innovations in Bitcoin network, many active users and simply observers of the situation are asking questions, because they do not have the objective information and are in a ‚Äúlimbo‚Äù state. It is difficult for people around the world to orient themselves in what to pay attention to, what to invest in, how to make a correct and far-sighted choice.  The international public movement ‚ÄúChange the World Together‚Äù always made efforts to inform people and develop the world of crypto-currencies. It was in order to share what is going on, the chairman of the CWT board Mr. Alexei Muratov recorded a special video message ‚Äì the leader of the organization answered all the most frequently asked questions of users of crypto-currencies in details, by explaining a number of nuances of the industry.  All crypto-currencies are conceptually identical. They all have one problem. They are born decentralized, but as they grow, they become centrist like how Bitcoin is today. For example, in order to generate a new coin, to mine Bitcoin, you need to select pairs of prime numbers thanks to what the block is generated, which means if you generate a new block in blockchain, the genesis block gives you a coin as a reward, by sending it to your address. And this is how it works in all cryptocurrencies ‚Äì to generate a new coin it is necessary to support the network. Maintaining the network is basically called mining, or forging. Miners do not deal with bitcoins as most people imagine, they generate blocks in blockchain and for that they get a reward in the form of Bitcoin. In Bitcoin genesis block it is already written, as to how many bitcoins should be given for each block and within what period of time.  Genesis block will give bitcoin depending on the level of difficulty, and the same applies to all the other cryptocurrencies. This unified concept leads to centering, that is, to centralization. As at the initial stage there are a lot of miners, it is easy to mine, easy to generate blocks, and easy to maintain the network. Accordingly, anyone can mine, as there are many miners and they will not let anything happen to the network. This applies to both the concepts ‚Äì POW as well as POS. In POW, if the complexity of the network increases, then more powerful equipment is required, and one needs to invest a lot of money to be able to generate new blocks of blockchain, respectively, the competition is decreasing, since you need a lot of ‚Äúiron‚Äù to generate blocks. The same goes with the classic POS concept. To generate new blocks you need to have coins. The more coins you have, the more blocks you forge; the more blocks you forge, the more coins you are given. Accordingly, you become stronger and stronger. Competing with you becomes more difficult. And if you do not sell your coins to anyone, then you get the whole network concentrated on yourself. Because of this, all the network of blockchain which are working on this principle, are striving from decentralization to centering. So, the more ‚Äúpower-iron‚Äù in POW or the more coins in POS, all these systems tend to centering or to capturing of this system.  In PRIZM, everything is fundamentally different: emission of coins is not related to the generation of blocks in blockchain. In fact, forgers are enthusiasts who maintain the network in a working condition and do not generate new coins. They simply receive a fixed commission from the transactions that were recorded in the block they create. The coins are generated for all the users simultaneously and this leads to even greater decentralization. It is impossible to accumulate 50% of coins in one place. The more the network of users grows, the more it spreads. The amount of users grows and Genesis is required to generate new coins for different addresses. To get more coins from Genesis, users are forced not only to keep their coins, but also to distribute them to their followers by popularizing the system and leading it to an even greater decentralization.  PRIZM is conceptually completely different. Generation of coins is made for storage, regardless of whether you create new blocks or not. Coins are generated based on the available balance. Today, there is not a single crypto currency in the world such as PRIZM. We mean ‚Äì Crypto-currency, which is not to be confused with the huge number of HYIPs posing as a cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency, in which the function of generation of new coins and the function of generation of new blocks for maintaining the network of blockchain ‚Äì are divided. PRIZM is the only cryptocurrency wherein blockchain is on one side of the coin, and the generation of coins is on the other side of it, and all this is connected in one 100% decentralized cryptocurrency. No one has it yet. This makes it possible not to become centralized, but to preserve the original concept of the tool which is decentralized, open, transparent and controlled by a huge number of users of the network.

I want to state that I only work with CWT and Prizm. I do not participate in any other projects and do not have any accounts in other projects. Regarding the conferences before and now, I only participate in joint conferences, if I am invited, and represent the International Social Movement CWT (‚ÄúChange the World Together‚Äù). If you are told that I am the owner or participant in some other project, this is a lie. Most likely these are scammers who are trying to mislead you.  I already repeatedly posted this announcement on my site and on my Facebook profile. Once again I repeat - I participate in joint conferences with different companies, but I'm only doing it as a speaker under the CWT banner, where I‚Äôm talking about the ideology of the movement, its goals and aims. I‚Äôm having such joint conferences with many different companies.  Regarding the company E-Dinar Coin, I stopped participating in joint conferences with E-Dinar Coin as soon as the complaints addressed to the company started. My book ‚ÄúIdeology of CWT‚Äù is used by many companies, as it is the best tool nowadays to promote the blockchain projects. The book has been already published in many languages and has been distributed throughout the world with a circulation of more than 100.000 copies at the moment.  I cannot forbid using it, and I do not want to do it. Our task is the maximum number of supporters and I'm not interested in what blockchain projects they are involved in. I believe, let them earn where they want, it is their right. The main thing for us is that our supporters share the goals and objectives of the CWT as per ideology.  From my side, I always try to tell and explain the leaders around the world in the simplest language and with all the details - what blockchain is, what does decentralization mean and how today's crypto currencies differ from one another, as well as from electronic currencies and hype-projects. http://cwt.top/en/news/2305/prizm-prezentovana-v-indii-sostojalas-konferencija-dlja-top-lide  Many leaders who are engaged in crypto-currency projects do not even know the basics.

The choice is left to the leaders and participants. This is their choice, so let them choose any project, I just want their choice to be conscious.  Now regarding MMM, I never concealed my participation in this project. All who participated in MMM know that I was in charge of ideology and political party organization. It was the ideology of the MMM that formed the basis of CWT ideology. I do not hide it. A huge number of leaders from MMM support me today as well. Our goal is to change the world!

PRIZM is one hundred percent PoS cryptocurrency based on the NEXT core, built with the Java language open source . The unique algorithm of PoS in PRIZM does not depend on any implementation of the ‚Äúcoin age‚Äù concept used by other PoS cryptocurrencies, and is resistant to so-called ""nothing at stake"" attacks. Curve25519 encryption is used to provide a balance of security and required processing power among with more commonly used SHA256 hashing algorithms.  Blocks are generated every 60 seconds, on average, by accounts that are not blocked on network hosts. PZM is redistributed by including transaction fees that are awarded to the account when it successfully creates the block. This process is known as ‚Äúforging‚Äù and is akin to the concept of ""mining"" used by other cryptocurrencies. Transactions are considered safe after 10 block confirmations, and the current architecture and the size of the PZM block allow processing up to 367,200 transactions per day.  PZM also includes the implementation of the Transparent Forging function, which will increase the performance of transaction processing by two orders of magnitude using the algorithm of generation of a deterministic block, in combination with additional network security mechanisms.  Premine  The initial issue is 10 million PZM. The final amount of 600 trillion PZM will be achieved in 500 years. Coins were issued with the creation of a block of genesis (the first block in the chain of blocks). Pre-mining is realized in all countries of the world, at face value, limited parties, to achieve the starting decentralization of Prizm.  Uniqueness  ParaMining is a key advantage of PRIZM over the rest of cryptocurrencies. Due the basic forging mechanism, the developers of PRIZM have added a unique, linear-retrograde mechanism for determining the reward for the storage of funds, aimed at economic attractiveness and the gradual replacement of all existing financial instruments of the world  by the mass of PZM. That is, in addition to the basic forging mechanism, which does not increase the amount of funds in the system. Prism has an additional mechanism called ParaMining, which creates new coins, according to the metrics of the standard mathematics of the development of a normalized financial system in the context of the global economy. According to our calculations, only this format for the growth of the mass of coins can ensure a gradual and confident replacement of all existing economic instruments.  The main advantage of Paramining is uniqueness of situation where nobody can interfere with this mechanism and falsify new coins ‚Äì all PZM users and miners can monitor the number of coins issued by the system in the real-time.    Paramining works on any Prism wallet with a balance of more than 1 PZM and automatically stops when the balance reaches 1 million PZM  For the first time, the system of establishing referral links without using any references has been applied. After creating a new wallet, the system captures its first transaction from the block and permanently sets up a referral chain that can not be changed, which makes it easy to build global MLM networks and increase the speed of new coinage.  Technical implementation at the moment is not described in detail because the main thing for all of us is to create not 100 ""dead"" tools, but one - with good support and working well. If our know-how is revealed, then someone will definitely try to repeat it and this involuntarily will lead to the dispersion of attention and use of this idea not for noble and important for our planet purposes, but for purposes not known to us and not always differing in positive coloring intent.  To start production of new PZMs, only one coin in the PZM wallet is enough to automatically start paramining. This is the process that allows you to increase the number of coins in your wallet without any electricity costs. ParaMining starts with 1 coin and stops automatically when number of 1 million coins is reached in the wallet.
