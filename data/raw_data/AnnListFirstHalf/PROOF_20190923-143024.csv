Please notify that for large PROOF token holders (from 500'000 PROOF and more) extensive verification is required, for which a number of documents, including passport or driving license scan, a payment document confirming the place of permanent residence, and a document confirming the possession of a bank account (for example, a photo of a bank card).   The bridge for PROOF tokens migration will be available until the end of 2018, however, one should remember that the members of elite levels can count on privileges only if the verification procedure has been passed successfully!

We are happy to announce the release of our new product - Prover Clapperboard to confirm video files recorded from cameras that do not have an Internet connection (standard digital cameras, action cameras, CCTV cameras etc)!  The product is the mobile application that allows you to place any text comment in the blockchain and generate a special QR code that allows you later to find this text comment in the blockchain. A text comment can contain, for example, the name of the movie / scene / camera angle /take for filmmaking or the name of the hospital / surgeon ID / the name of the operation for videotaping the surgical operations, or the name of the construction site / site / job description for remote control of construction work at the site and much more.  To confirm the created video, you only need to display the QR-code generated by the application into the camera for a few seconds during the recording.  To verify the authenticity of a video containing such a QR-code, it just is enough to upload it to our online service or use our open algorithms. Video analysis modules will automatically detect and recognize the QR code in the video stream, specifying the block number and hash of the transaction, which allows you to determine a text comment previously saved in the block.",False

We congratulate everyone on the New Year and want to share with you the results of the project in 2017:  The MVP of the PROVER product already works for a month, allowing us to test the service and get feedback from you! We went a path from the idea to the working technology and developed a video analytics system that allows to recognize the trajectory of the smartphone's movement. It is necessary to entering the swype code by using on the basis of motion in the frame. We've developed and deployed in GooglePlay, a mobile application Prover MVP (SWYPE ID) - it is a full-featured product, based on the Ropsten Testnet blockchain, which allows to confirm the video by entering the swype code. We've developed and deployed in GooglePlay, the mobile application Prover CLAPPERBOARD, which allows to add timestamps and comments for video files created by CCTV cameras, action cameras, as well as other cameras that do not have internet connections and SWYPE ID technology can’t be used; We’ve developed the service (http://mvp.prover.io) for verification the authenticity of a video files, created using PROVER technology (SWYPE-ID or CLAPPERBOARD); We’ve participated in several blockchain conferences in Russia, India, Japan and the United Arab Emirates, where we were able to demonstrate our idea to hundreds of people and to get a huge interest and readiness to use Prover technology in various of business.  Our plans for 2018 are even more ambitious!  We are happy to inform you the dates the ICO of the PROVER Project, which will be held on 30.01.2018 - 31.03.2018!  By the middle of 2018 we will finish the development of all the planned functionality of our product and turn the project into a full-fledged, protected technology solution. We decided not to limit our Project to the Ethereum ecosystem and plan to make the implementation of the PROVER technology for a very promising blockchain - NEM!  We are sure that our service will be used by thousands of organizations and millions of people around the world! Thank you for believing in us! Happy New Year, dear friends!  Good luck and prosperity to you in 2018!",False
