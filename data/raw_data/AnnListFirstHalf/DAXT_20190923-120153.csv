The BlockEx Digital Asset Exchange Platform (DAxP) manages the entire lifecycle of blockchain based digital assets. It has toolkits for asset creation, servicing, trade settlement, permissioned trading and automated reporting. Currently it is launching the BlockEx ICO Market. This will provide a full end-to-end compliant ICO product offering to companies wishing to launch an ICO. BlockEx will bring the governance and legal framework of its regulated activities to the ICO landscape, to provide a safe marketplace for both issuers and participants. BlockEx’s DAxP is currently in production, so participants in the ICO can realise the utility of the token before end of year.  BlockEx already has traction, and is about to reach lift off!  • 3 billion GBP worth of ICOs in approval pipeline. • 1.8 billion GBP pipeline of blockchain bonds • 5 white label Brokerage clients • Accepted to FCA Sandbox to test bond issuance tools • Accepted to AIFC Sandbox for security based tokens • Partnership with large CSD for Golden Gate • Partnership with OpenText for blockchain trade finance   ICO Problems BlockEx Has Solved  The BlockEx ICO Market was created in response to problems in the current ICO landscape. The lack of AML and KYC on ICO buyers and sellers means ICOs can be used for money laundering, and participants in the market can be exposed to fraud. The volatility of cryptocurrencies creates risks for the issuers, who may not manage the funds they receive effectively, and for buyers, who face exchange rate risk. The lack of easy fiat funding options also creates problems. There is a lack of governance, and huge sums are being invested in ideas in white papers, with no promise that the product will materialise. Some cryptocurrency projects were halted for creating ICOs that behave like financial securities without proper authorisation. Fear, uncertainty and doubt have been created by past and current fraudulent ICOs. Moreover, the distribution of ICO tokens has been heavily relationship based. The issuers of ICOs generally have a relationship with early buyers, who get a larger allocation.   BlockEx ICO Market  The BlockEx ICO Market solves the aforementioned issues:  Pot Allocation System: The Pot Allocation System operates during the pre-sale of ICOs hosted on our platform. If a pre-sale is oversubscribed, tokens are allocated in proportion to the amount of funds subscribed, so everyone can get some tokens. Digital Asset Exchange Token (DAXT): Our ICO is offering the Digital Asset Exchange Token (DAXT). It gives holders access to the Pot Allocation System used during the pre-sale of ICOs hosted on our platform. AML, KYC, and Security: BlockEx maintains institutional grade AML, KYC and security policies for all services, products, and traders. Token Issuing Company and 3rd Party Treasury Management Services: Funds raised will be released in tranches as ICO issuers reach preset milestones. They will be actively managed to remove the risks created by cryptocurrencies' volatility. Internal Digital Asset Exchange Token (IDAXT): The IDAXT is an internal special purpose token that automatically transfers various funding methods (fiat or cryptocurrency) on-chain. Exchanging funds from multiple currencies will be risk-free and transparent, since it will happen on-chain. Full Fiat Onrails: Traders can fund their accounts by wire, credit card, or from an eWallet. Instant Secondary Market: BlockEx offers an instant secondary market post ICO, so holders can immediately begin trading their tokens.   The DAXT  The BlockEx DAXT gives its holder access to the Pot Allocation System during ICO pre-sales hosted on the BlockEx ICO Market. This means that it can be used to guarantee an allocation of high quality, compliant ICO tokens. If a pre-sale is oversubscribed, the Pot Allocation System allocates tokens in proportion to the amount of funds subscribed, so everyone can join the fun.
