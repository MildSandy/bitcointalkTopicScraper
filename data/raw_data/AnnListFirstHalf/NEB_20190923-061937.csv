Check out the forecasts from our neural network for free! https://neurobot.trading/forecasts  The neural network collects and analyses data 24/7 and provides forecasts for various cryptocurrenciesâ€™ exchange rates. There are three types of forecasts: for 24 hours, for 48 hours and for one week. Depending on the type of forecast and the chosen cryptocurrency, the accuracy of the forecast spans within the range of 70-90%. Example, BTC forecast https://neurobot.trading/forecasts/show_predict/btc  The project is targeted at anybody interested in trading. It provides an accurate and uncomplicated platform that is clearly comprehensive for all levels of trader. It cuts though the time wasting miniscule details to provide a stream line analysis of market information. It aids traders to channel their strength into more worthwhile and important projects rather then consume them with pages of unnecessary data. This project opens up possibilities for newcomers who are just entering the exchange trade, serving as a powerful, reliable user friendly tool.  Thanks to the abilities of neural networks, NeuroBot is constantly learning to better correspond to the state of the market, to make more accurate forecasts and improve the quality of the resulting work.  Why invest in NEB tokens? Starting from 1 January 2018, we will introduce a paid subscription to the forecasts. The cost of the annual package would be 1200$ (or 4 ETH, 16000 NEB). Due to the fact that the number of crypto traders is increasing every day, our service will be in high demand. As well as the payment of forecasts we will make in tokens NEB, the exchange rates NEB tokens will grow along with the development of our project.  Also soon we will develop a trading bot for Bitfinex. The bot will automatically trade based on the forecasts from the neural network.
