There are many potentials that a cryptocurrency with smart-contract function can do. Decentralized movemen can also be effective in Intellectual Property industry.   Let us see what changes are being made by a new dedicated blockchain team in South Korea.  NPER is a project that solves the problem and stereotypes in intellectual property industry. It will protect the right of the creators, and provide a new business model. The main goal of NPER project is to build a global IP Peer to Peer Trade & Investment Platform through blockchain.

The role of the decentralization on intellectual property industry can be breaking the monopolized structure. For example, in Korea, more than 80% of the revenue goes to the agencies such as streaming company or producing company. The artists only gets few percentage of the revenue from their copyright. This is mainly because the copyright structure is highly centralized.  However, if we decentralize this structure, we can give more profit and opportunity to the creators. Let's say we buy the song or any other form of work from the creator, and give them an NPER token. Creators can work on other pieces, or even help themselves for livelihood with the money they get from exchanging NPER token into USD, just because they have the ""right"" to get the profits. They will have much more profits then before. At least it won't be 4~10% as I gave you the example in Korea above.  Meanwhile, investors, or fans can own the copyright of the music with NPER token. Without ""the middleman"" or centralized copyright structure, all of these can happen with the centralization of IP. In addition to it, only few can invest on centralized IP, but with NPER, everyone can invest on decentralized IP as IP will be transformed into ""invest-able digitalized asset"" called ""NPER coin"".  Also, trades will be freely conducted with peer to peer system. IP1 can be sent from person A to Person B, and IP1 can be divided into numerous parts with NPER token. It is a matter of how many % a token holder is holding for IP1 or etc.  Hope my example helped! You can see the actual diagrams and figures that I mentioned above on our whitepaper at our webpage as well!  -NPER project (http://nper.io)  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So, can you tell me about what is the role of the decentralized to the intellectual property industry?
