A few decades ago, text-only input was the height of interactivity. Now we have augmented reality devices and a booming industry that earned over $36 billion in 2017.  Modern technology allows for more immersive experiences, but it also opens the door for aggressive monetization. Game design now takes a backseat to microtransactions and loot boxes, threatening the fun and innovation of video games in the name of pleasing company shareholders.  Enjin Coin has a plan to set the gaming industry back on track. The blockchain project lets developers integrate Enjin Coin into games to essentially replace in-app currencies. Items purchased through the platform are then stored in the user’s wallet, giving them full control and ownership over every item.  Enjin Coin also gives guilds, fan communities, and esports teams access to monetization tools. Minecraft groups are already using Enjin Coin to power virtual marketplaces. Fans get new items and new experiences, and server managers are always able to pay the bills.  Giving players a sense of value and ownership is crucial to the continued success of the gaming industry. It puts attention on the experience of games, not monetization tactics. Players will see real value in owning a piece of their favorite franchise. If game developers want to capitalize on that, all they have to do is give the players what they want: more great games https://www.investinblockchain.com/enjin-coin-disrupting-gaming/",False

Minecraft Plugin. Unity SDK. Godot SDK. Trusted Platform API. Wallet Updates (Gaming Support / Exchange System). All Smart Contracts are going live in early July. Those contracts are packed with functionality and some of the most complex contracts on Ethereum. We have built a token system that is far more powerful and flexible than anything out there. We’ve gone way beyond our roadmap and white paper.  It's only been 6 months. Projects like this usually require 3-5 years to reach proper maturity. That’s a normal timeline for most early supporters going into startups. Instead we’re accelerating and compacting a massive roadmap into 1 year and we’re achieving it this year.  We're moving faster and far more aggressively than other teams (including billion dollar market cap teams). The price is not a reflection of our progress or marketing, that’s a different topic with its own analysis (think of price as an opportunity to enter or leave the project). We're here to do our mission and we will continue to forge ahead in creating a world-class blockchain platform for game developers and gamers.  In the time since we originally planned our roadmap, we realized that existing scaling projects (Raiden, Plasma) had undefined timelines and might not even perform the types of transactions that we'd need for gaming. We have formed a new all-star team to work on Efinity, and we've been making a lot of progress in research & development of our unique scaling solution. We've been keeping quiet about this for now, since our initial releases will be to internal beta game developers.  Our communication and marketing has always been about educating game developers about how blockchain can radically improve their games, and sharing our roadmaps and progress with the community.",False

CoinSpot — Aussies Rejoice!  CoinSpot is Australia’s largest and most popular cryptocurrency exchange.  The main reason it’s so popular is because it’s simple, easy-to-use and local, putting a heavy emphasis on domestic clients — Australians can make fast exchanges, and avoid transfer and currency exchange fees to get much better value for money on CoinSpot than elsewhere.  CoinSpot is well-established — it was founded in 2013, has long-held reputation for reliability, and is also a member of ADCA — the Australian Digital Commerce Association.  CoinSpot is the first direct way to purchase and sell Enjin Coin with and for fiat currency — Australian dollars.  Qryptos — Built for Traders QRYPTOS is a high performance crypto-only trading exchange and secure ICO listing platform, serving token issuers, crypto traders and ICO participants in the new crypto economy. QRYPTOS is built by QUOINE, a leading global blockchain fintech company with offices in Japan, Singapore and Vietnam.  QRYPTOS is regulated by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (JFSA), and oriented towards experienced cryptocurrency traders.  Cobinhood — 0% Trading Fees Cobinhood is a cryptocurrency service platform that provides cryptocurrency trading and ICO underwriting.  It was created with the average institutional and retail investor and trader in mind. As the world’s first zero fee high frequency cryptocurrency exchange, it aims to maximize return on investment for all customers.  CoinRail — The Korean Exchange Launched on late 2017, CoinRail is a cryptocurrency exchange that has the largest variety of coins in South Korea.  Like most local exchanges, Coinrail also supports only South Korean Won. They accept Korean bank transfers require and do not charge fees on deposits.  This is an obvious advantage, especially for locals, as they can directly buy cryptocurrency with cash.  https://blog.enjincoin.io/coinspot-qryptos-cobinhood-and-coinrail-list-enjin-coin-9ff9f9a7e52e",False

This is the first time Enjin has joined forces with an esports organisation, as it felt the need to get involved before it becomes a even bigger market – and rightfully so.  Maxim Blagov, Enjin Coin CEO said this of the partnership: “We have been exploring the eSports market for some time now and have been waiting for the perfect partner. The incredible success and rapid growth of NRG eSports since its founding, coupled with their organization meticulous focus on strategy and innovation that clearly represents the future of esports made them the obvious choice.”  The collaboration will see NRG spread the word of Enjin Coin, as well as educating its rapidly-growing following on gaming cryptocurrency and introducing the Enjin Wallet (which is described as “the most secure mobile wallet in the world.”)  Ilija Rolovic, Enjin Coin CMO explained the role NRG has in the partnership a little further. “NRG eSports will help us introduce Enjin Coin to a massive, engaged, hard-core gaming audience — and be the first in a wave of gaming organizations and communities that will use our technology to galvanize their fans.” It sounds as if Enjin Coin may add other organisations to its list of partners further down the line.  NRG will create a custom token with its own branding on it, and will then distribute it to fans of the organisation in an attempt to spread awareness and to reward engagement. These tokens will be used for entering raffles and winning prizes, whether it’s visiting an event, receiving gaming hardware, or receiving professional training.  NRG already counts EventsDC, Republic of Gamers, Logitech, Twitch, and Amazon Coins among its partners. Competing in titles such as Fortnite, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Overwatch, Rocket League, Hearthstone, For Honor, Vainglory, and Smite, NRG is one of the biggest organisations in esports.  Esports Insider says: We’re intrigued to see how NRG and Enjin Coin look to influence fans and spectators to embrace cryptocurrency over time. Using incentives and prizes makes complete sense, but it’ll have to be done well to not feel forced.  http://www.esportsinsider.com/2018/02/nrg-esports-enjin-coin-partnership/",False

Our gaming lives are not our own.  We’re bound by rules made by others.  We are told there is a natural order to virtual worlds, and that those who try to upend it do not fare well.  We’re told that corporate and individual greed is the way things are, and will remain until the end of times.  We are told that no matter what we do, it will never amount to more than a single drop in a limitless ocean.  What is an ocean, but a multitude of drops?  The gaming industry has been corrupted by both malicious players and profit-hungry corporations.  Gaming franchises that used to seize our imaginations have been ruined by the endless stream of poor game design choices fueled by shareholder’s greed.  What used to be an immersive artform is slowly devolving into an endless sequence of limited-time offers, rotten loot boxes and worthless microtransactions designed to squeeze every last drop out of our wallets, making us pay for things we do not own.  Games we play became plagued by the scourge of scammers and hackers that do not care about experiencing imaginary universes, making friends or having fun — their only goal is to make a buck by stealing what was never really ours.  Our gaming lives are not our own — they are chained to centralized, cloud-powered servers, where all the things we worked so hard to build can disappear in an instant of someone else’s selfishness or incompetence.  We dare to dream about a better world.  We want to reignite the spark of creativity that lies in every game developer’s heart, extinguished by years of battling with game monetisation models fueled by greed and monopolies.  We want to help them explore new technologies that can shatter the chains that have kept them beached for so long — and give them the tools and knowledge they need to discover new lands.  We want to unite gamers and game developers under a single banner, so they can become an ocean that will obliterate the old, corrupt structures of the gaming industry — and reshape it into an art form that is made fair and revolutionized by new technologies.  We dream of a world where gamers are unshackled and unbound from a single digital reality, free to roam a myriad of gaming universes while taking their characters and items with them — safely kept inside their own, impenetrable digital vaults.  Actually owning the virtual items they earned or paid for.  A world where gamers are rewarded based on skill, merit, talent and creativity — not on mindless, AI-powered grinding, deceit and forced pay-to-win models.  Where game developers can build new worlds that benefit themselves and gamers at the same time. Where the architects of virtual realities that choose ethics, message and innovation over greed end up being rewarded with player loyalty and support.  Where games played by millions are those that teach us about being human, that explore new game mechanics, enrich our minds and make us feel joy. That help us learn about key subjects like the nature of consciousness, logic, ethics, science, philosophy, art and history.  Our mission is to bring fairness and purpose to gaming.  To enrich gamers experiences, protect them from malicious players and enable them to truly own their items and characters. To help game developers utilize ethical monetisation models that do not prey upon human psychology, but are powered by intrinsic value. To aid them in their quest to discover, explore and create new genres of games that have art at their very core.

Calm down. Relax. Take it easy.  No need to panic.  I’m not saying there will be a cryptocurrency crash of epicly disastrous proportions. A catastrophic burst of a Schrödinger-like crypto bubble.  I’m not claiming that the worst nightmare of every crypto-investor will happen — just that if it does, Enjin Coin would be left standing.  Perhaps stronger than ever.  The Shroud of Gray  I vividly remember a conversation I had with my father — two decades ago.  We were in a crappy, ancient car.  “So… What do you actually sell at your new job, dad?” I asked, restless on the back-seat.  “I sell fog.” he laconically replied.   “Fog?” the 8-year old me followed up.  “Mist. Bottled fog, of sorts. It doesn’t exist, not really. But it has value.” he went on, mysteriously.  A month later, he bought a brand-new ride. To me, the car looked like a freaking spaceship.  A few weeks later, I kinda-sorta realised what the heck his new gig was about. I did not get the fog analogy he used, but the Internet — yeah, I knew everything about it — we got our first modem when I was five.  It was 1998, and he was running an ISP company — selling internet time.  Modems are one thing that I’ll never, ever miss.  As I grew up, I came to understand — and appreciate what my dad meant by “selling fog.” It’s imaginary. It’s fairy dust.  It’s not “real” in a way sand, gold or airplanes are.

We are pleased to announce that the Enjin Smart Wallet is now available for Android devices on Google Play and as an APK download — iOS version will be coming in early Q1 2018.  It Begins with Total Security Imagine having to develop a mobile cryptocurrency wallet that will be used by tens or even hundreds of millions of people across the world.  How can you approach this daunting task?  Where do you even begin?  Security — that’s where.  At the very start, we realized that making the Enjin Smart Wallet as secure as technically possible is our number one priority.  We started with checking out other popular wallets, searching for ideas we could improve upon — and we came out empty-handed and somewhat disappointed. During our analysis and testing, we managed to penetrate most major mobile wallets and extraction of passwords and passphrases was achievable.  It was clear we needed to think out of the box.  We built the Enjin Smart Wallet foundation on top-of-the-line security architecture, took inspiration from hardware wallets, combined our UX/UI and development experience, and went above and beyond to make a mobile app that can turn your smartphone into a hardware-like secure wallet on non-rooted devices.  https://blog.enjincoin.io/the-most-secure-mobile-cryptocurrency-wallet-in-the-world-eb46c9cb16f4",False

Security depends on thorough code review and penetration testing by skilled security researchers, as well as best-practices by the development team.  Open source software in some cases could even bring a false sense of security - as we saw earlier this year with the multiple vulnerabilities in the Parity multi-sig wallet with unimaginable losses of funds (288M).  With the Enjin Wallet we're ensuring that all available hardware and OS security is enabled, creating our own secure Enjin keyboard, using multiple encryption and adding a multitude of our own security innovations to make it near impossible for various types of attacks to work against the wallet.  The Enjin Wallet is the most secure mobile cryptocurrency wallet in the world. No other wallet on the market currently reaches the level of security we’ve implemented (our developers tested and penetrated almost all - password easily seen and passphrases exported). We have gone above and beyond, to an almost obsessive level in regards to securing the Enjin Wallet.  We will be commissioning private reviews over the coming months with trusted security researchers to ensure the wallet remains secure and tested before each new release.

The Enjin Coin channel is not meant for abusing the team and shilling Game Credits. The channel is made for supporters of Enjin Coin. There is a point where the line has been crossed and you will be banned. That line was crossed today. I'll unban you soon, but do not bring up the GAME topic again in our channel (it is not the right place and not on a consistent manner).  You should be far more positive or even neutral towards Enjin Coin than Game, if you care to actually look at our stats, 19 million users community, whitepaper, yellow paper and upcoming Enjin Coin wallet release:  https://www.similarweb.com/website/gamecredits.com?competitors=enjin.com  If you continue to push Game in this thread or in our other official channels, you will be perm banned and your posts removed.

There were clear red flags that I pointed out, and I was happy to see them addressed. (ex. distribution %'s, went from somewhere in the 50s or 60s to mid 80s iirc). I still felt ENJ was asking for too much in the ICO, so I didn't buy in. Although I was very critical of the potential of the ICO, I defended the team against scam accusations from my position as a long time user. I bought in a couple weeks ago near the bottom and have been holding in anticipation of the Minecraft plugin. I've made very positive tweets about ENJ recently. Despite all this shit I'm buying more ENJ if it drops in the 240 range. I'm critical of ENJ, as I am with all my investments. It's stupid not to be critical of your investments or cognizant of your surroundings. With that being said, I respect your request and will not mention GAME on anything related to ENJ.

Bread wallet has good security (we still rate ours much higher due to a few items - such as them requiring the full input of each passphrase word, a keylogger could capture words. During import the Enjin wallet avoids this requirement by having you choose the word after inputting one or two characters). We also have another feature I will not reveal yet (till it's implemented), that significantly provides better security than Bread Wallet and other wallets.

Enjin Coin is a natural progression for our network, so the adoption angle is going to be smooth and will happen. The great advantage we have, is that Enjin spans almost every single game online, from the most obscure to major AAA titles. Once we inject all the features needed to begin adoption, Enjin Coin will literally be touching every game imaginable. We have the ability to disperse Enjin Coin into an incredibly wide network of DIFFERENT gaming audiences and segments. This is critical for gaining true adoption and gives us thousands of chances to make it happen.",False

I understand the price is under the ICO, but it has only been 20 days since the ICO. Our team is working non-stop and we're putting everything we have to making sure we produce the best possible product and cryptocurrency with wide adoption in gaming.  If you believe in us and see our prior history in Enjin (www.enjin.com), we're nothing like other ICOs. The market may not see our full potential yet, but we will get it done and get it done right. Our team is infused with passion and drive. We feel honored to be given this chance in creating the ultimate gaming coin.  We did not value our tokens high, we have a huge network of millions of active gamers that we can adopt the coin into initially. If you compare our marketcap to Game Credits or MGO you can see why I feel we are vastly undervalued.

Enough of that got TONS of newbies into the market, which is why bitcoin is in a bubble and no one can find proper market value for ICO assets.  For the record though, a majority of the ICOs I've been in (TRST, Lunyr, ODN) are still at at least 2x, and Lunyr only dropped briefly and hasn't since gone back down to ICO price.  I've been messing with ICO's since the DAO, which was only the 2nd major one. This pattern of crappy ICO performance fiat-wise is a newer phenomenon, in what's still a new technology/market anyway. And many are saying it's due to everyone being bullish for BTC. But I've seen various patterns now each occurring for a few months give or take. It used to be everytime bitcoin was bullish alts were bearish then for like 2 months there EVERY TIME bitcoin got bullish every other asset it seemed was going green as the noobs scrambled to get into crypto.  It's nice for the long run of crypto, but I'm telling you now bitcoin is not worth $8,000.... no matter what anyone says about bitcoin being superior, at this point it's a first-to-market thing. Let the hip billionaires ruin bitcoin who cares but with all these ICO's now, only 1 or 2 from each category is going to make it. I'm hoping Enj is the token people think about when they think about cryptos merging with games, but it could end up being anyone. I mostly wish that teams would account for the pricing with regards to utility, so you don't end up sitting here with 2 cent coins you paid 7 cents for.  Long term though, the second that the coins are actually utilized in real world, the growth will be natural. I'd rather see ENJ go from 2 cents to 25 cents over 2 years than what's happened to bitcoin...and I held bitcoin until I couldn't stomach it. It's no longer a novel technology, it's a get rich quick scheme. ENJ could be a way for tons of people to get into crypto who would've otherwise never gave a crap about bitcoin.  Also, would users have to buy enj and then deposit to their server/admin and it's credited as their in game stuff, or is it developers who buy tons of coins and sell them as in game items to then buy more enj?  Last year how many of the world's elite were talking shit on BTC, and now they're advising 10-25% of ones portfolio...god it's sickening.

The first time i managed to get out with minor profits but this time i dont think i am going to make it. This is a very bad and most probably very whales-manipulated coin investment. This whole ""hey guys buy some more and do some trading in order to win"" binance competition was very fishy from the start but i skipped the ""trading"" part of it and bought a lot at the peak ( 417 sat ).  What the competition want to accomplish is simply enhance day to day trading , which means that the price will not moon as we were all expecting , but instead will plummit with the help of short trades. The competitions' terms state that , i am just reading between the lines here and try to rationalize.  Promoting trades and assigning prizes to top 100 traders is very different to promoting a simple purchase in order to be on top 100 , as i initialy thought it was the case.  Keep in mind the prizes.. Top winners will get for free hundred of thousand of coins. Which they will most probably dump immediately leading the coin to even lower levels.  I believe that by the end of the ""competition"" the coins price will be at least 150-200 satoshi , thus helping the big whales to buy in at the lowest possible price. I fear that we are being just manipulated once more by Binance exhange. I have made a bad choice unfortunately and the only thing to do left is just wait when and if the coin will reach those levels agains.. Probably by another manipulative tactic..

You've done a greta job with the marketing.  Big reason why I plan on HODL - The minecraft portion alone is a massive deal. Integration so the common Joe is using it.  The one thing I would really appreciate seeing though is a more strong approach to force users to buy using Enji coins only not other Cryptos that are accepted. Preferably something along the lines of you can deposit the Ethereum but it is immediatly converted to Enji.  I saw some areas saying you will be allowing Ethereum to be a focus not JUST Enji.  If you are forcing users to use ENji only not offering Eth - you are increasing market orders ... Increasinng value. Hoping I misread this and you do plan on only offering Enji with the platform - not JUST offering incentives for using it. Any clarification on this would be appreciated.  Also, with the bonus etc I'm thrown off. But we can all tell (at this point) there is no doubt the ICO will hit it's target.  So what will be the market cap ? What will be the true value of each coin we have ? From what I understand it is essentially a dime per coin ?  I assume it wil probably list around $.15 - $.20 if that's the case. Like most coins there will be an immediate drop by the next day... some stabilization and then 'hopefully' a run up within the week - and go from there.  Market cap is my biggest question. With the bonus ICO and presale coins etc I'm a bit thrown off on all that ... Some people got lucky and got them for $.05 already in the presale. Kudos to them !! They're in a no way to lsoe situation",False

Sale and trade of virtual items in multiplayer gaming communities is huge. A good example of this would be Team Fortress 2. Even though the goods in TF2 technically are not supposed to be traded for real money - the selling and trading of TF2 items is a huge deal. There are many websites dedicated to trade of items in this game alone and interestingly enough use very rare items as a form of currency with uncommon items as a fraction of that currency.  Having a legitimate cryptocurrency dedicated to virtual items for one thing would help stabilize prices, prevent fraud, help prevent theft, and even allow trading of items - where the company that owns the game forbids trading for actual money. This is particularly where it's going to explode. This will effect companies such as Steam in certain ways for sure. But it does NOT have to be negative. They just have to evolve. Steam doesn't want you to pay another gamer for an item he/she may have, because they sell that item themselves for real cash in the Steam store. So, gamers who trade in TF2 can only trade with another item of equal value. This gets complicated and theft happens regularly. If a gamer has a certain gun that I may want, but I don't have the necessary items to trade with. I can either A. buy the item in the steam store and then trade. B. Buy that gun myself. C. Buy it from that gamer with Enjin through a dedicated trading site. D. Buy it directly from that gamer via wallet to wallet transaction with Enjin. Enjin makes it easier. But this is grey right, because, now in a way I'm cheating Steam. If they evolve to incorporate Enjin into their service - they could earn dividends from trading while at the same time they could also use Enjin for contests, rewards, etc. Also by keeping control of trading - they earn their dividend from providing extra security against fraud/theft. My understanding might still be limited, but this is how I see it.  For many games, micro transactions will also be easier with a dedicated currency. So will trading of items between multiple games.  I'd type much more sorry, but I have class tomorrow and am tired.  In short: Enjin knows what they're doing and this is something even I thought about long ago (not as a currency, but pondering some sort of system for improved sale/trade of virtual items). If I could afford it, I'd be buying tons of ENJ right now, but I'm happy with the starter amount I have. And, this is my opinion. I personally believe if you invest into ENJ, you will be making a good choice.",False

Sadly those domains are registered on some horrible registrants without livechat so before the crowdsale ends, there's no way that those domains get closed. Maybe that is a lesson learned to always check the domain and many sources before sending any money. Getting 100k$ seems much easier than i have ever thought  The positive thing is ""612M / 800M ENJ SOLD"" so within few days the crowdsale will end i think.",False

Sometimes you are better off doing nothing and sometimes its the other way.  I suggest you keep 500 Ether as is, and do not invest anywhere else and just hold them for the next few years, they may one day be sufficient for you to by yourself a new house.  The other 500 Ether you bucket into 20 blocks of 25 Ether each, and over time look at alternate investments and ICOs, with each ICO you put in max of 25 Ether, so even if you pick a not so good one, your risk is limited. Apart from ICOs you could also put the 25 ETH into already listed Alt coin which are trading below ICO price after doing your research.  As for Enjin ICO, its a good one within the gaming space.

Enjin Coin, the Ethereum-based gaming cryptocurrency finished its token pre-sale with over $12 million USD contributed in Ether (38,800 ETH).    400 Million tokens were sold, with an additional 100 Million ENJ in bonuses.  CEO Maxim Blagov reflected on their success, saying “We spent months getting feedback and planning out the important features gamers actually need. I think that’s why this has been so successful. People are asking us about the upcoming October crowdsale every day now — they just can’t get enough Enjin Coins!”  The popular website creation platform hosts over 250,000 websites and 18.8 million users at the time of writing. Their highly anticipated Enjin Coin pre-sale reached its maximum token goal with over 4200 individual contributors.  “We’re starting development immediately!” said Witek Radomski, Technical Director at Enjin. “I can’t wait to combine blockchain with game assets, and to see the new experiences that games and Enjin communities can build.”  The Enjin team plans to develop their Smart Wallet and game plugin by the end of the year. “We want to bring this technology to Minecraft first because these servers already sell digital items every day. Minecraft is almost like a game creation platform, and each server has its own unique items, economy, and game mechanics!” said Lilia Pritchard, community manager.   Last chance during crowdsale in October   The last opportunity for gamers to get their hands on some Enjin Coins is during the public crowdsale, scheduled for October 3rd at 12:00 UTC. Approximately 300 Million ENJ remain for the crowdsale, and afterwards will only be available on exchanges and by trading with other gamers.  The crowdsale will run for a maximum of 4 weeks, with the maximum amounts of coins offered to early buyers:  Week 1: 1 ETH = 6,000 ENJ Week 2: 1 ETH = 5,000 ENJ Week 3: 1 ETH = 4,000 ENJ Week 4: 1 ETH = 3,000 ENJ  The contribution address and details will be provided before the sale begins.  Pre-sale contributor tokens   The very first Enjin Coins will be distributed to pre-sale contributors between October 1st to 3rd. Transfer of the tokens will be locked until the public crowdsale finishes.  Enjin is currently in talks with multiple cryptocurrency exchanges to allow trading of ENJ and other currencies. Tidex and Bancor have both been confirmed and will offer liquidity to Enjin Coin traders.   Read more at: https://medium.com/@coinfork/enjin-coin-pre-sale-sells-out-at-12m-db45261e3dd7",False

Enjin Coin reduces fraud because cryptocurrency transactions are decentralized and irreversible. Merchants won't need to deal with chargebacks when players buy items in the economy. Also, players can't lose their items if their game account is banned or compromised. For transactions between players, we will have an escrow system. This is enforced by a smart contract so that each player gets exactly what they are expecting in any item/currency trade.  We're starting by developing plugins for Minecraft, Unturned (Rocketmod) and possibly ARK depending on viability. When we have the Minecraft MVP and Java API ready, we can start engaging with game developers and showing them demos of this in action and the SDK itself.  Enjin Coins will be distributed to pre-sale contributors on October 1st-3rd, and we're trying to get a min. viable product out by the end of the year! Trying to have it fully playable and live in Minecraft in January.",False

Guys, seriously, do you even have a lawyer engaged for this process? You absolutely CANNOT make these kinds of statements!  You could say these tokens will be burned, you can say they would not be sold within a particular timeframe, or that they will not be sold for less than the ICO price, but you can't say they will be sold for a declared value in excess of the ICO price. That renders the process a sale of a financial instrument and contravenes the securities laws of most jurisdictions in the world by way of asserting that there will be a future profitable value to them.  You risk potentially serious consequences in being so careless with how you're handling such matters. Get a lawyer to explain all this to you!  The web-site now says :  ""Any unsold tokens are locked for 6 months and will not be sold under public price.""  Which seems better.   Kapyong",False

Enjin already has a thriving community network of 18 millions gamers and sees ~60 million global views per month, which will naturally speed ENJ adoption. Thousands of Minecraft servers use our Minecraft plugin and store module for selling virtual items daily, and tens of thousands of active gaming communities across 100’s of games use our cms, points systems, donations, ranks, and are hungry for a real value based connection between their in-game items and communities.  For game developers:  We're developing a cross-platform suite of software around Enjin Coin that make it easy for game developers to add blockchain to their games. Adding proper virtual items trading to a game takes more work than most game developers are willing to invest, so having a ready-to-go item platform will make it very appealing. Depending on the scale and complexity of the game, the developer may choose to use the game SDK, or simply use the Platform API for a simpler way to manage items and transactions. The API will not be centralized but hosted by multiple parties, so gamers can choose which platforms they trust.  We're focusing on ease of use for end users. We want to bring blockchain mainstream by making it extremely simple to use the wallet, allowing in-game purchases, trading and interaction while putting all the complexity into the background. The Smart Wallet will be the key to smooth adoption in gaming.  Our smart contracts are designed around the features gamers need. The Escrow smart contract will allow for safe transactions of game items between players with a simple user-interface. The subscription system will allow for true Paypal-like subscriptions with cryptocurrency. The payment gateway will allow for any group to setup multiple payees, enforced by the smart contract, which prevents leadership conflicts or takeovers.  All these and many other features, together, create a total solution for virtual items and virtual currency, that as a whole cannot be matched by any other solution in the space.",False

Been there but my items where sold secretly due to rules and regulations.",False

Same transaction price for both, regardless of value. The quantity or ENJ price of the items doesn't affect the transaction fees. I admit the fees are somewhat high at the moment but we are watching the progress on the Raiden update. We're aware that the fees must be very lower for this to work seamlessly with thousands of items and we have a few fallbacks to work on in case Raiden doesn't pan out as expected.  Quote Let's say i'm playing an MMO, my sword would be stored in a ETH smart contract wallet, there's no way someone would take that item away from me since it's locked into a smart contract correct?  Yes, this is one of the major advantages of using cryptocurrency for items. Game developers cannot remove your items, and even if your game or platform account is hacked, nothing can be taken from you. The responsibility is to keep your computer secure, but smart contract wallets can at least provide protection against total loss. Even if the game developer ""nerfs"" the item type completely, the reserve ENJ value is insurance against some of the loss. Or if the game / game server's database is wiped, they can come online again with everyone still owning their most important items.  Quote Could collectible items be stored into a vault? Locked for X periods of times?  I'm not 100% sure if I understand what you mean, but if you are talking about cold storage of items, yes they can be transferred to a paper wallet or hardware wallet. You may even be able to use cold storage items in-game with some limitations (no trading). Let me know if you meant something else.  Quote Back in the Warcraft days, distribution of consumables was a little tedious, it would be great if the guild bank could just send all the consumables before raid time automatically and users could just send materials to the guild bank, then the bank could send those materials to the people that craft what's needed.  Awesome, I love this idea. The guild's event calendar could be set up with an automation trigger to distribute consumables 1 hour before the event. I'm noting that down for a future update to the Raid events in the Enjin event calendar.  Quote It could go as far as people taking "" contracts "" in the guild and get paid in guild funds for that contract.  We need 10,000 Blue Ore, will pay X per stack, 5 people can split this contract, if they fail to complete the contract, they forgo their share.  I think there's an unlimited amount of ways this could make running a guild 100x more efficient,  running a guild was extremely tedious and i haven't even touched the DKP system.  This is another great use-case and something we should consider in the Escrow contract, multiple payees and payout splits depending on the number of participants OR the number of resources committed. I'll look into this while designing the item Escrow system. Thank you for the suggestions!",False

The C# SDK is planned for Q1 2018 and Unity should be a fairly simple extension to that. Depending on game developer partnerships leading into late September we may update the roadmap with an updated timeline for certain SDKs.  Quote Also if i am not wrong Google Play Doesn't allows the developers to use any other payment gateway except their own one for In Game Purchases, how do you plan to tackle that?    Google Play's terms may not apply, depending on the way Enjin Coin is used inside games. Some key things to remember are that this platform can be used to represent game items, not necessarily as a payment gateway. The mobile game does not need to connect to an Ethereum node directly, and could sync game assets using each game developer's Platform API instead if Ethereum poses a problem. Decentralized game items could be supported on other websites and platforms, which satisfies the second sub-point in those terms.

Games with very transient items like the ones you mentioned may continue to implement them as a temporary item on their servers. Where I see the benefit of Enjin Coin in those games are things like dog-tags for player kills across any server, an in-game currency, vanity items, and possibly consumables.  We are also brainstorming how best to implement no-drop items and will update the whitepaper when we've nailed that down.  What Enjin Coin does allow for is new gameplay experiences that weren't previously possible on any platform. The dog-tags system is a fun idea, and it would be fun to see decentralized ""kill trophy"" dog tags handed out for various types of achievements, either by partnered games and/or tournament platforms - or by unaffiliated collectives of gamers. You'd have notorious gamers wearing them as status badges which could be later adopted into various games and websites as these systems become popular.",False

I stated our overall traffic is growing since April 2017 (as per Quantcast data) and our Client Base is growing and bigger than ever. By Client Base I mean paying and free clients (The Owners of communities, NOT the members of a community), there is a huge distinction between the two. Clients pay us for our plans here: https://www.enjin.com/pricing and can also join on the Free Plan. Clients are the users who make communities and virtual stores on Enjin. We don't control who joins the various communities. That's highly dependent on the client managing the community and the games currently peaking in that year. (Minecraft made an insane peak in 2014 compared to all other games)  Each Client on Enjin creates a website / mobile community (free or paid) on our network, that community receives traffic as per Quantcast monitoring (The mobile stats are not reflected here!).  My point is this, we have more clients but they receive less traffic. Each community is smaller in user count, therefore there is less traffic directed to that community. This is not indicative of Client or Community count on Enjin! Yes you can say they are correlated to some extent, but this is not the case when you have a catalyst like Minecraft (the biggest most hyped game) in 2014 pushing insane user traffic towards Client communities.  Why are Clients on Enjin showing less web traffic in 2017 than in 2014? here are the 3 main factors:  The Enjin Mobile apps! Mobile is taking over web traffic everywhere. Here are our apps: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.enjin.mobile&hl=en and https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/enjin-community-for-gamers/id1103331595?mt=8 Minecraft Hype - Minecraft traffic peaking in 2014 - Clients had a far larger user base of Minecraft players. Each community gained far more traffic since they had way more active users during the Minecraft hype years. Content modules such as our Wiki Module (used by certain communities), also pushed traffic. The https change, which disguised our recent growth and actual traffic. (See the post Brad posted regarding that)  I hope this clears up the traffic situation. To equate us to a scam because of the traffic changes on our Enjin platform (Minecraft Hype / Enjin Mobile Apps Released / HTTPS) is not fair and baseless. We are still one of the largest gaming website networks in the world based on our current traffic (US RANK 991) and growing in Client numbers and in user traffic (2017). The statistics are very clear on that.  Another note. I'm going to take on-board your criticism regarding the 66% offered to the crowd sale. We've discussed this with our team and advisors over the last few weeks and decided to change the crowdsale percentage to 80%. More details will be posted shortly regarding that.",False

In our announcement and whitepaper we have only advertised our current 2017 traffic. You can see it directly on Quantcast here: https://www.quantcast.com/p-e2f9QTuI7ynec and linked in our Whitepaper here: https://enjincoin.io/enjincoin_whitepaper.pdf  Here is why we’re currently very happy about our traffic ranking:  Quantcast shows us peaking in 2014 and traffic dropping afterward. We had a US traffic rank of 732 in 2014 and now we're at 991 in 2017 (The rank indicates the number of sites receiving more traffic than Enjin. Currently Quantcast measure us as being bigger than all websites in USA minus 990). We can speculate on a few possible reasons for this:  Minecraft's peak was in 2014 and thus a large wave of our traffic followed its popularity (check Google Trends for ""Minecraft""). The casual gamers may have moved off to mobile games or other trends, but the hardcore gamers remain and game oriented businesses remain. Many users have been switching to our Android and iOS Mobile app https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.enjin.mobile&hl=en and https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/enjin-community-for-gamers/id1103331595?mt=8 for accessing Enjin and Enjin Community forums. We've neglected to track our app traffic in our Quantcast traffic statistics. We have opened a conversation with Quantcast now to see about tracking this. Our traffic follows game popularity and cycles, with Minecraft being the biggest video gaming phenomenon the world has seen in 2014. We haven't encountered an game yet even close to Minecraft's popularity, but we're continuing to look for new opportunities and branching into new games, with smaller traffic but passionate communities. We changed to HTTPS across tens of thousands of communities, here is the reply Brad (our network engineer) posted to you:      Our Traffic is growing since April, including our Mobile Apps traffic. Here are the latest stats, which we provided to you and can be checked on Quantcast:   Our actual network traffic from April to now:   https://www.quantcast.com/p-e2f9QTuI7ynec#trafficCard  In USA we are 1007th in traffic, 776th in the UK 618th in Canada 394th in Germany 269th in Brazil, and so on  We made all the above clear in the thread, but you kept insisting that we have no real traffic, that our staff are not real (we even invited you to meet us in person or on video chat), even after we clearly and repeatedly explained and provided answers.   So, here's the situation, if you continue to delete my posts instead of providing full and frank answers to the issues I am raising  The only posts we deleted are the dupes you kept posting, while ignoring our answers. But I hope this discussion clears everything up.  Now, we are planning features for a number of new games, and we're working on some huge updates to the CMS platform, this includes Enjin Coin, a new frontend, and more updates to our mobile apps. We're here for the long game - we love gaming, and we are trying to innovate by bringing a blockchain item platform to gamers.  You can't expect a 9 year long continual growth curve to be the only factor for success, there are cycles in traffic and markets, just like our current cycle of growth starting in April. We are still clearly ranked as one of the biggest networks online. Minecraft was huge temporary growth, there was no way to retain all those users, and now we're back to pre-Minecraft hype with a better product overall. Despite World of Warcraft being much smaller now that it was a few years ago, we've replaced all those users.

We’re calling it Enjin Coin, and it’s an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain.  You can check out our info-graphic for an overview of our idea, and the official whitepaper for the in-depth concept.  In this article, I’ll begin by talking about the Custom Coins feature and how virtual assets will benefit gamers, developers and community owners.  Creating game items  The core purpose of the platform is to create and sell virtual assets. Enjin Coin allows you to create new tokens called Custom Coins. They represent any kind of game item, currency, or permission token.  To create a new custom coin, you begin by defining some parameters:  Name Icon Maximum Supply Exchange Rate Decimal Places   This creates a mint contract for your coin on the blockchain. A mint contract can receive and store Enjin Coins, and produces the new custom token in return.  You might create a custom coin called “Emerald” and set the exchange rate to 5 ENJ per Emerald. 5 Enjin Coins are sent and stored inside the mint to create each Emerald.    All custom coins are backed with ENJ, which gives the tokens liquidity. Anyone holding the custom token could send it back to the original mint contract to receive the Enjin Coins that were used to produce it.  You’ll notice that this is similar to a reserve currency — but with the guarantee of the smart contract adhering to the exchange rate rules. In an upcoming article, we will explore the options for increasing value and inflation as a Custom Coin becomes worth more in the economy.  By default most creators will lock the ability to mint Custom Coins to only themselves, but the access settings can also permit anyone to mint new assets.  Why represent game items with Custom Coins?  Practically all games today use an internal, centralized database to represent items. It’s fast and cheap, and it’s been the standard for decades — but there are some compelling reasons to look to using the blockchain instead.  The world is becoming more decentralized.  Just like the move from hard-drive backups to cloud storage, people are now moving their assets to the decentralized internet. Bitcoin, along with Ethereum and other innovative blockchain technologies have had over 8 years to evolve and enter the public consciousness. We are in the midst of an explosion of decentralization.  It’s creeping into every aspect of our lives: from identity, to law, to politics and medical research. People are recognizing the security and sovereignty of the public ledger and they will begin to demand it anywhere they commit their time and money.  Virtual worlds are becoming part of people’s identities.  With players often spending hundreds or thousands of hours in a single online game, they are investing a lot of energy into their virtual characters and assets. If players had full ownership of these assets, they would value them more. Assets gained years earlier could also increase in value and draw the players back into the game.  Player accounts have been accidentally wiped in many games:  An Entire MMO Was Accidentally Erased From the Internet And you think server downtime is bad. Spare a thought for players of Japanese/Korean MMO M2, which thanks to a little…kotaku.com  Dragon Nest MMO loses two years of player data - Geek.com Massively-multiplayer online games are one of the most difficult games to get right and keep running.

We need a system where players have full control and ownership over their virtual assets.  Payment fraud, trust and security  Merchants suffer from a lot of payment fraud. It is estimated that for every legitimate virtual purchase made, there are 7.5 virtual items lost to fraud. This can be drastically improved because of the reliability of transactions on the blockchain.  Persistence between different games and communities  A glance at any self-respecting gamer’s Steam collection will show you tens (if not hundreds) of games. Even hardcore MMO enthusiasts will drop into new games for some novel variety.  If a player loses interest in a certain game, their assets would normally be left to decay, devoid of all value. At best, their old account might be sold off on eBay, if the game developer doesn’t outright ban such activities.  With each new game, players have to start from scratch, and while this is often an interesting element of gameplay, it shouldn’t be the only option available. Imagine being able to play in different games that share economies and certain item types between their game-worlds. This opens many possibilities for new game experiences that haven’t been explored yet by game developers!  Decentralized assets will create more realistic game economies  Using cryptocurrencies will allow for free markets in games. Trading in-and-out of the game itself. Since the currency cannot be manipulated or banned by arbitrary game rules, it will behave and feel more like a real economy. This can make games much more immersive, and it’s something that’s been missing in gaming for a long time.  Game companies might need to plan carefully when allocating items, but it reflects the real world better. Players will truly value their game assets.  Access and Privilege tokens  Custom coins can be used for access in a game or website.  For example, a custom “Chest Key” token could be required to open chests containing rare items in a game. On a website, a “Forum Post” token could allow users to create a single post in a VIP forum per token spent. The website owner may sell a limited number of “Ad” tokens that allow uploading an ad to the news page or message board. These could be traded further by players.   The integration between games and websites allows for some powerful privilege dynamics between the two platforms.  Final Thoughts  The gaming world is ready to experience a revolution in decentralized game assets and currency with Custom Coins on the blockchain. We’ve only scratched the surface of features that could be implemented into future games when real asset ownership is introduced.  Please read our Whitepaper to read about all the features, and visit the Enjin Coin website to be updated on the progress of this exciting token!",False

The reason behind this is actually due to us implementing HTTPS (SSL/TLS) as well as the HTTP2 protocol on enjin.com and throughout the Enjin Network during this period of time, something you can verify here. We made the decision to upgrade the network to support HTTP2 (which encompasses the transition to HTTPS) as well as to offer that to our users as a way of improving the security of the network - something that we take very seriously - in addition to improving the speed of the network which is a direct benefit of moving to the HTTP2 protocol.  It wasn't a light decision as we had previously read articles (linked below) regarding the transition between the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. We knew it could have quite a major impact on our traffic metrics. However, we ultimately knew that this would be short-term, in the grand scheme of things, whilst all of the redirects from the indexed HTTP pages to HTTPS began taking effect in which it'd eventually begin to recover again.  You can read one of the articles that we reviewed whilst implementing support for HTTPS and HTTP2 below: http://searchengineland.com/google-makes-penalty-mistakes-buffer-story-203591  Likewise, a new - more recent - article has arisen which shows that this is still a persistent problem with changing from HTTP to HTTPS. http://www.seoblog.com/2017/07/rankings-drop-https-ssl/  Ultimately, yes - the transition did have an impact on our traffic metrics and may still have an impact for another few months although, it was an essential step to take and it will eventually recover.  Should you be interested in our true network-wide ranking, you can see our network-wide statistics via our Quantcat page, located here.

Hi Witekn, thank you for taking the time of responding.   1. Transaction fees are currently in Ether, around 2 cents worth of fees per transaction and confirmation within approx 40-90 seconds.

There is no difference in transacting Items or Currencies as they are based on the same token design.  Okay, a few follow up questions, i hope these also help my fellow players.  Scenario Player 1 Owns; -Item A (Wand) = 100 ENJ -Item B (Armor) = 1000 ENJ  Trade Item A to Player 2 = Cost, 2 cents Trade Item B to Player 2 = Cost, 2 cents?  Does the worth of items or quantity of items change the transaction fees?   2. Items will be stored in an Ethereum smart contract wallet - it can be set up with spending thresholds for a basic level of security. For the long term, items can be stored in any Ethereum wallets such as MyEtherWallet - which means you could put them into cold storage. To use them in game, you'd want to put those items into your Enjin Smart Wallet. We'll look at the possibility for items in 'cold' wallet accounts to be recognized in games, but it would be more limited.   Let's say i'm playing an MMO, my sword would be stored in a ETH smart contract wallet, there's no way someone would take that item away from me since it's locked into a smart contract correct?  Could collectible items be stored into a vault? Locked for X periods of times?   3. Yes, communities can configure shared accounts to be used as a guild bank - we're planning a number of features around this and I'd like to hear your use-case further.   Back in the Warcraft days, distribution of consumables was a little tedious, it would be great if the guild bank could just send all the consumables before raid time automatically and users could just send materials to the guild bank, then the bank could send those materials to the people that craft what's needed.  It could go as far as people taking "" contracts "" in the guild and get paid in guild funds for that contract.  We need 10,000 Blue Ore, will pay X per stack, 5 people can split this contract, if they fail to complete the contract, they forgo their share.  I think there's an unlimited amount of ways this could make running a guild 100x more efficient,  running a guild was extremely tedious and i haven't even touched the DKP system.",False

The key reason we decided to start developing this coin, is due to the fact that we can create instant adoption on our huge network of 18 million gamers and 250k communities that span thousands of games (significantly towards AAA games). The other key reason, is we believe our concept as defined in the whitepaper will create near infinite use cases in a variety of game markets and situations.  https://enjincoin.io/enjincoin_whitepaper.pdf  We understand that no huge publishers will utilize (EA/Sony/Microsoft) this coin immediately without the correct market environment and toolsets provided.  Unlike other game coins, our plan is realistically achievable and will succeed. We are forming a step by step process to achieving mass adoption and utilization by big publishers.  The first step, is to quickly initiate mass adoption on our network of 250K communities and game servers (we already provide them with plugins, websites and web / in-game stores). This will be smoothly achieved, as we built the Enjin Platform and control every part of it.  https://www.enjin.com  The second step will be to attract indie game developers, game celebrities and content creators to utilize this coin, this step will be easily achieved once adoption begins to peak on Enjin and other networks. Millions of users will hold and utilize Enjin Coin at this stage, so forming partnerships with larger entities will become logically attainable without much difficulty.  Finally, due to creating a wider adoption network across many thousands of communities, servers and indie games, we can approach huge publishers with enough positive market forces and proven frameworks and toolsets.  We’re working on all 3 steps simultaneously and will be releasing key news regarding that soon.

You're asking for many millions in investment from the public and yet three of your team slated for a share of the pre-mine are not easily found as actual people on the web. Given their stated roles and experience I would have expected to be able to find them quite easily somewhere on social media. I am asking that you provide a little more to substantiate your claims regarding who your team are.  Quote from: WitekRadomski on July 28, 2017, 07:59:18 PM we don't intend to drop tokens on the market. We're happy to time-lock the release of the partnership tokens over 18-24 months with as we intend to release them very slowly, to promote adoption of ENJ over many years. That isn't the point. You are still structuring your ICO in such a way that investors are facing a 50% 'tax' on their investment as a result of the 34% pre-mine being retained by you. Citing that other ICO's have done worse is not a rebuttal. You're still requiring that the investor pay both for the project to be funded directly as well as accept said 'tax' in order to pay both for the team 'bonuses' (which isn't unreasonable, per se), AND for making payments to collaborators and communities. Why are you not simply budgeting for the collaborators/community costs through the main token sale funds?  Quote from: WitekRadomski on July 28, 2017, 07:59:18 PM Regarding the 18% Team/Advisors portion of the coins, we have a lot of people working on Enjin Coin, and 18% gives everyone here a fair stake in the project. Either you have people who form your team, in which case they need to be listed in order for the public to know where that 18% allocation is to go - in that you're not requiring they simply trust your word that it'll be disbursed to legitimate team members only, or you have other people, those who 'collaborate' and are part of the community, who are supposed to be being paid from the other part of the pre-mine, as mentioned above. You can't just say that 18% is going to go to 'everyone here' and not actually define what and who is meant by that.  Also, with regards to the holding of these many millions, are you intending on having the ICO funds and pre-mine tokens held in trusted third-party escrow, for release as and when required or as milestones are reached? It would add a much-needed layer of oversight to the process.",False

Partnership tokens are going to be directed primarily towards communities that are using in-game items, website points, ranks, and shops. Further, we're partnering specifically with communities who intend to use them as elements of gameplay.  Since the majority of tokens are being distributed to create gameplay incentives, this doesn't dilute the crowdsale token pool very much. Instead, We're creating more opportunities for the tokens to actually be used by gamers. It will create a more vibrant ecosystem! The one thing that I really lament with existing cryptocurrencies is the lack of places to spend and use coins. I would be completely sold on a cryptocurrency if I could use it across thousands of games. Hodling & investing is great, but I want to see coins and tokens move to the next stage of an economy. Gaming is the ultimate platform for this - it's quick and easy to adopt (especially with Enjin Coin), all infrastructure can be built digitally and the risks are very low. Gamers are already familiar with virtual items and currencies and they're ready to run with this in their virtual worlds.  About reserving Enjin Coin tokens versus using the crowdsale funds for this - we want to have adequate tokens available to promote Enjin Coin adoption for years regardless of market behavior and having to buy-back tokens. This is just another way to slice a cake, and we're essentially committing this portion specifically for the purposes above. These reserved tokens are not being dumped on the market for investors, the majority is being directed towards the gaming community for the benefit of the whole.",False

We have a multi-stage coin adoption strategy for the gaming market: The community level (guilds, clans, websites, forums) Game servers - with plugins for popular games (beginning with Minecraft and Unturned) Indie game developers Larger game developers  For each of these four stages, we'll need to use some of the partnership tokens as incentives.  In the short term, for the first two aspects, we are partnering with a selection of gaming communities who will implement Enjin Coin features and rewards into their servers & websites. We've already received hundreds of partnership applications to review. These partners will receive a larger amount of coins monthly with the goal of creating interesting gameplay or rewards with them.  We're also going to distribute small amounts of coins to 30,000 existing gaming communities (the most active ones on the Enjin network).  18% Team/Advisors:  This includes our core team and advisors, and others that have been instrumental in the ongoing project, they work in the background and we haven't mentioned them in the whitepaper. This is to incentivize the original team to put in their absolute best for more than a salary going forward. Many of us here are working 10-12 hour days and weekends because we believe in this project's future. Each team member should have a personal stake in our success.  Crowdsale funds:  The Funding Allocation section in the whitepaper lays out how the crowdsale funds will be used. A large portion (50%) is going towards development and this involves hiring and expanding our development team so we can move much faster. The Enjin social network is a complex project and needs an 8 person team full-time to run it. We are looking to increase - possibly double - our existing team to be able to devote energy towards Enjin Coin development. We may need to work on custom game plugins & game developer partnerships, which in our experience takes up a large amount of development time. World-class devs and staff don't come cheap and if we were to hire 6 additional developers and other supporting staff we're looking at an increased spend of $1m+ USD per year in salaries alone, not to mention a lot of additional costs involved.  We are also working with Vanbex Group for consulting and assistance with Enjin Coin over the next few months. Part of the crowdsale funds are paying the cost of working with Vanbex. Their team effectively doubles our marketing and development power leading up to the crowdsale.  Quote from: cryptodevil on July 27, 2017, 02:59:21 PM Also, you list this young lady: Lilia Pritchard, as a team member and marketing and social media expert, yes?  Trouble is, whenever I do a search for her with the term 'enjin' I don't get any results other than your ICO page and a website listing a 'Lilia Pritchard' as an English language teacher.  Actually, even when I do a simple search on ""Lilia Pritchard"" I'm only getting 62 results, none of them leading anywhere useful.  Where would I find examples of Ms Pritchard's social media chops?  Lilia has been with us since launch in 2009, but she prefers to work in the background.

At the start we are releasing two plugins for very popular games with virtual item economies:  - A plugin for Minecraft (for all 3 platforms: Spigot, Sponge, Forge). We are the largest website platform for Minecraft servers and thousands of servers use our existing plugin for virtual item sales daily. - A plugin for Unturned (Rocketmod). This is a rising, popular game and people are already making Enjin shop plugins for it. We are in touch with the developers of Rocketmod and we're very excited to develop Enjin Coin integration. This will also work with 2+ upcoming games that Rocketmod plans to support.  The Enjin platform currently processes over $1 million in virtual item sales per month across all games and communities. Integrating with the above 2 games will bring instant adoption to the currency among thousands of active servers. We also host over 250k communities playing hundreds of games, and they could start using Enjin Coin functionality on their websites.  Our strategy of beginning with game plugins means we can integrate with some very popular mainstream games out the door, and meanwhile pursue further partnerships.  We're also considering a new type of decentralized DKP system that can support the following games: World of Warcraft, Aion, Age of Conan, Everquest 1+2, EVE Online, Final Fantasy XIV, Guild Wars 2, LOTRO, Rift, Star Wars: The Old Republic, and Tera. We're still in the concept/planning stages for this, but it would use the Enjin Coin features and tie into Enjin's DKP module which could be updated for Enjin Coin and potentially open-sourced in the future.  Quote from: chorobes on July 24, 2017, 02:58:15 PM What proof is there that Enjin itself actually supports this coin and you are not using their name?  The official website www.enjin.com features Enjin Coin. I'll also be linking to this thread in my articles.",False
