WHO WILL WIN THE RACE?   The issue of quantum supremacy is increasingly of concern to the world's leading powers. Representatives of the scientific and economic community agree that the country that will win the race to create a full-fledged quantum computer will gain information, economic and military superiority. Huge funds are invested in the development of quantum computing. Governments establish special agencies to encourage the development of quantum technologies. We have found the most interesting articles on this topic and suggest you make sure how serious this is:   «Beijing is striving to become a world leader in quantum technology through large-scale state-guided investments, which may total tens of billions of dollars in the years to come. Under its 13th five-year plan, introduced in 2016, China has launched a “megaproject” for quantum communications and computing, which aims to achieve major breakthroughs in these technologies by 2030, including the expansion of China’s national quantum communications infrastructure, the development of a general quantum computer prototype, and the construction of a practical quantum simulator. China is also building the National Laboratory for Quantum Information Sciences, which, with over $1 billion in initial funding, could emerge as a key center of gravity for future research and development».  What about another big player in this field?    “China’s emergence as a serious contender in quantum science underlines the need for the United States to take steps to preserve its competitiveness. Recently, it has begun to do so. In Sep 2018, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the National Quantum Initiative Act, calling for the creation of National Quantum Information Science Research Centers within the Department of Energy. And earlier this week, the White House convened a quantum summit with business leaders and launched a new National Strategic Overview for Quantum Information Science. During the summit, the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy both announced further funding for quantum research.”  The full article is here: https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-09-26/chinas-quantum-future  Other governments are also aware of the growing pace of the race for quantum supremacy and are trying to catch up with the leaders. A typical example is the UK:   “In 2013, the government embarked on the first phase of the National Quantum Programme, an ambitious initiative to back the UK’s quantum sector and accelerate the road from the laboratory to commercialisation, committing £270 million to creating a new industry. The Autumn Budget reaffirmed quantum’s position at the heart of Britain’s modern industrial strategy, with the chancellor making the case for the sector and promising further funds to drive progress. Parliament’s science and technology select committee has this month shown its hand and wholeheartedly backed the government in commissioning the second phase of the National Quantum programme, advocating the UK seize the top spot internationally and reap the economic, technological and societal benefits that are to be gained.”  The full article is here: https://tech.newstatesman.com/guest-opinion/quantum-computing-uk-economy  As we have already said, the era of quantum computing may come in the next 10 years. During this period, the winner of the competition for quantum supremacy will be finally determined.

Here (https://www.research.ibm.com/ibm-q/learn/what-is-quantum-computing/ )  we’ve found an interesting note about it:   “In order to increase the computational power of quantum computing systems, improvements are needed along two dimensions. One is qubit count; the more qubits you have, the more states can in principle be manipulated and stored. The second is to achieve lower error rates. We need to be able to manipulate the qubit states accurately and perform sequential operations that provide answers, not noise. Combining these two concepts, we can create a single measure of a quantum computer’s power called quantum volume. Quantum volume measures the relationship between number and quality of qubits, circuit connectivity, and error rates of operations. Building larger systems with lower error rates will lead to discovering the first instances of quantum advantage, or applications where quantum computers can offer a computational advantage for solving real problems”.

The difference between DapCash and Kelvin:  – Kelvin is designed for those of crypto-users who appreciate the comfort (smart contracts+, open API, convenient ID for the wallet) – DapCash is more focused on network services that will be implemented only within the framework of this project: onion routing, DarkNet, VPN, etc. – Also, DapCash places special emphasis on the anonymity of transactions and connections – You can buy DapCash coins at a crowdsale (ICO), and Kelvin is not planning a public sale.   Three types of coins  It wasn’t just for fun. DapCash is a multiple blockchain, in which various chains are created and exist. This blockchain architecture provides hassle-free network scalability and high transaction speed.  Also, it is necessary because of mining specifics, security and other purposes of subchains. A Golden coin (DAPG) is a rare token with one block per 10 000 secs generation, classic PoW. Golden blocks are also planning to be used for establishing consensus between shards inside other blockchains that have shards. The Golden coin is rarer and little more protected from so-called 51% attack. Also, the Golden coin is topmost blockchain for the rest subchains, like Silver or Bronze.  A Silver coin (DAPS) is a general token with unlimited block size, one block per 100 secs generation, hierarchical PoW with sharded blockchain. Silver appears when you mine golden tokens, these processes are merged in so-called Electrum mining. This means that for each 1 golden coin 100 silver coins present.  A Bronze coin (DAPB) is a payment token. You can buy a cup of coffee or make payments for DapVPNand and other DAP services. It is noteworthy DAPG and DAPS are more suitable for investment purposes. But you can use any type of coin to pay for services.",False

How to choose a budding ICO for investment? Currently, the ICO market is going through difficult times. Too many low-quality projects appeared in late 2017 and early 2018, and now they are only abandoned sites and useless tokens. Against this background, it is increasingly difficult for project founders to earn the trust of investors and raise funds to develop a project. Difficult times are not only for founders but also for investors. There are too many projects, and crypto-investors just don't have time to assess the advantages and disadvantages of each project. How to understand which project is worthy of attention? Here's what we think about it: 1) First of all, you should pay attention to the role of blockchain in a project. If blockchain can be easily removed from the project and it doesn't change - well,  this project doesn't need blockchain. Crypto-investor doesn't need such a project either. Pay special attention to those projects that are unthinkable without blockchain, in which blockchain - based innovations are the heart of the project. 2) Look for projects that are unknown to a wide audience. Have you found a project that is placed on all the top ranking sites? A project has a huge community and advertisement in the top crypto-media? Great! A project has a huge budget for marketing and.... what else? And most often it is the only thing that a project has. And even if the project is really great, too many people already know about it. Look for projects that don't shout about themselves too loudly and don't throw money for marketing. These projects spend funds primarily for product development.    3) Take a critical look at the project - what does it have except beautiful promises? Every decent project must have MVP! If the project team has already created at least something, it is hoped that the project will be brought to completion.  4) Pay close attention to a project team. If a team comprise too many managers, advisors, and marketers it could mean those founders are primarily concerned about the image of a project. Don't get fooled by these decorations. In a decent blockchain project, the main role is played by developers. 5) Attentively consider the size of a hard cap. In fact, the development of almost any IT-project, including blockchain projects, requires not so much money. Well, a few million dollars for 2-3 years. If founders want to raise more than $ 10 million, think about whether to invest in someone's holidays in the Maldives or in someone's new Maibach. ",False

Here are a couple of impressive excerpts from the article:  “By 2025, up to 10% of global gross domestic product is likely to be stored on blockchains1. A blockchain is a digital tool that uses cryptography techniques to protect information from unauthorized changes. It lies at the root of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency2. Blockchain-related products are used everywhere from finance and manufacturing to health care, in a market worth more than US$150 billion. When information is money, data security, transparency and accountability are crucial. The blockchain business needs to update its existing software to use one-way cryptographic functions that are equally hard to reverse using conventional or quantum computers9. Until these post-quantum solutions are established or standardized, platforms must be flexible and capable of changing cryptographic algorithms on the fly.”  The full article is here: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07449-z#ref-CR12",False

We realize a programmable Ising-type quantum spin model with tunable interactions and system sizes of up to 51 qubits. Within this model, we observe phase transitions into spatially ordered states that break various discrete symmetries, verify the high-fidelity preparation of these states and investigate the dynamics across the phase transition in large arrays of atoms. In particular, we observe robust many-body dynamics corresponding to persistent oscillations of the order after a rapid quantum quench that results from a sudden transition across the phase boundary.

Has the quantum future already come? Let's see what is going on.  This article ( https://www.wired.co.uk/article/d-wave-2000q-quantum-computer ) tells us D-Wave began to produce and sell quantum computers in 2011: first, it was a 128-qubit quantum computer, then a 512-qubit one and so on, up to a 2000-qubit quantum computer!

This is where we need to clarify some things. The quantum computer developed by D-Wave, strictly speaking, can't be called ""quantum"" in the truest sense of the word. This so-called adiabatic computer is a classic computer that uses some quantum effects. D-Wave computers can solve only a very narrow range of optimization problems. There is such a problem known, for example, in the economy — cost optimization. You have a lot of parameters, a lot of goals that you need to achieve at the same time. For example, you need to visit a million customers in different places and at the same time, you need to optimize the road, costs, time and so on. This is a classical problem, the so-called ""traveling salesman problem"". On conventional computers, it is very difficult to solve — a computer needs to sort out many, many different options, it may take thousands of years, and the D-Wave copes with it in seconds. But an adiabatic computer is not designed for other tasks, so its use is extremely limited. In fact, an adiabatic computer is a step in the evolution of a classical computer with a very non-standard architecture that uses some quantum effects. The adiabatic computer doesn't use the effect of superposition. This is not a ""universal"" quantum computer that can be used to factorize numbers, to hack encryption systems, etc.  A universal quantum computer is limited to 72 qubits so far - in March 2018, Google reported testing of a laboratory sample of such a computer ( https://physicsworld.com/a/google-aims-for-quantum-supremacy/ ).",False

Let me try... OQS is Open Quantum Safe - https://openquantumsafe.org/  if you want more details its better to read on their site.  In few words, they work like usual assymetric alghorythms but based on different math operations. For example, RSA is based on factorization thats already has quantum alghorythm that could crack it in polynomal time (so-called Shor's alghorythm). Elliptic curves is based on... elliptic curves they are also vulberable for quantum calculations but only in theory. Post-quantum is mostly based on so-called lattice based encryption thats are not vulnerable for quantum computers, mostly because it requires to store lot of intermediate results and memory in quantum calculations is bottleneck. Thats why hash trees are also quantum resistant. So, replace block in the blockchain its impossible. But with quantum computer with thousands of qubits you could steal the Bitcoin wallet, for example. Or ever mine all the rest blocks.  There are also another post quantum signatures, based on supersingular elliptic curves, ring with errors and etc. They all are also mostly based on exponential grow of memory usage for calculation, btw that does some problem with their optimization - usual PQ signatures load CPU a lot and have big size of sign and public key.",False

Ever if we'll find vulnerablity in sign alghorythm we could always declare that as depricated and issue the new one with fixes. If we'll have so many transactions that we can't process ever with 3 blockchains - we could add 4,5.. 65535 blockchain and keep transactions fast.  5) Additional services, like fully anonymous decentrelized VPN, audio video streaming, buisness collaboration tools and etc. Thats not related directly to crypto currency itself but thats would be first services that will work with DapCash.
