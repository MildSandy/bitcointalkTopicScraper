As I’ve just arrived in Singapore again to work closely together with the Foundation team, I think it’s a good idea to take one step back and go in-depth on what has caused me to join the Foundation team as a community member and why I felt very connected with the team.  Let’s dive a little bit into my history to understand where I’m coming from. As a marketing guy I have worked in several positions at commercial companies like The Walt Disney Company, where I was mainly responsible for creating creative marketing campaigns and content, both online and offline. While I’ve always loved doing my job, it caught my attention that contributing to the blockchain ecosystem by helping out several communities was the thing I’ve always spoke most enthusiastically about when coming home from work. I felt truly connected with everyone that was growing the same community and ecosystem as me, which rapidly resulted in spending more and more time in the blockchain space (and on my phone… sorry!).  Fast forward to the end of 2017, I made the decision that I wanted to be professionally involved with this movement. I wanted to find a way to contribute as much of my time to further build this unique decentralized ecosystem consisting of thousands of people that make the Request Network as awesome as it is today. But what was it that caused this burning desire?  I’ve tried to write down what I’ve always experienced as the core cultural values that connect us as a community, a team and a revolutionary movement within the blockchain ecosystem. You probably recognize yourself with some of these points and I hope to inspire you by sharing my thoughts. We’re in this revolution together, and experiencing that the community and team have so much in common is what makes me very happy.  https://blog.request.network/shaping-the-request-network-dna-a-story-on-how-our-shared-values-connect-us-d0cf12ceeedc",False

Due to this partnership we will see the gold-backed Digix gold (DGX) tokens available as an option for invoicing on the Request Network. This allows anyone in the world to digitally send and receive invoices which can be paid with gold.  Soon all users of the Request Network will be able to request an invoice to be paid in DGX tokens, which are backed by 99.99% gold cast bars from London Bullion Market Association (LBMA)-approved refiners on a 1:1 basis, where 1 token is backed by 1 gram of gold. Having gold-backed tokens available as an invoicing option allows users to receive and send payments in a stablecoin, whose value is not subject to the high volatility of the cryptocurrency market or to foreign exchange fluctuations.  While the financial services industry continues to witness interest in blockchain technology, asset-backed tokens such as the DGX token are a good way for users who want to hedge against any volatility through a safe haven asset.  Digix is an asset tokenisation company with an aim of tokenising real world assets through several proprietary technologies, such as the Proof of Provenance (PoP) protocol which ensures the legitimacy and transparency of the process through which gold bullion is represented as digital assets.  DGX 2.0 has just launched on April 8 and is now available for purchase on the Digix marketplace. Users can register for an account and purchase DGX 2.0 tokens once they have submitted their KYC information and have their Ethereum address approved.  https://blog.request.network/request-network-partners-with-digix-to-allow-invoicing-in-gold-39417eeb74c5",False

This year, we hope to see the number of users evolve nicely, and are excited about our next milestones.  Over the last 2 weeks, the growth of our community was impressive. We see it as our responsibility to make sure everyone understands Request the same way. That’s why we want to encourage our earliest supporters and those who are very knowledgeable about Request to play an educative role and help others understand the details of our project. We’d also be very appreciative of thoughtful Reddit posts that help educating others about Request.  To recall: The Request protocol aims to formalize financial flows on the blockchain by setting the standard for payments, invoicing, accounting, and auditing in cryptocurrencies, so that crypto-enthusiasts can invoice, get paid, and get their salary in crypto.  https://blog.request.network/request-network-project-update-january-5th-2018-release-of-the-js-library-on-the-road-to-b805be6b58a4",False

For those complaining about ""price drops"" zoom out and look at the 1 Month chart not the 1 day lol. REQ made it over 1$ to about 1.15 a few days ago and is now consolidating which is completely normal in crypto before it retests all time highs and moves higher. Right now its accumulation phase and anything under 1$ is a steal.  For those who haven't researched into REQ yet Take a look at the 2018 road map on their website. https://request.network/#/   This is just Q1 and Q2 of their 2018 Road map below.  Request Great Wall: Q1 2018 - The first iteration of Request working with Ethereum on Main Net  - Deploy management of crypto-currencies to Request (ERC20 tokens…)  - Working on partnerships with Accounting, Payment and Audit firms  - Launching the ""Pay with Request"" project: an online button which will offer an alternative to the traditional ""Pay with Paypal"" and ""Pay with credit card"" methods  - Outside audits of the Request Contracts  - Proof of concept: Request Core working with a Bitcoin Oracle  Request Stonehenge: Q2 2018 - Proof of concept of Privacy using ZkSnarks  - Add management of fiat-currencies to Request (USD, EUR, CNY…)  - Launching the ""Request & Transparency"" project. We will work with city halls, associations and governments to publish real time information on their budget.  - Organize discussion groups around Payment Requests with institutions such as Worldbank, IMF, ECB and the UN  Congratulations for those who have been accumulating REQ.

Request is a layer built upon Ethereum which disintermediates payment requests.  What does that mean? Every time you receive an invoice, a receipt, or make a payment online, a third party is used to generate and share this request. This third party is usually PayPal, Stripe, or any accounting software.  In the near future, instead of using a third party, you’ll create your request directly on the blockchain which will enable a seamless payment experience. This process carries a number of benefits: It will be cheaper It will be more secure because you won’t share your financial information It will be easier to pay, thanks to the blockchain interoperability between the payee app and the payer app     And this is just the beginning; Request builds upon this concept even further. Request works with every currency Request enable accounting in real time Request improves financial audit with smart algorithms on the blockchain Most interesting is the fact that Request allows machines to pay each other within a standard framework   The network consists of 3 layers. The core layer includes the most fundamental smart contracts used to create and detect payment requests. The extensions layer adds taxation and business rules. Finally, the application layer allows financial organizations to access invoices and facilitate payments.   The bottom line is that not only do we know how to implement such a process, but we have already created a working prototype. Our team has been working on payment networks and blockchain since 2014, and we are backed by ING bank and the YCombinator which provide valuable advice. If you want to get involved in our work, the best way to help is to review our whitepaper and highlight anything that you don’t find clear enough.  The team look forward to seeing you on our slack!
