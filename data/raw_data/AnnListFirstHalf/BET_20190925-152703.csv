I guess you‚Äôve heard about high rollers or whales ‚Äì gamblers who play really big. Will you attract this type of visitors? What I‚Äôm trying to ask is whether you ready to compete with high rollers casinos? Cuz cryptocurrencies are wonderful for whales as they can wager more in BTC in more convenient way. If you are planning to join the market of such big casinos, pls let me know as it may be interesting for some of my clients. Thanks. We are not a casino. Our team is building a blockchain protocol for the online gambling industry so anyone will be able to use it to create their decentralized casinos or games.  These casino owners and game developers will be able to attract any players, including high rollers and whales.  We are also developing a loyalty program which will help casino owners to attract large players.  DAO.Casino protocol allows private investors to get revenue by being a bankroll backer and providing fund into games running the protocol.",False

It is very important for us.  Quote from: Emileetran on June 21, 2018, 02:25:38 AM I'm not a programmer or codewriter but I've been following this project since the start. How long does it take to make a few games? I've seen the prototype dice game and the blackjack game for months now only updates I see is that they go to conferences. Is there a timeline anywhere ? How long till there is an actual working system and casino? We are in the business of making software and not casino management. Our main goal is to create a fair blockchain protocol that helps to transform current gaming industry and help developers to build own games and casinos. Currently, you can test some of them in our Testing environment. Parallel to the development, we research the most popular games in different countries. Therefore, the implementation of contracts for other games will be. We are also preparing something special to come this fall. Follow our GitHub and official channels and keep up to date with our latest updates.",False

The campaign raised 56,370.777896189830879 total amount of Ether in 7823 transactions. Token sale ended a few days earlier due to a vulnerability in Parity client, but even so, the campaign turned out to be more than successful. We would like to thank all our supporters, because without you, DAO.Casino would not have existed!  Short stats Number of tx: 7823 transactions Total amount of Ether raised: 56,370.777896189830879 Total amount of BET in existence (including vesting and bounty): 167270820.687908580232679286 Contract Address: 0x8aA33A7899FCC8eA5fBe6A608A109c3893A1B8b2  Security audit Security audit of the contract was conducted by BokkyPooBah and the website infrastructure by a separate team‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäDigital Security Russia. We went to the leading security audit team that also audits IT infrastructure for largest russian banks such as VTB and Sberbank and works with over 500 companies around the world. It is important to remember that apart from on-chain infrastructure‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcontracts related to tokensales, your tokenholders interact with traditional IT infrastructure‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa website hosted on a server. That‚Äôs why we worked with a separate team that made sure that we haven‚Äôt missed any potential exploits.  BET token Even at the start of the project, we chose a fixed supply for BET token. Fixed supply is simple and easy to understand. It also favors early adopters and gains trust from the community. Total BET supply is 167270820.687908580232679286 and proportionate to the amount of ether contributed during the campaign (56,370.777896189830879). There will be no more BET issued. BET will be used as an ingame currency and power circulate in a reward distribution system. Potential loss of BET tokens by token holders is not an issue since the token is divisible. Also a reward distribution system that we‚Äôre building is customisable.  Word on phishing attacks Coordinated phishing attacks during token distribution campaigns became a serious problem. Most of the time such attacks start with someone creating several accounts with the aliases resembling the name of the project. One phishing attack, for example, started with number of accounts created in our Slack channel. This particular attack used our team members names and their pictures taken from the official website. As soon as this ‚Äúswarm‚Äù started posting it was immediately reported as scam. Despite of the community efforts to prevent those attacks, we learned that Slack channel is really not built as a public channel, since the permissions settings are limited and had to temporarily close new registrations.  Take aways There are quite a few takeaways from our token sale experience: Beware of phishing and coordinated scam attacks. Walk an extra mile to protect your future token holders even if it means sleepless nights and taking shifts looking after all your communication channels.  Make sure that you create very easy and straightforward tutorials explaining how to contribute. Unfortunately not everyone is reading t&c. Keep your t&c short. Crypto-tokens are now hitting the mainstream, that means some of your token holders might not have basic understanding of what private keys are and, for example, attempt to send ether from exchanges.  Monitor what‚Äôs happening with the software that you have recommended to your token holders‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääif there is a vulnerability detected you will be able to communicate to your community promptly. Slack is not an ideal tool for a public communication channel. Slack was conceived as a team communication tool , but it is hard to manage permissions, therefore it is vulnerable to phishing attacks in public channel, PMs and via SlackBot.  Do not start a token sale campaign if you‚Äôre not sure that enough crypto-savvy people are following your project. Those people help a lot to prevent phishing attacks and scams and protect the newcomers.  Remember that Ethereum itself is an experimental software and don‚Äôt hesitate to remind your token holder community about it. Despite of the fact that the brightest minds are now working to make Ethereum stable and useable, things like recent Parity exploit can happen. You have to be prepared. Make sure that your dev team is active in protocol level Gitter channels. In case of protocol level exploits you will know what to do.  Nevermind the trolls. Don‚Äôt start flame wars and make sure you answer all the hard questions well. Sometimes your best supporters will ask the hardest questions‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthese people are not trolls, but those who will help you long term to communicate your project better. Make sure that everyone who follows your project knows how the crucial information about your token sale will be distributed: official website, an email from a specific address, etc.  Token sale campaigns aren‚Äôt quite a walk in the park. It would be much harder without a strong community of people truly interested in the project who helped us to answer a huge amount of questions about the project coming 24/7 to all our public channels and, most importantly, prevent phishing attacks. We would like to thank all the vigilant folk reporting suspicious accounts to our team and passing on links to tutorials and updates to the newcomers.

After the successful Token Sale, we pay special attention to the possibilities of improving our protocol by implementing advanced technical solutions.  Blockchain technology issues  Once blockchain was founded, the pioneers saw in it a solution of many modern problems, like scalability, security, speed, legal issues, trust. But since the beginning, blockchain technology is also being attacked by critics. Part of them was just afraid of something innovating, they imagined it like something infernal, or just an another way to earn easy money. But to be honest, another part of critics had a point‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääjust like any other informational technology, blockchain had both ‚Äúpro‚Äù and ‚Äúcontra‚Äù. And one of the main ‚Äúcontra‚Äù was a transaction speed and fee.  The problem was not so critical a few years ago, although even at that time the transaction could take up to 10 minutes. But it was constantly growing up, and had a real splash in June 2017‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsome transaction took up to few days to confirm.  Almost the same situation took place in other blockchain networks. For example, Ethereum network had a major crash during Status.im token sale. Some people payed 1000$ gas for transaction and critics arrived shortly, claiming ineffectiveness of the Ethereum.  The logic of this problem is pretty simple. The more new users arrive‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe more blocks are created‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe more pressure on the blockchain network. Several teams worked on solving the transactions speed/fee problems and one of the first was the Lightning Network, which offered its solution in January 2017.  Lightning Network solution  A new technical solution was favorably received by the community. Some even said, that it could replace the whole blockchain, but the founders protested. According to them, Lightning Network depends on the blockchain and was created to solve its problems, and not to replace it.  So what exactly Lightning Network? This is a P2P network system, that operates above the blockchain, building a straight bidirectional payment channel between two or more addresses. It allows to make simple micropayments safe and secure, without need in trust to a third party.  By creating a channel, participants have no need to refer to blockchain, which means all of the transactions will take place only between them. When participants decide to quit the channel, the outcome of all operations would be added to the blockchain. Needless to say, this solution significantly reduces the pressure on the Bitcoin network (or any other blockchain network).   Also, Lightning Network solves the issue with transactions fee. Participants will have to pay only twice‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto open and to close channel. Once the channel is open, they adding a certain amount of funds, and can make as many transactions, as they want to, with almost instant speed.  But the beauty of Lightning Network is in multiplicity! For example, Alice and Bob creates a channel, where Alice sending 2 BTC to Bob. Bob adds Charlie to this channel, and then transfer 1 BTC to him. The thing is, there could be more than two participants in existing channel, which simplifies payments without any need to access the blockchain.  DAO.Casino LN implementation  Just as Bitcoin, DAO.Casino‚Äôs blockchain protocol has the same set of problems‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätransaction speed and fee. For example, let‚Äôs take the BlackJack game. Any in-game action, like split, deal, double or remove bet normally acts through the blockchain. But such method slowed down the game, raised fee and made it nearly impossible to play.  Back in March 2017, DAO.Casino‚Äôs CTO Alexander Noxon on his Github explained a variation of Lightning Network idea named Payment Channels and this summer we have implemented it in our prototype. For now, we have tested it on BlackJack game, and it acts just as we planed‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsmooth, fast and cheap. It lowered down the commision payment and boosted game speed.  Another our development with implemented Lightning Network technology is the BET wallet. Thanks to Lightning Network, it is able to quickly transfer tokens BET between the player and the bankroller. You can check it on our Github. In the next part of our research article, we will demonstrate how the Lightning Network works in our dice game.

Fortunately, DAO.Casino wallet was saved by WhiteHat hackers. It means, our funds are safe and being kept on WhiteHat secure wallet.  Nevertheless, we decided to put on hold our token distribution campaign to protect our contributors. At the present moment we do not conduct any forms of Token Sale, so do not send funds to any address.  We are following the instructions of WhiteHat crew, and the process of returning goes just as they announced. Until the moment of return, we can not give a 100% guarantee that the funds will be returned. But even in the worst case scenario DAO.Casino project will stay and continue work on protocol, just as we announced earlier.  During the attack, our multisig wallet associated with the contract was destroyed (‚Äúsuicide‚Äù). Therefore, for technical reasons, we can‚Äôt use the BET token any more. We will release new token with a different name, instead of old one.  - The amount of new tokens will be exactly the same as the old ones; - New tokens would be sent to all participants of Token Sale according to how many old tokens they had; - Old tokens would not be supported by our team; - All participants of Token Sale will receive new tokens on July 29, 2017 or earlier.  In the upcoming days we will inform all exchanges and Etherscan about the replacement and finish work on the new contract.

A week ago we were forced to suspend our token sale, due to a critical vulnerability in Parity multisig wallet, and following hacker attack. Several major Ethereum-based projects suffered from this attack. Fortunately, fast response from WhiteHat hackers prevent theft and saved our funds.  However, during the attack our old multisig wallet associated with the contract was destroyed (‚Äúsuicide‚Äù). That is why we created a new contract which from now on is the only correct contract address. All values have been returned under DAO.Casino control by White hat.  The name of DAO.Casino token: BET New Contract Address: 0x8aA33A7899FCC8eA5fBe6A608A109c3893A1B8b2  Technically, such measure made old tokens unusable. We have issued a new tokens, with the same name BET. All tokens already automatically delivered to our contributors in the same amount as the old ones.  New tokens are valid, functional, transferable and ready to use. The old ones are not supported anymore. We reported this to all exchanges.  Such situation is a clear force majeure for the project, which is why we took a decision to finalise token sale to protect our contributors.  Our website will be restarted ASAP, so you could once again get all the information about our project, explore prototype and gain verified links to our official social media channels.  We hope that everyone who wanted to become a BET token holder had time to learn about the project and participate.  We would like to thank everyone who participated and helped with the campaign.

Our development crew have already cracked some difficult tasks, such as implementing logics of several games to EVM (ethereum virtual machine), creating referral system contract and reward distribution contract, implementing random generator in EVM and many other things.  Now we are standing towards the challenge of transaction speed and costs in Ethereum blockchain. We have already solved an issue of speed in random generation by integration our algorithm called Signidice. But we still had a problem of ~5$ fee for all in-game transactions.  One of the alternatives was to wait for Ethereum ecosystem solutions: Raiden and Whisper technologies. Raiden is realisation of channel idea, that allows any side to close it at any moment. And Whisper is a messaging protocol that allows two Ethereum addresses to cooperate.  Instead of this, we integrated payment channels to provide our community with higher quality service right now. It works quite simply:      A straight channel is been created between player and a bankroll;     Player chooses amount of BET, that he wants to play during one session, freezing it on a bankroll smart contract;     After the game ends player sends a request to bankroll to close the game session;     Concurrently smart contract automatically distribute game rewards depending on results.  In this way, game itself flows above the blockchain, but all primary transactions between parties stays in Ethereum. Thus, within one session, the player does not need to constantly refer to the blockchain and the game speed rises to the maximum available. Also, if earlier commissions were charged for each transaction, now they are charged only at the start and exit of the session.  To prevent cheating on the part of bankroll, we again using our know-how algorithm Signidice. Long story short, player gives a seed to bankroll backer, which signs it by his private key, and after that get a truly random number. If the bankroll will cheat, player will detect it with the help of public key, which used to check the fairness of private number. Needless to say, caught cheating bankroll backer goes to blacklist.  The technology mentioned above has already been implemented for alpha version of our BlackJack game and one another (watch for updates). Of course, we do not abandon communication with the Ethereum community and as soon as Raiden or Whisper will be ready, they would be also integrated in our protocol.  https://medium.com/@dao.casino/fast-and-chargeless-dao-casino-accelerate-prototype-and-remove-fees-6a70763e5b6c",False

Have a look at the explainer.  2. I sent ether to BET token sale contract from the exchange! Try to contact the exchange and ask them to transfer your tokens back, because they have them. Even though we tried to warn everyone in all our channels to send ether from the wallets that we recommend: MEW (My EtherWallet, MetaMask, Mist, Parity) some people still send ether from the exchange. Many people keep making this mistake and that means that many of them can lose their funds as the exchange make the transfers from another address than the user requested (not their ETH deposit address within the exchange). Though some people get help from the exchange, many times they won‚Äôt help and you lose your funds.  Unfortunately, we can‚Äôt issue tokens to people who made this mistake, since tokens are issued automatically by the crowdfunding contract, and we have no control over this process once the contract is deployed. Total amount of tokens are proportionate to the amount of ether that the contract has received.  3. I set my gas limit to 200,000 and transaction doesn‚Äôt send! If the recommended gas limit 200,000 gas didn‚Äôt work just leave whatever gas limit is set automatically by MEW and it should work.  4. I participated in a public token sale, when will I see BET tokens in my wallet? Add the tokens manually as described in the tutorial in the question 1 and it should work. Any case, after the campaign ends everyone will get their BET balances.  5. I participated to the tokens sale during pre-sale and tried to add tokens manually to the wallet, yet my balance is not showing! All the participants will get their BET after the token sale has ended. Some people already can see their BET balances, but for all participants BET is not yet transferrable.  6. When BET will be listed on exchanges and which ones? BET will be available on secondary market after campaign ends. We can‚Äôt yet announce which ones. While the token sale is still open it wouldn‚Äôt make sense to trade tokens anyway, since BET is available to everyone from the crowdfunding contract directly and exchange rate to eth is the same for everyone.  7. I‚Äôm a US resident, can I participate? The sale is not open to US citizens. Crowdsale participants must digitally sign a statement that they are not a US citizen. Our token BET will be tradeable after the sale. Interested US participants could buy it on the secondary market.  8. How many tokens will be created in total and will any be burned? The amount of tokens created depends on ether that is sent to the BET token sale contract, since it is the contract that issues tokens, automatically. No tokens will be burned.  9. Are the tokens instantly transferable or is there some kind of lockup period to them? No. Tokens become transferrable after the token sale has ended, which is either the 28 days after the start or when the max cap is reached.  10. What is BET, what can I do with it? BET is a functional token of DAO.Casino protocol. It is an ingame currency and it powers a reward system for active participants. For example, you can use it to become a Bankroll Backer and support any game of your choice and earn BET %. For more details read section 2 of a White Paper that describes active participant‚Äôs roles.  11. What happens if the max cap is not reached? Max cap is just a security measure and not a goal. The project already raised an amount of funds that will allow further development of the protocol long term. This is also mentioned in the token distribution document.  PS. This FAQ is in progress, we will be adding new questions and answers as we collect them. Meanwhile post your questions to AMA on reddit, ping us in Telegram and Slack.",False

For example for Bittrex listing devs have to apply not the community. Also this takes a long time. I know one project where a dev applied for listing since over 1 week now and still no listing. Expect that this one will not be listed on any major (i mean bittrex or polo) any time soon. I dont know the process for liqui. Maybe this is an option. But too uncertain for me. Also I dont understand why they dont want to list it. This is also the reason why i will not invest,False

Even though, currently the protocol is available as an MVP, our hope is that, when deployed in its full capacity, it will be able to disrupt the entire online gambling industry, and bring about fairness, transparency and mutual profitability powered by blockchain technology. Summary      Start: June 29th, 2017 at 1:00 pm GMT     Ending: in 28 days or when the Maximum cap is reached     Only ETH accepted     No minimum cap     Maximum cap: $25,000,000 in Ether     Token name: BET  Price staging on Token Sale      Day 1: 2,000 BET = 1 Ether     Days 2‚Äì14: 1,800 BET = 1 Ether     Days 15‚Äì17: 1,700 BET = 1 Ether     Days 18‚Äì20: 1,600 BET = 1 Ether     Days 21‚Äì23: 1,500 BET = 1 Ether     Days 24‚Äì26: 1,400 BET = 1 Ether     Days 27‚Äì28: 1,300 BET = 1 Ether  Token distribution      70%‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäToken Sale Participants     10%‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäEarly Adopters & Founders     10%‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäBounty     10%‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäLegal Entity  Intended use of revenue      60%‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäResearch & Development     20%‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäOperation     15%‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMarketing     5%‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäLegal  About the Token Sale  While preparing for the extended token sale, we have suddenly faced a somewhat pleasant, but still challenging issue.  The thing is that the demand for our tokens has dramatically exceeded the initially intended supply. In just a few days after announcing the pre-sale we‚Äôve received orders for nearly maximum that we planned as acceptable to distribute on this stage.  This makes us confident about our project‚Äôs future, and we would like to express our deep gratitude to everyone who wants to become a part of it. We value the entire community of our supporters, and it is crucial for us to make the token available to everyone who wishes to take part.  Thus, we decided to set the token sale‚Äôs maximum cap at $25 million worth of Ether. We consider this amount sufficient to meet the demand we‚Äôre currently dealing with and to present a chance for everyone to become a part of our project.  Hopefully, the revised token sale format won‚Äôt make much of a trade-off, and will fit the desires and expectations of everyone in the DAO.Casino community. Terms of the Token Sale  Other terms of the crowdsale campaign will remain unchanged. The protocol‚Äôs internal tokens are known as BETs, and are ERC20 tokens acting as in-game currency for all contracts integrated with the protocol.  You will be able to buy 2,000 BET tokens with 1 ETH on the first day of the campaign, and 1,800 BET tokens for the next two weeks. Then the amount of BETs available for 1 ETH will be decreasing by 100 every three days.  The campaign will start as planned, at 1:00 pm GMT on June 29th, 2017. It will completely end in 28 days or when the Maximum cap is reached.  We would like to note that founders and early adopters will have vesting. We deem this measure necessary to ensure the work on the project progresses after the token sale. The parties mentioned above will have 2 years of vesting with 6 months cliff, therefore, the BET tokens will mature by 25% every six months.  As a preparation for the token sale, the contract is currently being audited to guarantee complete security and safety. How to Participate  Please note that contributions will be accepted only in Ether. No other cryptocurrency or fiat contributions are available. Those willing to contribute to the development of our protocol may use any Ethereum client they like (we recommend Metamask, Parity, Mist, or MyEtherWallet).  The destination address will become public on the day of the token sale‚Äôs start only on the official website. From that address smart contract will transfer your BET tokens to your wallet. For that reason, of course, you should keep your private keys safe and sound.  You are also encouraged to check if the address is correct by checking it on Ethereum block explorers such as Etherscan during the campaign. Prohibited Actions DO NOT send ETH from any online exchange services (Kraken, Coinbase, Poloniex, etc)  We also recommend that you have your ETH private keys encrypted. This, however, will require you to have your password when you need to decrypt them, so keep that password in a safe place. NO THIRD PARTY would be distributing BET tokens on behalf of DAO.Casino  So if you received an email from a third party or offered BET tokens otherwise, please, beware of phishing. DO NOT send Ether to any third party addresses  To receive BET tokens do not send any Ether to addresses other than DAO.Casino crowdfunding contract address that will be provided on the official website. Briefly about the Protocol  DAO.Casino protocol automates value chain of the gambling industry. It will enable independent game developers to get automatically rewarded for their job when casinos take their games onboard. Unlike the current situation, the developer will retain copyright for their game.  The protocol of DAO.Casino also introduces the roles of a bankroll backer and randomness provider. Therefore, game developers won‚Äôt have to depend on casino operators, and finding a bankroll backer would be enough for them to roll out a successful product.  Casino operators, on their part, will be able to guarantee that all games held at their virtual premises are provably fair.  This will benefit all parties involved in online gambling business processes. All the contributors‚Ää‚Äî‚Äädevelopers, bankroll backers, referrers, and casino operators acting as referrers will be automatically rewarded for their contributions without a need to trust each other, i.e. bankroll backers and referrals won‚Äôt have to trust game providers in order to cooperate.  Further details as to the protocol‚Äôs capabilities are described in our whitepaper.  As we‚Äôve already released the MVP for the protocol, which features minimal functionality and several demo games like beta blackjack, dice, and an indie game we called ‚ÄúHack a DAO‚Äù, the product will be available in case of any outcome of the token sale.

BET is a functional token that is intended to circulate within DAO.Casino reward system and to be used as an ingame currency in the games integrated with the system. Whether BET will be listed on exchanges depends on exchanges themselves. Most token exchanges have a token request form and you can ask whether your token exchange platform of choice is planning to list a particular token.",False

People in marketing always recommend having an escrow, while legal experts we spoke to say that escrow in this context makes no sense apart from a marketing trick, since it provides no guarantees.   First of all, let‚Äôs say a token holder is not happy with the development process i.e. it takes longer, can she go to the escrow service and get money back in exchange for tokens?   We recognise the fact that escrow can be a good way to psychologically comfort some users, but it‚Äôs unclear how it can provide guarantees in a practical sense. An escrow doesn‚Äôt have any agreement with token holders. Another question, is escrow legally liable for the timely development of the milestones? There are loads of other questions about this that led us to the decision not to use third parties to manage project development.   Secondly, in order to theoretically move a responsibility for quality and security assessment to a third party escrow, this third party need to have a very specific expertise to actually assess decisions of a dev team and either agree with them or not.   Let‚Äôs imagine there is a dev team that uses Ethereum, but 3 years from now decides to move some components to DFinity blockchain. Will some escrow service with experience of bitcoin based altcoins have enough expertise to assess this decision? Decentralised tech, blockchain tech in particular develops very fast, it‚Äôs unclear how an escrow service would provide this expertise.   That‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt consider third party escrow services. Saying that, we‚Äôre open to all recommendations from community, if someone can explain how it would work in practical terms, and represent something more than a marketing strategy, it would be very useful, not just for this project, but for the community.   There will be a multisig for managing the project budget, and the signatories will be published on the site before the crowdfunding starts. Since we are rolling out a working MVP before the crowdfund, we think that will be enough. Projects that run fundraisers pre-MVP can probably benefit from escrows.",False

The goal of this project is not to mimic exiting online gambling industry and connect a couple of blockchain-based games, but enabled new business models to evolve based on the cooperation between parties that don't trust each other. DAO.Casino UI platform is there as an example of how UI platform can work on top of this logic: source of PRNG and an automated value chain - system of rewards.

Wagerr looks different: on the technical level Wagerr rolls out their own blockchain - a network of masternodes, as far as I understand it's a permissioned blockchain specific to their project. DAO.Casino is built on top of Ethereum's public blockchain. At least in January this year, almost a quarter of all Ethereum contracts verified on Etherscan were related to gambling and gaming, not it is probably even more. But in order for individual games to become an industry there should be a business logic allowing all parties involved in the industry to interact.  On the business logic level Wagerr is closer to how Ethereum's prediction markets work, since one can use them for sports betting. DAO.Casino provides an automatic value distribution system, more like a decentralised market where participants can interact without trusting each other.  Example: Alice is operates an online casino and Bob is a referral. Bob brings a new player to Alice's casino and want a reward for it. In a conventional system Bob will have to trust Alice so that she gives him his reward for brining a new player, or have a contract with him that is enforceable legally. In a DAO.Casino value distribution system this reward will go from Alice's casino to Bob automatically, so Bob doesn't have to trust Alice. So they don't have to know and trust each other in order to cooperate. This is just a referral component example. DAO.Casino automates interactions between: game devs, bankroll backers, referrals, casino operators. Does this make sense?",False

BET has a huge chance to become the number one in ""gambling"" tokens.  upd 09.06.2017:     Bankroll Backing, as the new feature is titled, is introduced in the wake of DAO.Casino‚Äôs motto: to enable a sustainable model which benefits all the parties involved in the online gambling working model. This system is supported by, what DAO.Casino refers as, Bankroll Backers. Any participant holding DAO.Casino‚Äôs native token BET can take up the role of a Bankroll Backer; s/he will only require to install bankroll app and commit their tokens in a game contract, and receive rewards.   In modern gambling industry, this role is taken on by casino operators. While this practice requires game developers to put unquestionable trust on their casino managers, it also makes them dependable on them. Operators have an unquestionable influence on the game developer, who can not bring his game to the market without the participation of the casino, no matter how good it is.   DAO.Casino protocol‚Äôs Bankroll Backing System allows to solve this problem. Anyway, the casino operator can retain this function, becoming a bankroll backer for their own games.   Bankroll Backers will be able to evaluate games in a market environment to understand what kind of reward they will be able to count on, and make a choice in favor of the best of the games. In this case, ""bad"" games do not even reach the player. In fact, the bankroll sponsor conducts the first audit of the game. Naturally, he takes risks - the game justifies itself or not, but in the market conditions it works best.   After the game has received the required amount BET`s, the bankroll sponsor will automatically receive a reward (part of the player's loss), which is pre-programmed in the game contract code.   At the moment, our team has developed an Bankroll backer application using the Electron.js framework.   ‚ÄúIt is influenced by Ethereum wallets, and is available throughout all platforms, including Windows, MAC OS, and Linux.‚Äù - Says Kellas the coder of Bankroll App.   In our first implemented PRNG (pseudo random number generator), the bankroll sponsor provides a value that is involved in determining the outcome of the game.

DAO.Casino is an Ethereum-based protocol for the online gambling industry that enables interactions between all parties without the need for trust. It aims to cover not just the games and user account balances, but the gambling industry value chain as a whole.  It consists of:  A system that is capable of providing equally unpredictable pseudorandom numbers for games open to any game developers. An automated value distribution protocol that enables a P2P markets to emerge.  Smart contracts act as autonomous agents that reward all the key contributors for their work exactly how they have been programmed: game developers, referrers and operators of independent platforms necessary for the game discovery, and those that take part in PRNG.  Obtaining randomness necessary for gambling games in a deterministic virtual machine is not a trivial task, so an economic incentive layer should be introduced. Equally unpredictable random numbers that determine outcomes in each game are provided by a bankroller panel interacting with the gaming contract.  Problems with Traditional Casino Systems  The online gaming industry has a plethora of issues that directly/indirectly originates from the concentration of trust. These issues can be anything from RNG to user balance account management and developers‚Äô access to the market.  Here are some of the common problems experienced by the players:  After transferring the money to the game account, it is not credited or it is stolen; After withdrawing the money from the deposit, it has not been credited to the card; The player has not received the promised bonuses; The player is not able to enter his or her game account; Hidden fees: casinos charge a fee for the gain withdrawal; The player can withdraw funds only on a certain day.  Why DAO.Casino Protocol?  DAO.Casino enables a sustainable working model which benefits all the associated parties in the online gambling business process. DAO.Casino can solve:  Risk of fraud on behalf of online casinos; Inability to check the result of the draw; High and hidden fees; High entry level for the game developers; High costs of running an online casino; Operations overheads such as integrating payment systems & user account balance management.  Our Mission  The core objective behind the existence of DAO.Casino is to replace centralised casino models with a socio-economic protocol with no human intervention whatsoever. This decentralized system will achieve a fine balance between active participation and a fair economic return for those who participate.  For developers, DAO.Casino proposes to eliminate their need to rely on centralized casinos. Instead, the protocol makes it easier for these talented individuals and teams to monetise their work, raise funds, and expect bankrolling without paying heavy commissions.  For gamers, DAO.Casino is equally attractive, as it allows them to break free from rigged centralised online casinos. Traditional casinos are a black box; players cannot call their bluff easily, because the outcomes of each bet are calculated behind closed curtains. DAO.Casino, on the other hand, allows for transparency.  The protocol focuses on obtaining pseudorandomness in all the gaming outcomes by introducing an economic incentive layer. Here, the participants interact with PRNG contracts to ensure unpredictable pseudorandomness. In the beginning we expect existing licensed online casino operators to integrate with the protocol to reduce costs, while long-term new forms of regulations more suitable for decentralised, transparent and automated systems can emerge.  The long-term goal of the DAO.Casino project, apart from providing experimental software and implementing main protocol components, is to contribute to the development of new forms of online gambling certification. So far, gambling games on Ethereum remain in the gray legal area, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be so, since technologies such as Ethereum open up possibilities for far better customer protection and enable fair-by-design gambling.  Read our whitepaper https://github.com/DaoCasino/Whitepaper/blob/master/DAO.Casino%20WP.md  About the BET Token  BET is DAO.Casino‚Äôs internal token. It is used as in-game currency for all the game contracts integrated with the protocol and to power DAO.Casino reward system. In the near future, BET accounts can also be used as a reputation system and for ranking the games and the players. For example, most popular games would have more transaction history.    DAO.Casino values participation as much as it values investment, so the protocol will benefit all the parties involved in the online gambling business process. Suggested Dao.Casino reward distribution is as follows; it rewards all participants equally, however independent platform operators can choose their own reward distribution scheme (e.g. if the platform needs to incentivise more referrals but build their own games)  Game Developer: 25% Casino Operator*: 25% Referrer: 25% Bankroll Backers: 25%  *Casino Operator/Platform can only be one entity. All figures are subject to change.  BET Crowdfund  The BET crowdfunding campaign is planned during Q3 2017. Dates will be announced soon.
