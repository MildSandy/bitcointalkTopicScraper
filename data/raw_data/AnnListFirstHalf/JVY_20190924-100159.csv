They all have so many issues, which vary from exchange to exchange.  Personally, I have six(6) exchange accounts, but I guess that's down to five(5) now that Bitfinex stopped serving US customers and gave an ultimatum before confiscating my funds.  I tried buying Ripple the other day, from Kraken, but their system was/is broken. It wouldn't allow me to stop pending orders (just gave an error about my session) and I couldn't place an order for Ripple. I ended up having to send BTC from Gemini to Shapeshift with my Kraken ripple address (which I hope to be able to access one day). These are exactly the frustrating headaches we aim to overcome with our solution.  So, if I had to pick one, in the meantime, I would pick Gemini.  Cheers,  Brandon",False

This is our #1 priority, and we are considering all options; including the on-boarding of more developers. We brought on two more in the past 30 days and are getting them up-to-speed. However, things changed on us, because I wasn't even going to build a prototype, at all, and only decided to spend the large sum of money to do so as a backup plan. When, the ICO landscape changed in October, it became apparent that not having a product was no longer an option.  At that time, we ramped up and put more priority, but we ran into several difficulties with the technology side of things.

I do want to integrate a tumble feature into the wallet, but it might be a moot point with Zcash, Monero, etc support. Even with support of those more ""anonymous"" cryptocurrencies, would you want to see a tumbler feature?  There are libraries to incorporate Tumblebit, which we could add, at some point. However, I don't want to focus on that feature, if the goal of obscurity is covered elsewhere.  As for fees, I know that integrating a 3rd-party tumbler uses fees. I would imagine that Tumblebit would also have to charge fees, but we haven't investigated that feature yet. In any case, tumbling would definitely be ""optional"" for all users. It wouldn't make sense to provide that degree of obscurity, at a cost, for the average user.   Quote from: earthcoin on November 06, 2017, 05:17:13 PM How do you plan to get the word out about your wallet once it's fully launched? Just word of mouth?  We do expect our wallet users to become our viral marketing force!  However, we also plan to promote and market the wallet everywhere possible, once we have sufficient funding.  Currently, we are seeing quite a few, very high quality media platforms picking up what we're trying to do, already, so that's very encouraging also. We feel that the media will latch on to what we're doing and help us generate awareness in the crypto community and with the mainstream.",False

That is what this patent covers, so that we can make it ""optional"" for users to store a bank account on file.  Regardless, this method has not been patented, so we patented it more for our protection.

Haha... sorry, Marvin! We'll call him ""Mystery Marvin"" for now.  The other two biggest reasons are that we've been scrambling to get our prototype and polished financials released. It has been a bit embarrassing that we missed the deadlines so badly. However, it is no small feat to build the foundation of a truly usable crypto solution. Unfortunately, our wallet dev team ran into serious issues with Bitcoin Cash support, encryption (on device and in memory), some blockchain functions related to Ethereum and ERC20 tokens (the most difficult to integrate into a decentralized wallet), and certain other security features we cannot publicize.  Sometimes it works out that way in the development world, and we just have to adapt and adjust.  If we had known it would have taken this long to get the prototype out, we would have just spent a much smaller $3,000 and released an extremely basic, open-source wallet like Eidoo did. They raised $28M for their very basic prototype. So, we are encouraged that once everyone finally sees what we're doing, it will get people excited and talking!  We appreciate your patience, and we feel it will all be well worth the wait! On Monday, we'll catch up on the other questions from this thread!  Take care!",False

This initial version also ran into so many delays, due to trying to do too much and overcome too many obstacles all at once. So, the initial prototype will also not have conversion functionality. However, the conversion functionality should be added shortly after the initial release (within 1-3 weeks of the initial version).  If you take a look at the Javvy crypto solution roadmap, you'll see all of the expected features in the ""Official Release"" version. Based on funding, you'll also see the additional features that we hope to add quickly after the official release version.

I would go so far as to say that the banking industry controls everything, globally, including the governments.

As mentioned in these earlier replies, cryptocurrency forces all parties (democrat, republican, communist, marxist, or any ruling body) to see that their grasp on the people is at risk. They would have us believe that crypto leads to criminal activity and chaos, but inquiring minds know better. Javvy intends to build ""the people's wallet"" and help to bring true freedom to the people.  So Javvy has to earn the trust of the people to gain traction, and then we are confident that the VCs will want to hedge their bets and bank on Javvy, because Javvy IS the way to the future of finance.

Also, the Javvy wallet will educate while providing options for 2-factor authentication (methods outside of mobile 2FA, for maximum security on mobile as well).  Our wallet also encrypts everything on the device (some popular crypto wallets do not), and malware/ransomware cannot bypass the 2FA. There are other security features as well, but we must keep some things under wraps, as we've already basically laid out most of our plans publicly. These have already been used by Coinbase, and others, as a template or guide on how to improve their offerings. So, some things we keep to ourselves and rely on users to review our profiles (background and expertise) to see that we are very qualified to deliver this much needed solution for crypto users everywhere.  Fortunately, some of the biggest benefits of the Javvy wallet are going to protected by patent.  Note: The smoke-and-mirrors part of ICOs is that very few ICOs really spell out what they are doing on the micro level. They just claim they will address a need, in a market with huge potential, and then they ask for trust (even if their backgrounds are not related). However, nearly all successful ICOs already have massive funding lined up (at huge discounts for their ""friends""), generate buzz around the ICO, and then hope that some additional people buy in (where the later users [the crowd] pay significant premium). With Javvy, we are doing it all the hard way. We worked on detailed documentation, patent filings, product development BEFORE outside funding, extremely expensive and detailed financials/projections, and working diligently to earn the crypto community's trust. We believe that THIS is the way it should be and that everyone will appreciate our honesty, integrity, and transparency.",False

So, if only 5,000 ETH were contributed, then only 2,500,000 tokens would be minted, ever. We only mint enough tokens to meet the demand and no more than that.

However, the long answer is that there is always a chance for some issues in the early stages.  So, that said, I will be personally holding some bitcoin, ethereum, and javvy tokens in my Javvy wallet prototype BUT it will not be a huge amount right away, just in case. With such thorough testing, I highly doubt that anything would occur that would not be recoverable with a quick update but I want users to treat the prototype as ""experimental"" anyway.

You are SO right, GoBelle! It was my thought, also, that one of ""the big guys"" should have already made a comprehensive wallet, supporting all major cryptos, with easy buy/sell capability and integrated international debit card. It seems crazy to me that those corporations raised nearly half of a BILLION dollars and still haven't gotten it right.  Perhaps they just aren't the right people for such a huge task and need to work with Javvy. In contrast, the Javvy team has the right background and expertise. Once we decided to apply our knowledge and experience to crypto, we began to see what needed to be done and we're doing it.  Even in this early stage of our project, we have already made waves, because Coinbase and others have begun to ""try"" to address our concerns. However, their changes are just smoke-and-mirrors, because they don't really address the root of the issue. They merely substituted the problem with another problem. So it is too little, too late. They should have addressed them back in 2012 when I first complained to them all. I waited FIVE YEARS for a solution. It took us going ""all in"" and doing it ourselves to get them to ""look like"" they are doing something, but it's not enough. Javvy will either work with them or replace them.",False

We actually answered that question in the LIVE stream last night, if you want to check out the recording. In short, though, I'll answer here too. We are open to taking on new advisors who are superstars, especially in the crypto vertical.

We will likely just post them as CSO, Chief Strategy Officer, because they have been awesome and instrumental in helping us tailor our financials and message for investors. Our finance and legal teams are very strong.  We are also currently in talks with a major security expert to join our team in a capacity to assure that our wallet code and overall system is secure and audited.

That video has not been released yet, but since it doesn't cover that point; I'll answer here.  So, the way it works is that filing a ""patent pending"" gives you a ""priority date"" on the day it is filed. There are no prior patents that would override our patent, but there is a chance that another ""patent pending"", filed prior to ours, would conflict and have an earlier priority date. There is no way to know, until one is published, but we feel that it is unlikely. Most of the patents being filed are in regards to settling securities using a custodial account (depository for internal settlements) or are related to blockchain innovations.  I doubt that others were focused on the methods in our patents, because ""atomic swaps"" did not exist, meaning the value was limited (e.g. required 3rd-parties that charge a fee). However, I had the foresight to know that it would be possible one day (and bitcoin to ethereum atomic swapping is already possible now, much sooner than I anticipated). As a result, we will be able to use these virtually free methods and avoid using even Shapeshift (fee-based).",False

Good question. I sort of eluded to this in an earlier reply, but here's a more detailed overview...  We hired several advisors who were very qualified freelancers. The goal is to get to know them and see if they are fit to become a full part of the team or not. While some advisors have given great feedback, we do not want to clutter our site/info with a lot of advisors that may not be brought on long-term. Unlike most ICOs, we want our advisors to be truly engaged and bring strength to achieve success for the project.  Some early advisors were not brought on long-term, despite giving good feedback, because they were simply unreliable or difficult to coordinate with for meetings, feedback, and decisions. Ultimately, we only highlight those we feel contribute to the overall goals of this project and who dedicate the time to truly help it succeed.",False

We must be on to something!) and the costs of doing anything ICO related has skyrocketed 10,000% in the past 2 months. We are still spending quite a bit on social media but we really need the community to understand what we are working on and help us to spread the word.  So, we are going to be detailing that struggle in video format as well. We feel that people do not like to read, so let's just be real and personal and build real connections with the crypto community. We want to engage and have a real conversation about what crypto users need, what is really going on, and how the wool is being pulled over people's eyes where the rich (investors backing projects to get big money in ICOs) get richer and the ""little guys"" with great ideas (that's us! lol) are already being pushed out. It's the same now in crypto as it's ever been in any market.  But we have a plan, and we will succeed.  This idea of being ""the easy button"" for crypto, supporting all cryptos/tokens/etc within a single, secure, and intuitive wallet; is the way it always should have been. We just have to show that Javvy has the solution and get more people on-board!",False

The arbitrarily high ETH CAP is NOT our goal. It's just a high enough limit to let everyone who wants to support ""the people's wallet"", get in.  Our goal is closer to 200,000 ETH, but we left it open to raise more and add more advanced features from the road-map.  Quote from: BLACKCOIN883 on October 20, 2017, 02:48:51 PM What happens to unsold tokens, assuming there are any.  For example, at the minimum of 5,000 ETH contributed, only 2,500,000 JVY tokens would be minted. This creates the scarcity based on the current demand. So, the terms we defined will ensure that we don't end up with way more tokens than the demand would justify. We felt this was a better way than other ICOs that simply mint a fortune (mostly so the founders immediately get rich). We're more interested in delivering the best solution and THEN get rich off of revenues for doing something great and highly desired by the crypto community (a wallet with all cryptos supported that is far more secure and easy-to-use).   Does that clarify how the ETH CAP is intended to work and how tokens will be minted in appropriate scarcity?",False

I would be happy to give some insight into the dev process and the overall obstacles facing our startup...  Building a crypto wallet for a single platform, from open-source, would likely take 1 month to get working.  Adding in a focus on streamlining navigation and building an attractive and intuitive user interface usually takes months, due to all the feedback, opinions, and focus group testing.  Then, adding in native development for each platform (increased performance, better UI/UX, consistency, reliability) takes another 1-2 months.  We also added quite a few advanced features, such as support for ERC20 tokens (starting with the Javvy token, of course! ), Bitcoin Cash, etc. These would typically add another 1-2 months of testing to get fully operational.  Lastly, a LOT of testing and refining is necessary.  Now, to put that 6-12 months of work into perspective: Back in June/July, we decided to charge forward with this project, on the basis that we would be able to fund it via an ICO. Unfortunately, that gave us precious little time to find qualified blockchain/wallet developers, create all of the documentation, build the website, push ahead with marketing, and do everything that is required of a startup. So, we've basically squeezed more than a year of work into a few months. We were able to scale our wallet dev team up to several very knowledgeable and capable people, but it still takes time.  Everyone on our team (23 people and growing) have done a spectacular job! Even though we wanted to release the prototype prior to the ICO, it was an unrealistic expectation. That said, we still hoped to release a working prototype by 10.14.2017 (yesterday).  Now, our lead wallet dev says he currently expects to meet a 10.21.2017 release date, provided no major obstacles arise.  We are planning to take a screen share of the wallet prototype in action and share a ""sneak peek"" in the next few days. Stay tuned!",False

Many people might consider ""Registration"" to mean giving out an email or signing up in order to download, etc. There is no ""registration"" required in order to use our wallet. The wallet download, once available, may be done anonymously or installed directly from a mobile app store (not really anonymous because the carrier knows who you are but we do not). As far as VERIFICATION, our focus on regulations abides by the most restrictive of country-specific and global policies.  So the answer is different for different people.  For instance, every user may use the wallet's send, receive, and convert functions without registering OR being verified.  When buying or selling cryptos/tokens, the following applies:  IF the user is a US citizen, they may be verified instantly by their US bank account and have a low, but reasonable, limit IF the user is a non-US citizen OR is a US citizen wanting higher limits or without a US bank account, then ID verification would be necessary*  *Using our rapid ID verification system (usually instant upon scan or upload of photos of proper documents).  Does that clarify things a bit?  Cheers,  Brandon",False

Below that amount and all contributors will be refunded.  The hard cap is set to 2,000,000 ETH. This number was chosen as an arbitrarily high limit, not the amount of any goal.  Quote from: PENSCoin on October 15, 2017, 02:56:32 AM Very interesting project but why such a large amount of the project? How will the team spend big money?  Following onto the prior answer, the 2,000,000 ETH limit is not a goal but rather an arbitrarily high limit to allow for anyone who wants to contribute, to have an equal opportunity to participate. This way, we avoid the ""fastest clicker"" frenzy or the ""too low gas"" types of issues that may end up leaving many behind. Instead, everyone who wants in, during this short ICO contribution period, will be able to get in. The way the ICO is structured, coins are minted only based on the amount of ETH contributed, and no JVY tokens will ever be minted again.  For example: So, if 5,000 ETH (the minimum for successful ICO) is contributed, then 2,500,000 tokens will be minted. This finite allotment results in scarcity. If more ETH is contributed, there will be more tokens but, after much discussion, we felt that the demand will justify and offset having less scarcity.  As for ""how will the team spend big money"", please see our road-map (image link below) for a vision of how large contributions will be spent.    What do you think of that plan?

Basically, yes.  Keep in mind that this is a ""wish list"" goal, because the funding and time required would be quite high. However, in the event that we raise the necessary funds OR the Javvy crypto solution revenues grow quickly enough, we would begin to stockpile physical gold and/or establish a relationship with a major bulk supplier (possibly a mine with guaranteed contractual pricing). Then, if a Javvy user wanted to trade for gold, once the payment was accepted and verified; the physical gold would be shipped (fully insured, up to shipping limits) to the requested address.  In this case, we envision that some sort of verification would be required (to help offset fraud and AML/KYC policies), so the address would need to match what was verified and kept on file. This feature gets us very excited about the possibilities!  I do not yet know if we would pay users for gold, though, as it would be costly and time-consuming to test all incoming gold for authenticity. So, this part of the process would need to be further considered and worked out. Therefore, it is possible that we would not be providing liquidity in the gold markets but rather a means to acquire physical gold.  To clarify our long-term vision, we would love to see the Javvy wallet be the only app anyone will ever need to buy, sell, and manage everything from cryptocurrencies to tokens to credit cards (via API integrations) to bank accounts (also via API integrations) to certain commodities (such as gold). We do realize that this is a very lofty goal, which is why no solution like this exists. However, our team is very capable and ""just because it hasn't been done before, doesn't mean it cannot be done!"" ;-)",False

They apparently started their site and campaign around the same time we did. I took about 15 minutes to review their pitch, because it does sound similar at first glance.  The biggest differences are:  1. They state a lot of the same goals but they do not have a regulatory focus, so they will have major difficulties attracting customers in geographic regions with strict regulations (such as the USA, Russia, China, soon-to-be EU, etc). This may also lead to them being shut down or being put under pressure, prior to their late 2018 goal to add the regulatory component. Other than that, this is likely the closest project out there claiming to deliver what Javvy will deliver. So, you are very astute to have found them and compared the two of us.  2. I could not find any convincing information on their team. Most would agree that a strong team is the #1 foundation for a pitch such as this. Anyone can have a great idea, but it's important to back it with the right team. Compare that to our team's extremely relevant and focused expertise here: https://javvy.com/#javvyteam  3. Eidoo does have the same focus of wanting to be a consolidated wallet solution, but they will be limited to buy/sell for their exchange supported cryptocurrencies. Most exchanges support only bitcoin, with a very few that support Ethereum and/or Litecoin. However, Javvy's patent pending 62558597 (https://javvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/javvy-patent-62558597_raw-format.pdf) will allow Javvy to serve buy/sell orders to ALL major cryptocurrencies, and approved tokens, on the day of our official release (Q1-Q2 of 2018*).  4. It may seem minor to most, but their domain is eidoo.io and they do not own eidoo.com, which is a spammy parked page that installs malware. As a result, I do not think the security savvy users out there will take that project seriously, unless they receive a lot of funding and use that to acquire the spammy .com domain.  *Note: We are planning to release our wallet prototype prior to the official ICO launch, but it will not support buy/sell capability, as that is a huge component that is a main reason we are raising funds in the equity fundraise and the ICO. I personally invested over $350,000 into this project, so far, just to get it to where it is now; but we need a lot more in order to change the face of global finance. We will be excited to have you all join us!  There are several other minor differences, but those are the big ones...",False

However, the real goal of Javvy is to bring crypto to the mainstream by making the whole process simple and seamless for users.  Javvy will be ""the easy button"" for crypto.  So, the marketplace will not be the focus, as we will likely integrate several marketplaces (for liquidity and arbitrage purposes), but that would be the only ""centralized"" element. Everything else will be installed on the user's device (desktop or mobile), with all backups, security, and private keys on the device itself (no possibility of theft from any web-based storage, like with existing exchanges and online crypto wallets). We also plan for the Javvy wallet to support 2FA (2-Factor Authentication) and hardware wallets, so that users are protected against malware and ransomware attacks also.",False

I think that having advisors who simply lend their name (or who's persona is used without their knowledge, such as Vitalik Buterin being listed on the TenX ICO) is not as good as having an advisor who is truly vested in the company and the success of the venture. That means that they should be investors, own equity, promote the ICO as social proof, and/or be willing to join the team in a more hands-on capacity.  Javvy advisors are compensated the same as with any company, regardless of ICO.  Some Javvy advisors work for tokens only.  Some of our advisors, such as Toshendra Sharma (Toshblocks), also provide specific services. So, Toshendra's team provided the ICO smart contracts and spent over a month customizing their powerful, audited, and proven ICO scripts for the Javvy ICO. Therefore, they were paid a combination of CASH and a future token allotment. It is only fair that more than tokens be given, in cases such as these that require significant up-front work.  We sourced our networks for advisors, but we also opened up advisor roles to exceptional freelancers. In those cases, some advisors are paid hourly in the case that we want to get to know them first. The goal here is to determine if they are a good fit as advisor or to convert to a permanent position with the team. If the freelancer doesn't work out, then we part ways. If they do work out, then they will be offered a compensation package that will include a base salary and tokens.",False

The prototype is planned to support the following:  Features: send, receive, history, balance, convert between crypto-crypto, backup/security options, price notifications, alerts, news, demo of the rapid ID verification process  Cryptos*: bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash, javvy token (JVY)  *So no buy/sell options in the prototype, but it will be possible to test buy/sell on the testnets to see that it does work but just needs the back-end (planned for mid-2018)  *Also planned for mid-2018 official release will be the support of all major cryptocurrencies and most, stable tokens (that pass our standards)  Best regards,  Brandon",False

We like to give conservative estimates, to account for unforeseen obstacles. So the mid-2018 release is very realistic, but I am hopeful that we can actually get it out by March 2018. I just like to set expectations. That said, the more successful our fundraise efforts are; the more likely we will be to hire help that pushes us across the finish line even faster!",False
