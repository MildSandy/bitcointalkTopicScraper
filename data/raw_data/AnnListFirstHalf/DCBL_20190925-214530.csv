Backed by the speed and exponential growth of the Ethereum Blockchain, Decibels is developing an optimum ecosystem for growth in the media world, together with a secure personal experience tailored to the entrepreneurial and artistic mindset.  Decibels was founded by creators, for creators, and bridges the divide between digital content providers and their customers by introducing a market approach to the online media industry, allowing creators to establish and develop markets for their content, while providing their customers the opportunity to participate in the content's price determination, thus decentralizing the process of online media content valuation.

To answer some questions for you guys, I know we have kept you a bit in the dark about prizes and we will update you all as often as we can.  1. Is the Bounty/Airdrop program still running? Currently the Vyper.IO URL you all have been using as the Bounty Round 1 is currently FINISHED. We have had over 30,000 submissions, and 11,000 winners who have completed necessary tasks to receive a prize. We are more than pleased with the results and can only hope that our community continues their support as often as possible.  2. What about Sylon’s Bounty on BitcoinTalk?  Sylon’s Bounty is ongoing and is Round 2 of the Bounty program. We offer all of you the chance to join in and continue sharing and promoting the growth of Decibels. We are hoping to reach over 100,000 members within our token holder count as we have the capacity and desire to be the most community driven token of 2018. We are currently at 23,000 token holders POST token distribution (meaning we haven’t sent out tokens yet and they will be disbursed)  3. How do I get my tokens/prizes?  To receive your tokens please head on over to https://www.decibels.io/ico/ and register your account with your email you used on the vyper.io panel. It does not need to be this email as you can set your social links and we will find you and verity the wallet address to it.  4. When can I withdraw tokens from the ICO Panel? All members can begin withdrawing their bounty and purchased tokens from the system once token distribution date or hard cap value is met. We may extend the ICO Date to be prepared to wait a little bit longer. We have maintained ALL Records and will not miss a single payment. You can be sure of it and can ask us at ANY time in the chat to verify your amount of entries by your email, wallet address, or social media account!  5. How do I purchase Tokens?  Head on over to the ICO System and purchase your tokens with ETH, BTC, BCH, ETC, XRP, TRX, or 25+ other currencies! There will be a bonus of 20% applied to all buyers through March!   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Дoбpoe yтpo, вeчep Decibel cooбщecтвo!

Our approach is highly different from our competitors though, where they seek to launch a platform that is utilized by consumers, we seek to use already established platforms such as youtube for our development. We are one of the only Media Developments that actually has real iconic record label backing, and real publicly followed artists with huge followings. Unlike most ICO's, we prefer NOT to display who we work with as this is just a tactic to build hype and show in this ICO World. Instead, we plan to offer our ICO to the people who understand how a development works and how profitable it is to enter at a phase like this. We will be the most community driven ICO as our supporters are large artists with large followings of 50k-500k+ including several artists with 1M+ member followings. This is just a start, and we have plenty more to come. We are supported by one of the best advisors there is and we are backed by several public youth organizations focused around art and creativity within kids and how art can effect their growth.",False

This isn’t another utility token of the future, it is a product for a community that will improve your life now. Decibels is leaving the blockchain development to Cardano and Ethereum while they are focusing on developing a media-based decentralized application to work with those developments.  How can Decibels improve your life?  Music and media files overwhelm virtual storage areas and the ability to torrent and pirate information has made keeping these files on devices unsafe. For the consumer, the issue is the security vulnerabilities consuming media brings to their technology. For creators, it is leaks and pirating that are detrimental to the value of the art and media they have produced. Leaks innately lower the worth of entertainment, harming creators. Decibels wants to lead a music/media revival by integrating security, scalability, and speed of the blockchain network to bring in a new digital era of music/media sales and advertising.  Based on the speed and continued growth of the Ethereum Network, Decibels seeks to secure a personal experience within a perfect ecosystem that allows for growth in the media world.  How will Decibels decentralize the value of media?  Decibels serves to bridge the gap between creator and audience by introducing a market-model to the media industry, meaning that creators can make their own content markets to give their fans, audiences, and communities a way to determine their own worth. Decentralizing the value of media content will be beneficial to creators and consumers.  Decibels is designed to mitigate, and eventually, remove the worry of piracy and media theft. Key developments for hardware, software, and a digital application will be implemented with the aid of the ICO. The end benefit—creating a secure media exchange that will be transferable via a Wallet Address to all your associated devices.  Who is the target audience?  Decibels is designed by creators, for creators. It is made for musicians, artists, designers, directors, developers, producers, filmmakers, journalists, authors, doctors, architects, and media lovers, right on down to the average college student.  The Decibels Team  Decibels is a multicultural and international development team with a dedication to innovation and a new kind of customer service. Based in both Northern America and Asia, Decibels is constantly growing to reach every corner of the globe from Central and South America to Africa to the United Kingdom and more. The Founder and Developer has been interested in cryptocurrency and creating personal Dapp samples since 2015. They are ready to execute the development goals on their roadmap to start a decentralized media renaissance.  About Decibel’s ICO Sale  Decibels’ ICO sale is from March 1 – May 10 and will have three constantly progressing amounts and time frames within that period. The purpose of having stages is to introduce fair market rates once the coin enters the 13 different (already applied for) exchanges. This will prevent the market value from being diminished after any initial sell-offs.",False

Decibels plans to lead the innovation is music/media revival by integrating the security, scale, and speed of the Blockchain network to establish a entirely new digital era of music/media sales and advertising. Based on the speed and continued growth of Ethereum, Decibels will provide a perfect ecosystem for growth in the media world along with a secure personal experience tailored to the entrepreneurial and artistic mind set.  Decibels is a design by creators, for creators. With the simple intent to bring value back to creativity and it’s beholders, while offering the community the ability to base that value as well.

Today’s offerings have diversified from a few choices to buy into to over 1000+ ICO Developments to pick from all over the internet. We have established that it takes a capable team, solid business model, and an exceptional project idea. A lot have hit this mark, but many have missed the solid fact that community involvement and opinion is a mandatory application. We have followed numerous ICO and Token Developments and have came to the conclusion that community involvement has to be the largest factor that plays into the success and overall outcome of a token development.  Today we release our upcoming project called Decibels. Decibels aims to tackle the media securities market like never before. Although there are large developments such as Tron and Viberate, Decibels plans to take a different approach at the media industry in a way we feel could be innovative and also project a very quick adoption by larger publicly used platforms. Decibels plans to be the first Blockchain Codex Development that can be integrated in platforms such as YouTube, SiriusXM, Netflix, Hulu, and other media entertainment sharing platforms that offer files to be used by the public in a manner that can be decentralized via the Blockchain and provide a marketplace environment for these files. What is interesting about our development is that we seek to partner with other developments such as Tron and Viberate to offer our plugin as an option to users on these platforms. This is something of a first in the ICO world were one seeks to unify developments based on already established platforms. It would create a large scale adoption method that could open the doors to larger partnerships as total market control wouldn’t be a direction they are headed. Our ICO will be held on the Ethereum Blockchain, but our main application will be developed on the Cardano Blockchain. Our developers understand the possibilities of what the Cardano Blockchain can offer, and plan to integrate every feature that comes along with the benefit of use of Cardano.  We offer a great business model focused around all media creators and their customers alike. Although missing our first impression by presentation by a small amount, we want to ensure we are focused on our community and definitely provide constant updates with promising returns on responses. Led by our young, skillfully-minded entrepreneur at the age of 23 named Anthony Colón Jr., who has over 5 years experience with Cryptocurrency Development and Implementation, 6 years business marketing and administration experience, and 7 years of PHP Development Skills; He is followed by a team of creative, intelligent, and highly open-minded individuals. Our team is constantly growing by the day and every new addition gets better as it moves along. The best thing about our development is our huge focus on our community outreach and our huge hunger to diversify on an international basis. We feature a widely multicultural executive and development team focused on bringing all forms of community outreach into entertainment and media security. Although in it’s infancy, we definitely hope to be one development to keep an eye out for.  Their ICO begins March 8th, with a short 2 month span separated by 3 price phases spanning from $0.40 up to $1.50. We also are offering bonuses to all eligible token purchases including adding BETA codes to select purchasers that will allow them early access to their platform for testing with open ended bug bounty reward possibilities. Weoffer two forms of payment including Ethereum. The other form of payment which we have integrated is ShapeShift ShapeShift offers a gateway that can exchange over 30 forms of Altcoins into Ethereum or Bitcoin allowing you to perform a payment easily in most types of way! Definitely an awesome addition and something that will help many early buyers diversify their method of payment.  Decibel is the Blockchain approach to multi-media encryption and delivery.

The current film & media movie industry world wide is hovering at around $2.01 Trillion, the home video industry at around $160.8Billion, the music/radio industry is upwards of $250.6 Billion, and the list goes on. While these are large numbers, the current piracy and theft rate is rising from last years position of 32%. This means that a large portion of proceeds is being lost to lower sales and exchanges by theft. Throughout all of this piracy, the media industry is projected to grow and additional 12-20% by 2021 due to the growing network of online social media presence. With Decibels, we plan to innovate and secure this exchange through all forms of implementation right on down to hard-coded radio, mp3 player, and file extensions.  Our main goal flourishes from a early age belief that what you make belongs to you, and shouldn't be hard to give to somebody without worries of it being stolen or replicated.  Decibels plans to develop and integrate a new form of encrypted extension file that can encapsulate and cloak the files being created through it. Through hardware implementation and software additions, Decibels plans to revitalize the media market through military-grade encryption used to attach the blockchain and it's immutable ledger to multi-media creation, exchange, and market development. Our goal is to balance the power of media ownership between the creator and receiver in a way that would retain value for the creator, but implement a volatile marketplace for the receiver in a way that would profit both through exchange of media and supply/demand.

This has caused artists value to demise over time due to no transparency within the music digital royalties market.  SOLUTIONS ______________   Decibels is a leading innovator in the movement to reclaim ownership and control of music and media for their creators, by tapping into the security, scale, and speed of the Blockchain network to establish an entirely new digital era of music, media sales, and advertising. Backed by the speed and exponential growth of the Ethereum Blockchain, Decibels is developing an optimum ecosystem for growth in the media world, together with a secure personal experience tailored to the entrepreneurial and artistic mindset.  HOW IT WORKS ______________   Decibels was founded by creators, for creators, and bridges the divide between digital content providers and their customers by introducing a market approach to the online media industry, allowing creators to establish and develop markets for their content, while providing their customers the opportunity to participate in the content's price determination, thus decentralizing the process of online media content valuation.    1 - Jet-Stream Sales Platform Decibels provides an easy to use Jet-Stream sales process that allows all creators to develop customized markets for their files. Sales can be generated easily with Decibels's mainstream platform that connects all files of creators to high-traffic media platforms, such as YouTube and Vimeo!    2 - Easy Conversion of Earnings Decibels integrates a simple atomic swap feature that allows users to receive payments in Decibels (DCBL tokens) and then exchange them for any tokens that support atomic swap exchanges. It has never been easier to secure, market, and earn money from digital files in a easy clean environment!    3 - Secure System for File Upload Through use of the secure ledger properties of the Blockchain, Decibels creates immutable DApp applications that support high-priority payment and withdrawal transactions that are irreversible. This technology ensures that customer sales conducted on the Decibels platform are secure, and that the value of customer files can not be changed by anyone other than the creator of the files!    4 - Online Wallet and Bank Decibels is partnering with top crypto wallet developers and debit card companies to offer Decibels creators direct access to their earnings through ATM and NFC Payment (touchless payment) applications! This means no more waiting for checks or bank deposits to arrive. Creators can use their earnings immediately, or invest them back into their customer markets for growth and expansion!   DECIBELS USE CASE ______________    1. Register with Decibels Media Creators get started by registering with Decibels Media via the Decibels PC or Mobile Application. Creators will then undergo KYC Verification (legal compliance requirements) to gather information necessary for copyright and ownership rights for their files.  2. Complete Verification Process Upon passing verification, members can develop their creator profile, and select which form of media they will be offering, or they may create a multi-media platform that can be distributed to all mainstream platforms that accept their file type.  3. Upload media files and secure them with Decibels Members will then upload their files directly, or through third-party plugins such as Pro Tools and Reason, allowing for an immediate import into the file vault, and available for market distribution on demand. Members can set specific API keys to ensure that uploaded files reache the market securely.  4. Develop Customer Markets with Decibels Media Marketing Features Once a creator's files are distributed and securely posted to networks such as YouTube, where the Decibels secure Codex eliminates media theft during MP4 Conversion, creators can begin to build the value of their markets through file views, sales, and exchanges when selected features are activated.  5. Inform Audiences Decibels helps creators to keep audiences informed of new media file additions on the Decibels platform, ensuring that customers never miss the latest and best creations.  6. Receive Earnings Proceeds from each sale are instantly added to the creator's Decibels wallet, where they can either be stored, or exchanged for other currencies and transferred to external wallet addresses. Creators also have the option to reinvest their DCBL tokens via advertising and promotion on the Decibels website.  ROADMAP ______________     TOKEN DETAILS ______________   .

There is Viberate which is offering a marketplace for live music industry, but doesn't come close to the market we plan to target. Viberate is limited to the growth of live music and concerts, we don't plan to take on this market what so ever. Our market that we are reaching out to is far less limited to the date and time of live music.  Theta Token is a great observation, but again, they seem to target the issue with YouTube and video content delivery. Although this would be something I would be interested in expanding to, it ultimately isn't the market I am going after either. My plan is to tackle the growing creative market, coupled with the ever expanding tech market. More is to come in our white paper. In the mean time, just know that we are have done our research on current ICO's and we wouldn't waste our time, money, or effort on a development that would over-saturate a already filled marketplace. We are taking extreme care to pay keen attention to market trends and how the creative market influences the technical market and vice-versa.  This will be next level and will have the potential to be implemented in places such as vehicles, mobile/tablets, computers, movies, music, and much much more. Again, we aren't tackling one issue. We are tackling THE issue.",False
