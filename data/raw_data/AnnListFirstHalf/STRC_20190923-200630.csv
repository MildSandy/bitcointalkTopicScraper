They are also experiencing very high levels of coin requests and dealing with 100k+ new members weekly.

Yobit, i paid 0.1BTC to be added there, turns out they are a bit ""suspect and i probably just paid from then to have a good night out.  We dont need Yobit as we are on Cryptopia.  Back to Earth has Facebook and Twitter account and Clay space is on instagram also, this is social promotion, but not paid ads.  There will be glory, with more help from the community here.   I think there is a new website being worked on also, so we will know more when that is released.  So for now, show Cryptopia love, vol needs to improve. More needs done by investors to help promote this project, you know, coins are often successful because they have active communities with a ""can do"" attitude.

Our team worked very hard, and we thank them for their diligence in fixing the enormous mess left by Token Market. We found many errors in Token Market's distribution that led to misplaced funds, inaccessible wallets, and massive confusion. These misplaced tokens totaled over $100,000 and required our immediate attention. Now we are proud to say: Problem Solved!  Token Market attempted to cover up their mistakes and blame our customers for missing funds. They were unwilling to take responsibility. Amicably resolving the situation with TM proved impossible. Fixing the issue would be expensive, and they refused payment through escrow.  Our team is stronger and more confident in our production than ever. The developments in the last three months are phenomenal. We will soon announce our PR team, a restructuring of the production company to encourage innovation, strategic partnerships, casting, and more!  We want to thank the community for sticking with us through these trying times for our startup, and look forward to the real work to come.",False

At this point, we have analyzed enough data to be confident in the veracity of the statements contained in our report. Still, we are wary of engaging in speculation based on our investigation because the whole situation is rather bizarre.  Our team is familiar with pratfalls common in web development that would, in most situations, be the root cause of several issues we found. Further analysis, however, revealed a lack of consistency that is more often caused by human error, and fits with TokenMarket’s explanation that bitcoin payments were manually connected to Ethereum addresses.  Much to our chagrin, we will probably never know exactly what happened that ultimately led to the re-issue. The new token distribution is not contingent on an explanation and we already have what we need to repair the damage and continue to focus on project development; Specifically, the ability to automate rapid distribution of new tokens, a list of Ethereum addresses that should not get new tokens, and the tools to verify token claims.  ...

While we aim to be as transparent as possible with project developments, we have been hesitant to release certain developments because we are creating a story, and if you give away story elements too soon you ruin the experience!  But I also understand that our project could be better at communicating our developments to the community.  So I’m here to answer some questions, like “Why is token distribution taking so long?” “Why did you sell so much of your bitcoin up front?”, “Where is all that money going?”, and ""What's next?""  Why is token distribution taking so long?  Because it is complicated.  Many people had their tokens sent to the wrong address, and we have to manually hunt them down and get a proper address from them for the reissue. The development is also taking a bit longer than anticipated because we are adding new smart contract functionality that will add to the future value of the Back to Earth experience.  Why did you sell so much bitcoin up front?  We raised 750.57 BTC in our crowdfund. Almost immediately following the crowdfund we liquidated over 643 BTC at a market rate of roughly $1450 per BTC. This totaled about $932,000. Since we sold, bitcoin’s price has moved up significantly… so why did we sell so much?  Because we are a company that is creating a product, not a venture capital firm speculating on the future price of bitcoin. By cashing out when we did we were able to immediately hire No Mimes Media to begin pre-production on the transmedia story, we locked in our award winning director, and we began hiring an enormous team to help us with the process of making our first episode. All told, Back to Earth is currently in collaboration with over 30 artists, technical advisors, and creators.  We were only looking to raise $750,000, and so we saw no point in holding the bitcoin as a means of making more money for the project. Our budget is set. And if we didn’t liquidate the bitcoin then we wouldn’t have been able to get moving on so many aspects of the production.  Where is that money going?  Film production is expensive! While I can’t reveal the costs of production for many reasons, I can tell you that a large portion of the budget has been allocated to film/story production. A good story is ultimately what is going to bring people back. Take a look at our white paper. There we outlined budget categories for our production. We are sticking to that very well so far.  What can we look forward to?  Lots of great things are just beyond the horizon. For one, I’ve been working hard to create an experience for everyone holding STRC after the reissue takes place.  We also have some storyboards coming in from our director that I would love to share with you. I will hopefully get a chance to share them in the coming week.  We are slated for production on August 7-11. We should have the first episode edited and ready by October. While we may not release it immediately, we do intend to release the first module of our transmedia experience around that time.  In November we will be taking our work to the American Film Market in an effort to get more funding through traditional methods. So far, many industry professionals have shown interest for our project.  I have been busy meeting with other business leaders and creators both locally in Albuquerque and in Los Angeles to help establish our company’s presence. Blockchain development is picking up in Albuquerque, and my team is working on positioning Back to Earth to be a company that encourages blockchain innovation in New Mexico.

After looking further into the problem, we have identified many factors as to why these individuals did not have access to their tokens–in many cases this was by no fault of their own.  Following this development, we parted ways with our StarCredits distributor and began the process of hiring a developer that would be able to take on the difficult task of reissuing 4.5 million StarCredits tokens. These last few weeks have had us busy analyzing the StarCredits blockchain to determine the best approach to handling the reissue. Since the blockchain industry is still such a small space, there are only a handful of people who are familiar enough with the technology to handle a reissue. Getting in contact with them and picking the right candidate took some time.  While I can announce that we have hired a developer to handle our resissue, we are still unsure as to when the distribution will take place. Obviously, we want to get the new tokens out as soon as possible–even within the next two weeks–but since we are in uncharted waters, we want to go slowly and make sure that we do this right. The last thing we want is to rush this process and then need to do a third reissue!  The good news is that the reissue probably won’t affect you.  If you are currently in possession of your SRC and can access them, then you don’t need to worry about the reissue. When the time comes, your wallet will be credited with an equal amount of the new token. We will essentially take a snapshot of the blockchain at a given point in time and will issue tokens to all wallets that are currently in possession of SRC. If you cannot access your tokens and you have not contacted us, now is the time to do so!  Regarding the future of SRC… well, we have to rebrand the SRC ticker.  Since the SRC ticker will already be in use and created for our first distribution, we are going to have to change the ticker. The new token’s ticker will be STRC. The old token in your wallet is StarCredit (SRC). The new token will be StarCredits (STRC).  We found that this disruption was truly a blessing in disguise.  The original SRC token had next to zero smart contract functionality. This was because we believed that most smart contract functions could be created through third party applications. However, as we have gotten further into pre-production, we have begun to find ways that smart contracts can be implemented to add extra functionality which specifically relate to the Back to Earth experience.  Therefore, the STRC token will have more functionality and uses than its predecessor! This will be showcased on the first day of the reissue through a small project I have been working on to reward our supporters. Stick around to learn more!  Pre-Production Updates  I’ve been in a lot of meetings the last few weeks, talking with directors, app developers, producers, you name it. We are excited to announce that we have locked in our director, and his work is amazing. We will have a more formal release prepared regarding this in the coming weeks.  So far, a lot of pre-production meetings have centered around our story. When you have a series, an app, an ARG experience, and a comic all in development there is a lot of work that goes into creating the story world and developing the cannon. While most of these meetings are closed door, and I can’t discuss what directions the story is headed, I can say that I get more and more excited about it everyday.  One of the many things that has come up in our discussions with our partners at No Mime’s Media is how we can get blockchain technology to play an integral role in our story. We want to do it in a way that not only shines a light on the possibilities of blockchain, but does so in a way that is educational and exciting. This process takes time but has proven to be very rewarding, and I can’t wait to show off some of the wonderful ideas we are beginning to create.  So far we have slated production of the first episode of Back to Earth on August 7-11, 2017. And we are planning to have a portion of the ARG ready by October. All this in preparation for a larger launch in 2018!  Follow us on Twitter to receive updates, or join our Telegram to connect with our team personally.",False

After further discussions with both TokenMarket and our community, we realized that this issue is something that goes deeper than “user error”. Certain participants retain passcodes to their wallets, but simply have not received the correct amount of StarCredits–if any at all.  We were immediately concerned when it was brought to light that this was not about lost seed words. Since we hired TokenMarket to help us correctly distribute StarCredits, we asked them to work with us to deliver the StarCredits to affected participants. Unfortunately, TokenMarket is not interested in compensating affected users for the missing tokens until we pay them for the unfinished crowdfund.  We have offered TokenMarket the option to put their payment in escrow in order to make sure that all parties receive the best outcome and that crowdfund participants aren’t left picking up the bill–but TokenMarket is not willing to use escrow. We find ourselves at a standstill.  Distribution will not continue until we pay, and we will not pay until distribution is completed.  As it stands, we would still be more than happy to use escrow. Then no one has to worry about the money and we can all focus on the solution.  However, since plan A was rejected we are moving forward with plan B. The only fair recourse at this point is to reissue StarCredits as a new token with a new name. Everyone who is holding SRC at the point of the new token distribution will receive an equal amount of the new token. Anyone who was affected by the issue in TokenMarket’s software will also receive the new token in the correct amount. The same will go for all Golden Tickets.  It will take us time to sort this out and we are willing to accept whatever help the community wants to offer. We are sorry that this will affect trading for the time being, but our intention was never to make a coin that traders pump and dump.  We won’t interfere with the market in any way, just replace tokens 1-to-1 and issue tokens that were sent to the wrong address by the crowdfund software.  This drama comes at a time when Clay Space, Back to Earth’s founder, is in Los Angeles meeting with our partners and working with producers to hire talent for the project, including ARG designers.

You say people want a more immersive experience, but perhaps what people really want is something that they can care about. In other words, emotional immersion rather than multi-media or multiple context immersion.  Many people might argue that humanity is already being turned into brain dead animals by [technology| the illuminati | mass entertainment | chemicals in food and envrionment | globalists | the natural cycles of civilisation | aliens | etc]. There are also various different versions of what it means to be 'awake', or 'enlightened', with the term 'woke' being one of the latest new words to be coined, and being used by competing groups for different purposes as far as I can see.  Could the blurring of the lines between game and reality even go as far as the storyline itself, with competition to control the narrative.  You say part of the problem is getting people involved after the initial stages, even though then the puzzles will be getting harder and you may perhaps need to catch up on what happened before - well perhaps some element of the gamification of social / political / cultural competition via game factions could provide the necessary motivation to accomplish this?  I know its terribly presumptuous to even suggest such things when you seem to have such a clear and well planned out map ahead of you already, but as I said I've thought about the gamification of such things in a similar way before and never had another opportunity to get them off my chest so I thought I might as well say it here and at least somebody might see it an run with some aspect if not you.  EDIT: Sorry to hijack your thread with even more of my nonsense, but I feel I should add a note regarding my original thoughts on the matter which I mentioned:  You have multiple factions with the game rewarding you if you bridge factions for individual solutions / campaigns / narratives, so the point of the game is to initially support your faction to push their perspective into the broader narrative, but ultimately the winner is the one which brings the most people behind the same narrative.  I literally don't know if that makes any significant sense to anybody reading this, but at the risk of sounding like a deranged hippy: it was a beautiful dream, man.",False

You will be happy to know that we are thinking about all of this! I'll respond to a few of your points because I think people reading through the thread will benefit by it.  ""You say people want a more immersive experience, but perhaps what people really want is something that they can care about. In other words, emotional immersion rather than multi-media or multiple context immersion.""  Emotional immersion is exactly what people want, and that is why we are using transmedia to bring it to people. A movie or a book can be engaging, but it doesn't completely engulf the audience within the world. Transmedia gets people engaged in ways that they may never expect, and that may feel more ""genuine"" than simply watching a movie or reading a book. In fact, most of the largest political movements in history have taken place through a transmedia environment. It has been shown throughout history that the best way to get people involved with a cause is to engage them through multiple platforms.  ""Could the blurring of the lines between game and reality even go as far as the storyline itself, with competition to control the narrative.""  Today's world is filled with competing narratives. People who believe in climate change and those who don't, people who think bitcoin is a new paradigm in technological development and people who think it is a scam, people who believe certain truths are false, and vice versa. Our alternate reality experience will absolutely aim to challenge our audience's preconceived notions of ""truth."" And it may lead to certain audience members taking away one ""truth' from the experience, while other audience's take away a completely different ""truth."" We intend for parts of our experience to be nearly indistinguishable from reality.  ""You say part of the problem is getting people involved after the initial stages, even though then the puzzles will be getting harder and you may perhaps need to catch up on what happened before - well perhaps some element of the gamification of social / political / cultural competition via game factions could provide the necessary motivation to accomplish this?""  We are going to tackle this through a few various methods. The simplest way to do it is to have on-ramps into the deeper aspects of the game through a variety of forms of mass media (for instance, apps, films, websites, social media, etc). But some of the deeper content that will be created for niche communities and fragmented groups across the world will absolutely need to spark a desire in those who interact with it to share it and get others involved.
