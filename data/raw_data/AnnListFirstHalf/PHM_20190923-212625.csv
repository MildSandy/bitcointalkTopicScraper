In my humble opinion, it was a mistake only choosing certain amount of people to participate in the bounty program, because if you choose 30 people for a certain task, maybe half of those chosen wont even do it anymore or changed their mind or now forgot about this after 3 weeks waiting. Also, it took you guys 3 weeks to send the emails to the applicants of the bounty program, those were 3 valuable weeks that could have been used to spread the word and make this viral.  Pros: You guys have a great working product: still in Beta but it works wonderful, the app doesnt drain the battery nor heats the cell phone, which shows you guys are very good on the technical aspect. You guys are honest: you decided to get a working product first and self-fund yourselves almost a year, and then after that start the ICO, this is very admirable. Very different from 99% of the ICOs out there. The concept is wonderful: mining only with your mobile will make it easy for the regular people to be able to join the crypto world and mine without having to spend thousands of dollars in equiptment like antminers or any of those devices that are too difficult to set up and take too much electric power. Only mining (real mining) with your mobile, is genius.  Cons: You guys dont know how to market this product. The bounty program is a good example on how inneficient you guys are at trying to make this go viral or promote this great product. You SHOULD NOT control who participates in the bounty program, you SHOULD let whoever wants to participate go ahead and do it, and they themselves send you proof daily/weekly of their progress in getting the word out. Should have hired just 1 guy to be in charge of this supervision. It took you 3 weeks to send the emails to the applicants of the bountry program. Almost half of the time of the ICO. A lot of valuable time wasted.  Anyway, I wish you guys good luck and hopefully see the release of the mainnet before the end of the year.  Best regards.",False

The investment fund contacted us soon after our announcement that we were going to take the Google Play Store head-on and distribute our app directly from our website, along with other third-party download sites.  Ivan Likov, the founder of Phoneum, in speaking about the investment, “They (the investment fund) agree that mobile mining should be made available for all, regardless of income or location. It is time to even the playing field and give everyone with a smart device the opportunity to participate in making cryptocurrency relevant now and in the future.”  Following the commitment, we have surpassed the $1,000,000.00 USD Soft Cap. Including the private, presale and current ICO phases, we have now raised more than $2,300,000.00. This means that Phoneum will not only become a reality, but that it will allow us to grow and become leaders in the mobile mining industry.

Using the Bancor Network, holders of the Phoneum token (PHM) will be able to convert PHM to any token on the Bancor Network. Users who want to buy PHM tokens will be able to buy them directly through the Bancor Web App.  https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*csEYDh_lxY_G4vjK8dKQQQ.jpeg  “We believe that mobile technology will drive cryptocurrency adoption. In our search for the best technologies to integrate, Bancor continuously came out on top.” Said Ivan Likov, the founder of Phoneum. “We like how their system is fair and equitable. It is based on the buys and sells of a token and no spread is created, unlike other networks.”  Bancor is not like other exchanges where people buy and sell tokens. The Bancor Protocol involves various Relay Tokens. A Relay Token is an ERC20 compliant token that is configured with two connectors, one that holds a balance of BNT and one that holds a balance of another ERC20 token. So, it can be PHMBNT (Phoneum Bancor Relay) or ETHBNT (Ether Bancor Relay). Converting one token for another is done through these relays on the Bancor Network.  Understanding the Phoneum token Relay:  https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*-96E1lNNbUfRV08x46NNrg.jpeg  The Relay Token will hold two token types. One is the PHM and the other is BNT. People who want to convert tokens using our Relay Token can send one type of token to our Relay Token (like BNT) and this will then buy an intermediate token called PHMBNT. This will then be exchanged for PHM.  Each step of the transaction will incur 0.1% transaction fee. There were two conversions in this case, so the fee would be 0.2%.  Therefore, using a transaction path we can convert PHM to any other token on the Bancor Network in no more than two steps.  ETH > BNT > PHMBNT > PHM (this can also work in reverse)   About Bancor Bancor Protocol is a standard for the creation of Smart Tokens™, cryptocurrencies with built-in convertibility directly through their smart contracts. Bancor utilizes an innovative token “connector” method to enable formulaic price calculation and continuous liquidity for all integrated tokens, without needing to match two parties in an exchange. Smart Tokens interconnect to form token liquidity networks, allowing user-generated cryptocurrencies to thrive. To convert tokens instantly, visit the Bancor Web App or join the Bancor Telegram group for more information.  About Phoneum Phoneum set out to deliver a simplified user experience and platform enabling all users – regardless of technical aptitude – to fully participate in the new cryptocurrency economy. Phoneum tokens (PHM) can be earned through mining, through the purchasing of tokens on an exchange or by redeeming tokens to create a transaction. Phoneum is a decentralized cryptocurrency and product that is revolutionary with its customized blockchain and algorithm for consensus. It was developed specifically for mobile devices (Android and iOS). The Phoneum application and product focuses on ease-of-use and speed of a transaction. Phoneum’s mission is to drive mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies by allowing anyone with a mobile device to participate.

Recently we have been made aware of Google banning crypto currency mining apps in their Google Play Store. This comes on the heels of Apple banning mining apps a month ago.  We at Phoneum applaud this decision. Sometimes cleaning house is required in order to reestablish credibility. Gone will be the apps that overheat phones, destroy battery life, mine in the background without permission, or make promises that can’t be delivered upon.  Unfortunately, we fully expect that our app will be thrown into this basket, without fully understanding the capabilities or the science behind Phoneum.  But we also believe that as the word gets out, acceptance will come. And with that acceptance, the ability to truly mine on a smart mobile device.  Ivan Likov, the founder and lead developer on the Phoneum project has spent years creating an algorithm that can mine on a smart mobile device, just as one would while using an expensive mining rig. He took the unusual route of self-funding and creating a Proof of Concept (PoC) to prove the naysayers wrong. Phoneum believes in transparency and will be releasing the code on GitHub when we are on the main net later this year.  Imagine for a moment, how true mobile mining changes the game. With over 2.1 Billion smart devices worldwide, the playing field has never been more even.  How does this work?  Phoneum uniquely combines Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Time (PoT) consensus mechanisms in which to earn PHM tokens. This combination ensures all miners are rewarded for their participation and contribution to network growth – rewarding all miners for any time that is spent running the Phoneum app, unlike traditional PoW consensus algorithms that only reward the miner who is first to solve the cryptographic puzzle. The algorithm has been developed to separate ASIC or computer-based miners to ensure they do not game the network and ensures a level-playing field for mobile-only miners.  The app is designed to leverage a device’s built-in battery and CPU sensors to monitor device temperature and ensure that it does not overheat. If a smart mobile device approaches overheating, the user will receive a notification that they are temporarily “off” from mining. However, unlike in a Proof of Work (PoW) only consensus mechanism where a computer must be constantly doing work in order to earn rewards (Which can lead to increased risk of overheating) Phoneum’s customized algorithm integration of Proof of Time (PoT) will enable miners to continue to earn rewards. While the mining function in the app is not active, it is still functioning as a node while the app is open and this Proof of Time (PoT) applies to help miners to continue to earn rewards.  We have data to back this up. We began alpha testing first on Android in January 2018. We maxed our cap of 10,000 downloads, with not a single reported incident of overheating or shortened battery life. In fact, the data in many cases showed that the Phoneum app used less resources than the majority of popular apps on the Google Play Store. The iOS Beta was launched in February 2018 and was capped at 10,000 downloads. Again, no reports of overheating or shortened battery life. Currently we are running on a combined testnet that allows for both Android and iOS to coexist. We have over 13,000 active miners online. They too have not reported any issues with the apps and applaud its simplicity and stability.  Our mission is to provide mining for everyone. While Google (and Apple) feel the need to ban mobile mining apps, we have made the conscious decision to release Phoneum outside of the Google Play environment. The incredibly popular game, Fortnite, has recently announced a similar approach.  Starting today, you can download our Android app directly from our website: https://phoneum.io/  We have also made it available on the following popular third-party vendors:  Mobilism: https://forum.mobilism.org/viewtopic.php?f=399&t=2691356 Xda-Developers: https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-phoneum-mobile-cryptocurrency-v1-6-t3825469  We recently undertook an ICO to raise the funds to finish the app. The ICO runs through September 30, 2018.

So then, for the average user, what's the coin they will be able to mine with this?

Today we would like to provide an update on the upcoming Crowdsale. Governments around the world have stepped up their regulations of cryptocurrencies, and here in Canada that is true for us as well. We have been working closely with our legal counsel to make sure that all rules are followed and that we are staying at the forefront of a constantly changing environment. While the regulatory environment is the primary reason for this update, we also recognize the current state of the cryptocurrency market. After much discussion with our advisors, back and forth with our counsel and listening to those who have expressed concern in the community, we have concluded that it would be in everyone’s best interest to reschedule our Crowdsale. The new Crowdsale dates will be June 21, 2018 – July 21, 2018. We have made a few adjustments to our offering, based on the testing and feedback from our alpha and beta testers.  •   Total Supply:  20,000,000,000 PHM •   Sale Allocation: 2,462,500,000 PHM •   PHM exchange rate:  $0.01 USD or = 1 PHM •   Project Soft cap:  $1,000,000 USD •   Project Hard cap:  $20,000,000 USD •   Stage bonuses:  35% / 30% / 25% / 20% / 15% •   Presale: 100,000,000 PHM + 35% = 135,000,000 PHM •   Stage 1: 475,000,000 PHM + 30% = 617,500,000 PHM •   Stage 2: 475,000,000 PHM + 25% = 593,750,000 PHM •   Stage 3: 475,000,000 PHM + 20% = 570,000,000 PHM •   Stage 4: 475,000,000 PHM + 15% = 546,250,000 PHM •   Payment options:  Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Wire Transfer A Presale will be held in advance of the Crowdsale. If you are an accredited investor and would like to participate, please email us with your interest to: contact@phoneum.io On Wednesday, April 11, 2018 we will be releasing the updated apps, opening more seats for testing and unveiling our new website, which will have full details on the Crowdsale and project roadmap!

One of the tasks was to write about the project in our Bitcointalk thread. Therefore, people just decided to post all those comments on their own will, and we have never told anyone what to write.  The reason why everyone jumped on this airdrop campaign is the actual project.  Phoneum is a decentralized cryptocurrency, that operates on mobile devices only!  I have worked for several months on a unique algorithm to differentiate computers and ASIC miners from mobile devices allowing me to create this Mobile Only Cryptocurrency.  The app is now available on an alpha test network for Android, and for 13 days, we have more than 800 users and about 2100 mobile miners at the time of this message.  Because it is a mobile-only cryptocurrency, it gives equal rights to all miners on the network.  I would be happy to connect and discuss further if you are interested.  Best regards,  Ivan",False

If you are interested, I wrote a PM to you.  2) I am in the negos right now with 2 teams and want to become a community manager for their ICOs. I've drawn an extremely valuable learning. Never-ever incentivize any sort of posting. Actually, you'd be much better off just deleting all them one-line posts, coz it looks really fishy.  Quote from: taseigerku on January 16, 2018, 02:13:57 AM if phoneum could solved the problem of mining without eaten by whale and getting dumped..then im in!   This is a very correct approach, Taseigerku.  I think that the project would have to deliver on the three fronts:  1) deliver an actual solution to a problem - how I mine with my mobile phone 2) prevent any whale-ification by restriciting the allowed number of tokens that any particular person can purchase 3) prevent any dumpt action - will I guess that if you ahve 1) and 2) in place, then you just need to regularly post updated info on the socials and move on with your project, rolling outs its stages.",False

If you have an entry level smartphone(4 cores, at least 1 GHz per core, 1 GB of ram and Android 4 to 5 inches screen, for this case scenario), you can make an estimated 4~4.2 phm per hour, anyways your mileage may vary, still its a good measure and it gives an idea of how much can you earn.
