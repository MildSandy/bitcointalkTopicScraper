Just as I have promised in the previous post, every month there would be an update on our finished and future work. Let’s get to business.  Ethbits Local:   What do we have now on Ethbits Local: – 5 cryptocurrencies for selling, buying and exchanging: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethbits, Monero, Onix;  – 239 countries, 78 payment methods, 169 fiat currencies which you can select while creating your offer;  – Site is available in 3 languages: English, Spanish and Chinese;  – We added 3 fields Headline,  Payment Details and Terms of Trade upon creating an offer for more detailed information for your future buyers/sellers;  – Added function “On Vacation” (on the page Settings -> Notifications), which allows you to deactivate your offer if you are not interested in trading at the moment.  – In modal sale window we added links-buttons for minimum and maximum so you can use them by clicking and not writing the data manually.    What’s next? – Improvements, improvements and again improvements. We are always open for constructive criticism and suggestions on improving design and logistics of Ethbits Local. We will be grateful if you leave your comments.  – Is 5 cryptocurrencies enough for p2p exchanger? I think not. In the near future we will add 1 minable coin and 2 ERC20 tokens.  – “New cooperations” – not empty words you heard from us in Telegram group. Which? Follow our news in social networks to be the first to find out.  – Redesign of the exchange page. Unlike other exchangers, we have p2p exchange crypto-to-crypto. Currently Ethbits Local is a hybrid of centralized trade and p2p platform. When you do something which doesn’t have analogies it’s always uneasy, BUT we have a few ideas which will make p2p exchange crypto-to-crypto easy and convenient for all the users.  – SMS notifications + online mode. Don’t want to miss a deal because you went out to make some tea? Easy.  – SEO improvements for public traders page.    iTrade: 1) Pre-registration for traders will be open in the beginning of January through our legal service;  2) Design of the exchange will be presented in the end of 2017;  3) ExchangeDB technology is in the stage of testing;  4) In closed Beta version there will be over 25 currency pairs;  5) UI of the exchange will be devided into 2 versions: for newbies and for professional traders, which would allow every user to Trade easily;  6) I often encounter the question about iTrade development process not being transparent. The answer is – iTrade is a half decentralized exchange. We cannot make our GIT repository public for security reasons. Design as I mentioned above will be provided by the end of this year.  Thank you all for your time. If you have additional questions or suggestions please write them in the comments below this post or in our Telegram channel.

Not only have we been looking for other crypto related companies to join force with we have been also thinking outside the box and very close to securing a partnership with a UK sports betting company in order to allow users to not only copy trade but to place bets on cryptos. We have found an easy way to implement this and this will also prove disruptive to prediction and gambling sites so we will not be giving any more details until after launch. Another few projects we will mention and to show our support we will be giving back the full referral fee to people who joined because of this email. However please do not consider this investment advise and do your own research on the company before participation.  IGNITE RATINGS https://igniteratings.com/  The first company is Ignite Ratings based in Gibraltar which is the worlds first decentralised self – regulating investment intelligence platform powered by crowd source opinion. They are about to hold an ICO and we are very lucky to have been offered access to a private pre sale. Ethbits intend to integrate part of the platform in part of Ethbits iTrade to support the social trading aspect. Some highlights of this project are:  Great team which highly relevant experience. I have personally spoken with EVERY team member and can say they are solid guys with an amazing vision and impressive track record of execution.

As you are aware we’ve been working hard on Ethbits.com, our local P2P exchange and Ethbits iTrade. Striving to deliver the best product possible optimising the user interface based on feedback.  Once again we’d like to take this opportunity for thanking our community who have placed their trust in us and maintained their confidence as we’ve been working very hard to deliver the best products in a timely manner. We look forward to a bright future for the Ethbits project and growing our community in as many countries where crypto is traded.  As promised, We will be delivering our 2nd quarterly airdrop in ETH to the ETBS holders on December 8th 10pm GMT. As we do a snapshot to the Ethereum blockchain to know which ethereum address is holding ETBS and is empowered to receive their % of the airdrop and snapshot and airdrop deposit happens at the same time, it is critical, that in preparation for this event, you do the following before:  1. Close any outstanding ETBS orders on EtherDelta, Hitbtc, Coinexchange or any other exchanges before December 8th and make sure you do it before 10 pm GMT. You can buy more tokens to receive more % of ETH, but just if you buy and withdraw to your wallet before the snapshot, you cannot receive ETH if you buy ETBS after the snapshot.  2. Ensure that you hold your ETBS tokens on an Ethereum address where you own and control the private key. Please withdraw from exchanges.  3. Hold your ETBS token on an Ethereum wallet where you own and control the private key until the EthBits team has communicated that the snapshot already happened and you can claim your dividends, otherwise you may miss the snapshot and the airdropped ETH.  As an important reminder, PLEASE WITHDRAW FROM EXCHANGES to your wallet and make sure you hold your tokens in your wallet before DECEMBER 8TH 10PM GMT to be able to receive % of the airdrop as we said before.

I very much thank you for your support. My name is Dmitry and I am the tech lead of the Ethbits project.  Perhaps everyone would agree if I say when you are really passionate about something – you forget about everything else. We’ve been so immersed into the development of iTrade that we forgot the most important thing – to keep you, our investors and users, updated on this whole development process.  I ask you people to forgive us for this omission. It will not happen again. Every month, (starting from today) October 25, we will be posting in our blog all the reports about our finished, ongoing and future work.  Now more specifically about work.  Ethbits Local: UI/UX  We have taken into account all the feedback and wishes of our users regarding the current design, and going to present you a new design of the project. I’m sure it will be equally handy for the experienced “cryptoworld” inhabitants and to the newbies. We will make 3 versions of trades: Buy – to buy cryptocurrency for fiat money; Sell – sell cryptocurrency for fiat money; Exchange – immediate exchange of cryptocurrencies between themselves. Sure you are going to like the simplicity and conveniencies of the new admin-panel.  XMR  At the moment of launching of the new version of Ethbits Local we will also add XMR. Which currency do you want to add next? Please write in the comments or in our group in Telegram.  Countries and currencies  We will expand the opportunities for creating offers for the majority of the countries and will add the option to use in dynamic formula the rates of different cryptocurrency exchangers or  currencies from coinmarketcap. Your rates could always be dynamically manageable according to the rate you prefer.  Limits  We are concerned about legality of our project, therefore any attempts to launder money through our service will not succeed. We have done our best to increase the limit as much as it is allowed by law. Perhaps some do not agree and ask why would I give out my data to this project? Answer is simple – verification of your identity and personal phone number is not a problem if you sell/buy cryptocurrency legally.  Favorites, avatars, notifications, best-search…  And many many other small improvements, that will help you to trade even easier.  All changes will be applied on November 13, 2017.  Ethbits iTrade:   A New Era  iTrade will be half decentralized thanks to ExchangeDB technology. Platform will be oriented on developers, traders and regular users. This technology will be entirely opensource and be using our own blockchain. We will introduce this technology in the beginning of January. Unfortunately I cannot uncover development details because me and my team need to discuss legal copyright questions and patent this technology. Only after that it will show up in the public repository GitHub.  User? Trader? Newbie?  iTrade will include: Exchange, Copy Trading feature and Social platform for trades. Regardlessly of your level of knowledge in cryptocurrencies – iTrade will give an opportunity to anyone who is willing to dip into the exciting world of trading.  When mooooon?  At this moment we have finished the basic functional of ExchangeDB, by the end of October we will finalize the visual part and design. Closed beta version – middle of spring, launch for public access – middle of summer 2018.  Security  We divide Web applications into 3 parts: legal service, main application and wallets.  Legal service – we will use our own application to verify the data (https://id.ethbits.com). Your data won’t be kept on the same server with main application.  Main application – access to the main server will not be made by ssh key or login/password. Hack from the outside is not possible.  Wallets – thanks to the ExchangeDB technology no one will be able to substitute the data about your transactions.  For now it’s all I can tell publically. All the list of technologies will be published on the iTrade landing page.    Pre-registration for traders and people who want to participate in closed beta tests will start after the publishing of legal service.

The platform includes payment via cryptocurrency, bank account transfers, and cash trades.  Ethbits is gaining popularity from users through its low transaction fees of 0.5% whilst also offering exchange via ETH and its own in-house token ETBS as well as bitcoin. The next coins expected to be available are Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) which focus on user privacy.  EthBits raised 13,786 ETH (worth $1.3 million at the time) from 820 investors in its crowdsale and has distributed 1.3 million ETBS tokens.  Matthew Radbourne, marketing manager of EthBits explained more:  “We’re very pleased that BCB ATM have agreed to make EthBits available through their network of ATMs. As cryptocurrency goes mainstream, there will be an ever-greater demand for convenient solutions such as ours.”  “The research shows that traditional cash and cashpoints aren’t going out of fashion any time soon. If we want people to use cryptocurrency, we need to start offering them solutions that are already familiar to them”  ETBS, the local currency of EthBits has recently been enhanced to reward token holders based upon the profit from the platform and also has a token burn function which will be utilized in the coming months based on the amount of profit generated through the platforms. 132 ETH was distributed to token holders in August with a further payment expected in January 2018.

Let me quote what Cryptopia said to me on the 5th August.  ""Hi Joseph.  Yes, I am sorry it has taken this long to get a final conclusion for you.  We have opened up the wallets so users can withdraw their ETB from Cryptopia and we will begin the delisting process.  rather then rehash the situation, I will actually just copy/paste the final email we have sent to the ETB team so you have it straight from the horses mouth so to speak  The Cryptopia Managers team have spent some time this week discussing the current situation with Ethbits and the future of trading Ethbits at Cryptopia.  While the CTO, was willing to discuss what would be needed to get ETB fully operational and trading on Cryptopia again, he was hesitant as there were concerns from the Dev team, that this could possibly open up an other issue having three different contracts coming into Cryptopia and the potential load on support this may cause.  The business team has estimated the cost of support for ETB to date at approximately $25,000, so including this cost with the potential future issues that concerned the Dev team, Management has decided that the best thing to do is open the ETB wallets and let users withdraw their coins.  We will permanently close the markets and regrettably will not consider another application from ETB at this time.  I am aware this was not the desired outcome, however we sincerely wish you and your team the best for the future of ETB. """,True

Quote from: bizzargin on September 01, 2017, 04:49:45 PM Quote from: cabron on September 01, 2017, 03:39:58 PM  Why do it needs our private key, Isn't this something of a security issue later? I'm not sure if I would like to get my Dividends already but would like to hear something from an expert who knew more about this. Waiting for the exchange too.  You need to validate that you own the wallet that you are claiming the dividends to. Also saves the funds from being send to a wallet that is not currently in use.  For example, if you lost your priv key, there is no reason for the team to keep sending dividends there.  I think so, but if you're not okay with the answer, you can directly ask the developers on Telegram channel.  https://t.me/ETBS_Official",True

Balances from the original ETB token contract (https://etherscan.io/address/0x807B9487aaF00629B674bd6d02E4917453bc5939) and the upgraded ETB token contract (https://etherscan.io/address/0x4fE6Ea636aBe664E0268Af373A10CA3621A0B95b) were taken as of block number 4190270 and combined to initialise the balances on the new ETBS token contract (https://etherscan.io/address/0x1b9743f556d65e757c4c650b4555baf354cb8bd3).  Going forward from this block (4,190,270), the original and upgraded ETB contracts will no longer be used for any purpose by EthBits and as such any token balances or transfers on these contracts will be ignored – only the new ETBS token contract will be recognised by the EthBits team.  The new ETBS token contract has the following functionality and features: 1. An ETBS token symbol – this allows us to cleanly list our new token on exchanges, starting with EtherDelta. 2. Based on the MiniMeToken used by a number of recent high profile ICOs with well-audited code and features. 3. Ability to query balances as of specific block numbers – this allows us to implement an easy profit sharing scheme for dividend payments. 4. Token burning functionality (currently turned off) – this allows us to proceed with our EthBits roadmap to add utility for the ETBS token.  Further details regarding the profit sharing contract will be communicated in the coming days, so we encourage you to keep a close eye on the usual communication channels for this and further exciting updates on the EthBits project. The approach we are taken is detailed in the Medium article: https://medium.com/@adam.dossa/dividend-payment-contract-based-on-minimetoken-90e5ba7c85d5  Once again we’d like to take this opportunity for thanking our community who have placed their trust in us, and maintained their confidence as we’ve working through these token related problems. Now that this is behind us we look forward to a bright future for the EthBits project that we all passionately believe in!

Quote from: Orias67 on August 23, 2017, 06:06:20 PM I got my ETBS tokens so I guess the swap is succession for me.  Thank you, when will you send first dividends ?  Glad to hear that. The dividens is planned to get distributed in August. We'll get more detailed information related to this.   Quote from: addicto on August 23, 2017, 06:10:10 PM It was totally surprise for me when I saw I have new tokens which were marked as ERC20 tokens. When I proceeded to check the source I realized that Ethbits just swapped the token. But old tokens still were appearing in wallet at the same time.  The swap was perfectly implemented and finished successfully. Old tokens are useless. Keep it or burn it, up to you. ",True

I'm on ETB telegram channel and seems they want to do another token swap!!! really i don't understand why.... and what about trading?? if someone needs to sell for liquidity?? simply he can't... not good for investors!!! i disagree.  I understand your concerns. Stay in the Telegram channel please, it's the most trusted way of getting informed about the progress.  As you know, manual token upgrades was planned, but then, the team decided to cancel it to fix the problem much faster with the token swap they designed. With the swap, all of the ETB tokens will be upgraded to the last version no matter whether they're upgraded. This way, we will get rid of that code problem and this won't be a bump on the road anymore.  For the exchange, you're right unfortunately. Remember this swap is to get rid of the problems. But, we expect new listings after the token swap is done perfectly. The team also explained this in the telegram channel. For now, make sure you store your ETB tokens only in your own safe ETH wallet. Don't store them in Crptopia or Etherdelta.

NOTE: It's your own responsibility to read the blog post to take the required steps. Please pay attention, folks.   ETB Token Swap and Dividends  Dear Investors,  We would like to thank you for your patience and update you with what is soon to come.  1. ETB to ETBS token swap.  We encountered an issue where not all investors have upgraded their tokens from the old to the new ETB contract. This caused issues with Cryptopia exchange, and paused trading for ETB.  We are going to resolve this issue by doing a token swap, the contract is already done and currently in audit phase. During the swap, old and new ETB tokens contracts will be swapped into a new token ETBS (new ticker). Nothing will be required from investors to do aside from having ETB tokens in a wallet that investors control private keys to. (Myetherwallet for example)  We ask you to withdraw ETB tokens from Cryptopia and Ether Delta before the token swap, which will be implemented in about 2 weeks from today. Cryptopia withdrawals are open for upgraded tokens and have been tested by Ethbits team, If you have any tokens missing on CRYPTOPIA from the old contract, which affected a few users, then the support at CRYPTOPIA should give these back to you (we don’t have access to their wallet), please contact them. As it stands we have no agreement to continue with CRYPTOPIA therefore we advise users should withdraw their tokens as soon as possible  Note: ETBS (new ticker) tokens will be listed on new exchanges and will be used to pay out dividends and fees in our local platform (same as before).  If you do not withdraw your tokens from exchanges you will be responsible for potential loss of tokens and dividends. Deadline will be announced shortly this week with a proper blog entry with every detail regarding this, you can start to withdraw from exchangers since now.  2. ETHBITS LOCAL  Our Local platform is in the final stages and NEW image is done and waiting for ETBS integration (swap contract) to be fully opened. We anticipate releasing the site by the end of August 2017. Shortly after, we will also release an official report which will cover our achievements, further look ahead and other relevant information.  Ethbits team will also be partaking in strategical partnerships and attending relevant crypto related events.  3. PROFIT SHARING  In August we intend to get the new token distributed and start paying back something to the holders of ETBS that has been made by indexing some of the ICO funds. Although Ethbits Local has made minimal profit during open Beta we have decided to release some funds (dividends) back to the community for the support, as we promised in the ICO. The profit sharing amount will be paid out to our investors and will be based on a snapshot, the date and amount will be announced property in a separate blog entry shortly.  Note: To get dividends you will need to have ETBS in the wallet that you control private keys to.     The ETHBITS team will remain at your disposal to clarify any doubts that may arise regarding this or any other situation.

Quote from: privateclub1 on August 06, 2017, 03:51:36 PM What is the offical contract adress and decimal to create a custom token ETB on MyEtherWallet ? Anyone has transfered their ETB from Cryptopia to MEW recently ? Thanks  PS: The last time a created and added a custom token ETB to MEW and sent 1 ETB for test and it was lost ( never reached MEW ) Transaction = ZERO history   You must be doing something wrong... If you have upgraded ETB tokens on Crptopia, withdraw is working fine for now. And people are withdrawing their ETB tokens from Cryptopia to their safe ETH wallets. If you have old (not upgraded) ETB tokens on Cryptopia, immediately contact with them to withdraw or you won't be able to get the dividends.  0x4fE6Ea636aBe664E0268Af373A10CA3621A0B95b in the Address field, ETB in the Token Symbol field & 12 in the Decimals field.

If you sent to old contract (sent without upgrading), you must write to cryptopia to ask for the devolution. Then upgrade and wait until the market is resume again. In this case, cryptopia is the only one who will send your ETB tokens back.  If you sent to the new contract, you must have them in your balance there.

Quote from: Btc_1856 on July 03, 2017, 12:18:09 PM Quote from: fudster on July 03, 2017, 12:11:48 PM  Can you tell us what is the reason why there is the need to upgrade? I don't really know.  And why will ETHBITS be cheaper soon when I remember correctly its supply is just a million something and its marketcap is $2M. If its going to resume soon the price still still be $2 something, isn't it?  Because there are Bounty Hunter who is selling them at a low price and now they are upgrading because they find some bugs when they are auditing the process. To list in major exchange it is compulsory not only Ethbits there are many other who are upgrading.  This is a valid answer, I believe. If you need further information about the reasons for ETB upgrade, please visit the web site below.  https://blog.ethbits.com/2017/06/30/upgrade-status/  Quote from: Garrett Burgwardt on July 03, 2017, 12:55:37 PM This is not a good sign, Its just a scam project. See, they promise to make the platform 2 weeks from ICO, and there is nothing yet. LOL One more thing, the price drops not because only of bounty hunters, it is because people doesnt have interest in the coin itself.. So look at this, supply = very high..demand = super low, Then ask yourself what will happen.  Please stop spreading FUD about EthBits project. The process and team are absolutely transparent and nothing has been hided so far. Saying that demand is super low does not make sense. If you say so, try to sell ETB tokens and see how fast the others are grabbing them.",True

We will present the solution within 2 weeks so try not be too disheartened with the current price or volume.  To briefly mention the Signature Campaign: Ethbits had a signature campaign to help promote the crowdsale on the Bitcointalk forum. When we started the campaign, we announced each post would be worth up to 0.9 ETB.  The price of ETH went up dramatically, and we decided to increase the signature campaign to 3% of ETB sold during the crowdsale. We DID NOT penalise early participants - we awarded everyone in a fair manner. When the crowdsale was over, we had approximately 47 participants, meaning the rewards were very high. To be fair to investors while not penalising participants, the translations were included and the figures can be seen below:    By modifying the original plan, this turned out to be more beneficial to the Sig Campaign participants and token holders.  All tokens not used will be burned and this will be mentioned in the Monthly report which will outline how many tokens we are able to burn per month (in other words by paying less Ethbits will not keep any more tokens). This means the token supply will continuously be decreasing, as originally planned, which is great for the holders.

There is almost no volume and one person is doing this on purpose. I don't know if you're familiar with Etherdelta, but it does not work like a real exchange and can be very manipulative. One could make meaningless ""buy"" and ""sell"" applied on his own orders there.  The old contract-based part of Etherdelta is will possibly be closed soon. The valid Etherdelta link is below and the lowest seller asks for 0.08 ETH (almost $3) per ETB and this real price is ABSOLUTELY not meaningless like $0.003 and so on.  https://etherdelta.github.io/#ETB-ETH",True

The Devs has nothing to do with dumping on exchanges. They're decentralized and free markets which anyone can engage in. For coinmarketcap web site, the problem is they reflect the meaningless prices observed on Etherdelta exchange. I already explained the situation in my previous post. There is no market depth, furthermore, one could make meaningless ""buy"" and ""sell"" orders applied on his own orders there. This means the ETB price on coinmarketcap web site could be look like $250 or $0.003 as a result. This does not change the real value of ETB tokens.",True

It takes some getting use too, but Etherdelta very clean, and lean platform...  moving forward though, yes Etherdelta is pretty much the reason for low price, because its super niche, and the avg trader doesn't like a learning curve.  Basically, its a great place to pickup a bargain!  That being said, the price for ETB on the Ethbits site is listed @ $5 a coin....  When the dev has a suggested price for $5 and the coin is trading on Etherdelta for ~$2ish... you know what that means boys.  Easy double up.  This coin when it hits the bittrex will trade upwards of $5 dollars.  Based on ETH being $250 right now, each shares base intrinsic value should roughly be $2.50, however because extra tokens were burned... This creates valuation roughly 3.3x  So the fair price should roughly be around $8-10 dollars a coin. On top of that, this coin grants dividends!!!!!  True valuation will be reached on Bittrex within a few days.  Yeah need I say more? A coin that gives dividends and is under $10 bux, and allows you to own a shares in two separate trading exchanges.  Yeah.... Ethbits to the Moon. To all the sharps out there.

After receiving the money almost no information on Ethbits side, which contrast with a message every hour during the ICO. I do not get it, as 2 millions USD is not such a big sum to escape with it and it breaks their careers in future. If they worked on the project, they could make x10 or x100 with fees and their token value increase as the project itself seems really promising.  Still out of 3 linkedIn profiles on ICO site 2 are still there (Monty Singh and Dmitry Sergeev) and 1 was deleted (Pedro J Rodriguez). I have the tokens on my MEW wallet and probably all of you have it (just need to add it as custom token manually) and yesterday they posted an info on Twitter.  I wonder that maybe there was some break in the team? Someone escaped withe the money and the other do not know what to do?

I also raised concerns about the signature campaign manager (account seemed to be bought, e-mail + password recently changed). I had some not very pleasant DM's from this campaign manager. When asking the ethbits account if they would do something about this, they said no, they would not change the campaign manager. A few weeks later suddenly the campaign manager account goes inactive and ethbits account takes that role over, with no further explanation.  Also the incorrect use of English in all Ethbits related activity seems out of place as well, considering the guy in the interview that was given on Youtube seemed to handle his English pretty well, but I later found out that he is not even part of the team, apparantly he went to school with the CEO of Ethbits and he agreed to step up for the interview, because the actual team was too busy.

This is due to the fact that with a lower percentage of the profits, there will also be a lower amount of tokens, increasing your relative share of the tokens.

I think its an excellent and fair business proposition to buy the coin. WE did have offers  from angel investors but we prefer to let the community gain which in turn will give us more awareness and volume.   Centralized Start Up businesses are always at risk for investors and the creators. For the most part it is investors. In your scheme i dont see the part where EthBits team are risking. You are getting 100% of money from people for developing your project. If you will fail investors will lose money. You won't lose a single dime. You will go away and that's it.

I was really thinking the same thing. When I stumbled across POSwallet too. However you have to keep in mind POSWallet is structured differently.  POS Has a supply of 41 million coins, with a total supply of 70 million, trading at $0.20 cents a coin.  Plus they only give you a measly 1% return unless you subscribe via:  $50/per month = 1.5% $100/per month = 3% etc VIP$ 500/ per month = 8%  So their revenue sharing is substantially less than Ethbits.  Where we are 500 ETH from hitting 10% revenue sharing.  On top of that, ETHbits is A 2 TIER platform, serving at localeth, and also a separate exchange coming out next year.  They already will have a product after ICO is over, so this fundraiser is for a chance to get premium pricing on their exchange.  If they only raise 10,000 ETH, the rest 3 million tokens will be burned, increasing the value of the bought tokens immensely.  The cost price of a this token is $0.50 cents.  the POSw token is 2.5x cheaper right now, but is diluted x70.  ETH bits is going to be worth a lot one day...  You are getting 9% more interest than POSw is offering off the bat.  If this auction ends at 15% interest return, I will be so happy.  A healthy investment in this coin could change your life.

TBH, i have contributed to this campaign, and believe in it, along with the other people that have invested $400,000 USD. If its a scam, I appreciate your efforts in hindsight, but the sheer fact is that i've already invested.  Fact, there are two possibilities moving forward since i'm already vested.  1) Its a scam. My money is lost 2) Its not a scam, and i stand to make money with these guys.  point one, if its a scam, my money is gone. You crying wolf isn't gonna bring it back. point two, its not a scam, but your fuckin FUD, which at this point it seems more and more like, is actually good for me!!!!!  Why? Because regardless of your FUD, i'm already invested. So you're FUD is only scaring other investors away, and in essence, my investment will give me a better return.  For this FUD I thank you.  I know you guys are full of FUD, because your ENTIRE FUD bullshit argument is built on the fact the Dev's are deleting your FUD posts.  Its logic, that if i was a campaign manager, and dumb shits like you were creating FUD, i would delete that shit too. Freedom of speech on a moderated forum is not free.  You trolls are essentially trolling. How much is poloniex paying you? You guys have FUDd'ED SOOOO MUCH, that they are finally leaving your FUD. You do realize that?  That you look like a FUCKIN IDIOT.  AND IF I COULD. I would down vote all your trust, because this project is legit.  JUST GET THE FUCK OUT.  You aren't offering anything constructive.  If you are GOING to FUD, STOP.  I'm already invested.  They aren't deleting your FUD anymore, cuz they realize ur a fukin parasite.  BUT THANK YOU.  For scaring people away.

So you are guarantee that EthBits exchange wont get hacked ever in any way? That cold storage can't be hacked ever? That could't happen? Poloniex using cold storage and even they were hacked several times. What are the names of developers that already made another exchanges and what are the name of their exchanges?  Sergeev Dmitry but like what was mentioned he is under NDA and I can not say that. Also we never claimed we are hack proof but we will make security a very serious priority and limit any potential hacks. That is a given wuth any exchange really. All exchanges are open to potential hacks.  2. So your answer for my question is you are using blockchain network because you need to money for developing centralized exchange and there is no near any other reason why would you need to use particulary a blockchain? So if you had money for developing you wouldn't use ethereum network?  We are using the Ethereum Network mainly to use the profit share smart contract. Also we have found a company in Gibraltar where we can pay dividends without KYC so this is a major step in the right direction.  3. I'm sure Liqui will get bigger after some time and i dont see the reason why would some new exchange should be huge with a lot of users. If you are planning to start instantly like Polo with their volumes than you are risking to be hacked because a lot of hackers eyeballs will be watching your exchange. I think there is no reason to be in a hurry to become big because you should get enough time to get trust and credibility. I need the exact calculations what profit will token holders get if for example you will be having Bittrex month profit.  We will grow slowly with closed and open Beta. We are fully aware of the potential risks and will avoid them at all costs.  What profit will i get if i will be buying EthBits tokens for the current price in sum of 10 BTC.  I can not tell you that it would not be legal. But we will be having press releases in each country we enter. Also we wil be taking site fees in ETB and a new idea we have had is to burn part of the fees we take which will keep the supply constantly reducing. So we will maintain the desirability of the token constantly increasing and also have a constantly decreasing supply. We have made the token that will be 10 decimal places that is how confident we are.  For example: I will be buying 20000 EBTS. It is 0.9% of all the 100% total EBTS cap. If Exchange will be getting profit for 50k USD every day the token holders will be getting 1000 EBTS profits every month to my wallet.  We will be paying dividends in Ehthereum and we do not know the profit share yet until we have finished the crowdsale. It will be between 8% and 40%. Lets say we sell out and you buy 100% of the tokens which is 4 mill. If we  make 5k ETH per day then we distribute 40 % this evenly between the 5 Mill token holders every quarter. But remember we will have a decreasing supply.  Also will the exchange profit calculations be transparent and you will be making every month a thorough spreadsheet for investors? Or we will be trusting on your WORD that you will be fair and will give any exchange balance information? How also we could be sure that you will be getting correct data without any changes? Am i understand this right that your profit payments to tokens holders will be made by EthBits devs so we should trust you that your team won't scum anyone?  We will be provably fair it is in out white paper. If you have a read we can answer any questions you have no problems.  In total this is your business model? You asking for 100% of money from people without any return for exchange development. No one can be sure if you even make this glorious exchange. No one is sure if it will any good. No one is sure if it will not be hacked. And if at the end all will get well and you will finally release your exchange after a year or more for every 1 profited dollar you will take 0.6 cents for yourself and the rest 0.4 for all the token holders? What kind of fairy world are you live in? Do you think this is reasonable business model for people buying your coin?   Polo make 1 Mill usd per day sometimes. If they used our structure it would not just be the core team who are rich. We are giving people a good opportunity. Start Up businesses are always a risk but we have an excellent team to make this happen. I think its an excellent and fair business proposition to buy the coin. WE did have offers  from angel investors but we prefer to let the community gain which in turn will give us more awareness and volume.,True

Good question seriously it is good.  Well for the hacking part we are using a team of developers who know the concept of cold storage very well and I have mentioned it before that they have made an exchange that has never had any security problems. We will not be using smart contracts because we are not yet so confident enough. If we use standard well proven protocols with cold storage then the only security breach will be inside jobs and nobody wants to go on the run or go to jail. There will be no one with access to the code who is not well vetted and who has a equity in the company. It will not happen.  2. Rather than get Angel investors (most of them already have a piece of the pie in other exchanges) we are doing a crowdsale so to give everybody an option to get good returns. We can not legally sit her and say yes you will get rich but we are extremely confident we can take on the top exchanges with volume quickly. Also we will be utilising our token to partly pay site fees and also part of the fees we take in our token will be burned. So we will have a constant volume with a reducing supply. We could not do that with pounds or bitcoin and if we could then it would be nice to hear how we could.  3. I kind of answered this before. I would say Liqui is successful but only a hand full of people are gaining considerable amounts of returns. we are aiming high like Polo. You can call that rubbish if you like but we have the right team in place to do so. Polo makes sometimes 1 Mill usd per day. imagine 40% of that shared out to the people who believed in us from the start or even people who bought our token at 50 times the value from now. I am not saying we will do any of this I am giving you a scenario. If we sell out and we make 1 mill per day then we will pay out 400k USD per day to token holders that will be better than what liqui offers by holding your bitcoin. So what would you prefer a handful of people making all the money or a community  who saw an opportunity and grabbed it to share the profits. We are doing all the hard work all you have to do is believe in what we are doing. So your argument I do not understand.,True

Why can't there be a legit exchange that has its own token and rewards shareholders directly, that can be traded on any exchange freely.  Why are the profits from centralized exchanges only shared with only a handful of people?  Anything runs the risk of being hacked. It's common sense exchanges that have been around longer, have been more ""tested"". Again, if you have a lot of money in an exchange (that's your own risk), best practice is to not use an exchange like primary storage.  I think what a lot of people fail to realize, that a community of users is being created. The people that buy into this right now, will likely also trade on the exchange... So even on launch, there will be a group and community using this exchange.  The largest and primary reason poloniex is successful, is it's aesthetically pleasing & intuitive front end.  I use other exchanges, but really, besides 2-4 exchanges, most of my trades happen on 2. Poloniex and Bittrex.  I have accounts in BTC-e & Liqui, but those don't really get used at all.  My point is, the more people that get in on this, the greater the community, the greater profits for everybody.

A few years ago I was a part of development team on p2p exchange project. I signed NDA so I can't share you any information about code, project and names.  About security question: There are 2 types of hacking: hacking the entire network (for example - find and use bugs in blockchain) and exchange platform bugs and erros. For the first type - It will be not only Ethbits users problems, it will be a global catastrophe for each crypto users and exchanches. For the second type - My team is developing 100% secure and successful high-load projects for customers.  About cold wallets and Poloniex ""hacks"" - It wasn't ""cold wallet hacks"" their problem was in database structure and withdrawal daemon. Cold wallet is 100% secure if you follow 2 rules: 1 - If you send out a transaction from a cold wallet, it's not a cold wallet; 2 - If you create a cold wallet on a infected (hacked) computer, it's not a cold wallet.

So you are saying you are guaranteeing that for the second type of security breach you can assure all that EthBits can't be hacked ever?

Questions are in quotes because i see that you are refusing to answer to them and simply deleting messages. The first three times my questions were without any quotes and accusations. But as i see you dont want to talk and banning me from Telegram, your subreddit, deleting messages from here. So what conversation are you talking about?  What so FUD about my messages? Can you alaborate on that? That i think you shouldn't trust people that cant answer to simple questions and instead of that deleting all?  Now after 30 times of deleting my messages from here, from Telegram and reddit you want to talk? Why not start doing it before it?  Spamming is posting the same message all over again where the same message is ALREADY located and not being deleted without any reason.  If you understand the concernes from inverstors why not just answer to the questions instead of doing something else?  The questions are:  1. We already have another well made exchanges goes through the fire, getting hacked (Polo) and getting stronger every time. And this would mean that if people will be trading on EthBits they will be risking money to lose. Because exchange will be fresh, without any fixes. And every new exchange is more exposed to hacks because developers dont have enough experience developering their own exchange. So there are will be exchange mistakes on which traders will be paying by losing money. What are the guarantees that EtherBits cold storage wont get hacked with traders money? How can you give any promises on that? Why doing another centralized exchange in the first place?  2. Why you need blockchain network to make a centralized exchange? Other than giving a very small percentage of dividents to token holders what is the another reason? I dont see one.  3. Why not starting exchange without crowdsale? Liqui.io is great example on that. They weren't started any crowdsale to get money from people. They did it by themselves.  The way i see EthBits is using excuse (Ethereum network) to get money for developing centralized exchange on which most of the profits will go only to you. I dont see the reason why else would you need this.  I wouldn't say a thing is this was a decentralized exchange project like bitsquare or openledger or https://etherdelta.github.io but its not. Its from another world.",True

Basically for every 1000 ETH we raise that is a 1% more profit share. So if we raise 10k ETH the site profit share will be a base rate of 10% but there will only be just over 1 Mill Ethbit tokens to share the profit amongst.  If we sell 4 Million tokens then we will distribute 40% of the site profit among 4 mill tokens. So the actual amount of dividends you receive should be the same regardless of 10% with 1 mill tokens or 40% with 4 Mill tokens. I hope I made that clear? If not then please say and I can try break it down some more for you in another way.         Quote from: DonApp on April 16, 2017, 08:30:33 PM I decided not to participate in this ICO, since the roadmap shows quite long times before developments will be finished. Moreover, limited ICO funds might slow down the process. I hope you will have a good ICO and will succeed with reaching enough funding!  Thank you for considering. We have set a minimum which will ensure our development will not be slowed down and remember we have Ethbits Local ready to launch next month that will start generating revenue. If we only sell 1 Mill tokens then that will potentially better better for the investors due to the reduced supply by burning unsold tokens. We will be sharing profits from the start and people need to buy them to pay site fees. That will be interesting indeed. All opinions are welcome though and actually appreciated because at this early stage we can easily tweek a few things if the opinions are good. For example we totally  restructured our ICO sale price and token issuance after listening to what the investors wanted. Good luck with your future investments and thanks for checking us out.",True

In the ANN it states '4 mill tokens will be sold during the Crowdsale and all unsold will be burned'. But later it says that '2 Million tokens will for 0.11-0.13 ETH during Token crowdsale' and '2 Mill tokens will be for sale upon launch of the site until sold for a fixed price of 1 ETH each' --> How many tokens will be for sale during ICO? 2 Million or 4 Million? Will there be a sale after ending of the ICO at a price of 1 ETH/ETB? I don't understand...  Furthermore; on the ICO website it says a price 0.1-0.13 ETH each, but here in ANN it says 0.11-0.13 ETH each? So what is the price during ICO, between 0.1-0.13 ETH/ETB or 0.11-0.13 ETH/ETB?    Any clarification on this possibly? Would like to know this before i can decide to participate in the ico or not.   Hi there sorry for the confusion. We did change to pricing structure based on the communities concerns. so the new price is:  Week 1 0.01 ETH per ETB 1st Week  Week 2 0.011 ETH per ETB 2nd Week Week 3 0.012 ETH per ETB 3nd Week  Week 4 0.013 ETH per ETB 4nd Week  If you find any information contrary to this anywhere please let us know.

Ethbits is a legally registered company with real people behind it that match with our core team. 2. ICOCOUNTDOWN does not list scams which is the reason why they are so popular (we are listed on there). 3. www.bravenewcoin.com and www.tokenmarket.net would have their reputations damaged if they were working with scammers. 4. The principle escrow is Fran from bravenewcoin so we can not just run away with money even if we intended too. 5. We have provided links to the team on www.linkedin.com in order to verify anything we have stated. 6. We welcome you to join us at https://www.coinfestuk.org/ so come and check us out in real life we can tell you and confirm everything face to face. 7. Our Lead Developer has an outstanding reputation on upwork and again would not jeopardise his company and reputation by working with scammers. 8. We publicly posted we are not part of ethbits.net before it was mentioned. They actually copied us before we went public so there must be a compliment there (the design for Ethbits logo competition was carried on bitcointalk which is where this 'leak' must have come from).    The team has discussed this and have decided to take action to stop the ridiculous claims by some of the users. How can they type of graphics used to determine the legitimacy of a project?  All the posts are deleted by admin when we report them but we have to wait for the admin on bitcointalk to respond and in that time we have legitimate potential investors visiting our thread and they do not need to trawl through all of this FUD just to get some information. We will have a moderated thread and we will not delete legitimate questions actually we welcome them! The person in the video, Matt, is helping out and is potentially going to be hosting the UK site for Ethbits Local. However he has a Job that is not crypto related therefore would like initially to keep low key. He may be at coinfest though with a few others so come and see for yourself. The CEO Monty will also be present so please if you can come and see us!",True

Its hard to understand why that would happen. Anyway we continue to make the 1st crypto copy trading platform. We will update the thread with this later today/ tomorrow:   WHAT IS ETHBIT TOKEN?   The ETHBIT token is a type of currency used to pay fees on the ETHBITS Local platform (for example to buy/sell Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies).  ETHBIT tokens can also be used to distribute dividends to investors.  If you hold ETHBITS tokens, you hold a portion of our platform, and by holding a portion of our platform you are entitled to your share of a distribution of 40% of the platform’s profit.  The dividends will be paid on a quarterly basis . A total of 4 mill tokens will be sold and a maximum of 5 mill tokens will ever be in existence. The final number of Ethbits created will be determined by how many tokens are sold in the Token Crowdsale:  •   4 Mill tokens will be sold during the Crowdsale and all unsold will be burned . •   10% of tokens sold will be used to drive the platform Ethbits iTrade •   4% of the tokens will go to the core team and the remaining 6% will be used for Marketing and PR .  It’s easy to get started using an Ethereum smart contract and Ether.  Receive ETHBIT tokens from our four tiers rolling out over a four-week period starting at 0.01 ETH https://ico.ethbits.com.:   Amount raised VS Profit Share If less than 1 million usd if raised then the proportion raised will determine the % profit share. So the amount raised from 0 – 1 Mill usd will determine the % profit share from 0 – 40%. Everything over 1 Mill means the standard 40%.",True
