But the difference from them, our system is designed in such a way that users do not need to change the behavior of the network, using their usual search engines or applications.  Our system works with any browser, with any search engine, any application or game. Every owner of his website or application can connect to us for free.   to: happyme1818  Have you ever met similar projects? Can you share the name?   For advertising exchanges, an API has been created that will allow them to sell all unsold traffic for free and from the usual banners to make the most targeted CPA advertising.  Each publisher (owner of their own site or application or game) receives payment not for 1000 impressions or clicks, but for the user who is interested in the product.  Users can subscribe to favorite brands and view only the ads they themselves have chosen.  In our system, targeting is designed, analogues in the world which does not exist, advertisers search through smart contracts based on data within user questionnaires, each user decides what information he is willing to open for searching on his personal data and receives a reward in the form of coins for providing personal data for exact targeting.  We do not sell user data, smart contracts search within user profiles, leaving users anonymous on the network. The system shows only anonymous statistics on the fulfillment of the terms of the smart contracts. Each user can see a condition that has become decisive for his choice.  Our system has unique capabilities, such as: - evaluation of the quality of goods (interview among subscribers) - Testing games (you do not need to keep staff, you can attract a few thousand testers overnight in the world) - paid filters (any brand can create a unique targeting, add any new parameter which is not present in the questionnaires)  Users receive coins directly from advertisers for doing marketing quests and viewing ads. The advertiser himself determines what price he pays users for each viewing.  There are no intermediaries in the system, each participant of the system receives money directly, our system also does not take money for advertising campaigns, we take the commission only from operations on the wallet, to input and output of money.  Inside our wallet, it is possible to enter and withdraw money through a bank account, credit card, exchange through other payment systems or in the form of another crypto currency.",False

Every owner of his website or application can connect to us for free.  For advertising exchanges, an API has been created that will allow them to sell all unsold traffic for free and from the usual banners to make the most targeted CPA advertising.  Each publisher (owner of their own site or application or game) receives payment not for 1000 impressions or clicks, but for the user who is interested in the product.  Users can subscribe to favorite brands and view only the ads they themselves have chosen.  In our system, targeting is designed, analogues in the world which does not exist, advertisers search through smart contracts based on data within user questionnaires, each user decides what information he is ready to open for search on his personal data and receives a reward in the form of coins for providing personal data for exact targeting.  We do not sell user data, smart contracts search within user profiles, leaving users anonymous on the network. The system shows only anonymous statistics on the fulfillment of the terms of the smart contracts. Each user can see a condition that has become decisive for his choice.  Our system has unique capabilities, such as: product quality evaluation (survey among subscribers), game testing (you do not need to keep staff, you can attract thousands of testers overnight in the world), paid filters (any brand can create unique targeting, add any new parameter of which is not present in the questionnaires)  Users receive coins directly from advertisers for doing marketing quests and viewing ads. The advertiser himself determines what price he pays users for each viewing.  There are no intermediaries in the system, each participant of the system receives money directly, our system also does not take money for advertising campaigns, we take the commission only from operations on the wallet, to input and output of money.  Inside our wallet, there is an opportunity to enter and withdraw money through a bank account, credit card, exchange through other payment systems or in the form of another crypto currency.
