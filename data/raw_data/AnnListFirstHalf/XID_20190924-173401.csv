Dear Supporters,  We are on the road to building our first product and team.  We have made good progress getting a strong team in place to build AIR’s Minimum Viable Product (MVP): AIR1. It is great that we have attracted more blockchain and distributed storage talent to the project. New team members will be joining the project over the next two months. We have also formed two tech partnerships to secure delivery of AIR1.  The AIR1 is scheduled to be released for private Beta at the end of March. AIR1 will enable individuals to secure their identity and sign-up for online services and products without filling in forms. We will provide businesses with a new way of onboarding customers for KYC compliance, which will deliver more customer.  It is important that AIR1 complies with the GDPR - the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, PSD2 - the Revised Payment Services Directive, as well as a series of security standards. We are currently doing a final review of those standards to ensure that our solution has high inter-operability and security. In October we also sponsored the Smart Cities Hackathon in Melbourne, Australia. This helped raise the profile of digital identities for smart cities. It was also good to connect with a great group of blockchain developers.  Currently we are sharpening our brand, so that it is well suited to our target consumer and business markets. More on that next month.  Thank you for taking the time to read our monthly newsletter! If you have any questions, please email us at community@sphre.co.

It has been an eventful few months since the closing of our crowdsale. We would like to formally thank all of you who contributed during the period. We raised nearly 7 million Dollars (USD)! This newsletter will serve to inform all AIR Crowdsale participants and current XID token holders of our current progress as well as our future plans. The newsletters will be released on a regular monthly basis via email.    TEAM/ORGANIZATIONAL UPDATES  Since the crowdsale, we have been busy relocating our team from around the world to our new offices located in New Zealand. This has been a time-consuming process and has caused a slight delay in the progress of our work. We will have all our team members relocated by mid-September 2017. Instead of having fragmented communication across different time zones, bringing the team together in a central location will make the decision making and development process a lot faster.  We have also acquired new talent with a lot of experience in the blockchain identity space to complement our pre-existing team. This includes the hiring of a new Chief Executive Officer (CEO), who is expected to join us during September; the CEO will be formally introduced to you in our next newsletter.  We have also commenced our search for additional senior development team members as we look forward to  further enhancing AIR product development. This will also be subject to further announcements as we move forward as well.    PROJECT DEVELOPMENT UPDATES  The initial fabric has been laid out, including the algorithm and basic features for the wallet. However, we are currently exploring expansions to the core technology stack for the underlying platform for which our products will be built on. This will allow us to have even greater flexibility for application integrations. Our partners will be able to build modular applications on top of our fabric, in addition to the AIR, EON, and CTRL applications that will be built. We have had two meetings in London so far with our development partners and will be having more meetings in September to discuss and finalize our approach.  We are also progressing in discussions with the potential partnering of a firm which possesses some great technology that will complement what we are doing here very nicely from a technical perspective. When the core stack has been completed, we will be moving on to our next phase of piloting the product with our business partners.  In order to protect our competitive advantage, announcements will be released later on in the year with respect to the names of our partners and our pilot projects. We are currently exploring a new innovative way to apply our identity application to other technologies. This will open up an entirely new stream of revenue for our company with applications that have a global market outreach. We want to safeguard this opportunity we have discovered until we are far enough along that competition would not be a threat. Our roadmap will be reassessed to include these additional requirements, and extended for the design and implementation plan. Full details will be made available to our stakeholders in a future announcement.  Finally, we have enlisted the services of a digital marketing agency that will be redesigning our website for us. The website will have a sharp appearance and will include all the information previously available on our old site. The site will be fully redesigned from frontend to backend; will include visual designs for partner logos and descriptions; and a dedicated news/media page that staff will be able to upload to directly. Further updates will come when we are closer to launching the site later next month.   OTHER COMMUNITY CONCERNS  1.      Exchanges: We have decided to delay exchange talks and focus on the development for the first few months. We are running a company, not a pump and dump campaign. If that’s what you were looking for, then you have come to the wrong project. We are playing the long-term, not the short-term game. A business is not built in a few months. A full-scale marketing strategy is planned out with proper content scheduling, and that will be released when the time is right. We are aware of the low-volume so in order to address that concern, we are reviewing processes to assist the liquidity on the exchanges, and further updates in this regard will be communicated in due course. Please contact one of the team members at community@sphre.co if you wish to have your XID purchased.  2.      Slack: We have been having problems with ghost accounts in our slack channels that we are not able to ban. We have also had more problems with the Slackbot being hacked. In order to solve this problem we are looking into moving our Slack communications to another service (potentially Discord). We will make a formal update across all our channels when the switch is being made.  3.      Updates: Obviously it’s been a little quiet across the channels, We hope that you can understand the operational growing pains of a new business; everything will come together nicely over the next few months at which point we will be kicking into another gear and updating more often and synchronously across all communication channels. For now, the best way to keep in contact with the team is through the Slack channel and the community email mentioned above.  4.      Distribution: There are still tokens that need to be distributed. Unfortunately there was an issue with users submitting their token addresses which created a delay. We also had technical difficulties with the August 5th distribution and that has created some further delay. I would like to issue a formal apology to those users who are still waiting. The communication has been slow because we are spread across multiple time zones; but the communication is a necessary step, of course, and will improve as we work on getting into our new office space. Your tokens will be sent out as soon as possible. The market cap will also be calculated after the final burn is completed.",False

We will be confirming that all the transactions have been processed correctly 2.    The ETH address field will be added to the Token Investor portal–An email will be sent out with instructions to the email you have provided on the Token Investor site 3.    Tokens will then be distributed within the next 21 days and the build will commence following our roadmap benchmarks The crowdsale was a great success and only one in a series of many more to come.

We have some news to announce today, due to transaction costs we will not be issuing the tokens on Omni, we feel it is best for our users and for the project to issue an ERC20 token. This will decrease transaction costs, while increasing functionality and optimal interoperability by taking advantage of the ERC20 protocols. As well, we know that exchanges are experienced in listing ERC20 tokens, and given their recent successes, we expect this will help us reach more exchanges a lot quicker than had we used Omni. We also feel this aligns us more competitively with the future of cryptocurrency and decentralized applications. What does this mean for our investors and bounty campaign participants? Nothing changes, tokens will be available as planned at the end of the crowdsale, except now you will receive an ERC20 token. And our roadmap remains the same (including our Litecoin implementation), this will not delay any of our project goals. The issuance of these tokens is a very simple process. We will just need to collect ETH addresses instead of Omni. Thank you for your support and we are excited for the future of Air!

We are doing our best to allocate the funds in a fair and transparent way .

Here are answers to questions proposed by Coin Interview:  Whitepaper Source: http://www.sphre.co/cs/downloads/Air_Platform_Whitepaper.pdf  ""At its core, an Air-based digital identity facilitates the ability to digitally sign and verify an action or transaction, thereby enabling a variety of potential use cases"" -pg 13  1.Can you give some examples of potential use cases?  For sure, some examples are initially as follows:  I am an end-consumer, using a cell/mobile phone or PC, and I want to buy an item from a popular online retailer.  I select the item from the retailer’s website; I confirm that I want to “pay” for the item; the Air platform is engaged in the background; my identity is checked and confirmed, and the transfer of funds is made directly from my bank.  My order is then successfully concluded in the usual manner (logistics etc.) without the need for a password (or other form of authorisation).  I am a consumer of government services, and want to confirm my identity to receive a new passport. Now, the process for passport replacement is unnecessarily extended due to the need for the given individual to supply supporting evidence of identity (which then needs to be manually verified). However, with the product in place, the individual will be able to authenticate directly with the relevant government departments (or indeed multiple government departments), and I can receive my new passport faster. Several discussions in this regard have been held with representatives of New Zealand’s RealMe program, for possible technology refresh requirements.  I am a consumer of medical services, and want to share my patient record with a third-party insurer, I can authorise this engagement via direct identity authorisation in a single transactional step, with the records shared simply and efficiently. My patient records may either be maintained via my usage of the Sphre EON product (that builds on top of the Air Platform), or can be maintained via existing medical systems, where Air API interconnectivity is implemented.  For the end-consumer application, for each transaction using Air I will receive a micropayment, and a targeted advertisement based on my selected content of interest. In this way, I build token value that can be exchanged and/or used for onward purchase of goods and services. It is our plan to work with content providers of all types, whether large agencies or small publishers, and our approaches towards these agencies is currently ongoing.  2. How will the network application interface with the omni layer? Can anyone from the Omni layer comment on this thread and explain how their technology will interface with SPHRE?  From Adam (adam@omni.foundation):  The Air Platform will leverage Remote Procedure Call (RPC) functionality to a local running version of Omni-core and create a 'Fulfilment' address (much the same way as we create a new address in bitcoin-core). We will then fund that address with XID.  Upon a qualifying event (an identity authentication for instance), we will then send an RPC call to Omni-core to send amount Y of XID to the users address Z (XID wallet).  ""To support the operation and user adoption of the Air Platform, a mobile/cellphone application (initially for Apple iOS/Google Android, with other platforms to follow on an incremental basis) will be created for individual use. The application will secure and maintain an individual’s digital identity, and is expected to be as ‘lightweight’ and as implicit to use for the individual as possible during operation"" pg.17  3. Do you have a prototype or proof of concept?   Yes, we currently have a proof of concept for the core system, and some additional ‘stubs’ for other components in readiness for final project development once the Crowdsale is completed. These components will be made available via open source licensing/bug bounty commencement as-of phase 2 of the Air Platform project.  4. If one's phone is lost or stolen, how does one recover their identity? Are you controlling private keys on the phone? Are you going to provide an additional service to secure customer's private keys in the event of theft or loss of that key?  The newly registered user will receive an additional identifier, which will be similar in structure to a UUID, but will be unique to the Air Platform in structure. This UUID provided has no special cryptographic properties, and can therefore be shared amongst user designated parties (to a total of 4 parties), and cell/mobile numbers for these parties will be gathered during the registration process. Upon loss, the designated parties will be contacted via cell/mobile SMS and asked for a component of the affected users UUID (they will not be asked to supply the entire code), upon completion the user's cell/mobile Air app will be revoked. A new set of keys can then be issued for the user to use on a new device, once available.  4. Will there be an investor deck to explain these points?  We are releasing more content over the next few weeks overviewing the sale.  Consumer Level:  What applications will run on the Air Platform?  Our aim is to encourage the use of the protocol by as many organisations as possible, to develop applications that put the consumer first, and where a consumer can receive fair value for their attention, that they can then take forward to engagement within the digital economy.  What is the target audience?  Our initial consumer audience will be the millennial generation, for the following reasons: They are ‘digital natives’. They have the concept of the ‘personal brand’. They are more willing than others to engage in the ‘digital economy’. For Enterprise, of course our product is aimed at companies and corporations that are interested in streamlining their existing internal processes and customer relations.  Our audience is anyone from 8-80, as our aim is to deliver almost an implicit use product, in fact we are working from the target use group backwards to deliver as simple and as useful user interface/experience as possible.  Can a 16-year-old use it or is this development heavy?  Yes, although our initial target consumer audience is the millennial generation, I think any 16-year-old person will be able to operate the Air consumer app.  What is your target for this raise? 1-2 million USD or more?  We would like to raise about $3 million USD, however this is dependent on a number of factors, such as BTC pricing at the time of the Crowdsale etc.  Can we have more details on your team?  We currently have one core developer in India, that worked on the initial core system development. Post the completion of the Crowdsale we will engage with Blockchain Labs New Zealand (http://blockchainlabs.nz/) to build out the team for final Air Platform and consumer application delivery. Post completion of the project (and as finances allow, we will build our own internal team to continue with the development of the Air Platform.  In specific terms, what is the function of your token on your network?  The XID token will act as fuel for all identity based transactions for all functions within the Air applications domain (authorization/authentication etc.).  The XID token will be used to power our micropayment system (based on Omnilayer), that will enable us to revenue share directly with users. It is very important to us that we share value with our users, and our token is a great way to achieve this for us to reach our goal of delivering a fairer internet.  Community:  Why are you using Omni and Hyperledger instead of Ethereum?  Hyperledger The first connector Sphre's products (like AIR) will work with. There is no reason connectors to Ethereum and other blockchains cannot be built in the future, if we find the demand for such connectors.  Omni-Layer They have the best track record - there is over $200m worth of omni-layer assets now. MaidSafe, Tether, Synereo, etc- Omni Layer is embracing Lightning network and micro payment solutions so we feel they are much more future proof for what we need our asset to do, than say an Ethereum based token. Also Bitcoin is used as a currency more than Ether is. With Omni - the Air platform can have a wallet where XID's address is the same address as their bitcoin wallet. This paves way to a lot of function opportunities.  .How are you running smart contracts without Ethereum? (If you’re running them on Hyperledger can you explain in simple terms how this will work and what resources one would need to get started with the technology)  For users, the use of blockchain and smart contract technology will be implicit, there will be no requirement to understand the internal workings of the Air Platform to interact with the system, everything will be managed via the mobile/cell phone based Air app.  Are the GitHub repos open? Is this an open source project?  This is not an open source project right now. We are keeping our IP under wraps until phase 2. There's a natural tendency in the blockchain space to open-source everything. This takes strategic consideration - look at Hyperledger for example. It took time to open-source it. We will share when the time is right.  How can one get involved with the bug bounties?  The bug bounty program will be separately announced right here on bitcointalk to the timeline in the detailed plan, and we are looking forward to having direct engagement with the development community during this key period for the project.   If there are big bounties for promotion can you please provide the community with a press kit that will ideally contain the investor deck, logos and documentation about the project?  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6fH54MqD6yqb3BHdlFPOXpPajg/view?usp=sharing  When will the token be available on exchanges? Are there any exchanges underwriting your token sale?  We are in discussions with various crypto exchanges to discuss partnership opportunities with our platform.  Future Plans:  What will you do after you raise the money?  Our full focus will be on project completion, and bringing to market of Air, with the continued ongoing strong engagement of the community. The Air Platform technical implementation work will be completed in cooperation with BLNZ, and some travel will be required to facilitate discussions and final planning. There will be no requirement for an office in the initial stage.  Do you have developers lined up?  Yes, as above, we will work in cooperation with Blockchain Labs New Zealand (BLNZ), and discussions are already ongoing in terms of technical deliverables and team engagement.  What is your go to market strategy?  Our plan is for a sustained and engaging campaign beginning immediately at the end of the Crowdsale until project launch across all marketing channels. We will also commence engagements with potential initial customers of the Air Platform, and this will include content delivery agencies in such industries as Advertising and Publishing, and enterprises for the possible use of the enterprise layer of the Air Platform.  Will there be room for the community to get involved after the Crowdsale?  Yes, we very much want and respect the engagement of the community during the Air project, and beyond. It would be great to hear from the community for instance as-to how the full potential of Air can be obtained and potential further use cases. It is our plan is to open a further channel to receive ideas and bug bounty reports as we go forward, and this will be announced here on bitcointalk.  When do you estimate there will be a MVP?  Our plan is to release major version 1.0 of Air, for both core (blockchain and services) and consumer (cell/mobile) app by end of September 2017.  Are there plans for institutional investment later down the road?   Like any company, we would like to grow for us to continue our mission objectives, a primary one of which is the building of a fairer internet via value sharing, and this may include institutional investment in the future.  How will the company turn a profit? What is the role of the company if the project is open source?  Our aim is to sell short content space to content delivery companies, that we can then forward to relevant users based on their stated interests (in-line with attention economic principles), and then share this revenue directly with our users via XID token payments. We are currently working on estimated revenue for this functionality, and this will be published here in bitcointalk once finalised.  In the future, we will continue to build further products on-top of the Air Platform with two products scoped and designed called EON (in collaboration with D-Wave Systems), and CTRL). In this way, we will continue to grow our portfolio of products towards the market, and continue to return value to our users based on the principles established by the Air protocol.  ---------  Please share your thoughts about these answers!

There are many challenges in this race; the majority are due to the divided nature of the various solutions so far implemented by a great number organizations.  This has resulted in a poor user experience via the need to maintain multiple service registrations, logins, usernames and passwords, due to largely different and confusing security policies.  The centralized nature of identity providers such as Facebook are of great value to bad actors based on constantly updating threats, and therefore centralized solutions will become increasingly unsound as we continue to evolve with, and live more of our lives via the Internet. Cryptography and decentralized technologies such as blockchain offer a potential solution for these challenges.  These technologies revert the ownership of a digital identity from centralized Internet services such as Facebook to the individual, so that the individual is in control.  This approach decentralizes data and computing capacity, thereby greatly decreasing potential security exploits, and further preventing future potential threats due to the increased technical complexity needed to exploit.  THE AIR OPPORTUNITY Air is a platform for digital identity for both the Enterprise (Platform/Application Programming Interface (API)) and individuals (cell/mobile phone application). The Air digital identity system uses blockchain technologies via the implementation of a per user specific Smart Contract to complete cryptographically secured digital identity management actions, for authentication, authorization and transaction completion verification. Air is based on open-source technologies, and is defined from the start as an ‘open standards’ based system, to ensure the greatest interoperability in the future. Air also implements a novel approach for user adoption whereby an individual will receive an XID digital token micropayment to an Air digital wallet once a successful identity transaction has taken place. Once completed, targeted content based on the user’s stated interests will then be sent to the user’s cell/mobile application, as per the following overview:   THE AIR PLATFORM POTENTIAL MARKET The digital identity market is estimated to grow from EUR 8.43 Billion (USD 8.09 Billion) in 2016 to EUR 14.13 Billion (USD 14.82 Billion) by 2021, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 12.9% between 2016 and 2021. Major growth drivers of the market are rise in awareness about compliance management across various industries, increase in security concerns among organizations and individuals, and demand for mobility solutions (see our Whitepaper for citation).   THE AIR PLATFORM USE CASE EXAMPLES There are many potential use cases for Air, as It is expected that Air-based digital identities will take a variety of forms, such as individual, enterprises, organizations or devices.  However please consider the following initial use case examples:  USE CASE 1 I am an end-consumer, using a cell/mobile phone, tablet or Personal Computer (PC), and I want to buy an item from a popular online retailer.  I select the item from the retailer’s website; I confirm that I want to “pay” for the item; the Air platform is engaged in the background; my identity is checked and confirmed, and the transfer of funds is made directly from my bank.  My order is then successfully concluded in the usual manner (logistics etc.) without the need for a password (or other form of authorization).   USE CASE 2 I am a consumer of medical services, and want to share my patient record with a third-party insurer, I can authorize this engagement via direct identity authorization in a single transactional step, with the records shared simply and efficiently.   USE CASE 3 For the end-consumer application, for each transaction that I will complete successfully leveraging the Air product for Identity Management, I will receive a micropayment, and a targeted advertisement based on my selected content of interest, as previously stated.   THE AIR PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE Air is a highly secure platform for digital identity, based on the Hyperledger blockchain. The baseline technology of Air is composed of three major components: Chaincode (also known as a Smart Contract), Application Programming Interface (API) and a mobile/cellphone application (initially for Apple iOS/Google Android, with other platforms to follow) for individual use. The following diagram shows the technology components of the Air system:  The API will allow organizations and enterprises to integrate support for Air into their existing and new systems.  The cell/mobile application can secure and maintain an individual’s Air identity. The individual can also store their identity within a Digital Vault of their choice, such as their bank. The Hyperledger Chaincode forms the basis of the given identity and contains program logic that will allow an individual to recover their identity if their mobile device is lost.   AIR PLATFORM KEY FEATURES AND BENEFITS Air features all required functions to secure a given individual’s digital identity, and greatly simplifies the usage of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for the user. Air removes the given user’s identity data from the identity transaction itself, thereby providing increased individual security, identity fraud protection and privacy. Air also features a cell/mobile phone digital wallet, that will enable the individual to receive an XID token micropayment for all actions undertaken using the system, thereby allowing the user to build XID token spending power with relevant service providers over time. The benefits of the Air system are clear, however at a high level the following key system attributes are:  USER CONTROL Air enables the individual to be 100% in control of their digital identity via full user controllability of the individual's registered identity and associated attributes for data sharing needs.  SECURITY Air provides a highly secure Blockchain based environment for digital identity and micropayment based transactions.  INTEROPERABILITY Air provides system interoperability with both blockchain and non-blockchain based systems via Smart Contract based access control.  PORTABILITY Air provides integration with on and off blockchain based systems, a truly global scale solution for Identity Management.   THE AIR PLATFORM PROJECT ROADMAP From the Air project 2017 major milestone perspective, the development of Air Platform is scheduled as follows. However, it is expected that where possible, major milestone completion can be brought forward in time, based on full development team and required infrastructure scale-out, to be based on Crowdsale funds available.  THE AIR PLATFORM XID TOKEN The Air XID token is a key component of the Air Platform. The token is a reward for users of the platform upon completion of a successful identity based transaction. Post completion, targeted content based on the user’s stated interests will then be sent to the user’s cell/mobile application.   The XID token can then be used by via the Air XID Digital Wallet to facilitate exchange to fiat currency, and potentially direct purchase of goods and services from supporting vendors.  AIR PLATFORM XID TOKEN PRICING AND PROJECT FUND ALLOCATION There will be 50 million XID tokens to be distributed to Crowdsale participants.    In addition:  A total of 2.5% of total Crowdsale, to a maximum of 1.25 million XID will be created for founder’s reward (to be held within a formal ESCROW agreement for 12 months). A total of 6.5% of the maximum Crowdsale, to a maximum of 3.25 million XID will be created for large bug and significant development bounties which will be published during the Air Platform project cycle. A fixed amount equivalent to 1% (400,000 XID) of the total Crowdsale, will be created for community bounties during the Crowdsale period. Combined, the total possible supply of XID is 55 million. All XID tokens will be distributed to participants post the conclusion of the Crowdsale timeline and will be based on the number of XID tokens sold during the Crowdsale period. There will be no further XID tokens made available for later purchase. Prior to reaching a steady state where Air Platform resources can be supported through advertising revenue (for the end-consumer application) and enterprise engagement.   The XID token sale will be utilized to acquire the necessary funds to complete the Air Platform project.  These funds will be allocated towards the project in the following manner:   THE AIR PLATFORM DECENTRALIZATION OVERVIEW As stated, it is expected that Air-based digital identities will take a variety of forms, such as individual, enterprises, organisations or devices.  These identities will be fully owned and controlled by the creator, and will not rely on any centralised third party for validation.  A further advantage of an Air-based digital identity is that due to its blockchain-based implementation, that digital bearer’s assets -- such as cryptocurrencies or other tokenized assets -- are also intrinsically supported. Air is built on principles of cryptography, consensus theory, transparency, accountability (and in the case of the end consumer, sound economics) to serve as a new foundation for our future identity systems, and a fairer Internet.
