ICO, Bounty Campaign","Anyone who has been following the cryptocurrency market should already be aware of the recent malicious attacks against popular wallets – several of which were successful, and resulted in drastic losses to their users.    At CORION, we understand the seriousness of these threats, and decided to invite several highly-trusted security experts to review the CORION system. We wanted to make sure our code is not only bullet-proof, but also hacker-proof.  The surprising result? We have located a vulnerability unknown so far which creates a backdoor to the affected wallets, allowing hackers to circumvent the security of these systems, and gain access.    What is even more shocking is that one doesn't even need to be a hacker to exploit this vulnerability, and gain access to your wallet.  Turns out, due to the lack of industry standards for the creation and set-up of a fortified wallet, most are not nearly as secure as they claim to be. Our investigation suggests that this newly-exposed security hazard actually affects the majority of wallets currently available to users.  http://blog.corion.io/media/corion-ico-announcement/",False

ICO, Bounty Campaign","    The Reasons why Corion Token/Coins will be one of the Most Popular Cryptocurrency in the world for many years to come...  (1) Corion Tokens/Coins is hosted on the Ethereum Classic Blockchain. One of the very first Cryptocurrency on it.  (2) ICO BONUSES  (3) Corion Platform Smart Contract Base, Built-in Decentralised P2P exchange provides a SAFE, FAST, and SECURE entry point. Can't be HACKED like DAO.  (4) Corion don't Fluctuate like other Smart Contract CryptoTokens or CryptoCurrencies Thus, It value is maintained E.g. each Corion coin value $1 today will maintain  $1 in 2018 ..so on This will help Market Traders, Ecommerce Merchants maintain value for their capital accepting Corions as means of payment. YOU MAY ASK THEN HOW I CAN MAKE PROFIT ON CORION?  (5) CORION ACTIVITIES REWARD DAILY COIN EMISSION.. They are 2 Service Provider on the Corion Platform .. PUBLIC SERVICE PROVIDER PRIVATE PUBLIC PROVIDER  The Amount of Wallet Connected to a Public Service Provider is UNLIMITED for the daily coin emission  While  The Amount of Wallet Connected to a Private Service Provider is just 250 for the daily coin emission  The Public Service Provider will require a purchase of 3,000corions ($3,000) to be ACTIVE  The Private Service Provider will require a purchase of 8,000corions ($8,000) to be ACTIVE  All Corion Wallets are either CONNECTED to A PUBLIC SERVICE PROVIDER  or A PRIVATE SERVICE PROVIDER for 0-2.5% daily coin emission reward..  The Public Service Provider sets his daily coin emission reward from 30% minimum and 70% maximum. While The Private Service Provider sets his daily coin emission reward to 0% minimum or 100% Maximum.  The daily coin emission reward can be aquired daily to each corion wallet holder base on the numbers of Corion coins in their wallet and already set daily emission reward of the Service Provider their are connected to ..  E.g...  A PUBLIC SERVICE PROVIDER who has set his emission reward to 50%-50% (50% for him, 50% for his connected wallet holders) is connected to 200 Corion Wallet Account Holders with each of them having 500corion coins each .. The Emission Reward for the day is 2.5%  Both Provider and Wallet Holder will get 6.25corions ($6.25) each .. Meaning the Wallet holder will have 500 + 6.25 =506.25corions ($506.25). The next day emission reward will base on 506.25corions  The PROVIDER gets 6.25corions ($6.25) each on each of the 200 Corion Wallet Connected to his Network as coin emission reward for the day. 6.25 X 200 = 1,250corions ($1,250) to be added to his own account for that trading day alone  By Assumption: 1,250 X 30days = 37,500corions ($37,500)monthly This could be more base on Power of Compounding and also as his Network grows from 200 connected wallet to more..",False

ICO, Bounty Campaign","   Hmmm. This is not a charity. We are not giving away free money.  Service providers are businessmen who already have or would like to start a business and have enough money to do so. If you have your own business already then you can extend your business to the crypto world, where you can find more customers and/or a funding source for your business.  If you are starting your own business then you can have this second layer where you can find funding for the start of your business or extra source of money.  So how you can find your users, customers?  In an indirect way, you just put your business on our platform (by reserving 3000 or 8000 Corions, which is redeemable after you stop being a service provider). It means you will be in our Marketplace and if users find your business offer and/or giveback percentage attractive then they will connect to you.  I a direct way, you can promote your own business among your regular customers, maybe offer discount if they pay with Corion, or just ask them to support you. Or you can come up with some alternative, like you start a contest, if the monthly income from Corion will be higher than (that number) then you will give 20% discount for all Corion buyers.",False
