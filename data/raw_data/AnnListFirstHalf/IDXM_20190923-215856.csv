DVIP has been permanently locked down forever, consider it a badge of honor in your wallet showing that you participated in the sale   When launching the new IDXM and AURA contracts we launched them on ethereum with the balances already set, this means that instead of minting to one wallet and sending them out we actually minted them specifically with the balances of the wallets that were holding DVIP. This resulted in quite the gas cost savings as there were many less transactions than sending them out one by one. Because we did it that way they will not show up on etherscan/ethplorer until you make a transfer. I contacted them to see if they could get them to show up and their response indicated that they didn't have the manpower to do that. Included in the blogpost from your quote (click the link that I saved in your quote) are instructions to get them to show up in your wallet on MEW, MetaMask, etc. Any wallet that allows you to input custom tokens will work fine, once you have done that you will see them show up.

Aurora 🔥 Decentralized Finance and Banking + Exchange 🔵,"   Yup! We're creating a price-stable cryptocurrency called the boreal. Boreals are backed up by debt from loans, ether reserves and acceptance at retailers (starting with IDEX) at the target value regardless of the market rate. The various tools backing boreals will ensure it stays price-stable at the target value. Users will be able to come to the bank and get loans in boreals with interest rates based on their blockchain based credit score. Our goal is to bring decentralized banking to all corners of the world.  Quote from: ro777jer on January 03, 2018, 10:09:37 AM Hi everyone. Does anybody know what commissions will IDEX charge from the users?  0.1% fee for makers and 0.2% fee to takers. Takers also pay the gas fees.  Quote from: slavonicpl on January 03, 2018, 10:10:53 AM As far as I understand, IDEX will be based on Ethereum technological solutions. In what way will it be unique?  Check out the diagram in our ANN thread. Unlike other ethereum based decentralized exchanges IDEX is a hybrid model that combines the best of both worlds in the form of real time trading (like Binance or Bitfinex) with blockchain custody and settlement of funds (like etherdelta). This means it is as safe as etherdelta with the speed and UX of Binance.",False

Aurora 🔥 Decentralized Finance and Banking + Exchange 🔵,"   Right now we can handle upwards for 50 trades per second, that is over 5 times what ethereum can do. Once we put work into scaling that number we can get into the millions of trades per second. This requires ethereum to scale as well to match our capabilities.  Quote from: newboi on January 03, 2018, 10:42:15 AM I’ve come across the info that users won’t spend any means on gas when working with IDEX. How is it possible? What’s the secret?  Trades still require gas fees but we have made gas free cancels. Unlike etherdelta or 0x exchanges which cost about a dollar to cancel your trade our design makes cancels free. This makes running bots much more cost prohibitive on IDEX than our competitors.  Quote from: coinmenace on January 03, 2018, 03:59:53 PM why do you need 2 tokens?  Membership token (DVIP) is a crypto membership that comes with free trading on IDEX until 2021 and double AURA rewards (from the rewards program) for life after the free trades runs out. AURA is our utility token that will be used for POS staking our sidechain once IDEX moves from ethereum mainnet to an ethereum sidechain for scaling. AURA token holders will stake our chain and get paid in IDEX trade fees for providing the security to the network. As Aurora expands into decentralized banking the revenue from that venture will also flow back to AURA stakers for running the network.  Each DVIP also comes with 50,000 AURA tokens. So for $3,000 you get free trades on IDEX for 3 years, double AURA rewards for life after that and 50,000 AURA tokens. DVIP works now and AURA will be used for staking as soon as we have our sidechain live. Getting the sidechain live is our main focus after we do a few more minor things to stable out IDEX.",False

If the supply of the currency far outstrips the demand then the price will fall, on the other side if the demand is much greater than the supply then the price will go up too much. While boreals are backed by a basket of decentralized assets it is also crucial that we make sure the supply corresponds with the current demand. This way we can adjust the amount of boreals in circulation depending on market sentiment.

Like traditional banking reserves must be kept on hand to pay out those who wish to withdraw.  2) Reserves will also be used for market making boreal around the target price. For example if boreals drop to 95 cents we will use the reserves to buy them off the market and get the price back up to the target price. If boreals are trading above 1 dollar we will sell more until the price goes down to a dollar, all ether from that sale will then go into the reserves.

Great question! The reserves will come from a few key sources. The biggest is IDEX, all trade fees from IDEX will be put into the reserves to back boreals. Second is fees from boreal loans and also any revenue from market making. Users will also be able to buy boreals from the bank, further increasing the reserves.  40% of the AURA tokens are slowly hitting the market through our growth hacking programs.

We can look at various countries during the free banking eras (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_banking) and see that many banks were able to have extremely low reserve requirements because their customers liked their currency so much. For example in Scotland banks only had about 2% reserves because that is all they needed.  Along with Ether, AURA will be used in our reserves early on meaning we will start with 400% reserves or higher.

Aurora 🔥 Decentralized Finance and Banking + Exchange 🔵,"   Fractional reserve lending refers to the practice of taking deposits from customers and lending those deposits out to other customers. The bank makes money from interest on the loans and passes some of that income on to the depositor (think of interest on a savings account).  Fractional reserve lending has a pretty negative perception, especially in the cryptocurrency space, but in and of itself it isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's a basic component of how banking works, where people with excess capital (depositors) give it to the bank to lend to customers, and both the depositor and bank profit in the process. The issues arise when the bank gets too loose with it's lending standards and there aren't enough reserves available when the depositors want to withdraw.  In the case of Aurora, it's a little different. Aurora will be taking in Ether (and potentially other cryptocurrencies), and giving out a new stable currency, the boreal. The key here is to manage the reserve levels so that individuals can always exchange their boreals back with Aurora. Per the previous post reserve levels will start very conservatively and lower over time. Additionally, it's important to remember that reserves are only one of the pieces backing and supporting the boreal, in addition to retailer backing through IDEX and debt/loan repayment. These other two components will also generate demand for boreals helping ensure there aren't issues with too many people trying to exit at one time.

Say a user borrows 200 boreals, they have to pay back those 200 boreals plus interest on the loan, creating an upward buying pressure on the asset.  Second is reserves in crypto. This will allow DC to buy up boreals when they are trading below the target value, helping push the price back up. When boreals are trading above the target value more boreals can be printed and sold, with the revenue from that sale going into the reserves.  Third is retailer acceptance at the target price (Regardless of what the market price is) starting with IDEX. When boreals launch users will be able to pay their IDEX trade fees in them at a 5% discount. This discount will encourage traders to buy up boreals to pay their trade fees. We will make it so this process can be automated, making it very simple to save some money.

Do both these tokens use the same algorithm? since it was already specified that Aura uses proof of stake. Is there a specific meaning for DVIP?

Aurora 🔥 Decentralized Finance and Banking + Exchange 🔵,"Hi everyone, lots of great questions here, let's start knocking them off!      Our end vision is an autonomous system that manages the monetary policy (supply, issuance rate, etc.) of a stablecoin called the boreal. The simple version of this is as demand increases and the price rises above the target value, boreal supply will increase. If demand decreases, and the price starts to fall below target, the supply will decrease. Increasing the supply is easy. The challenge with a stablecoin is dealing with a drop in price/decrease in demand, as you don't want everyone rushing for the exits at the same time. This is where we have a unique solution by backing the boreal with multiple assets.  1. Boreals can always be redeemed on IDEX at their target value in lieu of trade fees, regardless of the price at which they are currently trading. If the price drops below the target value, traders can lower their overall trading costs by first buying boreals and using that to pay their fees. When the exchange gets paid in boreals that currency is now out of circulation. We plan to create a tool that will allow users to do this automatically, making it even easier for traders to take advantage of this opportunity. 2. Demand for boreals due to loan repayment, both principal and interest. Individuals who take out loans in boreals will be able to spend them/sell them/etc. Once the loan comes due, they will have to repurchase those boreals for repayment of the loan principal, including some extra boreals to cover the interest. This will serve as another source of demand and upward pressure on the price.  The model is inspired by free banking (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_banking), a period in which private entities issued their own currency and were responsible for managing the supply prudently. The blockchain brings a new element of transparency to this where individuals can see how much is in circulation, how quickly they are being pulled out of circulation due to IDEX fees/loan repayment, etc. Our system will be able to use all of this information to design and determine a safe monetary policy with the ultimate goal of currency price stability.",False

Aurora 🔥 Decentralized Finance and Banking + Exchange 🔵,"    Great question, couple of clarifications first. Aurora is the name of the entire project. It means ""dawn"" in Latin, which we thought was fitting as we are at the beginning of a new form of economic systems. The currency users borrow from decentralized capital is the stablecoin known as the boreal. This system is not yet available and is further down our roadmap.  In terms of documentation/proof that is something we are very keenly paying attention to as there is a lot of development in the space.  There are ID providers such as uPort and RepSys, as well as new entrants such as Bloom working to bring decentralized credit scores. We believe that there will be a host of other services we can use to understand an individual’s economic activity and trustworthiness in addition to the data we have regarding trade activity on IDEX. In our whitepaper we reference an example of a First Blood player who is winning a lot of games and making money from the platform. This is a fun example that illustrates how there will be many new ways to see if someone is worthy of or has the income to repay a loan.",False

Aurora 🔥 Decentralized Finance and Banking + Exchange 🔵,"     Hi, and thanks for you interest in participating in the bounty! We did not find the bounty to be a very effective use of our time once the sale was in full swing and as such we decided to end it early. You can see in the thread that it was very well executed and we had quite a lot of participation. We had also pushed back our sale a bit and didn't want to make the bounty hunters work longer than we had agreed.  In regards to the token sale, yes we have taken a bit of an unusual approach with the membership (DVIP) purchase and the network token (AURA) airdrop. DVIP is a crypto membership that comes with free trading on IDEX until 2021 and double AURA rewards (from the rewards program https://tinyurl.com/AuroraRewards) for life after the free trade period is over. To use the membership all you have to do is hold the token in the same wallet you use for trading on IDEX (do not deposit it to the exchange). The smart contract and system will do the rest, automatically calculating how much DVIP you hold (if less than 1) and giving the trader the appropriate discount.  Each DVIP also comes with 50,000 AURA tokens. AURA is our utility token that will be used for POS staking our sidechain once IDEX moves from ethereum mainnet to an ethereum sidechain for scaling. AURA token holders will stake our chain and get paid in IDEX trade fees for providing the security to the network. As Aurora expands into decentralized banking the revenue from that venture will also flow back to AURA stakers for running the network.  So for each DVIP you get free trades on IDEX for 3 years, double AURA rewards for life after that and 50,000 AURA tokens. DVIP works now and AURA will be used for staking as soon as we have our sidechain live.",False

I'm sure Golem or other players will deploy distributed AI hosting before long, and I'm excited to see you are positioning yourselves accordingly.  I wonder if upcoming AI servers and server farms are an early area where you would be eager to offer loans. Better than farms, I think, is the idea of a server in every household. Something to keep our solar panels and battery packs busy :-) ---- what I mean is, the AURA and DVIP and upcoming BOREAL coins should be well positioned to benefit from a robust,  distributed AI architecture, according to your road map ... and I believe it would make good sense to find small players who can host a $50,000-$100,000 server, offer them a loan, which they can repay by simply deploying Golem or some such system.  With current infrastructure, ETH is strong, but nodes are still vulnerable to disruption. It looks like you are planning for a day when trade volumes are scaled exponentially. Proof of stake, where applicable in the Ethereum ecosystem, will definitely make a difference in terms of scaling solutions ... but the AI backbone is going to be essential in moving any of these heavy lifting projects forward.

Aurora 🔥 Decentralized Finance and Banking + Exchange 🔵,"Token Sale Has SOLD OUT! Thank you. Click here for full details  Due to inappropriate behavior on our previous thread we have started a new moderated ANN thread.      Web | Token Sale | IDEX Exchange | Whitepaper | Telegram | Medium | Reddit | Twitter | Newsletter   Aurora is the first blockchain powered financial network and cryptobank.  Trade freely and securely. Store your wealth in a reserve backed stable coin. Take back control of your finances.     Aurora will be the first fully decentralized crypto banking and financial platform. Aurora DAO is a suite of DAPPs and protocols that make up a fully decentralized banking and financial network. The components of Aurora support the boreal, a decentralized stablecoin, and together enable global banking in the new currency. Revenue from the components of Aurora will be used to expand boreal banking and provide economic incentives to secure the network via the Snowglobe protocol. More information about Aurora including the whitepaper can be found here.  The first component of Aurora is IDEX, a real-time decentralized exchange already live on the mainnet.   IDEX - Real-Time Decentralized Exchange    IDEX is a decentralized exchange that provides instant order placement and execution, free order cancellation, and real-time order book updates.  IDEX is the first component of Aurora and is the first real-time decentralized exchange. IDEX combines the speed of centralized exchanges and the security of the blockchain. IDEX allows traders to trade continuously without waiting for transactions to mine, fill multiple orders at once, and cancel orders immediately without any gas costs. It’s the experience people should expect trading on the blockchain!  Start trading immediately on IDEX!    On current decentralized exchanges such as Ethderdelta, 0x and Oasis, trade speeds are limited by block times and order books update slowly, often being out of sync with the actual app. Trades are not matched automatically, forcing users to manually select trades, opening them up to user error. Filling multiple orders, or market orders is impossible, and canceling or even placing limit orders can cost gas. By giving up the ability to manage user’s cryptocurrency, these exchanges also severely hamper the user experience.   Our Unique Solution    IDEX takes a different approach. By controlling the transaction sequence, IDEX provides the speed and user experience of a centralized exchange plus the security and auditability of a decentralized exchange.  Unlike other decentralized exchanges, the IDEX smart contract is designed to submit signed trades to Ethereum. This enables IDEX to control the order that transactions are processed, separating the act of trading from the blockchain transaction. As users trade their exchange balances update in real-time, while in the background their private keys are used to authorize the trade in the contract. This authorization prevents users from rescinding any completed trades and prevents IDEX from initiating any unauthorized trades.   The Future  Decentralized Exchange Protocol: Snowglobe  Ethereum is currently unable to meet the requirements of busy decentralized exchanges. Our solution is “Snowglobe”, a sidechain protocol used for decentralized trading that enables multiple exchanges to share liquidity.  Snowglobe is a protocol for high-performance, EVM-compatible, decentralized sidechain exchanges. The IDEX sidechain and the Snowglobe network are both secured by staking the AURA token. Stakers are rewarded with transaction fees from IDEX, DC banking, and any other future Aurora products.    Stable Coin: Boreals  Boreal is the stablecoin of the Aurora network. Inspired by free banking, each boreal is backed by ether reserves, debt from loans, and dapp endorsement, beginning with IDEX. Click to learn more about free banking, boreals, and Aurora loans.   The team     Roadmap    October 2017 IDEX launch on the mainnet. Semi-decentralized architecture consists of Ethereum smart contract plus central trading engine and transaction arbiter. API integration. Opening the platform via API access that will enable the development of trading bots, increasing liquidity and improving market efficiency. December 11th 2017 Token sale begins. DVIP will give discounted fees immediately. AURA will be airdropped on addresses holding DVIP once the token sale has ended. Once the airdrop has completed both DVIP and AURA will be unfrozen for transfers. Q2 2018 - Boreals go live with market making to stabilize the price Q3 2018 - Deploy Snowglobe childchain architecture, allowing IDEX to increase transaction throughput. Q4 2018 - Decentralization of the orderbook and transaction arbiter. This completes the transition of the current IDEX product to a decentralized childchain exchange. Q1 2019 - Margin trading support. Including this functionality in the protocol will put the UX on par with existing centralized exchanges. TBD - Once sharding is production ready we will launch the Snowglobe MVP, other exchanges are now able to build on the protocol. TBD - Fully decentralized Aurora mvp with Decentralized Capital boreal loans.  The protocol will continue to evolve and incorporate new blockchain developments, for example zk-snarks or other privacy systems that enable private trades. These improvements are heavily dependent on further development of the Ethereum network and other evolving blockchains.   Our Tokens  Aurora currently has two tokens: DVIP, our membership token, and AURA, our proof of stake utility token.  DVIP Token  DVIP is the token for sale during our token sale. A total of 2000 DVIP will ever be created and we are selling 1600 DVIP in our token sale. The remaining tokens have been reserved for marketing efforts or have been previously sold during our presale.  DVIP provides 3 main benefits: Free or discounted trades on IDEX through 2021 2x Market Making rewards for life DVIP is redeemable for Aurora tokens (AURA) in the future. DVIP is redeemable at a rate of 50,000 AURA per 1 DVIP.  For a complete breakdown of the benefits of DVIP membership, please visit the Aurora whitepaper.  Market Making Rewards on IDEX 20% of the total AURA token supply will be initially dedicated to the market maker rewards program, the first of our community distribution initiatives. AURA is awarded at a rate of 1% of the total remaining Market Maker rewards AURA per month. This program will extend through at least the end of 2019. Market makers who place and execute limit orders on any IDEX market will receive AURA tokens proportional to the fees spent on their limit orders.  A trader can earn up to 2x more AURA by owning membership tokens.   Aurora Token (AURA)  Aurora (AURA) is our proof of stake network token. AURA that aligns the interests of Aurora and the Snowglobe operators. All value from Aurora is used to compensate those who stake their AURA and provide security for the Snowglobe network.  In addition to acquiring AURA during our membership token sale, Aurora tokens can be earned by trading on IDEX through our market making program, which rewards users for adding liquidity to the exchange.  AURA Distribution  50% of AURA tokens will be used to help accelerate adoption of the Aurora network, the other 50% will be used for operations. 40% will be used to help subsidize the growth of Aurora by distributing AURA to users and community members through programs such as market maker rewards, marketing campaigns, and air drops. 10% will be given out proportionally to individuals who purchase IDEX memberships.

Aurora 🔥 Decentralized Finance and Banking + Exchange 🔵,"   Thanks! And yes it is more of a 2 for 1 deal. We sell the memberships and as a benefit of the membership you get free AURA tokens, the staking token of our sidechain version we will move to in the future.  Membership token (DVIP) is a crypto membership that comes with free trading on IDEX until 2021 and double AURA rewards (from the rewards program) for life after the free trades runs out. AURA is our utility token that will be used for POS staking our sidechain once IDEX moves from ethereum mainnet to an ethereum sidechain for scaling. AURA token holders will stake our chain and get paid in IDEX trade fees for providing the security to the network. As Aurora expands into decentralized banking the revenue from that venture will also flow back to AURA stakers for running the network.  Each DVIP also comes with 50,000 AURA tokens. So for $3,000 you get free trades on IDEX for 3 years, double AURA rewards for life after that and 50,000 AURA tokens. DVIP works now and AURA will be used for staking as soon as we have our sidechain live. Getting the sidechain live is our main focus after we do a few more minor things to stable out IDEX.",False

Aurora 🔥 Decentralized Finance and Banking + Exchange 🔵,"   As Passive pointed out there is no minimum. If you buy less than a full membership you get prorated fee discounts and AURA holdings. For example if you buy 1/5th DVIP you get 20% off trade fees for 3 years plus 10,000 AURA tokens. You can also buy more than 1 DVIP and get more AURA, but the DVIP trade fee benefits stop at 1 DVIP. Both DVIP and AURA will are ethereum assets and will be listed on IDEX. After the sale ends we will work on getting AURA listed on other exchanges.",False
