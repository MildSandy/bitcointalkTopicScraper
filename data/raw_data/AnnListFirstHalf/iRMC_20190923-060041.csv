ReMeChain ICO.    The idea of consolidation of the secondary metals market arose in 2014, and in 2015 the site lominfo.ru was launched to test the business idea. In the 2nd quarter of 2017 was formed a team of developers and partners of the project. The development of a platform prototype has begun.  ReMeChain will hold pre-ICO and ICO in September and November 2017.  In the 4th quarter of 2017 the alpha version of the platform would begin to be tested among the community of crypto-investors and experts-participants of the raw-materials market. Also, a mobile application will be launched.  The launch of the beta version of the project is scheduled for May 2018. In parallel, a PR-campaign will be conducted to attract buyers and suppliers to use the service. Russia will be the first country in which the ReMeChain marketplace will be launched.   ReMeChain will evolve and adapt for use in China in 3rd quarter of 2018. Recall, that China is the largest consumer of secondary metal in the world - in 2016, the country imported 1.44 million tons. The demand for secondary metals is growing by 7-10% annually. By 2020, ReMeChain will integrate legislative and tax standards for barrier-free international trade. After 3 years, the projected turnover on the marketplace will be $ 982 million.    On the basis of ReMeChain, a unified scrap metal scoring system will be created, opening up opportunities for international communication and business cooperation between small and medium-sized participants in the secondary metals market from different regions. Earlier, at the international level, only large companies could build trading chains. Integration into a unified system will undoubtedly lead to an increase in liquidity and the formation of an honest market price for scrap metal due to open information about all the representatives of the market, regardless of their business scale.  The ReMeChain project is also aimed at resolving environmental problems: due to the turbulent activity of mining enterprises, the global reserves of primary resources are gradually depleted.The environmental solution of ReMeChain is to increase the attractiveness of using metal scrap in global production. The volume of the market will increase with the introduction of smart contracts, attracting producers and recycling companies.  In the foreseeable future, participants in the secondary materials market will have access to a system that allows real-time tracking of demand and supply for scrap of different types, select hundreds of bona fide counterparties and enter into safe transactions based on RMC smart contracts.     To implement the trading platform ReMeChain will issue its own crypto currency. RMC token is based on open source Etherium and will be used to conduct smart transactions on the exchange between sellers and buyers.  In total, 6,600,000 tokens will be transferred to investors, which will be distributed as follows:  1. During the pre-ICO from November 9 to November 23, 600,000 tokens will be sold at a price of $ 1 apiece. Investors at the pre-ICO stage will receive a 20% bonus to the purchased tokens. 2. During the ICO from January 25 to February 25, 6,000,000 tokens will be sold at a price of $ 1 apiece.     To carry out the transaction of purchase and sale of secondary metal through ReMeChain it will take considerably less time and resources to negotiate the parameters of the contract. Also, the parties will be able to be sure of the transparency of the counterparty and the reliability of the fulfillment of their obligations.  Conclusion of the transaction takes place in several stages:  1. The buyer and the seller register on the site, fill in the legal information. 2. The buyer chooses a suitable offer, exchanges fiat money for RMC - the project's crypto currency. 3. The parties agree on the terms of the transaction - conclude a smart contract. 4. The buyer contributes funds that are reserved on the escrow account. 5. Upon receipt of the goods, the buyer checks it for compliance with the conditions stated in the transaction. If the terms of the transaction are executed, the buyer confirms this in the ReMeChain system, and the seller receives funds from the escrow account. 6. The blockchain-network records the results of the transaction with the parties' feedback.      ReMeChain will act as a bilateral guarantor in transactions for the purchase and sale of secondary metals. Before the transaction, the parties will be able to examine the counterparty's reputation for prior activity. General evaluation standards will help the buyer to quickly find the desired lot, and the seller to form his proposal correctly. The opportunities of small and medium-sized businesses within the ReMeChain marketplace will be equal to the capabilities of large companies and enable them to conduct international trade, scale and develop.  Finally, according to its design, ReMeChain is the only decentralized marketplace that solves systemic problems at the global level. The project sets the standards of work, which will be gradually accepted by all market participants!",False
