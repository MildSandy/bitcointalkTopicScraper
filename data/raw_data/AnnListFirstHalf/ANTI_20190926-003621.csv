Authors/inventors can write original articles, whether about science, or an invention they were planning, and make sure it is not plagiarized and stolen from other users across the internet. We want to serve as a hub for people to share their ideas with everyone else. Currently, it takes anywhere from 80-150 days to file for publication in the United States, and an enormous 21 months to file to copyright, we aim to lower both numbers down to around 2-5 days. Anyone can post on our website, opening a huge potential market, and those who are passionate about their work can apply to get it protected for a small fee in ANTIMASS, an ERC-20 smart contract token.  Miners of the token can then run algorithms to verify that it is original content by searching through our database of already copyrighted and claimed work from across the internet. The miners then get the significant portion of the fee required to submit a claim. As a platform, we are only half a year old, but we have made the finishing touches on our whitepaper and our pre-ICO is live, and offering an additional 25% bonus. Our ICO starts on February 17th. There are a total of 100,000,000 tokens created, the hardcap, and we are selling 55,000,000 of them during our crowdsale for 1 ETH = 1,000 ANTI. Our whitepaper and ICO can be found on https://antimasstechnologies.com  The Antimass Team",False
