Clients scoring and verification 2. Holding clients database and representation clients to each other 3. Offered conditions database 4. Contract creation 5. Contract conditions fulfillment control 6. Guarantee fund function  Differences from Competitors SOFIN Platform All competitors can be divided into two categories: ‚Ä¢ Traditional P2P Lending (Lending Club, Zopa, bezbanka.ru, etc.) ‚Ä¢ Loans in cryptocurrency (Everex, POLONIEX, Btcjam, etc.) Our transaction storage system is more open than the first category. You can remember at least a scandal with Lending Club when the turnover of the company was artificially overstated. SOFIN transactions are stored in a decentralized storage facility based on blockchain. There is also a powerful bonus model based on the private SOFIN token (more in the Smart Contract Structure section). We benefit from the second category with the legal purity and transparency of each transaction. The loan is given in the fiat currency of the Borrower‚Äôs country according to the law. So the Creditor has a clear, legitimate reason to repay his loan. In addition, we differ from both options with the existence of our own guarantee fund, which reduces the risks of Creditors (more in the Guarantee Fund section). We give loans to both individuals and small and medium-sized businesses. For businessmen it can be both a business development loan and the one to start a new one. The main thing is to make the project viable. The risk assessment methodology, including the startups, has already been tested in practice. For the startups it will also be a plus if the Borrower has already proven its reliability by taking and returning consumer loans. His ranking and history of consumer loans will be available to the system, and the chances of getting credit for business will grow significantly.",False

It says:  The purpose of preICO is to collect 250 000$. During the preICO phase, preliminary SOFIN will be implemented and exchanged to the main tokens during the ICO 1-2 phase. They will continue to participate in the P2P system and trade on the exchanges. On preICO it will be possible to purchase up to 11 500 000 tokens at different prices depending on the number of already sold coins:  Number of tokens Price in USD for 1 preICO SOFIN Amount in USD per phase Type of phase 1000000 0.45 450000 Closed day 500000 0.5 250000 Dedicated phase Up to 10000000 0.8 Up to 8000000 Bonus phase  A complete buy-out of the dedicated phase tokens means a successful preICO. The .ico phases begin in approximately 1-2 months after the end of the preICO. In this period of time, we will redesign the product and prepare for ICO. The purpose of ICO is to collect 9 500 000$. In ICO it will be possible to purchase up to 80 000 000 tokens at different prices, depending on the number of already sold tokens in ICO:  Number of tokens Price in USD for 1 SOFIN Amount in USD per phase Type of phase 9500000 1.00 9500000 Dedicated phase Up to 70000000 2.00 Up to 140000000 Bonus phase  Your homepage says:    So the info concerning the PreICO doesn't add up. Am I missing something or are the whitepaper numbers outdated? Would be awesome if you could clear things up for me and maybe say 1-2 words about how you come to your valuation:)  The project itself looks promising though.",False
