TE-FOOD SOLUTION ""...for the first time in the history of crypto, a major securities commission released an opinion, which referred to, that based on its economics, the TFD token is not a security, it doesn’t need a licence under the German Banking Act, or the Payment Services Supervision Act.""  The equivalent of the SEC in Germany is on official record for stating that TFD is not a security.   CAL, which is pegged in value to the US Dollar, doesn’t have any characteristics of securities:  1.  it will not be traded on secondary exchanges, 2.  its price will not be volatile (as it’s a stable token), and 3.  it will be paid only for providing services (software licence rental, providing computation power, etc.).",False

Integration of these two new tokens will commence this week. A quick look at who and what they are, as well as next steps for community voting:  What is Zilliqa (ZIL)? Zilliqa is the first public blockchain designed to implement sharding, allowing for linear scaling as the blockchain grows in size. To date, scalability has been an issue for existing blockchain technologies.   Bitcoin often can’t process all the demand for its network, and transaction fees have risen accordingly. The same goes for Ethereum where limited throughput means smart contracts can become gas-intensive. For instance, the popularity of Crypto Kitties significantly slowed Ethereum, showing the limits of the network.  Zilliqa fundamentally changes how a blockchain reaches consensus. Their sharding solution scales with the size of the network. Theoretically, there’s no limit to the number of transactions Zilliqa could process per second. Practically, however, depending on the number of nodes on the network, Zilliqa could process tens or hundreds of thousands of transactions per second.  What is TE-FOOD (TFD)? TE-FOOD is a farm-to-table traceability solution, covering all logistics and food quality activities and data management of the supply chain. It provides cost-effective software and identification tools to make livestock and fresh food supply information transparent.  TE-FOOD is the only fresh food ecosystem which integrates supply chain companies, consumers, and governments/authorities to improve food safety, eliminate food frauds, and decrease costs of the supply chain companies.   Identification tools are applied to livestock, transports, and fresh food packages to follow the items throughout the whole supply chain. Fresh food products in retail can be traced back to their origins together with food safety-related information.   https://twitter.com/payfairio/status/1019179015154872322",False

We think the real competition comes from elsewhere, and there can be synergies with other crypto companies which make all of us stronger.  This is why we joined the Trace Alliance, started by OriginTrail.  Why is this important? We can provide solutions for food companies with any type of software background (including having no identification hardware and no software at all).  We can provide solutions for food companies which want to use our private or public blockchain ledger, or even if they want to store their data in a third-party blockchain like Vechain or Hyperledger.  We can also provide solutions for larger companies in the supply chain to integrate their existing systems.  But what if many different companies of the same supply chain use many different on-chain and off-chain traceability solutions? In the emerging markets, this is a rare situation, but in developed countries, it’s quite common. We could create custom interfaces to each one of them, but maybe there is a quicker, better solution.  OriginTrail provides an independent protocol for such problems. And the fact that both OriginTrail and TE-FOOD are compliant to the GS1 standards, it makes the data exchange even more convenient.  As there is a great diversity in different supply chains, there will be examples for all above mentioned versions. But we believe, that joining the Trace Alliance makes our offering stronger, and enables us to provide solutions to even more consumer needs.  We hope this cooperation will be fruitful, and the starting point of many interesting partnerships.  Source : https://medium.com/te-food/te-food-joins-the-trace-alliance-fd543772334d",False

Business strategy for Q2, 2018 We published the strategy we will follow in Q2.  TL;DR:  Roll outs and new implementations in Vietnam Seeking for implementation partners internationally Seeking for cooperation partners to provide value added services Keeping ourselves to the roadmap Increasing marketing efforts  Meat qualiy checker R&D project We joined a consortium to develop a mobile app based meat quality checker application for consumers. The consortium won more than 1 million USD national R&D grant. As technology evolves, it provides possibility to develop applications using mobile phones, artificial intelligence, and blockchain, which formerly were not available to the public.  Although this is an R&D project, therefore the output is uncertain, we believe such application can get TE-FOOD a lot of publicity and a new revenue source.  Partnership with Laurel  We partnered with Laurel, the leading retail technology provider in Hungary. Laurel’s customers include companies like TESCO, Metro, Auchan, IKEA, SPAR, Adidas, Butlers, Coca Cola, Hervis, Bauhaus, Praktiker. They are acclaimed partners of IBM, Fujitsu, NCR, Microsoft, Oracle, Toshiba, Symphony, LSRetail.

The pilots will be implemented through a new collaboration with HALAL TRAIL who have developed innovative halal traceability solutions with TE-FOOD. HALAL TRAIL will be the first solution to expand to all global halal food markets, and provide food traceability and quality verification services for the sector.  From the 7.6 billion people in the world, almost 2 billion are Muslims. The halal method in the food industry refers to the permissible or lawful way of preparing food and drinks according to Islamic law. Due to religious reasons, this enormous market of Muslims consciously seeks trusted, halal certified sources when they buy food. Their motivation to check the source is very strong.  According to industry estimations, the global halal food market will reach USD 2.55 trillion by 2024.  Food traceability combined with blockchain technology is the solution which can give Muslims peace of mind that their food was prepared according to Islamic law.  TE-FOOD’s traceability processes were specifically developed for HALAL TRAIL to trace halal food. The solution is under testing before the pilots start in June 2018.  TE-FOOD and HALAL TRAIL will create the pilots in Lancaster, Tunbridge Wells & Manchester, U.K. as a reference to be implemented globally.",False

Introduction video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qot-VCUgpng  Te-food is already a company with a working product and a real revenue. In the crypto-scene, this is a great advantage because it’s very unusual. Since 2016, TE-FOOD is implemented in Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh City region) for tracing pigs, pork, poultry and eggs through the whole supply chain from farm to retail. The system tracks 18.000 pigs, 200,000 chickens and 2.5 million eggs each day, serving 30 million people. They already got coverage on the television. Market expansion is the main reason why they launched a fund raising.  http://vnews.gov.vn/tp-ho-chi-minh-trien-khai-truy-xuat-nguon-goc-thit-trung-gia-cam https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y3n1LHHg6M  Whitepaper https://ico.tefoodint.com/te-food-white-paper.pdf 13000+ members https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@tefood  Company hierarchy https://medium.com/te-food/company-hieararchy-of-te-food-due-diligence-series-b5211f902738  ICO statistics  22/02/2018 Total token supply : 1,000,000,000 Tokens available in sale : 512,000,000 Total hardcap : $ 19,000,000 Hardcap public sale : 4128 eth  Overall the team did a very good job, this in contrary to alot of other ico’s. The telegram group was muted upfront to encounter scammers. The last digits of the ethereum adress was also given out upfront to ensure people wouldn’t send to the wrong adress. The gwei usage and gas limit settings where capped at 50 gwei + 200K gas to avoid a typical gaswar. To participate, KYC and whitelisting was needed. This was stopped at 14/02, to protect the investment of early followers. Max cap at ico was set at 1eth/contributor to give alot of people the possibility to be part of this happening. After 14minutes, the 4128eth were reached, a great succes. The tokens are released and locked for 14days. Many people are always afraid of high pre-sale bonusses. In this case, these discounts were offset by the volatile ethereum market during the presale until the public sale. The difference is only 10% which should give alot of people confidence. 20.000 ether was rejected during the presale, which is as big as the total hardcap. As mentioned earlier, this fund raising went very smooth and was done profesionally. I sincerely hope that this will become the standard for other ico’s.  Mission  Improving food safety around the world and change the way we approach food. Fighting off the massive corruption in the food industry, diminish the effects of frauds and make food supply transparent. That’s also the reason why we will use blockhain, since we believe that big industry players can corrupt data on centralized systems. We want to provide legitimacy by using the blockchain. Using a general food safety ledger, improves supply chain efficiency. This trough the mitigation of redundant identifications and activities. For example double vaccination or use of antibiotics. This can lead to decreasing costs.  Team The 21-year-old IT company, Erba Ltd. has 30 developers, from which 12 work on TE-FOOD. They have every type of developers ready to assist them in their tasks: front end, back end, blockchain, AI, hardware, system administration. For the blockchain part, Abraham Endre (Silur), former member of zCash team, member of Monero team, and member of Ethereum Foundation’s research team is the most well known. https://icobench.com/ico/te-food/team  Target markets The main focus is primarily on emerging countries where Te-Food can show the advantages of the product the best. Recently, a representation office was opened in South Africa and negaotiations are running in Laos,Malaysia & Cambodia. Last countries are situated in the ASEAN region which means they are willing to export to China. China however is requiring traceability data to import, where Te-Food comes in handy. But also other negotiations are running in West-African countries for the implemention of Te-Food. As mentioned earlier, these countries are recieving our main focus. Nonetheless, as food trade is global, establishing partnerships in developed countries makes sense as well. A solution like Te-Food is also not available there yet. According to statistics, the size of the food traceability market will increase to $15B in the coming years. https://medium.com/te-food/why-does-te-food-focuses-on-emerging-countries-aa9e3450c8fb  Governemental support Getting backed from governments is important, since they have the power to regulate and enfore a market. Also sanctions can be giving for those who don’t follow the rules. The problem in most cases, is that they don’t know how to implement traceability on a big scale. But this is where our team try to consult them.  Why should organisations in the supply chain adopt Te-Food Mostly, the traceability costs are paid by the participants at the beginning of the supply chain (farms) . In reality, companies at the end of the chain (retails), are having the most benefit from the transparant data. Te-Food gives the supply chain companies an option to buy/sell value added information to each other. The farms can get an extra income for cooperation with the tracking of the data. That’s the model to encourage them for working with the system. These direct transactions can also be made by using Te-Food tokens. In summary the tokens will be used for paying transactions and paying for value added information. But also for rewarding conscious consumer behavior by using the consumer mobile app.  https://medium.com/@wolfcrypto/te-food-ama-with-wolf-crypto-351fadc38475  Real partnerships  Auchan: French retail group with 338,000 employees in 15 countries https://twitter.com/TE_FOOD/status/957898375067787264  Japfa: Listed dairy farming company in Singapore  CJ Group: Listed South-Korean conglomerate (one of the largest chaebols — no need for introduction)  Big C: Thailand’s second-largest hypermarket operator https://twitter.com/TE_FOOD/status/955745031704535040  AEON: Listed Japanese retail chain with 500,000 employees, operates across South-east Asia https://twitter.com/TE_FOOD/status/961187412079792128  CP Group: Thailand’s largest conglomerate (revenue of US$45 billion) https://twitter.com/twitter/statuses/953560938359160832  Lotte Mart: Hypermarket chain in Korea (of the vast Lotte Group) https://twitter.com/TE_FOOD/status/964403001409470464  They appear to have cornered the market in Vietnam with partnerships with major distribution points like Vissan, Satra Foods, Mega Market, VinMart etc. https://zintech.vn/cong-nghe-phat-hien-nguon-goc-nhung-mieng-thit-heo/  (Picture is showing a marketing board in Lotte mart to encourage users, real partnerships..)

Not for filling their own pocket, as they could easily raise 2–3 times the hardcap amount. Instead they declined alot of big offers. This means there will be a big demand. This would suit both parties obviously. Getting on a decent exchange is good for gaining attention by other investors, which means growth, more users and more market penetration.  As mentioned above, there is already a working product which is being used. The product itself is brilliant. Helping the world trough blockchain, more projects like this in media would bring benifits for the whole cryptocurrency market as well. Less food poisoning, less fraud and fewer deaths thanks to Te-Food. I can see this being covered easily in newspapers and television in the future. This will give the exchange also extra exposure afcorse. ( now already in Vietnam on television )  The team doesn’t want to hype it too much, they gained healthy attention for doing the fund raise. No hard shilling or crazy stunts were needed. The main focus is achieving more countries that will be working with them. Marketing afcorse is also a part of this , which is being covered by Marton. I spoke alot to him and i am assured of his profesionallity to keep giving Te-Food more attention, which they also deserve. Other members of the team can be easily reached, which came in handy for getting more information on the project. They are very transparant, friendly and want the project to succeed. If you read this summary and clicked multiple links, you should be aware that the team is working very hard to accomplish that. The team mentioned that huge news is going to be announced. Considering their profesionality, the news will be really big.  Getting partnerships will trigger a domino-effect, businesses will have to start using it or they will left behind. Because people will prefer buying food from a traceable source instead and not from sources without traceable food. This project will have a high grow rate.",False

The completely new approach that covers a bigger picture in the food industry, the usage commodity of the app itself and a real value and usage of the token, gives this project a big advantage before it`s ˝competitors˝, such as Wabi for example. I think that based on today`s lifestyle and the population growing even faster that predicted, there will be more and more stricter controls about the food that is produced and offered to the end customer. And not only will there be a stricter inspection by the government authorities, but more and more people will wanna know more about what they eat, and where the food comes from. The fact that Te-food not only focuses on consumers usage,  but also on supply chain companies and governments authorities, gives this project just another added value.  I would also like to point out that the decision of the team, to focus on the emerging countries first, where the majority of food frauds are executed is simply great. There for, the practical usage of the product will eventually benefit the population of those countries and the product it` self will begin it`s adoption. Which in my opinion is one of the greatest challenges. In this case will be a win-win situation. Well adopted product will definitely benefit the consumers food recognition and reduce food frauds.  Seeing it from both perspectives; as an investor and a potential product user, talking for myself I see no reason not to invest. In this case I can support the team in their work and later on use the tokens for the purpose of using the product. I also believe that along the way I may even earn some money by trading a small amount of the bought tokens. I missed the ICO opportunity to be already part of this amazing project, but will definitely keep an eye for when the tokens hit some exchanges so I can invest in the early stages of this food revolution.  Just a quick opinion I wanted to share  ",False

We have entered the new year and for many of us, it’s a fresh start. A chance to reflect on a few things we could have done better in 2017 and enter this year with a positive attitude to make a change. Have you established a new years resolution this year? A recent poll was taken to determine what the most popular new year's resolution was. In first place, with almost twice as many votes as anything else was to become a healthier person in the year ahead. Working to become a healthier you, is without a doubt the best project you can ever undertake because you are the most important thing in your life. Make yourself the best person you can be. The main catalyst which deters most people from a healthy lifestyle is the assumption that we don’t have time to exercise and for many of us, we simply don’t. The funny thing is though, when you force yourself to exercise regularly, your energy levels begin to rise. You become extremely productive at work and have an abundance of spare time all of a sudden. You then realise that your body and mind were functioning at 60% when you were neglecting exercise.  https://twitter.com/TE_FOOD/status/956148310523432960",False

Since a real farm-to-table traceability what TE-FOOD provides is extremely rare, you are right that it could be required in developed countries as well.  But in developed countries usually there is some kind of traceability, although currently it's almost never farm-to-table. However, in most emerging countries, which give 65% of the world's population, there is no traceability at all. This is one reason we are focusing on emerging countries.

We have already negotiations in Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, and South Africa.  We experience huge demand for fresh food traceability.

And exactly as you wrote, you can be able to trace back the food products until they reached America in that case. But it depends on how the food products are sold in retail.  An example: Vietnam is one of the biggest exporter of Pangasius fish. A massive amount of Pangasius fish is exported to Europe. If the European importer buys the fish pre-packaged, then the TE-FOOD label stickers will be on each package, so European consumers can check the origin information. But if the fish is bought in bulk, and the retail packaging is done in an European food processing plant, then no TE-FOOD label will be applied to the retail packages.  We focus on emerging markets, but we don't refuse customers in other markets. In the example above, it can be wise for us to contact the European importer to join TE-FOOD, so they can provide full traceability for the fish products, which is a business advantage for them.  And you are right with RFID. RFID is a great technology, but in the livestock and fresh food industry it is used only on cattles in developed countries, because they live longer, and they are more expensive. For anything else, RFID is way too expensive.",False

Most of the food gets packaged locally due to local legislative reuqirements (e.g. in the province of Quebec in Canada by law the packaging must include French, etc). However, I have already seen packaged berries (strawberries, etc) with QR on the package (which was promoting the producer and not for traceabilty), so I assume it woildn't be hard to get them to do it. But if they are not aware that this featue exists, they won't incorporate it in the packaging.  As you mentioned, the consumers in the developing countries are not cocnerned that much with the food they are buying, so it might take a while for this to pick up.

In a globalized economy the source of even a fresh food can be anywhere in the world.  ""consumers in the developing countries are not cocnerned that much with the food they are buying"" Sorry, that's not what I wanted to say. The reality is quite the opposite. As the number of middle class grows constantly in the emerging countries, there is a massive pressure on the governments to wastly improve food security. That's why we saw tremendous interest from governmeents in many emerging countries to implement fresh food traceability. Their problem is that they don't know how to do it. They have to work out regulation, enforcement, sanctioning, to fit in the processes into a proper government body, the role of the authority in the system, etc. This is why we write so many times that to be successful in this industry is 30-40% technology, and 60-70% implementation methodology. And we have a proper, experience based methodology, which focuses on emerging countries.  Developed countries are more difficult markets from many viewpoints. A lot of companies have internal traceability systems (although those are focusing on logistics, not food quality, and are not open to third parties, let alone consumers), and need strong arguments to undertake additional work to integrate to a new traceability system. Since food frauds are not so common in developed countries as they are in the developing ones, the consumer pressure is not as strong.  In many cases, consumers in developed countries think that food traceability is a solved problem in their country. But if you read about it, you see that, for example in the U.S. cattle traceability is mandatory only between farms and slaughterhouses, and only if the livestock crosses state borders. You can't call it farm-to-table.",False

Here are the answers:  1. We already have several major food companies amongst our customers:  Auchan - https://www.auchan-retail.com/ CJ Group - http://english.cj.net/ CP group - http://www.cpgroupglobal.com/ Japfa - https://japfa.com/index.php AEON - https://www.aeon.com/ Vissan - https://www.vissan.com.vn/ Big C - https://www.bigc.co.th/  These are all large food supply chain conglomerates with tens of thousands of employees.  2. We provide a modern, but very cost effective traceability solution for the supply chain companies (no special hardware is needed), and beside the logistics approach, we track and trace food quality related information as well, so we provide custom processes and functions for the different food categories. These are strong advantages in the market.  3. Another advantage is our sales model. We don't have initial implementation fee, we sell the identification materials, and charge for the transactions made in the system. Companies like it because the costs can be covered by the OPEX budget, it doesn't require CAPEX involvement.  4. TE-FOOD has more implementation models. - It can be implemented by a company (food producer, retailer) to require traceability data from its suppliers, - or it can be implemented by a government / authority (trade, food safety, etc.) for the whole supply chain in one or more geographical regions / food categories. For government implementations, TE-FOOD prefers PPP (Public Private Partnership) model, where the government acts as regulatory authority, not as customer. TE-FOOD provides consultation services for the authorities, does the implementation, and trains the supply chain.  If you have any more question, you are welcome.",False

TE-FOOD is a successful food traceability solution, used by 6,000+ companies, managing more than 400,000 transactions each day, reaching 30 million people.  We are dedicated to improve food safety, fight off corruption, support fair trade, and build trust between the food supply chain companies, consumers, and authorities in the emerging markets.  We believe that building a sustainable business on food safety is much more efficient to make difference than any type of aid.  The Hottest Bounty campaign this Winter! Join us now!           TE-FOOD in numbers   TE-FOOD Q&A   Why do you focus on livestock and fresh food?  Almost 80% of food frauds are perpetrated on livestock and fresh food products (seafood, dairy products, and meat products are in the forefront). Each year, one in ten people in the world becomes ill after eating contaminated food, causing more than 400,000 deaths yearly (according to World Health Organisation). Also, the overuse of antibiotics in food animals threatens public health. Mitigating this problem is our main mission.  Why do you focus on emerging countries?  Emerging markets contain more than 50 countries, representing 60% of the world's population and 45% of its GDP. Around 2/3 of the food frauds are executed in emerging countries. According to studies, Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of food traceability is the highest in Asia-Pacific (16.7%) compared to the rest of the world (5.5-8.7%). Growing middle-class in emerging countries, and increasing awareness among population drives growing demand for consumer level product history insight. Our technology and implementation methodology fits perfectly in the needs of emerging countries.   What is unique in TE-FOOD?  While food safety professionals and organisations always emphasize the importance of whole-chain food traceability, in reality very few such system exist. Even the most popular one-up-one-down systems (when traceability exists only within a supply chain participant's processes from purchasing to selling) are rare in emerging countries. TE-FOOD tracks millions of items on a daily basis in more food categories, through the whole supply chain. Such achievement is extremely rare in this scope and range of products. TE-FOOD combines modern technology with low-cost implementation and operation, providing a viable solution for emerging countries. We also have a detailed, practical implementation roadmap to help companies and authorities successfully implement traceability. This makes our solution scalable.   Why do you need ICO, if it's a working solution?  While TE-FOOD has decent revenues, the system is ready and the implementation methodology is well polished, the adaptation of blockchain technology, and the international expansion needs significant funds. Implementing a whole chain traceability system needs a lot of professionals working together for at least 8-12 months. Strategy planning, legislation management, communication with companies, social organisations, and consumers, technology implementation, data migration, process customizations, trainings are the largest steps of such implementation project.   Are you able to execute your plans?  Our team has 21 years of experience in mission critical system development. We have the best professionals to execute the strategy, sales, and technology sides of our plans. As we developed one of the largest whole-chain traceability systems on the world, we have real life knowledge and experience in implementing traceability systems in emerging countries.   Why does food traceability need blockchain?  1.   Food supply chains – especially in the emerging countries – are poisoned with frauds and corruption, which led to untrust. Data provided within the chain is always debated. The incorruptible, unalterable data storage structure of blockchain increases the credibility of the supply chain data for consumers, supply chain memebers, authorities and NGOs. 2.   A single, general food safety ledger improves supply chain efficiency (through the mitigation of redundant identifications and activities, such as double vaccination, or double use of antibiotics) and leads to decreased costs (by enabling quick, targeted recalls, instead of expensive wide-scale recalls). 3.   It's an interoperable platform which serves data to customers and companies even beyond country borders, which is a legit requirement in a globalized world.   What is the business model of TE-FOOD?  TE-FOOD has more implementation models. It can be implemented by a company (food producer, retailer) to require traceability data from its suppliers, or it can be implemented by a government for the whole supply chain in one or more geographical regions / food categories. For government implementations, TE-FOOD prefers PPP (Public Private Partnership) model, where the government acts as regulatory authority, not as customer. TE-FOOD provides consultation services for the authorities, does the implementation, and trains the supply chain. TE-FOOD’s revenue sources:  1. Selling physical and logical identification materials 2. Charging transactional costs 3. Selling food transport environment sensors 4. Charging monthly or sales volume dependent fees on the marketplace   What will be your token used for?  TE Coin tokens represent a payment tool to use within the TE-FOOD system. It can be used for the following purposes:  1. Pay for transactions 2. Pay for value added information 3. Rewarding conscious consumer behavior for using our Consumer mobile app.     How TE-FOOD works  TE-FOOD enables all companies of the fresh food supply chain to manage logistics and food safety related data in their operations. Identification tools of various technologies are applied to livestock, transports, and fresh food packages to follow the items throughout the whole supply chain. Fresh food products in retail can be traced back to their origins together with food safety related information.  Current status  TE-FOOD is ready and in use by thousands of companies each day. The following achievements are accomplished:  B2B mobile app with custom processes and functions for each role(e.g. farm, veterinary, etc.) and food category (e.g. pig, chicken, etc.). All processes, modules, functions are reday, tested, and in production for pig, chicken, and egg categories. (available for Android and iOS) Cost effective QR code and RFID based animal, transport, andpackage identification tools (security seals, label stickers, printed bags, etc.) Public consumer mobile app to check food history whileshopping (available for Android and iOS) Integrated retail solutions (cashier box, smart scales, digitalsignage kiosks) Zalo.me compliant QR codes to reach 60M+ users Controlling and enforcement mobile app for authorities (veterinaries,police, market control) Standard interfaces to connect third-party solutions Farm management mobile app (inventory management, feeding, vaccination) Implementation guidebook with step-by-step roadmap and training materials, focusing on emerging countries, both for private and governmental customers.  Blockchain  Blockchain will be implemented for two purposes:  Token transaction ledger  The token payment solution will be implemented on a public network using TFOOD, an ERC20 token, which represent the identity and information data of tracked items. Supply chain participants will use it to buy transactions in the system.  Traceability transaction ledger  Transactional and food related information will be stored on a private blockchain, and will be driven by an internal technical token: the Transaction token.

Using blockchain in livestock tracking has more advantages. Maybe the most important is that a blockchain based ledger is incorruptible, unalterable. Livestock trading is fulll with abuses and frauds all over the world. Using a system which is fed by data by people and sensors and the data can be read, but not altered later means more credibility for the supply chain and the consumers.  Using blockchain for contracting and payment within the supply chain means further advantages, but these are the areas which are much harder for supply chain participants to accept, so a careful planning is needed on how to implement them.  Tracking costs vary in different industries and technologies. For cattles in the USA, RFID ear tag based traceability costs start at $2-5, and this is not a whole chain traceability cost, but just the farmer's cost. We are by far cheaper than that.",False

Do you imagine, they won't be able to falsify the expiration date of the meat they are selling? (Maybe they still can, but it will be more difficult and it will be easier to detect) And you will be able to know the place of origine of the livestock. If there was a virus epidemic. It will be more easier to locate it and destroy the epidemic. So i think it can only be beneficial for everyone. But it needs to be seriously done.",False
