Nobody thinks about the importance of manufacturers: why take up mental space with what will come on its own? That is how the majority of major online retailers operate, as do practically all existing offline networks. They fight only over the major players: getting the chance to be directly supplied by Apple or Samsung at the initial wholesale price is the ultimate dream of any player in the retail market. But no one considers the interests of small manufacturers (vendors). The main reason for this is that you can’t “get much out of” them. A small manufacturer is only interesting to a similarly small or local retailer, one who doesn’t have enough of an assortment or has a unique target demographic.  And yet, small manufacturers—yesterday’s startups—contain huge potential for both the market and consumers.

Hamster Marketplace gives novice and local producers a way to sell niche electronics to a hungry market without a single middleman.  Hamster Marketplace will open the niche electronics market to thousands of vendors around the world who cannot afford to sell through current platforms. It will allow millions of buyers to find one-of-a-kind products and buy them without a middleman’s markup. The marketplace will be run by the producers themselves.  Given the difficult situation on the cryptocurrency market, a great alternative to cryptocurrencies is the purchase of tokens for projects that have already launched their ICOs or that are approaching their main round of token sales. One such project is Hamster Marketplace, a project to create a decentralized trading platform for indie manufacturers of gadgets and electronics. Unlike the projects of a year ago, Hamster Marketplace is supported not just by promises of “income from the token exchange rate” and hazy plans for the future, but by its reserve of experienced developers and managers, and by its own niche that no one has fully occupied. This is a fully-fledged, mature project that was created not under the “nursery” conditions of the novelty of tokens as a tool, but under fierce competition....",False

One of the first is Sophia TX, a startup which has postponed their ICO, which was supposed to start on 5thDecember, by two days. CryptoKitties have also affected CryptoHamsters’ plans for the Hamster Marketplace project. The team of HM has decided to postpone their pre-sale from 7 to 11 of December.   The team has postponed its tokens presale due to malfunction of the Ethereum Blockchain. It was affected by numerous smart-contracts of CryptoKitties game as described in the official announcement of HM:   On Friday was supposed to mark the beginning of the Hamster Marketplace’ presale. Unfortunately our parts were crossed with the cat. More precisely, with many digital cats from popular application CryptoKitties… So we had only one way - to connect other currencies for pre-sale re-launch at Monday, 11th of December, 14:12 Moscow time"".   In CryptoKitties,users can buy and breed virtual kittens. More than 20,000 virtual cats have been bought and sold, resulting in a market cap of over $3 million.   Since all in-game transactions are based on Ethereum smart-contracts, this malfunction of the Ethereum network was caused by gamers’ activities. Due to this, the Ethereum exchange rate fell by 12%. At the same time the Bitcoin rate increased from $11300 to $15900. Ethereum representatives has stated that they are troubleshooting the issue and applying technical fixes.

Unfortunately, the cat ran across our road, so to speak. More precisely, several hundred thousand digital cats from the popular CryptoKitties application, which continues to overload the Ethereum blockchain since December 4, has delayed the launch of multiple ICO’s. The Ethereum developers' forecast for solving all problems of blockchain capacity is ""a couple of weeks"" at best. We were planning to launch the presale exclusively on “Ether"" this Friday. This technical issue did not leave us and our project a better solution than to urgently start accepting other currencies that were previously expected to launch only on January’s Hamster Marketplace token-sale.  We are doing everything in our power to solve this as quickly as possible. However, we had to move the presale to Monday, December 11, at 11:12 GMT.
