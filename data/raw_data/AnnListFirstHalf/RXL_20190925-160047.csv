What should be happening is that people can fund the escrow with their local currency and then you work out the escrow from there. I'm talking about usability and if you think people are genuinely going to go to Coinbase/equivalent, buy $¬£‚Ç¨1000 worth of eth and stick it in this, then you are crazy. It's not going to happen. People need to feel like they're not using crypto at all.

The answer is that we do not have access to the funds, the funds are stored inside a mutual contract on the blockchain that belongs only to both lessor and lessee - this is why it is called a trustless storage, as you do not have to trust your money to a third party. We are providing an interface to create and interact with these trustless contracts with no technical knowledge.  Moreover, storing deposit in Ethers can prove to be a very valuable investment over time and it can be worth much more than when security deposit was made. If you do not want to take the risk of value change, our contracts will also work with Dai stable coin developed by Maker.",False
