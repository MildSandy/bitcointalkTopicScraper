This took place on the moment the problem occured and KAPU failed to recognize the severity nor did they act to analyse and find a solution.  Currently the KAPU blockchain is corrupted:  - It can't be restored from 0 - It can't be upgraded to ARK v2 - A number of forging delegates is only elected due to the duplicated votes, receiving and distributing KAPU tokens that they shouldn't  There are 2 possible solutions:  1. Revert to the blockchain as per July 17th (and lose all transactions since) 2. Restart a new blockchain and distribute tokens to reflect the current balances (and lose all history)  The KAPU team has been informed of the problem on July 26th and August 13th. We have been working closely with their dev team to analyse the problem and this has lead to a security update on ARK Node v1 (v1.1.0). KAPU team however has a responsibility to their users to take a decision how to proceed and how to compensate their token owners. Up until today KAPU failed to inform their tokenholders and take measures to secure the integrity of their blockchain.  @Marc - cryptology , ARK Slack  https://steemit.com/arkecosystem/@jarunik/kapu-disclosure-announcement",False

Goose has been tinkering with computers ever since I was given a Commodore 64 to play with at a very young age. Goose is currently in the financial service sector as a risk management specialist. Richard has come from a different field being in that of mechanical engineering & estimating industry, where risk and calculated costs are always taken into account as well of profits within the area. We are both very excited about KAPU and think the archeological twist is a great one. We are proposing running 2 delegates (1-off private, 1-off public). We believe in rewarding those that are within our pool, we want to create a community within the pool where those that do vote for us can approach us if they have any queries as we look to improve the culture as a whole for those new to the DPoS world. You can reach either of us on slack @goose or @riichard if you have any questions about our proposal OUR PROPOSAL We are proposing running 2 delegate nodes as follows:  Goose (private delegate)  -   For high balance wallets (>15k) -   Weekly payout (until script automation then daily) -   Initial 20% share rate which will go up as KAPU price does -   Looking for 2-25 voters (>25 go on waitlist) to maintain good dilution rate -   Initial fidelity of 7 days to prevent pool hopping (will reduce to 24 hours after daily distributions start) -   No min/max payment, tx fees covered  Duck (public delegate)  -   All wallets welcome especially small ones -   Weekly payout -   Fidelity of 7 days to prevent pool hopping -   Initial 20% share rate which will go up as KAPU price does -   Will only distribute rewards to wallets up to 15K (over 15k only get rewards on 15k balance) to be fair to small wallets -   No min payment, tx fees covered In addition, we will be reserving 2.5% of forged rewards from each delegate (5% collectively) and are planning to build a KAPU faucet to spread the KAPU love far and wide both within and outside the community to get the word out. It is currently in process of being developed but we hope to make ~42 KAPU a day available for anyone that wants KAPU. Other Details: NETWORK SETUP We plan to run 3 nodes (2 mainnet, 1 devnet).

DPOS leverages the power of stakeholder approval voting to resolve consensus issues in a fair and democratic way unlike Proof of Stakeholder (POS) which incentivizes large coin holders to stake their balance, yet it is not necessarily beneficial to smaller coin holders. Since the staking rewards are based on network “weight”, anyone with a small balance will often see less “stake rewards” compared to those with much larger holdings. It is not necessarily the fairest way of distributing staking rewards by any means. So in conclusion the DPOS is a better model which this project would employ.

It is a variant of the Proof of Stake system, which itself was developed in order to reduce the cost and inefficient electricity usage associated with Proof of Work systems such as the one used by Bitcoin. The DPOS method, developed by Daniel Larimer and implemented for the first time by the Bitshares blockchain, diverge from the POS system. The difference between a POS system and a DPOS system is that POS involves the participation of the entire network to validate a transaction whereas DPOS involves only a limit number of delegates. These delegates perform the function of validating transactions, maintaining the blockchain and take the transaction fees as profit. KAPU Whitepaper VI Within this transaction validation system, each delegate receives a reward in KAPU token, in the form of transaction fee, in order to cover the operating costs needed to keep in efficiency conditions forgetting nodes (to which transaction verification is delegated) as well as maintaining the KAPU network in safe conditions. If delegates should conduct their job incorrectly or take advantage of their own authority, the votes may be revoked by voters and assigned to a new delegate. This system can guarantee the security of the network within a representative democratic logic. Unlike other DPOS systems, the KAPU network is composed of 51 delegates. The decision to assign the transaction validation to only 51 delegates was taken in order to allow us to guarantee a fast, efficient and stable network with an incredible time limit of 8 seconds per block. The KAPU DPOS based system is essential, safe and also compatible with energy saving. The KAPU project is also inspired by some innovators in this field like LISK, SHIFT, ARK in order to create the first archaeological blockchain and to gather information about history, finds, ancient artefacts and finally make them usable by the entire community.  I hope that ghost information is clear to me to understand how DPOS works.  Team KAPU",False

The Kapu coin is a fork of Ark, the dev Kiashaan is actually getting help from the Ark team to set up and make sure everything is ok ready for launch.  testnet is running is you would like to take a closer look.  The coin has been in development for months, if you had been on the ark slack testnet channel for the last few months you would have seen Kiashaan asking the Ark main dev Fixcrypt for help to set up the token.  I am not a dev/part of the team of Kapu.  I am however a member of the testnet for the coin and I think it has a future in the crypto world.",False
