During this stage, we will offer a 30% discount for our early supporters""   Hopefully, I understood the whitepaper correctly the first 30.000 tokens will be sold with 30% discount which means the first 210 ETH ($88.500) investments will have a discount. Then It seems that the other 30.000 tokens will be sold for 0.01 ETH each (300 ETH), which means $4.22 each which makes a total maximal goal of ($126.6k+$88.5k=$215.100). Total tokens sold are only 60.000, so the very limited supply makes the price higher of a token.  Suggestions for ByteBet:  * Spend more on marketing and explanation of the concept * Start making a more detailed roadmap * More information on total supply and price in pre-sale/ICO * Exchange list is maybe a bit late 2018Q2 * Find advisors and increase the size of the team * People need to be able to feel safe when they place a bet (transparency and information is important to add on the website)  Looking forward to the Alpha version in 2018Q1!",False

Problem In the original gambling model, players bet against the house where a high house edge is applied on every single bet the players make. No matter if the player wins or loses, the house edge is always applied, making it much harder not to lose money in the long run. The middleman's only intention is to make sure players play as many times as possible and lose their funds in the long-term, providing a steady income for the gambling site owners..  Benefits Low betting fees: by using blockchain technology fees can be decreased, leaving more money for the players. Reward system: 50% of the fees are shared between active community members and BBET token holders. Peer-to-peer: players bet against each other, not against the house. Customizable bets: players can create their own fully-customized bets and publish them on the platform.  How it works This flowchart explains how ByteBet works: https://imgur.com/p3B5f6w Learn more in the whitepaper: https://byte.bet/  Fee model Betting fees are kept low and maximum 1.5% fee levied on the winner‚Äôs prize. 50% of this fee is shared with the community members.

About ByteBet token (it‚Äôs not just for gamblers!) A ByteBet token (BBET) is used as a core element on ByteBet‚Äôs decentralized platform. A BBET token is a standard ERC-20 token created on the Ethereum network. This means all the infrastructure is already provided to store and transfer BBET tokens. Creating and joining games is only possible by using BBET tokens. Winners receive their prize in BBET tokens and also rewards are paid in BBET tokens.  Members who take part in verifying events receive a portion from the fees. Holding ByteBet tokens also entitles players to receive a share from the fees depending on their stake.  About the core team The core team members have been working together for more than three years. The ByteBet team also consists of freelancers who are helping us with design and development-related activities.

Gambling in a way that users bet against each other is different from the current betting websites I know of and would it would be nice to experience this new way of gambling. I just have to see where it is going with respect to the result of each bet and whether it will be possible to place so many bets at one time, say for example a weekend where more people use gambling sites to bet on sport events, if it is still possible to check whether all bets are valid and if the community is acting in a fair way to provide 100% true outcomes.  The cool things about ByteBet is that they will pay all coinholders, I would see this as a dividend for people that hold the coin in their wallet. In the white paper it stated that 0.25% of the fees paid on creating a bet will be redistributed to people that own the coin in the portfolio. By holding the coin you will receive ByteBet coins if someone is using them on the ByteBet platform. Moreover the fees paid, the people that help verify the created bet will also be rewarded with 0.5% of the total bet placed which is an argument that the community will act in a fair way in order to receive some ByteBet coins!  Besides, all betting sites I know of are making huge profits today and their revenues are still increasing. You may have heard that there are already a few betting websites that make use of cryptocurrency right now, I would say that this one is quite different and is not focusing on the huge profits but more on its users itself, let's say its community. It is the same as the other altcoins in the market but adding this unique feature which might turn out to be a very interesting way of gambling between people. However there is no real evidence that this way of gambling works, I would still invest some money into this project to see whether it works and to see if this can become a game changing gambling platform.  I do see potential in the idea of this gambling site and am looking forward to see where things are going, only point that I think will be hard to implement is all the technology to get everything exactly right the way it is supposed to without any errors. These errors can occur because it is a new concept which has not yet been tested, so I am only a bit scared that people might gain an advantage by something where ByteBet is not thinking about right now. However, we can only know whether there is any error when the platform is running.  The team is also looking a bit small to me, they say that they are making use of freelancers to get things done. I would say that ByteBet should increase its team in order to make the concept more trustworthy. However, I think that a team of 2 + freelancers has a possibility to lead to succes, other investors might want to see a bigger team and maybe advisors before putting some money into a project like this!  Let me know if I am missing anything on this forum please and Good Luck to this project!    ",False
