I have a wallet on MyEtherWallet, and would like to purchase some Sirin tokens. I know a website where I can buy them easily, so that's no problem, but how does this work? If I just enter my wallet address, will the tokens show up immediately? I noticed there is an 'add tokens' option in MyEtherWallet with a 'SRN' that can be selected. I have tried clicking on that but nothing happens other than that it 'loads'. However, if I go to add tokens again, I can load it again (as though I haven't yet). What does this mean? Is the 'SRN' of the Sirin tokens? And will my tokens show up in my wallet once I purchase them? Would love to get some advice on this, and am also curious about your expectations for this token. Also, if someone would like to explain the benefit of tokens in general to me, that would be much appreciated. It almost seems like too easy a way of creating new cryptocurrencies. What is the added value? Is every token like a subbranch of Ethereum, where one may create one at will? And, if so, what is the added value? (I know, I'm quite a noob.)

Each token went from 50c to $3.50 in a month. I got in at $2.50 and I thought that was good. But what I've seen now, is that ALL of their 500mil tokens are on the market, which means IF I'm right (hopefully I'm not and I'll be happy to be corrected), is that they flooded the market with 400mil tokens, diluting value and cutting the price off at the knees gown to 1/11th of what it was (currently, and it will drop much more IMO).  And I fully agree its going down to 10c price, and I'm going to back the truck up because then they will start pumping it like crazy, and say ""look, we've gone up 30 times (say it goes back to $3 for example), we're awesome!!

It is a deposit of 50 SRN required to pre-order a Finney. If you pre-order it in February  you will get a 10% discount on the price.   The price of the phone is set at the equivalent to ~$999USD, payable in SRN. When the phone is released, the price in SRN will be dictated by the exchange rate then, not now. You pay a pre-order deposit of 50 SRN.   When the phone is released, if 50SRN<$999USD, there will be a balance due. If 50 SRN>$999SRN, you will get a refund on the cost of the phone. (This is excluding taxes and shipping).   If you qualified for the 10% discount, use the rate of 50 SRN:$900USD.   The only way to preorder a Finney is following this Preorder link: https://sirinlabs.com/preorder.html   Once you complete this form you will get an email with the next steps to proceed with the payment.   There will be instructions in the email you will receive from preorder@sirinlabs.com once you complete the above steps.  Note: Please do not send the preorder deposit from an exchange wallet.

I mean get over it, go on with your live and make better investments next time.  I will not sit here and cry because what happent because of STOX coin that's different issue.. But to bash the project from the start? To insult the CEO and reducing the credibility before it even started is out of my rational mind!  Y'all should be ashamed of yourselves to come here and talk shit! Maybe start with looking into the mirror and ask yourself .. what did you have done wrong in the past? Do other people also still critizise you on future projects you make?  When you did you first job or employment.. You did few things wrong didn't you? Are people still critizising you about that? All your people complaining and whining that's what you like to do! Because you cannot deal with your own incompetence..  Bring a solution to the table? Bring alternative?? Start your own business or ICO show me what you are made of?  I know one thing for sure if STOX did take off and made you money you all be quiet and didn't open your mouth.. you are just bitter and mad because you've lost money.. Well that's life you lose some and you win some!  Give this ICO and company a chance to prove you wrong.. And don't be pointing fingers because you really have 0.0% clue what this business is made off...  This is a high quality team member with high sophisticated intelligence with years of field experience.. Please let me ask you to show me your experiences, your graduates etcetera?  I didn't see any good comments made here or proven arguments ?? Only the negative things.. well everybody can do that to another human being.. Only tell the negative things but that way you cannot have a clear vision on somebody or some team.  You guys can all see what's in front of you but cannot reveal what's behind the scenes...  So please do me a favor, if you don't like this project or team or CEO.. Just leave, go invest in something else and If you don't like it let it be so.. I respect your opinion and i'm adult enough to know when to be quiet and when to speak.  You aren't helping anybody here and aren't contributing a thing here.. Well I suggest be productive with your lives...  Are you the beings that are going to bash anything that's wrong in this world??? I don't think so  We all are here to make better solution and products for the world and have a better world ready for our childeren ... out of love and compassion.. If you want to see a better world and see your kids grow up in a nicer place than you have... be a role model and be the change you wanna see..  Well I can speak out of experience, life beats you down a lot and throws everything in your face, will test you for your blood..

And the most important: we are pushing towards an open developer community where developers and device vendors adopt our OS and SDK and create more devices and apps that runs Shield OS and use the SRN token. these apps can implement P2P micropayments, resource sharing, and more. in addition, we will have few of the best d-apps in the market like status and stox adopt our SDK and come preloaded on FINNEY. these apps will enjoy one of the most important features of the SDK  - seamless token conversion between other tokens to there own token. here is Stox announcement about our cooperation: https://medium.com/@stoxhq/stox-and-sirin-labs-announce-partnership-3c52864b9175  for more details please visit our website https://www.sirinlabs.com/ and read the white paper https://www.sirinlabs.com/media/SIRINLABS_-_White_Paper.pdf",False

I read about this earlier before the post, so I wasn't aware that the ICO hasn't been announced. A few questions:  1. What if you bought $999 of SRN tokens and then when the phone comes out, the tokens have dropped in value? Will you be forced to buy more SRN to buy the phone? Will this not encourage people to just wait for the phone to come out, and then buy SRN tokens with $999 and buy the phone? 2. The money will be credited daily to phone owners or SRN buyers?

We anticipate the value of the SRN token to increase significantly over the coming months up until the FINNEY' release. Of course, there is no guarantee that this will happen. The quantity of SRN needed to buy the phone will be determined by its market price. We think the price will increase for a number of reasons. The SRN token has multiple applications and powers the whole SIRIN LABS ecosystem, including usage in the Dapps store. We have an incredibly strong team (40+ people) and partners, and have already delivered a high quality product in the 'SOLARIN'. We believe FINNEY will connect the mainstream consumer to the blockchain economy and help enable mass adoption of cryptocurrency, FINNEY will be the bridge.  2. There will be an allocation of SRN tokens for the activation of your FINNEY cold wallet - there will be a daily pool of SRN tokens allocated for 'activation of cold wallets' that will be distributed between the number of wallets activated on that particular day.  Hope that helps!",False

WHAT IS FINNEY™? The current generation of smart devices compromises on user security. The focus is overwhelmingly on user experience, at a huge cost in fraud and cybercrime. We believe the digital economy of the future cannot tolerate this trade-off: device architecture demands a paradigm shift that enables true security while maintaining excellent user experience.  FINNEY™ devices are the first cyber-protected, blockchain-enabled mobile phone and PC. They enjoy the functionality of Android™ OS, plus a suite of cybersecurity technologies, giving users safe, reliable access to the blockchain.  FINNEY™ devices form an independent blockchain network, a distributed ledger both scalable and lightweight, powered by IOTA’s Tangle technology and SIRIN LABS’ security ecosystem. FINNEY™ is free from centralized backbones and mining centers, capable of providing fast, fee-less and secure transactions.  FINNEY™ devices will run on SIRIN LABS’ open-source operating system, SIRIN OS™. This is designed to support inherent Blockchain applications, such as a crypto wallet, secure exchange access, encrypted communications, and a P2P resource sharing ecosystem for payment and apps, supported by the SRN token. The SRN is the FINNEY™ network’s default currency. Here are a few examples:  CONNECTIVITY Stay connected while traveling abroad, using P2P data connection sharing over FINNEY™ devices network  CPU Monetize FINNEY™ devices’ computer power while idle, sharing over the secure FINNEY™ network  POWER Running low on battery is solved, by trading battery power with another FINNEY™ user  DAY TO DAY Securely send and receive payments for services and products, using FINNEY™ fee-less transactions system  SIRIN LABS will partner with consumer electronics OEMs to promote the adoption of FINNEY™ architecture, the software platform, and the SRN currency. Both hardware and software platforms will be released as open source   The SIRIN LABS Token (SRN) The SIRIN LABS ecosystem is based on an open-source cryptographic token named SIRIN Token, whose symbol is SRN. The SRN cryptocurrency token is fractionally divisible, transferable and exchangeable. During the token sale, the SRN Token is implemented as an ERC-20 compatible token over the public Ethereum blockchain and will be converted to a coin on the IOTA network towards the launch.  SRN token will be available for usage and purchasing of SIRIN LABS existing products and services, as long with pre-order of future products.  Activity in the SIRIN LABS ecosystem is exclusively performed using the SRN token, making it an integral part of FINNEY™ devices use and economy.

Hmmm what about the power?   Battery power can be bought using SIRIN token? As in the power that make the device work? Also, is this an upgraded version of the Solarin android phone that costs $14k - $16k ?

To Answer some of the questions you raised:  The main idea beyond a secure smartphone with a built-in wallet and a token is Shield OS.  Shield OS is Sirin Lab's open source extension framework to Android, our goal is that Shield OS will be adopted by more device manufacturers (FINNEY is a showcase) and reach the mass market.  Shield OS comes with SDK that gives device manufacturers and the developers community the power to build apps that make use of the decentralized world capabilities: Sirin decentralized fee less network, fast micropayments, cold wallet access, resource sharing services and the SRN token infrastructure.  Developers can develop apps that do micropayments for services like mobile data, local mobile data instead of roaming, wifi, also services that are not related to mobile resource share, like: location-based advertisement in exchange to SRNs.  mine while idle - this is actually an implementation suggestion, a developer can create an app that makes use of the Shield OS SDK to share computing resources while idle in exchange for SRNs  power - yes, the example we gave about power was sharing smartphone battery power, this will require a cable connection between the devices, and again its one example of using the SDK capabilities.   I will be happy to answer more questions on our technical aspects.   Thank you! ",False
