World's first decentralized VR platform!,"   First and foremost, ICO is a great way to make more people buy the tokens not just for the speculations but also for using them at the platform as it is meant to be. Marketing our ICO will help us to raise the awareness of the existence of our platform among the VR users as well. We believe this will give us a good kickstart as there will be those VR enthusiasts who will buy the tokens to start working with the platform right away. Secondly, we would like our platform to be as much decentralized as it is possible- we believe that people should be free to choose what they want to film, share, broadcast and advertise. Every single large investor who approached us before was trying to offer to implement some sort of control and introduce certain rules on the platform which would help them to accumulate more profit ( e.g- making users show the investors adds, introduce various broadcast costs for different types of content etc). We don’t want Prosense Live to become a second youtube. So, to summarize, we have the tech, we have the concent, we have specialists, we have the experience: we would like to share it not just to sell it. This is why our platform will be different. Whoever will get the tokens will run their own show. By selling tokens we get users and this is most important for us. Hope you got the idea",False

Please note: there is NO BOUNTY PROGRAM    About Prosense  Prosense is a working business with an already existing highly functional platform for filming, transporting and viewing professional VR broadcasts. We have more than three years of experience in VR content production and technology development. Prosense transforms the technology of centralized content delivery into a global decentralized peer-to-peer platform with a payment collection system in which intellectual property rights are protected by blockchain cryptography and all transactions are confidential.  ProsenseLive Platform  The platform allows any manufacturer of VR-content, whether it is a professional studio or amateur enthusiast, to deliver content to viewers in real time. Encryption, transcoding and delivery of content are carried out by a decentralized network of Prosense Nodes partners who are reimbursed with tokens. Copyright protection and payments to content providers are guaranteed and robustly protected through the use of blockchain technology. The ProsenseView application, adapted for all common types of VR equipment, allows you to participate in breathtaking adventures: gain new experiences while moving around in the broadcast (e.g. watch a goal being scored from the position of the goalie), see and discuss what is happening with your friends, and create your own virtual space and avatars.      The ProsenseLive platform is used for both professional and amateur VR content: online broadcasts of sporting events, concerts, shows, conferences, amateur events or adult content. The quality of the technology used for live VR broadcasts from Prosense gives you the illusion of presence and allows you to participate in breathtaking adventures from the comfort of your home.          Escrow All funds received during the ICO will be stored in a secure Escrow account provided by Blockchain Law Group. The funds will be transferred to Prosense only after all the obligations to the buyers of our tokens are fulfilled.
