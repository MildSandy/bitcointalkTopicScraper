To join the queue, please get your wallet verified according to instructions here: https://medium.com/@wabiico/how-to-join-the-verified-wabi-holder-discussion-telegram-channel-de891073e6ab  After you‚Äôve verified your wallet address, please fill out the following Google form: https://docs.google.com/forms/u/3/d/1qJXlx3VYPrbB-915nKkSvzie14FUffpP_b0da2M2mUg/  Once you‚Äôve been verified by the WaBi Holder Verification Bot and have filled in the Google form, you are automatically added to the queue!  How will I be prioritized in the queue? Position in the queue will be determined by the number of Supporter Points (SP) that you have.  How are the points calculated? SP is calculated by the amount of WaBi you hold in your registered private wallet. Every day you hold WaBi will give you SP of the same amount. The first date in calculating the points is 30th June 2018 or a date when you moved the WaBis there, whichever is later.  For instance, holding 1023 WaBi in your registered wallet will gain you 1023 SP a day. This means that in 3 days you will have 3069 SP, and will be positioned in the queue accordingly.  Where can I see my place in the queue? The queue will be published, public, and open in July. At that time, you will be able to see your position in the queue at queue.wacoin.io.  What happens if I add more WaBi into the wallet? You will gain SP daily, the total amount based on how much WaBi is in your wallet. Adding WaBi will gain you more SP on a daily basis.  What happens if I remove some WaBi from the wallet? Removing WaBi from the wallet will decrease the amount of SP you gain daily. Additionally, SP will be decreased by the amount of WaBi removed from the wallet, retroactively.  For instance, if you have 3 days of holding 1023 WaBi, you will have 3069 SP. If you remove 200 WaBi, you will only get an additional 823 SP the following day. However, you will also have 200 SP removed for every day previously participated. This means you will have (4 times 823 SP =) 3292 SP after day 4.  What if I have additional questions? You can join us at our official Telegram channel and talk directly to the team: https://t.me/wabi_ico  Alternatively, you can send an email to support@wacoin.io and we will respond as soon as possible.",False

Enhanced visibility will be vital for the WaBi project, and you can expect to see a lot more of us as we move forward. ‚Ä¢Our official WaBi Telegram group has almost 9000 members. In an effort to filter spam, FUD, and white noise posts from non-WaBi holders, we‚Äôve created a Verified WaBi Holder Discussion channel exclusive to supporters holding 50 WaBi or more. WaBi holders can gain access to this additional group through a simple verification process we will introduce in our channels this week. We will be discontinuing the Support / Business / Tech groups and replacing them with the Verified WaBi Holder Discussion channel.",False

WaBi‚Äôs Blockchain: WaBi is currently an ERC-20 token and will stay on the Ethereum Blockchain for the foreseeable future. If ETH can no longer cope with the amount of transactions, there will be a migration to an alternative, higher performance Blockchain with all coins being transferred. If ETH technology keeps improving and is able to cope with the volume of transactions we require, it is conceivable that migrating to another Blockchain won‚Äôt be necessary.  WaBi is a consumer incentivization token, rewarding consumers for purchases, scans, and other user related actions. Although our business is related to supply chain operations, we‚Äôd like to stress that WaBi is NOT a supply chain coin. WaBi‚Äôs growth potential expands far beyond Ethereum wallet users and crypto enthusiasts. Because of WaBi‚Äôs function as a loyalty token to incentivize our target demographic in China, we‚Äôre not only tapping into a market of over a billion potential users but also allowing real world usage to those with no exposure to cryptocurrency. WaBi is already being utilized by every day consumers.  Walimai‚Äôs Blockchain: Supply chain transactions through the Walimai retail channel are recorded on our own Blockchain already. Walimai‚Äôs own Blockchain has currently been running in Testnet mode for over a month, with a full migration planned over the course of the summer. There will be no Walimai supply chain coin for this Blockchain as we believe consumer incentivization and marketing is a much better use case. Unlike what is commonly believed, enterprise-grade Blockchain applications do not require coins to operate.  The Blockchain itself is based on Hyperledger software. In the interest of transparency, we‚Äôve decided against utilizing a private Blockchain. We believe that ‚Äòprivate Blockchain‚Äô is an oxymoron, and hold the openness of the Blockchain as an essential feature. Therefore, Masternodes of the Blockchain will function as auditors for transactions on the supply chain. To ensure security, we will only allow reliable auditors to run Masternodes. They will have to deposit WaBi as collateral and will be paid for their work in WaBi. Beyond this, the Walimai Masternodes will function like most other Masternodes.  Specifications for the Walimai Masternodes are being finalized and we will share them when ready. We can say you‚Äôll need a standard Linux server, a cloud based server will also suffice. https://medium.com/@wabiico/a-tale-of-2-blockchains-wabi-and-walimai-385b84db1e0d",False

We‚Äôve partnered with these shops to place our Walimai shelf and sell products protected by our labels through them. It will start with baby food that we are already selling in other stores and move into cosmetics as soon as we finish development and testing of our anti-counterfeiting labels for cosmetics packaging.  Our new partner has big plan for us. They believe in our potential so much that they will organise a special product launch conference some time after the Chinese New Year when everything is fully operational. They believe with baby food and cosmetics products they will grow into a leading position in the region.  https://medium.com/@wabiico/chain-of-stores-in-west-of-china-signed-up-15687451ce18",False

On the whitepaper it says that the users work as miner by scanning and verifying the products. But they have failed to elaborate on that. My understanding is by scanning the product users are timestamping and updating the Geolocation  of a certain product. So basically the users are kind of verifying the manufacturers claim. But the whole purpose and use of 'block-chain' is rather abstract! On the flip-side, speaking from experience, almost all the Asian projects are notorious for ambiguity at the beginning.

Could you clarify something for me?  The whitepaper says:  a) Up to 10.000.000 will be sold at the preICO at 0.03 USD/coin price. Funds will be used to launch the ICO. Up to an additional 1.000.000 coins will be distributed through the bounty program. b) Up to 40.000.000 will be distributed at the ICO stage in November 2017. 80% sold to ICO contributors, 20% distributed among the team and bounties. Funds will be used to grow sales in baby stores, add more product categories (such as alcohol) and set up the WaBi Project blockchain based, remotely hosted loyalty system. c) The remaining coins (49.000.000 if all 10.000.000 are sold at the preICO, 1.000.000 are distributed as bounties at the preICO round and 40.000.000 are sold during ICO stage) will be reserved to be delivered to consumers through the mining process. Consumers will receive coins by purchasing Walimai protected products and participating in other activities. These 49.000.000 will be held in an escrow. A merchant (seller of products protected by Walimai technology) will be entitled to release WaBi coins equivalent of 5% worth of quarterly increase in sales of his products, from the escrow into circulation by distributing these coins among the customers in the form of rewards and discounts. These coins can not be sold by merchants at an exchange.  a)   3.700.000 tokens were sold, 6.300.000 remaining b)   80% out of 40.000.000 is 32.000.000 ‚Äì crowdsale, 8.000.000 distribution among team members and partners. c)   Remaining coins ‚Äì 49.000.000 (+6.300.000 not sold during the pre-sale).  So, if I understand correctly, max of 32 mln coins can be sold during the crowdsale.   In their last Telegram post Wabi guys say:  Tokens price: We sell WaBi tokens at 0.25 USD per token (the higher end of the range we announced previously). This will give us around 11.5m USD raised (after accounting for ~50% preWaBi buyback).  11.500.000/0.25= 46.000.000 At least 46m tokens must be sold during the crowdsale if you don‚Äôt account for the buyback. How do you come up with this number of tokens? If you include 6.3m unsold pre-ico tokens and 8m that are meant for the team and the partners, then it‚Äôs 46m indeed. But does this really correspond with what‚Äôs laid out in the whitepaper? In my understanding ‚Äúup to‚Äù means ‚Äúno more than‚Äù. Could the team elaborate on this, please?",False

There are no exceptions. Even wildly popular ICOs like AirSwap and Request Network are now below ICO price because of this. Less popular ICOs are almost 50-70% below ICO price now. Wabi gave presale investors almost 850% discount (3 cents pre-sale vs 25 cents ICO). I leave it to you to guess what will happen when this token hits the exchanges.  2) This is not a very popular ICO. There is almost no hype around this project, so you will have a really difficult time finding buyers for this token and also 99% chance this won't be listed on any major exchange.  3) Don't be fooled by pre-sale investors claiming they believe in this project and will buy more at the ICO. This is a common con used by people to lure unsuspecting buyers into buying a token at hyper-inflated prices because they need buyers to dump on afterall.  4) The Walimai app this company is building the project around hardly has any reviews or ratings or downloads on the Google Play Store. So it's not a proven business as they claim to be.  Only invest in this ICO if:  1) They agree to lock up all pre-sale investor tokens for 3-6 months without exceptions.  or  2) They agree to reduce the ICO price to 3 cents which should make it a level playing field for everyone.  Lastly, I would like to end by saying that it is upto each and every one of us to demand higher standards from ICOs. If we continue to support ICOs that screw ICO investors by giving presale investors discounts, we will continue to take losses and investing itself will become non-viable. My advice is to wait for the token on the exchanges. You will most certainly be able to purchase it at 5-10 cents as opposed to 25 cents.",False

Exchanges do not have KYCs and, as noted in our whitepaper, we explicitly excluded certain nationalities for ICO participation, in addition to people who would not want to go through the KYC process.  3. Aside from the ICO, we are a rapidly growing company with constant business developments.

Hey everyone at Bitcointalk!  - We have launched our offline terminals in 3 baby stores in China last Sunday, so Walimai protected milk formula is currently being sold both offline and online.  - Our team is growing and we now have dedicated community managers as well as a highly experienced marketing director. We have been branded a ‚Äòhidden ICO‚Äô by some reviewers, however, our major marketing activities will start within the next 2 or 3 weeks. We are expecting the channels to become much more lively.  - At the moment we are finalising the ICO participation model. As we stated previously, we think that the current ‚ÄòBlack Friday at Walmart‚Äô model is terribly resource-inefficient, favours all sorts of sea mammals, and leaves the bulk of people unhappy. We are also not big fans of forced rationing. Therefore, we are finalising a system which hopefully can eschew most of these ailments. We shall be publishing a demo-version in the next few days so that everyone here can practice and get familiar with.  - We realise that currently the regulatory environment has been somewhat turbulent and a lot of people wonder how are we being affected.   - Firstly, to reconfirm, we are in full ICO preparation mode at the moment. The ICO goes ahead. You shall be seeing a lot more updates both here and elsewhere over the coming few weeks.   - Secondly, the China Ban. Just wanted to reiterate that it does not affect us directly, as we are running the ICO out of Singapore. We were bound to introduce a few changes to the Wabi circulation rules when it comes to China. However, once again, neither the business model nor the token model has been affected in a major way. We shall be publishing an updated Whitepaper soon, where these special provisions are presented in a more detailed manner.   - Finally, we wanted to tentatively designate November 7th as the ICO start date, subject to final confirmation. We realise that it is a bit later than we originally envisaged, however, due to the regulatory changes were compelled to move it. We are confident that this date leaves us enough time to step up our marketing efforts and to raise awareness to a sufficient degree to make our ICO a success.  - Last but not least, we welcome any feedback you might have.  Yas, Alex, and the Wabi Team  Beyond the message, we'll be providing everyone with the latest info when we update the wacoin.io website later this week  Please let me know if you have any questions!",False

We were bound to introduce a few changes to the WaBi circulation rules when it comes to China. However, neither the business model nor the token model has been affected in a major way. We shall be publishing an updated Whitepaper soon, where these special provisions are presented in a more detailed manner.    Quote from: elelegzet on October 01, 2017, 08:59:13 AM Hmmm... Seeems like a promising concept. Looks like a gem in a pile of garbage for me. Will follow it.  Thank you. It's more than a concept at this point.

Some people will probably sell tokens as they hit the exchanges. But keep in mind:  1. We sold 20% of circulating supply (10% of total) at the preICO to raise money to run the actual ICO.  2. Assuming half of those coins are sold on exchange quickly after the ICO - it is 10% of the circulating supply.  3. That would push the price down, we don‚Äôt know by how much, maybe around 10% but it depends on a lot of other factors.  4. 10% price volatility in crypto is a daily thing. It‚Äôs noise.  The above argument is not 100% rigorous but helps to put things into perspective.  We would also encourage people to think of the unmet demand that will be filled at the exchange: a lot of people will not pass our KYC (some countries restricted for the initial sale, some people will not be able to provide the right documents, etc). They will probably try to get the tokens at the exchange.  Most importantly, we would encourage people to look at the project long-term, not based on the first few days when it‚Äôs on the exchange.",False

We realise that such alteration in the middle of the fundraising round is far from ideal and we understand that you may want to reconsider your decision to contribute based on the new information, therefore we are offering a full refund for every contributor who is not happy with the change in the structure of the Wabi token, returning 100% of the funds in the same currency as well as reasonable transaction fees.  Before we fix the new model Yaroslav and myself will speak to our community in Slack, Telegram as well as inform every contributor via registered email in order to answer potential questions and collect feedback. We find the conversations we‚Äôve had so far with our community extremely valuable and often eye opening. Thus, in the coming few days we shall be fine-tuning the model based on the feedback we receive. We plan to fix the new model on Monday 14th August after incorporating your feedback.  Reasons for the change: 1.    With clarification by the Singaporean authorities our previous model of the Wabi token would almost certainly be considered a security. This creates significant risks for the project, our investors as well as ourselves. 2.    The feedback that we received so far was overwhelmingly in favour of us not limiting ourselves to the baby-store model and, instead, positioning it like an open platform with different channels, products and regions. Although this may increase the complexity of the project, in the long run we believe it has a far greater potential.  New WaBi (ËõôÂ∏Å) model:  1.    WaBi (ËõôÂ∏Å) coin will be structured as a crypto-token that can be used to purchase Walimai protected products (in some way similar to loyalty programme points). This includes not only baby food, but also alcohol, cosmetics or any other products we plan to protect with our technology.   In terms of geography it will start in China but will expand to other regions as well, even though exact timing it‚Äôs hard to predict at this stage.   This will also not be limited to products that we sell ourselves: we plan to add other companies to the platform (this was always part of the overall Walimai plan). These companies will join the Wabi rewards system as well.  2.    We will encourage the use of the Wabi tokens in several ways: a) We will setup a seamless user interface. An Example: https://cldup.com/ciIWwsikEO.png (215kB)  b) Allow users to ‚Äúmine‚Äù tokens with a proof of purchase. Basically, buyers of products protected by Walimai technology will receive some initial coins when they start buying. We are reserving some coins at the ICO specifically for that.  c) Get overall better terms. This may include discounts, special offers etc., discounted purchases of WaBi (ËõôÂ∏Å) coins etc.  New coin parameters: 1.Total supply of WaBi (ËõôÂ∏Å) will be limited at 100.000.000. With the following split: a) Up to 10.000.000 will be sold at the preICO at 0.03 USD/coin price. Funds will be used to launch the ICO. Up to additional 1.000.000 coins will be distributed through the bounty programme.  b) Up to 40.000.000 will be distributed at the ICO stage in September/October 2017. 80% sold for 0.15-0.25 USD/coin, 20% distributed among the team, bounties, founders. Funds will be used to grow sales in baby stores, add more product categories (such as alcohol and cosmetics) and set up a seamless WaBi usage process for consumers.  c) The remaining coins (49.000.000 if all 10.000.000 are sold at the preICO, 1.000.000 are distributed as bounties at the preICO round and 40.000.000 are sold during the ICO stage) will be reserved to be delivered to consumers through the mining process. Consumers will receive coins by purchasing Walimai protected products and participating in other activities. These 49.000.000 will be held in an escrow. A merchant (seller of products protected by Walimai technology) will be entitled to release WaBi coins equivalent of 5% worth of quarterly increase in sales of his products, from the escrow into the circulation by distributing these coins among the customers in the form of rewards and discounts. These coins can not be sold by merchants at an exchange.  Here is an example explaining point (c): merchant H sells cosmetics with Walimai protection, H used to sell 1m USD/month of cosmetics and grew sales to 1.3m USD over a quarter. Suppose, at the same time the price of WaBi at an exchange is 10 USD. H will then be eligible to distribute (1.3m-1m)*5%/10=1500 WaBi to it‚Äôs current or future buyers. And all of these WaBi have to be used by the merchant to encourage the use of WaBi and acquire additional users. These coins will be kept in several escrows for security.  2. We will get listed on exchanges after the ICO as planned before.  Why we believe WaBi tokens will be a success:  1.    Natural demand for the token. As it will be used within the loyalty system there will be a growing non-speculative transaction volume that will back the token circulation and ensure user adoption  2.    Large underlaying market. It‚Äôs not just baby stores now. It‚Äôs baby food, cosmetics, alcohol or other products that would be protected with Walimai label. And not only our own sales but sales of future partners: producers, distributors etc. 3.    Real customer benefit and seamless utilisation process. As a blockchain based loyalty system it will be much more advanced to whatever is currently available on China‚Äôs market.  Next steps for you: 1.    You should make the decision if you wish to remain or withdraw from the project. It will be possible to withdraw until the end of Sunday 20th August London time. 2.    If you decide to continue participating - nothing needs to be done. At the end of preICO we will exchange preWabi tokens that were already purchased to WaBi not at the 1:2 rate but at 1:34 rate, reflecting the 1 USD price of preWabi and 0.03 price of WaBi. 3.    If you decide to withdraw - let us know via an email to alex@wacoin.io. Please, use the same email that you‚Äôve used to register at wacoin.io. We will ask you to send the preWabi tokens back if you already received them. And process the refund within 24 hours after receiving them back.  We hope you will give this a good considerations. We have updated the website and WP (all available at www.wacoin.io) to further describe the new approach. We are happy to answer any questions you might have.  Also, we plan to extend the preICO by two weeks. Working on the new model we could not really take care of the marketing well enough. These additional two weeks will enable us to collect more at the preICO but will not delay ICO or exchange listing because we will already start to prepare for the ICO itself.

Please, see below: Main preICO terms PreICO and ICO ‚Ä¢ We will run this in two stages: first preICO, then ICO itself. PreICO will enable use to put together an ICO that is adequate to the size of the project and opportunity.  PreICO ‚Ä¢ Timing: start on 28th July at 17.00 Shanghai time and run for 21 days or until reaching maximum amount of 300k USD equivalent ‚Ä¢ Minimum and maximum amounts are 30k USD and 300k USD equivalent. If we don‚Äôt reach 30k, the contributions will be returned. The preICO will be closed if/when we receive 300k USD equivalent in contributions ‚Ä¢ Token: token is called preWaBi. Each preWaBi will be sold at 1 USD equivalent during the preICO. Each preWaBi will be converted into 2 WaBi at the end of main ICO ‚Ä¢ Token parameters: ERC20 token standard, 330.000 issued at the beginning of preICO. 10% of tokens on top of whatever is bought by contributors will be distributed as bounties. PreWaBi tokens not distributed to contributors or as bounties will be destroyed. No tokens will be distributed among founders or the team. E.g. if we receive 100k in contributions, 100.000 tokens will be distributed to contributors, 10.000 tokens will be distributed as bounties. The remaining 220.000 tokens will be destroyed. ‚Ä¢ Our preICO wallet will be secured with 2 out of 3 signature payments requirement, signatures will be held by founders and a team member. We are not securing it with a 3rd party due to relatively small amount of the raise. ICO wallet will be secured by 3rd party escrow. ‚Ä¢ Accepted currencies: BTC, ETH, LTC . ‚Ä¢ Once minimum amount is reached (30.000 USD equivalent) we will start converting into fiat currency to avoid fluctuation risk as most of the expenditures to run the full ICO will be in fiat currencies. ‚Ä¢ The amount of preWaBi delivered to contributors will be fixed at current exchange rates at the time when we receive the payment but delivery of preWaBi will be done at the end of preICO. ‚Ä¢ PreICO token code can be examined at (link to Github will be added later)  ICO ‚Ä¢ Important to note that we are still in discussion with lawyers on some of the parameters of the ICO. Hence it is possible that some of the ICO terms may change even after the preICO. At the same time will do our best to try and change it as little as possible as well as to protect the interests of our contributors and ensure they are not coming out worse off with whatever change of the below parameters. ‚Ä¢ Timing: start in August or September, will last for 30-60 days or until reaching maximum amount ‚Ä¢ Minimum and maximum amounts are 500k USD and 30m USD equivalent ‚Ä¢ Token: token is called WaBi (ËõôÂ∏Å). Each WaBi will be sold at 1 USD equivalent during the ICO ‚Ä¢ Token benefits: the collected contributions will be used to build sales network of products with Walimai labels through baby shops in China. Products will be sold at a 5-25% margin because of additional security, 60% of the profits made will be distributed to WaBi token holders (subject to taxes) every year. Will will distribute the profits in one of the following ways: a) buying back WaBi tokens at an exchange b) direct transfers to all of the WaBi token holders. For more detailed explanation please see the legal setup and benefits distribution part of this document ‚Ä¢ Token parameters: ERC20 token standard, tokens will be issued only one time at the end of the ICO following the formula: amount of issued tokens=‚Äúcontributed funds‚Äù/0.7+(preWabi issued at preICO)*2. For example, if 100k USD is contributed during preICO and 7m USD is contributed during the ICO, 7m/0.7+100k*2=10.200.000 WaBi tokens will be issued. 7.000.000 tokens will be distributed among the contributors, 3.000.000 will be distributed as bounties, team and founders compensation and 200.000 will be used for conversion from preWaBi into WaBi. ‚Ä¢ Some of the WaBi tokens may be sold at a discount during ICO, e.g. with a discount for early contributors, in this case we will use the nominal value (1 USD) for the above calculation. ‚Ä¢ Given the parameters outlined above, the maximum amount of WaBi tokens can reach 30m/0.7+300k*2=43.457.143 ‚Ä¢ Our ICO wallet will be secured with multi signature account involving 3rd party escrow. More details will be announced closer to the ICO ‚Ä¢ Accepted currencies: BTC, ETH, LTC",False

Good technology is not enough here, it's important to get people (who are generally not that tech-savvy) to start using the technology. That's why we are starting with baby food segment. Mother really care about the safety of the food, especially after all of the scandals. And in smaller cities (like Jiaxing, Hefei, Jiaozuo etc) there are not many options to buy baby food and feel safe, unlike in Shanghai where you can go to an expensive City supermarket and can be reasonably sure what you are buying is not fake.  Getting mothers/fathers to use this on baby formula is only the first step. Next it would be to add other products/segments like alcohol and pharmaceuticals. And, because doing the project with baby food is profitable, it will give us enough momentum to raise funds (investors will love to see profitability in the baby food segment) and make it successful in other segments as well.",False
