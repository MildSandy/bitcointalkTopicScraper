In a spur of the moment discussion, the NVO team went back and forth over a single issue that never really sat well with us since the NVO refund. The issue was that the refund was only a PARTIAL REFUND, leaving 55% of funds unreturned to the investors. It has been planned to refund the remaining amount, making it a FULL and TOTAL REFUND. We believe that it is only fair to make sure EVERYONE who held NVST is properly taken care of, and we simply want to do what is right by everyone, regardless of their viewpoint of us or the project. Please ensure that you still have access to your NVST tokens and make sure that you securely hold on to them. We will inform you when the time comes on what to do with them. Veserus will be providing funds for the 55% refund.  If it will be true it will be really huge thing!",False

After all, you are paid by one of the sides, you've been put as a community manager by the same person that lied to us for months and had zero grasp on the project.  Most of the claims you made come from your boss, they are empty and have zero value. Surely, they could make us think and consider the possibility of them true, but I have no reason to trust your boss that hasn't been upfront and refused transparency for a year with stupid excuses. It's sad to see a rather sensible man, yourself, be blinded by money and sweet talk. This is money speaking, this isn't truth or facts speaking until proven.  And proving such claims is extremely hard if not impossible.  I am sorry, but as far as I am concerned, anything that comes from either of the sides is full of shit.

I had a number of addresses (Electrum) and some worked while others didn't. After trial and error I figured out the common denominator: If an address has received more than one transaction (i.e. has more than one current spendable input) it would jam the xcp sweep. The solution was to send all BTC on an address to itself (collapse multiple inputs into a single). The sweep process then worked fine.,False

The total funds raised per currency: BTC: 1590.919664 LTC: 7807.588 XRP: 1325280.390 ETH: 6477.095 MAID: 765482 DASH: 1916.643 WAVES: 31145.630 DOGE: 23577240.970 ETC: 4126.090  Conversion rates per currency into BTC*: BTC: 1 LTC: 0.01688190 XRP: 0.00010822 ETH: 0.12242700 MAID: 0.00019581 DASH: 0.07139310 WAVES: 0.00167559 DOGE: 0.00000109 ETC: 0.00760768  Total BTC raised (at these exchange rates): 3055.120324 Total USD raised at the BTC-USD price (Bitstamp): 7790556.826  As you can see, about half of this 3055 BTC value was in altcoins that many have not been converted to BTC yet, and their value against the BTC has gone down considerably.  August 13th, 2018 conversion rate:  BTC: 1 LTC: 0.00903533  (53%) XRP: 0.00004485 (41%) ETH: 0.04612566  (38%) MAID: 0.00003805  (19%) DASH: 0.02342568  (33%) WAVES: 0.00032511 (19%) DOGE: 0.00000037 (36%) ETC: 0.00200381  (26%)  ETH alone raised about 790 BTC worth, and has declined in value so much that it is now worth only about 299 BTC.  So now we are down to ICO value at only 2564 BTC if you just look at that (But they may have converted some of the ETH for milestones so it is unclear what the actual number is).   60% of all ICO funds have been released per milestone schedule.  Which leaves 40% to be refunded to investors.  You can say 40% of 3055 is 1222 BTC but that won't be how it is done since the alt coins lost value.  The current 40% value is close to 1000 BTC.  And then there is a percentage of funds that were released for milestones that the team did not use and are included in the refund.  Escrows have done the math and told us the value of all funds to be released back to investors including unused forks is about 1400 BTC.  Now if altcoins surge in value and they do their conversions from remaining alts to BTC at that time we will have more than 1400 BTC.  If BTC starts to boom and altcoins lose their value, and they convert at that time, we may see less than 1400 BTC refund.  1400 divided by 15 million NVST tokens is .0000933 BTC per NVST refund.

The *official* timeline is as follows:  1) Thursday, August 30 - Vote closes. 2) Friday, August 31 - Snapshot[2]. 3) Saturday, September 1 - Refunds begin[3]. Notes: [1] Once I have a total transaction fee estimate, this amount will be appropriately truncated at a certain decimal. This will also be mentioned in one of the following posts. [2] The snapshot time will be random (i.e. exact time of day will not be announced) to prevent any adversary from gaming the system. Everyone is advised to remove any sell orders that you might have on the market and/or move to an appropriate wallet if necessary. If you own the private key to the address where your NVST is, then you are good to go. You, and only you, are liable in the event that you fail to adhere to adhere to this. The snapshot will be archived and a link to it will be provided to the public. [3] The amount of time for all refunds to be processed can not be estimated. I'll be available every single day until this is completed, but each transaction requires another signatory. Every transaction will be created and verified manually. There is no room for errors.  Appendix: 1) The address 1HF9qmvVz6EMu5ihjkbstpBwAVb9jdm9Lh will be excluded from the refunds. On it are unallocated tokens which can't be distributed. This issue stems from a chain of events which led to essentially what I'd call, theft of both the NVO domain and the database. The amount on it is 449,660.58536489 NVST, which represents 2.9977372357659333% of the supply. The exact percentage of the refund balance, which is 41.78678295 BTC will be set aside until a solution to this issue is found. I have decided to not let this issue delay the refund. 2) Therefore, the amount of issued tokens is 15 000 000 - 449,660.58536489 = 14 550 339.4146. The amount of BTC that will be refunded over this amount is 1,393.94415407 - 41.78678295 = 1352.15737112. This represents a rate of 0.00009292961 BTC/NVST. Example ~ refund amounts: 1k NVST -> 0.09292961 BTC. 10k NVST -> 0.9292961 BTC. 100k NVST -> 9.292961 BTC. Update: 1) Addresses that contain less than 0.1 NVST (~$0.06) will be excluded from the process as it makes no economic sense to do this. This affects about 345 addresses based on sample data (no snapshot yet), containing ~0.934 NVST. This saves about 11730 bytes of data (assuming 34 bytes per output) needed for the refund. 2) We will need at least 166 090 bytes to process this (34*4885). At 1-2 sat/byte this is 0.00166090 - 0.0033218, which means that we will truncate the amount after the reduction at the third decimal --> 1352.154 BTC. 3) Last address to be refunded is #4890. 4) Snapshot:   ",False

First, you'll need to download the zip file from https://github.com/Jpja/Sweep-XCP-Paperwallet  Unzip it and open sweep.html in your favourite web browser. You'll need to input the private key of the paper wallet. Fill in all of the other details and send them to an address that you have generated on counterwallet.io or straight to the voting address.  Note: Sweeping counterparty assets can be finicky. You'll need one larger input of at least 0.0005 bitcoins in the address that you're trying to sweep from. I found that sweeping only worked when I swept all of the bitcoins along with the tokens. This is why I would suggest sending to an address generated on counterwallet.io first, then voting from there.  The voting addresses can be found at https://medium.com/@nvoteam/vote-started-b3e37e0c1ecf  To vote for a refund, send to 17vvg1h5B5qwP2d2oz7t2GpXXpztxsmjNn  To vote for the project to continue, send to 1Caux6gNUB55cALFk1EHiRY5Eo613yuGhE  Do not sweep all of your assets to the voting address! Only NVSTVOTING tokens!  If you're not sure what you should vote for, join Discord or Telegram. Many users are having issues with censorship on Slack (which is typically full) and Telegram, so Discord is suggested for uncensored discussion.  Note: The NVO team does not regularly post on Discord, so there wouldn't typically be any first hand information there.  Telegram: https://t.me/joinchat/Ff92WUidI54g8rv2NdRr1A Discord: https://discord.gg/YvB5HXp  To view the voting results thus far, please visit https://nvo.party/vote.php  The voting should be ending some time around August 29th, although no exact deadline has been given. If you haven't voted yet, please attempt to do so ASAP in case there are any technical difficulties that you need to work through. Honestly, I'm not the most technical person so it took me quite a while to figure out how to vote from a paper wallet.

To The Moon and Back Again: NVO Success Story My journey with NVO started when I seen an NVO ICO banner ad on Coin Market Cap. I'll be honest, I didn't even read the ad... I didn't have to because the graphic of the lambo shaped rocket ship blasting off to the moon with the NVO logo was enough for me to click to see what they were about. The website was visually appealing to the eye, the design was modern, fresh and sleek, which is one of the main things I look for when investing in an ICO. After my initial website assessment, I immediately started my vigorous 128-point ICO due diligence process inspection.  Due Diligence Process I start my due diligence inspection by downloading and reviewing the white paper. While on the introduction page of the white paper my dyslexia kicked into overdrive and every sentence started and ended with word Lambo... I was immediately hooked and convinced myself this was a sign from God. However, I needed to gather more information before making any rash decisions. I gathered cold hard facts from reputable sources such as Facebook, Twitter and Youtube. My first search query and I'm already seeing the usual FUD stating NVO is a scam... I was convinced this project must be fraudulent until I discovered a link to a thread where one of the co-founders publically attacks reputable experts within the cryptosphere. I couldn't believe it! The founder of a project I'm about to throw my entire life savings at just dished out the most ultra savage verbal beatdown I've ever seen in my entire miserable life... Two words came to mind ""WORLD STAR!"" This aggregated evidence increased my risk-to-reward ratio tenfold... I was all in at that point! I didn't care that my wife, friends, co-workers and neighbors all told me it was a bad idea... hell even my dog was like ""don't do it!"" I didn't care, because I knew deep down in my heart that if there was any project that was going to take me to the moon, it was NVO.  Now that I had completed my due diligence process and calculated my risk-to-reward ratios I was ready to become an official member of the NVO community. I quickly logged into my CoinsMarkets.com account and sold off my entire portfolio of shitcoins, I had nothing to lose at this point as I was already operating in the red. Finally, I copy the NVO bitcoin address, take a deep breathe and click the send button... that's it, I did it! My entire crypto portfolio liquidated, I was now the official owner of 0.16 BTC worth of NVO... I could smell the leather interior of my future Aventador.  Fast Forward: Current State I've read a lot of your comments and I'm disgusted with all of your misinformation, fake news, false accusations and unsupported claims. You all knew before investing in this project what you were getting yourself into. It sounds to me as if none of you did any type of research prior to investing. You act as if you didn't know the core developer touts himself as being a genius autistic savant with borderline asperger's syndrome. You cannot sit there, behind your keyboards and state you didn't know he has a track record of ultra savagely not taking shit from anyone, especially those who disagree with his ideologies. Rather than bashing him for the work that he has failed to produce, you should be praising him for his savage character demeanor.  I have 100% faith in this project and I will continue to support NVO.  Oh and by the way, while you are all screaming this project is a scam, I bet you all missed out on the FREE NVST Voting Tokens that just got airdropped to all NVST token holders. Just ask yourself, if this project was exit scamming, why would they go through the hassle of issuing Voting tokens? Because, they have BIG plans in the near future and I'm going to reap all the benefits while you complainers sit behind your keyboards crying that you missed the boat to lambo town.",False

Bluelogic is fairly dead-on.  Here is what was said about the milestones:  - 30% release at the end of the crowdsale. - 30% at the delivery of the beta wallet and first API Cluster  So no matter what - the team received 30% of crowdsale funds to begin the project.  Not sure why anyone thinks they are entitled to a refund for that.  They obviously progressed and started things.  The beta wallet and API Cluster were indeed completed.  And we have even been told they still plan on completing version 1.3 which should correct most of the problems with the current versions. I was able to receive funds from 5 blockchains and send out 3 of those.  Kind of sucks but if we do get this update version 1.3 then they are cleared a bit in that regard. (NVO if you are reading this don't let me down)  So we are entitled to 40% of crowdsale proceeds.  They raised the equivalent of 3055 BTC but much of that was in alts that have crashed in BTC value since then.  Even with that, we are still receiving about 46% refund.  Which means you are making money in fiat terms, and doing better than if you put all your money in ETH and many other alts.  This doesn't excuse the performance of this team and their inability to solve internal problems.  To those of you thinking you should receive a full refund, I join you in your disappointment over the outcome of this project but not in your assessment of its expected resolution. And if any of you think the original ICO addresses should get the refund you should have your head examined.",False

With talk of voter manipulation, assertions of misappropriation of funds, one founder apparently prepared to bring a lawsuit against the other (i.e. Imed vs Ton Bi), and some investors prepared to bring this in front of European boards... I don't see (ethically/logically/etc...) how this could be left to a vote. Any sort of vote that extends this further will very likely succeed in expanding the size of the mess.  It's also worth noting that Imed has apparently published a copy of what appears to be a legal request for a prosecutor to take action against whom I presume to be Yanni. The legal request apparently alleges property theft, identity theft, and fraudulent bank accounts. Given that these are not minor allegations... decision about a vote should not hinge upon Yanni's involvement or lack thereof until such a time where he's cleared legally. My estimate is that investors would prefer not to wait for the duration of time this would take.  With the scale & pace at which government is being invited into this I could see it expanding to the point of legally ensnaring everyone (including escrows). It's been my impression that investors aren't liking the idea of having liquidity tied up in this for years while the only progress being made is to the financial benefit of lawyers. It's not even a matter of regret investing where absurd demands are being made by the investors either. Most appear happy to take their 60% haircut and move on.  That... and if a vote would win any kind of legitimate (e.g not manipulated) majority... then the founders should not be concerned by the idea of a refund. Any legitimate majority in their favor would happily reinvest after a refund proper.",False

When serious allegations arise regarding the legality of activities of internal management then all decisions resulting from those activities must either stop or be put on hold until a proper review is performed. Given that there are serious allegations levied in nearly all corners of this project at this point... I can think of no part of it which may continue as normal pursuant to the application of professional ethics.  A proper review requires the clearing of Yanni legally. It is alleged in the complaint that a computer was stolen which contained the DEX software. This makes the legal complaint of property theft relevant to this project ethically and legally. The assertions of fraud may also be relevant (i.e. we don't know at this time) and also require a proper clearing.  A proper review as mentioned above would tie up investor liquidity. All investors I've spoken to oppose the idea of their liquidity being tied up for very long.  From posts and comments I've seen there appears to be a discrepancy in how much the investors should be refunded. I propose that they be refunded the lowest undisputed amount as soon as possible with any discrepancies refunded to them at later date once the details are worked out. e.g. if everyone agrees the refund amount is at least 40% then 40% should be airdropped as soon as reasonably possible with any remainder sent once the details are settled.,False

The remaining holders can then follow Imed or Ton by vote.

Pure democracies have historically been suicidal and it's one of the reasons the US was setup as a republic with some hybrid functions of a democracy.

So...  I've talked to people that support Imed and they want a refund & freedom to reinvest. I've talked to the people that support Ton and they want a refund & freedom to reinvest. And naturally there are the people that want out completely.  This is so much so that it appears (I'm getting information second hand) Ton is actively working on a mechanism to help the escrows perform the refunds.  I have yet to meet a vested person that wants to be forced into an unpredictable direction on this... including both of the founders.  So my question would be: Why are we voting?  Wouldn't a vote only add some unpredictable risk to everyone? e.g. a person with a large holding forces everyone to support one founder who subsequently backs out of their ""refund but continue"" narrative.  What's worse is there were murmurs of airdropping new tokens to people who show their support in the vote. I haven't heard as much about it anymore... but this casts a shadow of doubt over the legitimacy of deciding this with a vote. If people are voting one way or the other out of a fear of missing out on airdropped tokens it amounts to voter manipulation. Further... it also casts some concern into the mind of voters of if their investment addresses will be singled out in the future should either co-founder be privy to which address voted for what.  It looks like even coinpayments (post on NVO reddit by Ton) has backed the idea that the only right course of action is a refund of remaining escrow.  And if all paths/parties agree on the correctness of a refund I'm unclear as to why we're bothering with a vote. It would seem to me that this would only cause unnecessary risk, confusion, and voter doubt (i.e. the risks associated with voting that I mentioned above). If there were disputes over whether refunds should happen or not I could see some sort of consensus mechanism being needed (e.g. voting) but that doesn't appear to be the case here.",False

The board of this new foundation will be made up of myself and some existing NVO community members to be named at a later date. A secondary purpose of the foundation will be to explore the possibility of filing a civil action against the CEO of this project, known here and elsewhere as Ton Bi, for his apparent misappropriation of project funds, for his lack of financial transparency as CEO of the project, and to compel him to finally commit to a full refund of investor funds as is appropriate in this situation. Of course, in the event a full refund is executed, this action would become moot. If it is ultimately determined that legal action is warranted, it will be brought on behalf and for the benefit of the previous project's NVO investors. After the foundation has been created, I will invite members of the community who wish to be part of this action to apply for membership to the board and represent their fellow NVO investors. There has been significant discussion about the current status of the DEX code, and those discussions include many false statements and accusations. For the immediate future, and to protect third parties, I will not release the code under any circumstances. If legal action is brought by the foundation against the CEO, the code and its associated history will be given to the court, under seal, as part of the evidence. As the CTO and as a co-founder of NVO, my role in the project has been to select the technology of the DEX and then produce it. That is exactly what I have been doing since the project began. Until now, I have been keeping this technology secret in order to protect the project. For the first time publicly, and only because development has already reached a point where the technology of the DEX is well established, I am willing to describe some aspects of the DEX implementation. The DEX is based on Blockstream technology, with integral support for smart contracts, sidechains, and peer-to-peer communication services to keep latency low and throughput high for each node of the network. Sidechains enable the plugin system, and smart contracts enable the trade validator. This multi-chain Blockstream-based technology is highly superior to slow and expensive atomic swap systems used in technologies such as Komodo, and was chosen at the beginning of the NVO project for its speed, flexibility, and extensibility. That is all I am willing to say on the subject of the DEX at this time. Now to the subject of the pending investor vote. Ton is the CEO and is responsible for representing the investors' best interests in all matters. Unfortunately, vote manipulation was evident in several public Telegram announcements where he promised to airdrop tokens only to people who voted in his favor. This manipulation is not in the interests of investors at all, and creates a conflict between his own interests and the interests of investor funds. Any vote that includes an option that benefits only one or the other remaining team member cannot be an option on the ballot. The only question for investors should be ""Should a refund be made or not?""  If the vote returns ""yes"", then all funds should be pooled and a snapshot should be announced at a specific future bitcoin block height to allow trading of the token to halt at that time. After the snapshot has been taken, the pooled funds should be distributed proportionally to all addresses that hold NVST as of that snapshot. If the vote returns ""no"", then the project must be completed as outlined in the crowdsale agreement. To prevent dragging this along further, I hereby call for and agree to a full refund to all investors, just as Ton has publicly stated several times in writing and on recorded calls. Because we are not being treated equally right now, we will make it equal and I will return the bitcoin that I earned and received from the milestones we have already completed, and Ton will also return all of the bitcoin he earned and received from the milestones. In addition, any coin forks that were created while the funds were in the escrow accounts will be redeemed and returned to investors as well. This method ensures investors are credited with the maximum possible amount, which is in their best interest. The only permissible alternative is to finish the project with a neutral 3rd party mediator in charge of all distributions and payments going forward, and who will be approved by both parties. Completion of the project as stated during the crowdsale is what the investors paid for, and unless the original terms of the crowdsale are followed, investors will have been defrauded, which is unacceptable to me. For the benefit of the investors, I am willing to work with a mediator as a go-between for all matters between myself and Ton, but only under the strict condition that there be full transparency and a complete audit of all funds held by the escrows, including deposits, trades, and distributions made to date, a full account of all remaining funds and their current addresses, and the status of all forked coins for the duration of the escrow accounts' lifetime. Regardless of the outcome of any investor vote or decisions by the escrows, I will continue to support the future of the DEX that I have been developing over the past year. In a matter of months, I expect the DEX testnet to be up and running, and the first public testnet trades can begin. At that time, I will announce a plan to further benefit all, I repeat, all NVST holders, regardless of how they voted (if a vote is necessary.)",False

Tonbi took ~600 BTC out of his allocated Y share. What are X/Y and how much of the paid money is left?

I have said it before that I consider myself best as a product person and a decent CEO. After this incident my own opinion has changed of myself to being very awful CEO. Along the way, I was lead to believe that a CTO should be in charge of everything in this space and not a CEO. There are certain truths to this statement as the most successful people in this space are usually developers. They tend to not need people like me managing them. Then again, no developer has ever created a popular DEX thus far. I do know the most popular desktop wallet, Exodus, was created by a team that is very strong in product design. They have taken over the older Jaxx wallet that most people was using when there weren't many alternatives.  This is my plan on how I will continue with the NVO project. When the proper vote is up, if everyone agrees on a refund then everyone will be refunded. However, for the people that voted for me to keep working, even if I don’t receive a majority vote, I will still collect your addresses and send you new tokens. You will still get your refunds and new tokens. but you will need to verify these addresses. If there is a refund, we will not work with escrowed funds and continue as usual just through a more paced out approach using personal funds.  As I have discussed on our telegram, it’s important that we set up 3 main components for this project to succeed. A centralized exchange that we will slowly grow liquidity to have it transferred to the DEX when it’s completed while the DEX and wallet are being simultaneously worked on by a different group of developers. As the CEX is already a white label solution, we will not compromise on speed or focus. The white label solution we bought is better than existing top CEXs and can be set up quickly. They were created by the people with the best reputation in this industry. Mike, my consultant, will oversee the multiple projects and it’s development process for a transparent workflow and communication between the community and developers. By transparency, I mean an update on what happens every day and what everyone worked on in full details.  This centralized exchange might deal with fiat if we struggle to find liquidity from just tokens trading pairs alone. If we struggle to compete with tokens trading alone, we will target on less popular fiat markets like Canada to grow our reputation by offering faster settlements for Bitcoin buying and selling. There will be less competition on ads space for us to get noticed by these markets. We will also receive help from another very reputable company in this space as well to help with liquidity that is also based in Canada. I will have a call to discuss with them if we can get more partnerships and OTC trading services on-board.  The wallet is one of the most important components where people will use the DEX. We will advertise the wallet on the CEX's homepage at first for desktop/offline storage of all coins traded on the exchange. We will need at least 1 more month to have something that we can be proud according to the developers that worked on them. The old wallet team were being underpaid and understaffed so if we solve these issues they will work much more faster. The wallet will also be open source and when the DEX is finished it will be advertised on the CEX as well and we will focus more on fiat there.  As for the DEX, we will hire new and existing blockchain developers on our team to brainstorm possible solutions. I will list out all the features and the priority and importance of each feature such as plugin system, minimum volume requirement, transactions per second, trading pairs and order book requirement/offline trading. A rough whitepaper will be required before the development is started and it will be shared within the community. This might take longer so we will have people coding the wallet and exchange while we are exploring DEX solutions. This will be a fun task for developers as they will be challenged to find the best solutions and original implementations to build the DEX. All good developers love working on something cool. The DEX will be also open source.  All funds spent will be updated with the community weekly or daily. This is the plan if we continue the direction without a refund after the vote. If we continue the direction with a refund we will still continue with this approach however we will pace it out over time instead of doing simultaneously tasks.  The entire project will be relaunched under a different name if we can’t get access to the current domain name. Even with access, we may also relaunch under a different name as we do not own the .com version for the project. This could result in phishing problems later in the future.

I had a hope and a vision that there could be many other projects that could very easily fit together with a DEX, and each of them would strengthen each other. When I brought these ideas to my cofounders, they agreed and we started the NVO project together with a great relationship.  Now one of the cofounders has sabotaged the project by wanting to start over from scratch even though development is nearing completion. He wants to take all of the crowdsale funds for himself and change the terms of the project all on his own to ignore some key promises of the crowdsale. The investors are now being told that they should want to have a fork of Komodo. They are also being told that they will not receive a DEX with plugins, which means it is not a true decentralized exchange. His Komodo fork will be controlled by him alone and he will approve or deny the coins that can be traded on his Komodo DEX. This is not in the spirit of a decentralized exchange, and nobody will use this Komodo fork any more than Komodo is already used right now.  The direction he wants to take NVO is not what investors were promised. This unfair change means only one thing is possible: the escrows must immediately refund the investors, and I have asked them to begin that process. Right now, the escrows are deciding what they will do with the crowdsale funds, and I believe we should hear their decision immediately.  My cofounder has also made some accusations about me and some of the other people associated with Veserus, one of the other projects that will help the DEX. These accusations are meant to distract you from what is really happening here. The fact is that my cofounder has taken 560 BTC, all of his share of the crowdsale funds from the milestones that we have already met, and I have taken only very little. The actual development has been paid out of my own pocket and not the crowdsale funds except for a very little amount. But my cofounder has wasted his share and no longer has the funds to afford to continue the project on his own. So, he will take what he has left and will do an easy fork of Komodo just so he can claim he has delivered an escrow milestone, and he will try to take 100% of those milestone funds instead of just the 50% he was taking before.  I would never allow that to happen if I was one of the escrows. He should never be permitted to take all of the escrow funds for himself, change the terms of the crowdsale, and deliver an inferior DEX that is no better than what someone else has already created. This is totally unfair to the investors. So I propose that the remaining funds that I am entitled to for the previous milestones be released to me so I can continue development of the DEX, and then investors should be refunded everything that is still in escrow as they are entitled to.  No matter what my cofounder does by himself, I still care the most about the NVO investors. I will continue developing the real NVO DEX with my own funds if necessary, and when development is complete, I will credit all NVST holders with the real NVO DEX tokens as promised since the crowdsale. A real decentralized exchange with a plugin system and a decentralized trade validator to power a very fast trading engine. We will continue development of Veserus and the other projects that will help the DEX, and the crowdsale investors will get the project they paid for, even if there is a full refund and I do not get my half of the remaining milestone funds.  Again I must say that I am sorry for how investors have been treated by my cofounder. This is totally unacceptable and I will do everything in my power to make it right.",False

In my opinion if not enough people are represented for the vote a decision that goes towards either of the sides shouldn't be taken, because it's going to be based on what a few whales voted. That's just my opinion and it comes from the fact that a lot of people are not checking the project for updates because the developers have been really poor with communications and deadlines. Bigger holders are more active and interested in this, so they will make moves. Good luck mobilizing the rest 5000 people in three days.  People should just be allowed to decide who they support again by reinvesting if they want to, why this hasn't been considered. Didn't we took enough damage from the founders ignorance and lack of generic approach to the project? I mean, you've seen what a year of progress has brought.  A lot of smaller holders haven't even heard about the project being torn down to pieces. It's going to take several hundreds of people to overthrow a decision made by any of the top 5 whales. I don't think people will mobilize quick enough to react and make the vote fair. Don't expect more than 30% voter turnout, will be curious to see if I am wrong. There's usually systems in place to protect for low voting turnout, is there going to be anything like this here or this is final?  Because if it's final, 2-3 people will decide the project's fate since it's weighted. And it's fair to be weighted since they've put most money in it, that's fine, but I am arguing that there isn't enough time and it has been communicated poorly. At least an extend in time?  Also none of the sides presented any information to help us decide, as far as I am concerned, no one has provided any proof. Just claims against each other.",False

For 2 NVO will be handing out dividends for NVST holders so that already cuts the competition down big time.  For 3 most of the other dex's coming out will not be true decentralization.  For 4 most other dex's are only erc20 and either won't be adding other coin types at all or at a much later point in time.  For 5  NO other Dex features a plug-in system that allows any 3rd party to create and upload their own coin/token/contract to the Dex network.

The team is still working and developing, but choose not to communicate much about their progress until they have something significant to present to the community.   The CEO of NVO, Ton Bi, has given the development team a 3-4 month deadline to produce the dex, although he has not been clear what exactly will happen if the deadline is not met.  One of the community members, Mike, has been in direct contact with Imed in the past few days and it appears development is going well. Veserus is done but waiting on legal clearance.  We are told Imed is moving to Malta to open a company for Veserus & also get it licensed there.  Imed manages a total of 76-100 developers.  Before anyone flies off claiming foul, consider they are probably not all full-time and they are responsible for the NVO dex, the wallet, Veserus, the bytecap website, and another project in the works that for now is simply called ""project S"".  The delays on the dex- Imed asks everyone to be patient.  NVO is using it's own blockchain to host the validator since Safenetwork was abandoned.  Once the blockchain is up, very little changes can be made.  So everything has to be right in the beginning.  And look at the Bancor hack - security is very important and cannot be rushed because of impatient investors.  This appears to be the primary causes for delays - simply making sure this is right and secure from the beginning.  This info has been gathered from various posts in slack and telegram.  I have no more contact with NVO than anyone else and am in no capacity affiliated with them other than an investor.",False

Quote from: crnewbie on June 09, 2018, 07:57:00 PM That's one possible approach however especially during end of last year they could get significant investment and boost their dev team like ten times which would lead to stronger product and faster development.  This year, there are many DEX projects and it will be much harder, especially for a small (in terms of capital and resources) project like NVO. I believe closest competition for NVO is Exodus wallet/exchange and it is already much bigger beast. I wish NVO the best (still holding few tokens) however it's hard to imagine they will succeed against current competition.  In addition to previous optimistic post from TSRW and countermissing, i must say next: - deadline of DEX was moved three times from ICO start. - useless wallet released  with half year delay (who will use it and for what?!) - 60% of collected funds are released from escrow in 2017 - no any evidence of development and no public statements from team - band of shills/trolls personally attacking any who shows doubts on NVO or mentioned other working DEXes.",False

I don’t know if 3 times is entirely accurate, but nevertheless what does this mean?  It means they suck at projecting the time and t takes to build this.  It may may indicate a measure of incompetence but it may not, I cannot ascertain that just yet.  If you examine the complexity of what they are attempting it does seem logical it will take some time to get it done and get it done right.  Does it mean it’s a scam?  I don’t think so but if you do then so be it.   - useless wallet released  with half year delay (who will use it and for what?!)  Far from useless.  I have used it several times.  I am having no luck getting my Ripple out so there is a problem there.  Remember this is beta, you know what that means right.  This is why they are not marketing, because they want to get it right.  How many good ripple wallets do you know of?  Yeah that’s right not too many because Ripple is a pain in the ass.  As you can see from their last update they are working on it.  And again, if you examine the complexity and of this wallet maybe it provides understanding why delays and bugs.  This is not a simple wallet, and it has to have code to connect it to the dex as well as plugin system.    - 60% of collected funds are released from escrow in 2017  So what is your point?  The escrow schedule has been posted from the very beginning.  They have completed the necessary milestones and have been rewarded.  If you have a problem with this you shouldn’t have invested in the first place.    - no any evidence of development and no public statements from team  I can understand the concerns with evidence.  Not much I can say about that.  Being an active member of slack I understand things better than a casual person who drops in after a period of not paying attention.  But the team does releases statements, don’t know what you are talking about there.  They just released an update a few days ago and it was forwarded to here.  If you want to disregard what they are saying and believe they are just lying well that is your choice.    - band of shills/trolls personally attacking any who shows doubts on NVO or mentioned other working DEXes.  Well man,  there have been plenty of people come in to various nvo media sites with honest intentions and questions and have been dealt with respect.  Then you have others.  Take prisoneroflies for instance.  This guy writes a long steemit post fudding NVO all in the name of civic duty and protecting others.  Well not only did most of his crap facts get debunked, but did you know he blackmailed the NVO team, asked them for a ransom to keep him from posting that.  So if he would have got paid he wouldn’t have “ protected” anybody.  And then old cool4y, he visits every NVO message board he can find with his endless list of alter ego names trolling.  Is that who you are referring to?  Or how about the guys that keep complaining that NVO isn’t on a good exchange even though it has been explained countless times why not. ",False

When i invested in nvo, i saw a great potential in this, i still do... the weight on the the shoulders of these guys.... man... reading what is said here is maybe one of the reason they ignore this forum and stay focussed on the task...  anyways...  Here's suggestion for the team, the escrows.... and all ico creators for that matter...    When the ico took place, the cryptos that have bin accepted had a set value at that time... when you did setup the objectives, you where aiming to a set value for the project...  time pass and the values goes up and down while escrows keep an eye on these funds...   In a bear market, i would consider normal the escrows would protect the funds by trading them for usdt or cash....  as well, in a clear bull market, they should keep these asset grow, keeping in mind the initial funding value, and keeping tabs of the growth...   So let say an ico is taking place at 0.10$/ token... At that time.. 1 btc goes for 1500$.... At the end of a bull market like the one we had...  that mean that escrows could have protected 10 folds the projected value of the ico...     Milestones get hit....  escrows are now to release parts of the funds...  in initial prevision, that milestone was supposed to release 100 000$ but now the escrows has 1 000 000$ in hands for the set amount of bet...  my opinion would be that the developper should have acces to the fund that they where forcasting for that milestone...  100k goes to them for the milestone, 900k stays in the escrow care.....  Then comes the end of the project, where all the funds are to be released....   along the road... all miles stone have bin paid to the developpers, ans the escrows have protescted a profit on the funds that had bin protected....   Usually that could be a moment for a bull run for the token and soon after a sell off...  but what if there is an incentive to prevent that.. .    Project developper already keep a good part of the tokens that have bin released  Token holder will keep them if they know that over the next year or so, the escrows would now release the profits of those funds to them...   the project will grow because of that stability and the investors will actually make profits both from their initial investment and from the project growth....

It's not so much that this project might turn out to be a scam, it's more so that I chose this project over other legitimately successful projects. That's what pisses me off the most.  You make a very good point about the team is intentionally making these tokens difficult to liquidate by not getting it listed on any other exchanges. I never thought of it that way. If they really wanted to make it easier to liquidate, they could easily do it, but instead all that we hear are excuses. Or maybe they are afraid that if it was liquid, everyone currently holding these bags would jump ship. Whatever their reasons, I now believe that the team wants to keep this as illiquid as possible.  The BTC is already in escrow and the team really doesn't have to launch an effectively working product in order to receive the remaining amount of BTC.

Srry man, with all respect to you personally, i can only commits those sentences as an ""very old song"". Since I've read all 150 pages of this tread.   I tell TSWR to stop posting updates because all it brings is more people angry and complaints so might as well report nothing. He doing great job. It keeping us up to date and also clearly shows whats going on.   The team is not stupid and they know if they release a product that doesn't work 100% the community will just shit on it like the TSWR updates.   Listen, i never call them stupid. They was smart enough to raise thousands of bitcoins. But in the product delivery aspect they doesn't show any significant evidence of their proficiency.   The SEC also made it hard for NVO since it is technically an unregistered security token. Will see in next 12 month.    Now on the topic on if NVO is a scam: 1.  Screw all of you that keep comparing NVO to other DEX.  You are saying your (insert DEX) is better after the fact, no one knew a year ago your DEX would increase in value and succeed. Here i agree with you. And i'm not  shilling for any other DEX, sorry   2.  How the hell is this a scam if they already got the money?  Why bother with updates, Telegram, Slack, and Bitcointalk?  NVO doesn't have an endless supply like FUTR and Monkey Capital ICO that depend on a flow of new money, and have you seen the NVST token price? 40% still escrow, its 1400btc +1400bch another twelve millions in today's prices.

Due to coinmarketcap delisting NVO, the required changes have already been added to 1.2 in order to display the price in the price page, using counterparty. Performance tests and benchmarks should happen at the end of this week or the mid next week regarding the separation of concerns.

Adding shared service, connecting the new design with the redis backend, setting messaging, workaround to use ipcRenderer and ipcMain additions from electron. Connecting new design with the redis backend, private data setup and started with prices. Transactions page Addresses page Price page Transfer page   Why just 30% advancement?  Most of the components and packages here are totally new to the wallet, some work arounds have been required like the IPC one, because of the separation of concerns and the way Angular works, which consumed a lot of time. Also, there was new additions to the development team who required a period for adaptation and training. Since some weeks, we focused on seting up documentations, internal and external documentations for the wallet and the cluster. These docs took a long time to be writen as they are very detailed, it contains everything about the wallet and cluster, including data schemas for the users, for the addresses management and private keys, transactions, prices, almost everything. On the cluster side, some changes have been done regarding networking issues with ripple, as the wallet uses the websocket ports of Ripple, we had to do some changes on the load balancers to let them relay the informations.  Regarding the updates, and the lack of updates, as mentioned in above, for now, we can't do weekly updates, maybe bi-weekly updates,  because we prefer not to update you when there is not much to say, the work is progressing, but it may not be as quick as what everyone would like to.

Here is the link to their Medium post: https://medium.com/@rredmond8118/payfair-escrow-platform-accepting-new-token-listings-for-free-b06949a0ef8b  All that this team needs to do is to fill out the application that can be accessed via their post and if the team approves, we will be listed on a new platform. We need to circulate this post so that the team sees. If they care about the investors, they will at least complete the application.  (P.S. I know that the announcement says tokens, but they are planning on adding Bitcoin soon. Dev team should fill out the form and submit NVO for consideration.)",False

It's a bit tricky to do - the buy side requires two transactions, and the timeout for any order match is just 20 blocks.  It can manually be done right now - you can see the history of matches from the very beginning of the NVST listing. But it's not as simple as just sending the bitcoin to the seller address.  Basically, the flow goes like this: Seller places order to sell NVST for BTC. Buyer places an order to match. The CP protocol says that once a match is made, the buyer has 20 blocks to complete the trade by making a second transaction that sends the appropriate amount of bitcoin in a transaction that includes the bitpay opcodes. You can see from this that a problem is created when a user places a buy order first and a seller matches the order while the buyer is away (or asleep, whatever.) Since the second transaction must be placed after a match, only a connected client can send the required bitcoin, and web services cannot reliably do that in an automated manner. Knowing this, the Counterwallet team disabled bitpay transactions some time ago from their web app.  Another hitch in the process is that if you send the bitcoin to the seller but the bitpay transaction doesn't confirm before the 20 block expiration, the tokens are not credited and the buyer effectively loses their bitcoin unless the seller sends them a refund (there is no mechanism to enforce refunds, you must rely on the seller's good graces.)  The method TSWR is setting up is a fork of an existing bitpay website that doesn't currently work - he and I are modifying it to work properly. Right now we are working on fixing a fee bug, but it should be ready to go...soon",False

However, I would wager that 99% of the NVST holders would have been willing to pay that fee for the chance of having liquidity. If someone had told me that when I invested last summer, I would have to wait 1 year and still not see any liquidity, I would not have invested. If nothing else, this team should have at least offered a method of liquidity, which they promised to do multiple times last year. Multiple times they said that they would provide another means for investors to trade NVST. This was around October of last year. It's now almost June and we are still only on Counterwallet. If NVST was liquid, chances are that it would be trading at above $1. People would be easily able to buy and sell at will. What good is it to worry about paying higher fees when your investment is stuck in an illiquid project? Here is the irony, we are investing in an exchange coin, which is supposed to allow all types of coins to be traded on their platform, yet we can't even trade the coin that's associated with the project.  That's pretty ironic, don't you think?  If this coin had been on HitBTC since last year (again, I really hate HitBTC, but if it offered liquidity, I'd be fine with it), NVST would have a bigger market and it would be more widely traded. Yes there's a fee, but I invested $4,500 into XCP, which you have to buy in order to transact on the Counterwallet exchange. I've been trying to sell that XCP since last month and it's current value is $3,000. I've lost approximately $1500 in value from holding the XCP, which I initially bought in order to buy NVST. What's 50 NVST compared to losing $1500 because I was forced to buy XCP just to use Counterwallet?  Counterwallet  is probably the only exchange where you have to go to a different exchange in order to buy their tokens required to trade on their DEX? That is the most absurd concept ever. Counterwallet is a broken platform. Either sell your XCP coin on your own exchange or allow people to buy NVST and other coins using BTC. Counterwallet is based on BTC, yet you can't trade BTC or their own coin XCP on their DEX. It would limit the risk of being stuck holding bags on their illiquid XCP coins. Once again, I hate HitBTC exchange, but in this case I would happily pay the extra fees to not be stuck holding these XCP coins. I'm hoping that the market pumps so someone can buy my XCP bags.",False

Refunds can only occur if two conditions are met: 1) Some milestone has not been met. 2) The project has been declared canceled/failed/abandoned by the team (which is not the case here).   5) IIRC the project hasn't even taken half of the funds (release milestones state that the team can take up to 60%). 6) The FUD/nonsense of the latest few posts is disgustingly ignorant to the point that I don't even need to double check the above number^. [1] It's like a plague; human stupidity knows no limit. [2] I'd do quite a few things differently; again, not my project. [3] 3000 BTC was not collected. That was the (est.) Bitcoin equivalent of all investments at the time of writing. The exchange rates are completely different now.

However, on Lauda's side of things it was a fake extortion attempt to get more information on a scammer. that post was specifically made to intentionally hurt Laudas  reputation as  good person who hates scammers.  Aside from that  the extortion part never even happened  it was a fake ATTEMPT <--- keyword  meaning there was  no valid evidence  that extortion took place.  which brings me to the conclusion that  because   extortion was not able to be proven  no one can say Lauda  extorted another member,  maybe attempted but  at very best that's classified as social engineering, and on this forum I do not see a rule against  that nor does it make some untrustable/trustable.  So my last point,  Luda has yet to be classified as scammer   for their services as an escrow. You will not find anything anywhere about Lauda scamming people out of money as an Escrow.  the fact you are trying to base Laudas reputation/trustability for their escrow  service around an extortion attempt post just shows how fucking stupid you as a real life person are Emanuil (cooly).   @lauda I am not paid for any support I offer to the project. they are very well aware of what I do and are very appreciative towards my actions.",False

Bitcoin – Go to step #1 Eth, Ripple, Litecoin, MAID, etc. – Go to step #2  Step #1 – Go to https://xchain.io/ and in the search bar at the top input the BTC address you sent from. On the resulting page look to the bottom and see if you see the asset NVST. If so – good, you are done. Go to Step #3. If not, you will need to find your transaction ID from when you sent BTC to the crowdsale. The address we sent funds to is: 3AiGej11G8jUXvEBPvQKPLiHXC7ruUCp1Z. This may help you find your transaction ID. Go to https://blockchain.info/ and input your transaction ID. In the result, notice if the BTC you sent was from only one address or from multiple addresses. •If only one sent from one address or input, check to make sure it is the same address you inputted at the xchain.io web page. If it is different, search the xchain site with that address. If you still do not see NVST at the bottom, go to step #4. If you do, go to step #3. •If you see multiple inputs, go to step #4.  Step #2 – If you sent any token other than BTC, NVO would have sent NVST tokens to the personal bitcoin address you listed on the original NVO crowdsale web page. Go to https://xchain.io/ and in the search bar at the top input the BTC address you listed as your personal bitcoin address on the NVO crowdsale web page. On the resulting page look to the bottom and check if you see the asset NVST. If so – good, you are done. Go to step #3. If not, go to step #4. If you do not remember which BTC address you used, go to step #4.  Step #3 –Congratulations, you are the proud owner of NVST tokens. First of all, you will need to control the private bitcoin keys to all addresses containing NVST in order to do anything with them. Unless you are looking to sell right now, it is best to sit tight and wait for the NVO wallet sweep function to be activated. If you are looking to sell, get your head examined. Then go here: https://medium.com/nvo-exchange/how-to-buy-and-trade-nvst-nvo-tokens-on-counterparty-decentralized-exchange-d82566f1316b . Or, wait for the Veserus CEX, developed by NVO, to launch soon to trade easier. If you do not control the private keys to your NVST bitcoin address, ask here for help. If that address is at a centralized exchange – kiss your NVST goodbye...  Step #4 – If you sent bitcoin from multiple inputs, if you sent an altcoin and do not remember which bitcoin address you entered on the NVO crowdsale page, or if you sent bitcoin from only one input but do not have NVST at that address, you will need to wait until the DEX is out and the NVO team continues with support.

For the V1.2.0, a lot of new features will be implemented, either on the Code side or in the Design side, let me give you some of them :     New design inclusion.    Implementation of Firebase.    New Feature : Sign message, for all the cryptos.    New Feature : Disable intro video.    New Feature : Set amount of threads.    New Feature : Set GAP size.    New Feature : Set API refresh rate.    New Feature : Disable/Enable Coins.    New Feature : Import/Sweep ability.    New Feature : Recovery from Mnemonic.    New Feature : Multiple accounts for the same wallet.    OPTIMIZATION : Addresses, sort the addresses as receiving addresses, change addresses, imported addresses.    OPTIMIZATION : Transactions, sort the transactions by transaction type, send receive, by crypto, by date, by value.    OPTIMIZATION : Addresses, enable Gap management    OPTIMIZATION : Addresses, add different addresses type, BC addresses for bitcoin, secret based addresses for XRP    Enhancement : In-wallet separation of concerns using a storage layer between front and back.    DATA MODELS ENHACEMENT : Rework the global object and reduce duplicated datas.    Write unit tests, integration tests, and general test modules.    Critical Feature : add ""Send Max"" button.    Critical Feature : UX improvement, need to catch ""enter key"" in login screen.  The V1.2 is supposed to be a mature release, and will be used as core base for the inclusion of the other features of the whole project, which why it is the priority. As of now, the due date for 1.2 is set for june-jully, it will still depend on other factors and may need more time then originally planned. Actually the team is working on the inclusion of the new design and separation of concerns, it already started and will take some time, we are also working on enabling multiple users per wallet by changing the structure of the global data storage objects and interfaces. The V1.2 will be compatible with V1.1, but as always we advise to backup the wallet. Once v1.2 is out, the backup formats will be frozen as there will be more informations into the backup file, and depending of the state of v1.2 and if we have enough time, we may also add a custom backup feature where you will be able to decide wether to backup some elements beside of the mandatory ones, and preferably creating backups compatible with other wallets.  Regarding Veserus, we have crypto to crypto trading, we will have crypto to fiat later, still need the platform's policy, term of use ... They SHOULD be ready for about two weeks, which when we are supposed to release Veserus.  Please guys understand that nothing is easy to do, and nothing comes in time, there are always things that happen in the middle and bother you, we always provide dates, and really do our best to meet the engagements, but it is really hard. Anyways, there are more surprises coming, and the wallet will be a nexus point in the middle of these.  Something else, we are expecting the mobile wallet with v1.3, as of now, v1.3 will be less consistent compared to 1.2, and focused on new features and mobile version.",False

Regarding the update :  - Added Multithreading. Better performances, less freezes, informations are processed more efficiently, you should get small spikes of CPU activity instead of a single full CPU activity. - Added Logger. Everything happening on the wallet is logged on different levels, all of these logs are saved locally in your user-data folder and can be checked at any moment. - Added API failover. There are several APIs available to get blockchain informations, untill now, we used one for each, with this update, we use different sources. - Did some UI and Bug fixes, more of them are coming. - Added Auto-updater. It is the most important update as we no longer have to provide huge updates, and can release bug fixes updates.  As the last point of the list says, we added an auto-updater, with this we will release updates more often, you won't have anything to do except launch the wallet and wait for a prompt who will ask you of you want to update the wallet. You won't have to re-download the whole wallet to get updated, you will download just the difference, except for Linux users (unfortunately) but we are thinking about a way to provide this feature for all the linux distros.  We are aware of most of the bugs, and the team is now focused on fixing them, the first update release is going to be a bug-fix release regarding the price displays, and enabling support for the cluster. We will do our best to provide weekly or bi-weekly updates to the wallets while working on the next step for its development.  What will be the next big update about ?  well, there have been a huge work done on the UI/UX, it's been largely improved. More options will be given to the users og which : - disable loading video. - Set the amount of threads to use - gap size management (the amount of empty addresses to be generated at all time) - improved transactions status message (when sending, it will give you more details about what happens if there is any error or a state different from ""done"") - improved Addresses managements and sorting - Improved transactions management and sorting - New feature : Sign messages. - New feature : Multiple accounts - New feature : Restore from mnemonic (in the register/login screen)  These are just some of the features coming in the next major update of the wallet.

As far as ""claiming"" your tokens, if you go to xchain.io and input your btc address into that search bar on the top, look to the bottom of the resulting page and you should see some NVST there.

Further down the line they plan on introducing atomic swaps as their mode of cross-chain exchanging.  Blocknet will have atomic swaps as well.  Atomic swaps are great but are limited to blockchains that support them.  NVO will provide the ability to exchange with a greater variety of coins.  NVO will also provide a plugin system allowing new coins the ability to be listed as soon as their developers can write the code to plug them in.  No waiting for the exchange to get around to it and accept them.  So NVO will have a huge advantage by being able to provide liquidity to all new coins faster than any other exchange.",False

Now moved out, ready for new performances. I will organize all of this and announce the new updates once ready  In order to give you an overview of what is coming in the few days. - Veserus is almost done, so NVO will soon be listed there. - The cluster is going to be delivered soon, the company preparing the configuration is almost ready to deliver them, then will come a small setup phase and benchmarking - Once done, we will connect the wallet to the cluster which will provide a far more stable env, linking Veserus to the wallet to enable quick exchange - Ton had the great idea of making a centralized social media design, this project will be decentralized in the future, once we have more time, but it will definitly a great addition for NVO Please share the updates, especially BTCT (plz) i am overcrowded for now, Thanks guys",False

Instead, Nemgun joined the NVO team and focused on the new distributed exchange technology.  At this point, the story gets a little long and boring, but the short version is that they realized a short-term CEX was needed to provide liquidity for the NVST token, and some other things also happened that eventually made resurrecting Veserus the easiest path forward to solve a number of problems simultaneously.

I have been holding NVST since the ICO, and I have been trying unsuccessfully to sweep the NVST into my Counterparty address.  Every time thus far, I was sweeping without including the BTC from the original address; ie. I was ""unclicking"" the BTC in the original address, and only including the NVST in the sweep attempt.  I do not have any BTC in the Counterparty wallet at this this time.  I think this is the root of the ""error"" that has come up thus far on every (weekly) attempt thus far.  So, tonight, I am including the BTC that resides in the origin address and I hope this makes the difference.  I was not thinking, until now, that there must be some BTC included in the sweep to pay for the network fees; with the mempool in better shape today than it has been recently, my hopes are high for the sweep.

It was basically meant to be a 'rival' of sorts. I don't know much more than that about it because I don't invest in banker shitcoins.  NVO is different because it's a modular exchange. Any token can be added to it. This means any blockchain, not like a lot of wallets or exchanges that say they offer a lot of alts, but they're mostly ERC20 tokens.  50% trading fees seems to be common with these exchanges, but I like NVO better because it's NOT an ERC20 token. I wouldn't invest in another ERC20 token, because I don't believe they're going to be around very long. They're okay for now and great for crowd sales.  NVO is such a different than any other project I've seen and that's why I'm invested in it. No one knows about it yet so it's the perfect time to buy in. Imagine what happens when advertising starts, when you can buy NVO easily and the DEX is out! I don't want to be scrambling to buy at that point.  Also, the best part about NVO is it's SEXY!

It's simple to see how your little mind could come up with fantastic stories to try to force your limited comprehension into that little box of fabricated reality that comes from only knowing 5% of what is actually happening. It's hard to fit objective reality into such a small box when it's already so full of fanciful imagined conspiracies and so deeply affected by entrenched confirmation biases.  Your projection of ""complaining"" is particularly puzzling, since the actual context of the carefully cherry-picked screenshot you took using your PaperNick alt was part of a larger discussion about how much I am impressed with their dedication and work ethic. It wasn't a complaint at all; it was, in fact, quite the opposite. To remind the poor readers subjected to this nonsense: because the developers have been so busy recently, I hadn't heard from them in a while, and thought I would check in with them. When I did, I immediately got a surprisingly large amount of information in a very short amount of time that gave me renewed confidence in their diligence and tirelessness. Kind of like how you yourself are diligent and tireless in propagating half-truths and subjective inferences as if they were established facts - but they provide actual real-world outcomes, unlike your little fists mashing fruitlessly on your keyboard in a misguided effort try and look important to a group of people who largely already dismiss you as psychotic and irrelevant.  As it is, my reputation in the NVO community speaks for itself, and I don't need to lift a finger to defend it in any way. Yours, on the other hand, also speaks for itself, and needs no further effort to expose. We are at an impasse, it seems. I, on the side of rational and clear thought, and you on the side of wild accusations of conspiracy and subterfuge and an irrational fear of being wrong. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",False

Do you know how many people ""dumped"" to get out, and what their positions were beforehand? Do you see TSWR still here, or did he leave after ""dumping"" as you assert? Do pump-and-dumps normally come from a few insiders selling a lot of shares at once, or from a lot of sellers selling very little spread out over time?  If you used your tiny little mind to spend as much time researching the subject matter you rage on about as you spend mashing your little fists on the keyboard about your hallucinatory delusions, you would know the answers to these questions, and would come to the rational conclusion that this is an organic growth spurt from a small number of addresses buying in for six figure dollar amounts in a short amount of time, not a ""pump and dump"" scheme in any sense of the phrase. But, your irrational blinding hatred for anything to do with this project makes it impossible for you to act rationally or objectively, so I can only presume this newest outburst to be part of your Clozapine withdrawal symptoms.

Did you send Bitcoin to the crowdsale, or did you send an altcoin?  Bitcoin – Go to step #1 Eth, Ripple, Litecoin, MAID, etc. – Go to step #2  Step #1 –  Go to https://xchain.io/ and in the search bar at the top input the BTC address you sent from.  On the resulting page look to the bottom and see if you see the asset NVST. If so – good, you are done.  Go to Step #3.  If not, you will need to find your transaction ID from when you sent BTC to the crowdsale.  The address we sent funds to is:  3AiGej11G8jUXvEBPvQKPLiHXC7ruUCp1Z.  This may help you find your transaction ID.  Go to https://blockchain.info/ and input your transaction ID.  In the result, notice if the BTC you sent was from only one address or from multiple addresses.  •If only one sent from one address or input, check to make sure it is the same address you inputted at the xchain.io web page.  If it is different, search the xchain site with that address.  If you still do not see NVST at the bottom, go to step #4.  If you do, go to step #3. •If you see multiple inputs, go to step #4.  Step #2 –  If you sent any token other than BTC, NVO would have sent NVST tokens to the personal bitcoin address you listed on the original NVO crowdsale web page.  Go to https://xchain.io/ and in the search bar at the top input the BTC address you listed as your personal bitcoin address on the NVO crowdsale web page.  On the resulting page look to the bottom and check if you see the asset NVST.  If so – good, you are done.  Go to step #3.  If not, go to step #4.  If you do not remember which BTC address you used, go to step #4.  Step #3 –Congratulations, you are the proud owner of NVST tokens.  First of all, you will need to control the private bitcoin keys to all addresses containing NVST in order to do anything with them.  Unless you are looking to sell right now, it is best to sit tight and wait for the NVO wallet sweep function to be activated.  If you are looking to sell, get your head examined.   Then go here: https://medium.com/nvo-exchange/how-to-buy-and-trade-nvst-nvo-tokens-on-counterparty-decentralized-exchange-d82566f1316b .  Or, wait for the Veserus CEX, developed by NVO,  to launch soon to trade easier.  If you do not control the private keys to your NVST bitcoin address, ask here for help.  If that address is at a centralized exchange – kiss your NVST goodbye...  Step #4 –  If you sent bitcoin from multiple inputs, if you sent an altcoin and do not remember which bitcoin address you entered on the NVO crowdsale page, or if you sent bitcoin from only one input but do not have NVST at that address, you will need to wait until the DEX is out and the NVO team continues with support.

But hey, you want to keep looking like an amateur, go right ahead. Here's a free lesson, for the benefit of others reading (since you won't read for comprehension anyway)...: Growth is always compared against a base value measure. Some people invest with a base they measure in BTC. Others measure against a base of Euros, or Yen, or USD, or whatever, based on their own goals and investing methods. The spot price of NVST is reported in XCP because that's the only way to buy it on the open market right now, but the base measure of value will be different for each investor based on their own methods of investing. In your example, you try to cherry-pick the measure of value against XCP but fail to realize you are conflating price with value. It's completely obvious you don't know what you're talking about.  And, of course, you can't bring yourself to admit that new money is coming in here - but to the limited extent that your tiny little head is able to grasp it, you still try to explain that away by waving your hands and pointing to a nebulous failure to reach some immeasurable ""surge"" that you don't define and have no basis to argue anyway. And if you take a look back, you'll see that I made a completely objective analysis of the factors going into the price increase. But somehow, you think your magic crystal ball is able to determine the motivations of those buys, something that shows overwhelming bias and utter lack of objectivity in your own arguments. So don't talk to me about objectivity, sweetheart. You're still here trying to keep attention on yourself and prove some misguided point to a group of investors that you no longer belong to that is populated by people who don't care about you in any real sense. An objective person would have moved on to the next thing in their life instead of coming back for more punishment.",False

Most of the new orders are from fresh XCP buys, where everyone is well aware of the cost to buy XCP and the cost to trade that for NVST.  As far as TSWR ""pumping"" the price, his updates are straight from Ton in slack where you were banned for being an incessant annoyance and continue this behavior to every NVO board you can find.  You must enjoy getting a rise out of the community.  Doesn't bother me as I know what I am sitting on in NVO and am quite happy with the progress.  The NVST token is now trading at 4x the ico price, with little advertising, a horrible exchange process, and only a buggy beta wallet.  Once they release the updated wallet soon, and begin their serious advertising campaign and the Veserus exchange, we will begin to see NVST price climb higher and the public turned on to what will become a dominant force in the crypto world.  And you sir, I hope you saved some tokens!

They will be distributed among the holders of NVST and will have to be stored/sent to an NVO wallet for redeem. Upon the detection of NVST inside a user’s wallet, the validator will issue a 2OF2 Bitcoin address containing the amount of NVSX based on the user’s amount of NVST. It will then create a redeem script and send it to the holder wallet. The wallet will endorse the redeem script and allow the transaction.  This will enable an automated process of fees distribution. NVST holders will still have to send funds into a NVO wallet to allow the process to take place. Later the whole process will be automated, using the new features from counterparty like smart contracts allowing the exchange and payout process to be fully autonomous. This system enables an automated distribution process amongst the addresses holding NVST, external exchanges filtering, and keeps NVO legal as only tiny amounts are processed because the price of NVSX will be fixed at 0.99 USD. The total available amount of NVSX will change proportionally to the amount of fees collected. It is a way to control the inflation and the price to enable a stable value asset for the holder’s usage.   NVSX = fees  With out fees nvsx wouldn't exist, nvsx is the key to unlock the access to the fees for the nvst holders.  (This is an example just fees and not trade volume trad volume would be $1B  per day in this example)  So if they do $7 mil that week in fees ( $1 mil per day and keep in mind fees are sent to a holding wallet)  and if nvsx is $0.99 cents there will be 6,930,000 actual nvsx sent out and divided amongst the nvst holders.  now if let's say i held 1.06 nvst out of the 6,930,000 NVSX I would receive 1 nvsx at the end of the week , i would then exchange that 1 NVSX for $0.99 (since one nvsx is only worth $0.99) cents worth of btc and that btc is taken from the $7 million in fees that are being stored in the holding wallet.",False

You really have no idea how any of this works, do you? No wonder you rage quit, you're just confused by simple market mechanics.  For those of you watching at home, the recent rise is due to new money coming in. The counterparty market is so thin, that any money flow will push it one direction or the other very quickly. The buyer yesterday dumped about $40k of new cash all at once, buying out the already thin ask side and practically quadrupling the value in both BTC and USD terms in a span of 15 minutes. It has since settled to about 2x what it was trading previously, in terms of both BTC and USD. XCP/BTC has been trading sideways since that time, locking in the price in BTC terms, while BTC has fallen against the Dollar, meaning the NVST/USD price has fallen apace with the broader market.  As I am typing this, another several orders for about 10k NVST from new money have been placed and are waiting for confirmation.  There are new buyers coming in. The value is increasing. You've demonstrated yet again your inability to understand how the NVST market works and are projecting your own flawed analysis onto something you simply have no aptitude for.  And yet, you lurk.  edit: the orders have confirmed and were added above the existing bid orders, spread out to try and hide the wall effect.

That's why i said nvo hasn't grown much. In order to grow inherently, the bid price in xcp/nvst should surge, not taking into account the usd value. As I said the new orders are result of two things: xcp plummeting to 50 dollars and TSWR pumping the coin buy copy-pasting  (as you said) old updates and putting them together to look appealing.

Now we have to stabilize the wallets with the API clusters and then we can ready to advertise  Exodus supports 5 blockchains and the rest are erc20 tokens  with the NVO wallet we can easily add ERC20 later on  Jaxx supports 6 blockchains and rest are erc20   NVO supports 8 and the other 2 are protocols on the Bitcoin blockchain just with the first release   so nemgun has thought really far into the future while developing on the wallet and that's really amazing imo   and most of the blockchains and protocols we have added are used for adding tokens so we can expect to support the most coins easily by the next updates to come. In the future we can expect to be the top wallet.   i have the CEO of ledger on skype so once we are ready we can integrate but it's not a priority at this stage of development  Veserus is going great we are optimizing the exchange for later use with NVO. The old UIs were really hard on the eyes so I had them change it. I don't want to shoot myself trying to read the numbers at night  unfortunately there won't be a light version  just one semi-dark version but it's really easy to use that's all we need,False

NVST only trades with XCP so you need to buy some XCP on Bittrex or Poloniex and send it to you counterwallet address.  You must also send enough BTC to that address to cover each transaction you plan to make since every counterparty transaction rides on top of a bitcoin transaction.  And every transaction on counterparty must pass through the btc network as if you were sending tokens somewhere.  And to further make things interesting, if you take an order already made, make sure you change the price per NVST to one higher of the smallest decimal place as counterparty has a habit of changing the amount you input by 1 satoshi (but xcp satoshi).  For instance if there is a sell order for .02000000 XCP, select that order but change the buy price to .02000001.  A royal pain in the butt, but you will get cheaper tokens by doing this rather than wat until next month for the NVO centralized exchange they are building to make trading easier.  As far as listing on other exchanges, they have tried some of the major exchanges but have not been successful.  NVO is regarded as a securities token which makes it impossible or near impossible to list on a US exchange, and it is also a counterparty token which makes it difficult for exchanges to list without paying more money than it is worth.  For instance HitBTC wanted something like 40 BTC to list it.

The next update of the wallet features an auto update function and early cluster linking.  They are preparing a new website/server for that kind of usage.  He also confirmed that the wallet will have the NVST/BTC in it along with other trading pairs, temporarily using veserus's exchange network.  He said there is no specific date as to when veserus will be up (no surprise there) And that they have many, many test to run before they can launch, because they want to make sure it's secure and functions well so no one losses coins.

We haven't gone to dubai yet but we will later. It's much faster to set up a centralized exchange over a decentralized one and the benefits once veserus is up will be immense with current news of exchanges gaining 100k users a day, disabling registrations and other centralized exchanges doing billions in daily volume.

Modular simply means that anyone can add any coin and you don't need to pay or hire a dev (assuming you know how to do it yourself).

Centralized exchanges can be shut down by governments, but a DEX can't assuming it's truly decentralized. NVO is going to have it's own blockchain rather than the safe network now, because the safe network (maidsafe) wasn't going to be ready in time.

Actually i am managing around 70 devs simultaneously, so i am constantly checking codes and pushes, we are creating the ecosystem of NVO and trust me, it is far from been easy, i also tried to get us listed on cryptopia, but they don't support counterparty (i can send you the conversation log if you want). Bittrex and Poloniex never wanted to list us, and never replied to our demands. I didn't wanted to stay like that, so i decided to relaunch veserus, and reopen it in Dubai, as even if it is a temporar exchange, you need a lisence and papers to make it legal and compliant. Also, we had a talk with the Ledger team (hardware wallet) as we will add support for hardware wallet in the next updates. I am also trying to enable trading from the wallet to Veserus (using its API) while the DEX is in development (will use the DEX interface with veserus) which will also let us fix and improve the DEX interface. I am aware about the price of NVST, and i am as annoyed as you guys are, so i decided to give a utility to the NVST on veserus (like binance and their coin) Instead of paying 200k$ to advertise on coinmarketcap, we decided to release our own version (bytecap) which will be used by the wallet to gather price informations. We will also try to check with card providers to see if we can setup a service comparable to mistertango, exchange linked to bank account with debit card. So, instead of chasing exchanges to list NVST, i decided to take a more complicated path, but more secure, with better results on the long term.  There are so many other things we are implementing and preparing, nobody took offdays, and i am forbiding it unless everything is done.  Regarding the bugs, the next update of the wallet will include an autoupdater, which means that at each startup you will be notified for a new version, it will download and install the update for you. For PR guy, keep in mind that it is a holiday period, give us some time, slowly but surely everything will be organized properly.

Their progress is extremely slow. They need to fix all the bugs, which will take a lot of time, then do all the improvements on the wallet they planned afterwards they need to do the temporary exchange and finaly the dex. With such rates, DEX will be delivered in 2019-2020 IF THEY MANAGE TO DO IT ALL. Honestly, they are very incompetent and don't have the skills to bring a basic wallet, the dex is innovation that nobody made so far and it will be x100 times harder to do. You can't build project like that with 3 people and be stingy spending money that WE GAVE YOU.  I'm from the project since day one, but they are real disappointment and complete failure.

I decided that NVO won't be built on maidsafe, as their network is not technologically ready to support NVO, but the NVO team is glad to support the MaidSafeCoin on the multiwallet.  Also, i would like to announce that NVO will be a wrapper built around a blockchain, we are already working on it. The details will be provided.

Also we as investors of course are kicking ourselves we put btc in as we have lost many thousands through the btc gains while it remained stagnant for those invested meaning those who didnt contribute to original ico are being rewarded now if they invest while original investors feel suckered.,False

The wallet beta is the newest completed milestone for the NVO decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (""DEX""), and represents several months of continuous development in parallel with the DEX order validator.  Security is the cornerstone of the NVO project, and the wallet is built with security as its first priority. All account data is locally stored and encrypted, including the wallet file and any backup or recovery files you create. The wallet also implements an authentication PIN for actions such as sending a transaction or exporting private keys. It’s also completely private. We do not obtain or track user identifying data, nor can we monitor or revoke your wallet access in any way. With the NVO wallet, you are always in complete and sole control of your assets.  Assets supported at launch: Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum Classic (ETC) Litecoin (LTC) Dogecoin (DOGE) Ripple (XRP) Dash (DASH) Waves (WAVE) Counterparty (XCP) NVO (NVST) Omnilayer (OMNI) MaidSafeCoin (MAID)  The download is available now for Mac, Windows and Linux. Wallet download: https://nvo.io/wallet.html   As a courtesy to our community, we have also included a list of current development goals for future versions of the NVO wallet, grouped by scope. Future updates will focus on these improvements. Since this is a long term project, this is not an exhaustive list. New items will be added as needed, as we will always be working on and improving the wallet.  I. Addresses Optimize functions, replacing existing packages/modules with more efficient functions, in part to reduce the size of the wallet executable. Most coins share the same requirements. Add GAP address management functionality, enabling more efficient address management. The default is a GAP of 20 addresses. We will also provide the ability to change the GAP size in the settings, subject to some limits. Enable an address import function. This feature is currently disabled, as it needs other updates first, namely GAP management. Enable watch-only addresses, to monitor address balances without the corresponding private key. This option prevents the wallet from conducting any transactions on the address, and is useful for verifying cold storage balances. Enable fine precision coin control to manage funds with more granularity, such as sending from a specific address to another. Concurrently, determine if it is feasible and helpful to consolidate XCP and OMNI addresses, and implement this consolidation if practical. Add functionality to allow signing messages with a private key and verifying that messages are validly signed from public keys.  II. Transactions Build more efficient transaction management using local storage, including the transactions in backup files. This could be defined in the account settings. Change the transaction display screen in order to improve the information flow and make transaction history easier to read. Currently, all transactions are displayed in the same block which is not user friendly.  III. Light nodes Implement an optional light node function, enabling the wallet to transact directly with the various blockchains without using an intermediate API. The objective is to let the wallet connect to the different networks with a minimum number of nodes for each cryptocurrency, and only when required, which will minimize bandwidth use. Light nodes would give the wallet more independence from intermediate APIs, offloading functions like transaction broadcasts or retrieving balances directly to and from the network.  IV. Integrations Implement hardware wallet integration.  V. Plugin-system preparation Prepare the first plug-in for an additional coin as a demonstration and template for 3rd party plugins Prepare download servers for plugin storage and distribution Prepare plugin provider functions and management interface System testing; define and execute QA/QC processes  VI. Ergonomics Display error messages below the corresponding discrete displays Search for transactions, coins and addresses. Add more robust dialogs (error messages, notifications, notices) Differentiate event types using more obvious visual design cues. UI and UX flow and speed optimization.   VII. APIs Consolidate the APIs for better code optimization Add network failover functionality for dropped connections or netsplits  VIII. Send/Receive Optimize send functions and features; add more granular send management functionality Add functionality to move Bitcoins sent to XCP and OMNI addresses Add the ability to include arbitrary data in transactions  IX. Options Include option to disable the opening splash video GAP management function options Settings for light nodes Username/Password/PIN management Extended backup options  X. Wallet framework Migrate to Firebase to enable import/export to and from the mobile client Extend chart data and optimize chart management Enable multiple accounts (feature disabled until Firebase migration complete) Enable imports from mnemonic (initially, only file-based imports are supported) Update any included 3rd party packages Prepare the mobile wallet client for release Implement desktop tray notifications (mostly for received transactions). Implement a more robust logging system  Issue tracking and bug reports will be handled by Github, and must follow the specified format. Critical bugfixes will be provided depending on the importance of the bug/glitch, and minor bugs will be fixed with each update.  Feature suggestions are welcome. All requests must be submitted as “issues” on Github. All feature suggestions will be taken into consideration, and may be included in future releases depending on their pertinence and the amount of development time required to implement the feature.  Github issue format:  [Title] : Include a short title describing the issue [Object] : Identify the element that isn’t behaving as it should. [Expected behaviour] : Describe how it should work based on context and labeling [Actual behaviour] : Describe in detail the core of the issue. Include any error messages and specific steps to duplicate the issue. [Logs] : Include any logs or screenshots that may help the team determine what’s going on.  You may add any tag you wish to the issue, but for the sake of organization, please ensure it is related to the issue.  Please note: Error logging in the wallet is not fully implemented in the initial release, so until full logging capability is implemented in a future version, any issues must be described in as much detail as possible to facilitate a quick turnaround. Poorly described or issues that do not conform to the template may be closed without action being taken.  In closing, we are extremely proud of our team’s efforts, and of our vision for NVO. With this release of the NVO wallet, what was started in private has now transformed into something that our community can use for themselves. We are very grateful to our community, and encourage you to join us on Reddit, Telegram, and Bitcointalk.com as we continue the next phase of development. Decentralization is the strength of the NVO project, and our strength grows when our community grows as well. Thank you for sticking with us, and we look forward to announcing the completion of our next milestone in the very near future.",False

That it's only available to slack and certain loyal holders? Get the fuck outta here with that BS. If anyone continues to put money into this scam then they deserve to lose it all at this point. This is a poorly run scam and they are doing this on Xenio as well. There has also been other projects that i listed for anyone that cares to read the forums. When a project receives over 30 million dollars this is not how things are run, thru chat forums and secret video and picture sessions you morons. Crypto is all about open source and they have zero work on github after 7 months - https://github.com/nvoproject/NVO-Project  . They will post screenshots of a github from one of their other projects which was also a scam. They will come on here and say its so they don't have their work stolen which is total BULLSHIT. Crypto is trustless not secretive. A DEX with no code and no wallet and no work after 7 months.  Once again - the developers and the mods of this chat with their army of shills and fake accounts can all go to hell. I hope each one of you one day get what's coming to you.

On the discord, there's an announcement channel where I try to keep the news up to date with what the devs are saying on the slack. This is an easy and simple way of keeping updated compared to searching all the information in the slack, so feel free to join. Moreover, the messages in the ""general"" channel from the slack will soon appear in the discord as well, so there'll be more animation if I may say.  I also made a post on reddit which contains most of the recent information: https://www.reddit.com/r/NVO/comments/7fudlu/nvo_updates_state_of_things/  ""Hello,  Here are a few updates for those who are not on the slack nor on the discord.  As of the 08/11/17, : Wallet release date was pushed back as there are several minor bugs to be dealt with. A skype conference call that could have been joined by anyone (Can confirm the things said in this sumary + I was here for the conf call) was made on the 07/11/17 where the devs were showing the wallet and its user interface. They then proceeded to answer a few questions. One of them was regarding the exchange listing of NVST. Apparently, they received a response from Bittrex saying the devs had to choose between listing NVST or XENIO (they asked for both). The NVO team saif they wanted to list NVST and are still waiting for that. No dates or proofs were given so we can't really tell when that happened. The wallet already integrates trading functions and about 20 currency if I recall, of which XCP, ETH, BTC, etc. All ERC20 tokens can be easily listed. There are no deadlines for the wallet except that it should be soon. The project should be fully complete around Q1 of 2018. It is realistic to keep in mind that deadlines are rarely met and are just for information purpose. Just tell yourselves that you will be able to trade by Q2 of 2018 and everything should be fine.  As of the 20/11/17: The devs (Nemgun, Marto and Tonbi) joined the slack to answer some concerns from the community. Here are a few things they said. Marto mentioned : ""There are no particular issue, but working on the development of a software teaches you one important thing, regardless the efforts you put in the development, or the size of your team, release dates are most of the time rescheduled. Especially during the pre-publishing as there are always last minute bugs, elements you forgot to add, or elements you should change"" Ton said that ""Yanni (marto) and his team manages only the wallet. The team managing the validator and the tests are handled by nemgun. and last time they were checking compatibility with the packages "". They also added that they did some ""compatibility test, it went well, we had a delay because of ethereum but it is resolved"". Finally, they said that HitBTC wanted $400 000 as a fee for listing NVST. The devs sees that much money as a waste and would rather invest that amount elsewhere in the development of NVO.io Tl:dr Yes wallet delayed / Final deadline of the project still Q1 2018 / Wallet still possibly released November.  Recently, they created a link so that you can be notified when the wallet will be up. You can sign up here: https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/nvo-wallet About 32k emails are already registered.  For those who haven't received their tokens yet, the distribution will continue after the wallet is released.  Final deadline for the project is Q1 2018, and most of the funds collected during the crowdsale are still in the hands of the escrow Lauda from Bitcointalk.org.  As the slack is not open for new members, you can join the discord. I will continue to post updates from the slack so people can still be aware on the recent news. https://discord.gg/YvB5HXp  Here's a file that might also interest you where you can see the estimated profit distribution with holding NVSTs. For x NVST, and y estimated volume on the NVO Exchange, you can view the yield you could potentially have. (Nothing is sure, this is just a calculator that you can mess around with). https://docs.google.com/file/d/1pvx-Ljg5xuf3gUwBtqsflPC3gTV0T4dh/edit?usp=docslist_api&filetype=msexcel  If you have any questions, you can join the discord and ask the community or me personally ( @Trigul ).

Here are a few things they said. Marto mentioned : ""There are no particular issue, but working on the development of a software teaches you one important thing, regardless the efforts you put in the development, or the size of your team, release dates are most of the time rescheduled. Especially during the pre-publishing as there are always last minute bugs, elements you forgot to add, or elements you should change"" Ton said that ""Yanni (marto) and his team manages only the wallet. The team managing the validator and the tests are handled by nemgun. and last time they were checking compatibility with the packages "". They also added that they did some ""compatibility test, it went well, we had a delay because of ethereum but it is resolved"". Finally, they said that HitBTC wanted $400 000 as a fee for listing NVST. The devs sees that much money as a waste and would rather invest that amount elsewhere in the development of NVO.io Tl:dr Yes wallet delayed / Final deadline of the project still Q1 2018 / Wallet still possibly released November.",False

There were some folks who sent from a source of multiple inputs that did not receive their tokens yet, because of the plethora of people who didn’t follow the directions that even though the crowdsale said they would lose their tokens, the NVO team has still helped them and have been forced to suspend all customer service until the first milestone. * NVO has missed - by large margins - every deadline or estimate they've given.  ""Days away"" has turned into months, for example.  While the wallet has been delayed, most of the delay has been from a change in strategy to code for the exchange some portions at the same time while coding the wallet.  The other delay has been to work out some bugs which is common. * NVO has been terrible at communicating and has no central source of information or updates - and can't be bothered to update the one official place they have (their website) Ton is active on slack.  I do agree communication could be better, but they have stated to the slack community that until the wallet is released and they have produced something, they are not making communication a priority.  This is their decision.  Some people may not like it.  They prefer to let their product do the talking first, then they will come out of their shell. * NVO has provided literally no proof of any work or accomplishments so far That is untrue.  They have had a Skype call with 33 slack members showcasing the wallet and answering some questions.  They do not want to broadcast code until the project is in advanced stages.  They do not want to reveal their innovations just yet.  This can appear to be an excuse for lack of work, but as this project could very well be something special it can also be a viable tactic for self-preservation.  When the wallet comes out, soon -  all of these doubts will vanish. * No one knows anything about any of the developers except that some are also involved in other similarly unfinished/non-responsive projects I can’t say much here except one of the unfinished projects was abandoned for this one.   Does that sum up where we are?  Outside of blind faith, what is the trust-in-NVO argument based on?  What have the developers shown you that suggests they can:  * Build the NVO exchange The wallet seen on Skype helps, but what proof does anyone have that any ico will come to fruition and be successful?  They are all a gamble.  Personally my initial small investment came from just the white paper, subsequent investments have come through conversations in various forums that I have witnessed or been a part of. * Develop an actual clientele and address the various customer service and other issues that will come up Same thing here - based off conversations, statements, and also the amount of people they helped in the early stages to get their tokens even when they didn’t follow clear ico directions.  It clearly said on the ico page to not send bitcoin from an exchange or from an address you do not control the private keys, yet some people still did that.  And NVO took the time to help them.  That has to mean something.  They consistently say that once the wallet is released, we will see a heightened presence.  I am fine with that, some are not. * Make it profitable and bring in consistent revenues Nothing new to say * Reliably deliver the shares of profits to NVO Token holders Nothing new to say  So the deal is this - a wallet should be coming out soon.

I didn't lose any money at all on this scam, I put a relatively small sum in initially on the fact the token was using counterparty and seemed decent enough based off the little info that was available at the time.

Only those with little to no reading comprehension would be swayed for a moment by the story given at this point. Do you really think developers would take 6 months to release a wallet after being backed with millions of dollars? If so you are sadly mistaken and very naive.  The SEC and FBI will be in the crypto space to the best of their abilities regardless if you like it or not so might as well get ready. Why would the agencies tasked with protecting the citizens from scams not be looking into the most lucrative investment asset class at the moment? Also why would the country whose currency you are trying to scam people for not come after you to claw back those funds that would go into their own agencies funds? Welcome to reality. The SEC has already said that tokens issued are more or less securities. The guys involved here will all be in prison at some point.

There happens the scam. What ever you say, an escrow never engages his reputation in a project, he is just a middle man holding funds for a short time."" End Quote  It would seem ""Over-capitalization"" is the plan. Raise way more than you need. Complete the mile-stones with minimum expenditure. Escrows are obliged to pay out.

The more the wallet is delayed, the more the DEX is delayed. This is a climate with many DEX projects already working and coming soon. Time is crucial. 2) DEX GUI attractiveness: the wallet GUI will be a good precursor to how the DEX will look like. Again, since there are many DEXes out there already and more coming, it will come down to how easy to use the DEX is for widespread adoption. To attract more users is very important for liquidity, and many people today don't use DEX's because of the small liquidity which results in large margins.  So yes, the wallet is important, and the moment it's released and people start using it and judging how well it's working and how ease to use it is will reflect on the price and the overall attractiveness of this project, either positively or negatively.",False

Regarding safenetforum, i already said that the moderators are biased, they delete the posts where i talk about development andkeep the posts where i reply to some idiots to protect david irvine. It is not a problem, i have a good memory, i will fist bring you the post made by David, and rewrite what i said in safenet forum.  Before doing that, regarding the repo of NVO, it is still private untill patented, this way, the NVO DEX will keep his advantage, and i said that many malready. I know that you dilute my posts to protect David irvine, so let me start.  Quote https://safenetforum.org/t/nvo-decentralized-exchange-crowdsale/13608/1219 Sorry chap, if you are banned it kinda means you are not welcome. It is a simple concept really. You must be hard at work on your version of SAFE as you have about a week to publish that as per your own timescales. Then if you have time we can chat about how you achieved it. I would be very interested.  In terms of beaker etc. it’s cool to fork as you say, however it’s not the SAFE network at all. I suspect there is very little forked in SAFE apart from some utilities, I really wish there were though as it would save time and enable more collaboration.  If you think the maidsafe github presence is not very active then I cannot help you there. but mainly we publish real progress weekly. That’s probably more important. You may find older libs we no longer maintain though, if you are not sure how github works you may even think that’s our total activity, I suspect.  Anyway that’s the last post from me until you show us your version of an autonomous secured data network until then it’s probably best not to waste valuable time.   My reply was (not worded as it was originally as it have been deleted) :  Effectively we don't work the same way on github for sure, as i constantly clean the unused repos, codes, i use DRAW.IO who is linked to gmail account, and i create a spreadsheet that i share with my developers. DRAW.IO lets me do the architecture of the technology, the spreadsheet lets me do the requirements and needed skills, result of the architecture, the advantage of draw.io is that you can send it to Github as  is integrated, it is even better then UMLs. Once i recruited the developers based on their skills, i put them on github, we open issues, where to start, where to finish (by respecting the architecture) and then they start working. I also said that a friend helped me to link the repos to slack in order to see a live feed of what is happening, it lets me check every commit, when an issue is too complicated i personally get into the research in order not to waste time, usually it takes 24 hours. This is how i work with github, i don't like to leave useless codes or old repos. After that, it is not up to you to tell me when i have to deliver it, for Xenio i effectively foked ethereum, and inspired from Dash for the blocks, i offered you to fork xenio once we open the source code, as we use POA to do the first POS of xenio, it is closer to a DPOS and it is very good as we reward all the nodes, not only the owners of XNO, which will bring a stable network as everyone needs a full node to be rewarded, i also inspired from blackcoin, it is a great one, but due to the need of coins to start staking, the network is weaker. I respect a lot blackcoin and rat4, he did a great work there. I also though about adding superblocks, mined by the servers, what is a server ? CPU, MEM, HDD/SDD, maybe GPU, it means that from the begining you would have a strong computation power and storage capacity because of the servers you can even please yourself and host a node in space (like blockstream or nexus). You could use safebrowser (i never said it is safenet), the browser (who is a fork of beaker) as it is built with nodejs you can communicate with any daemon, what is interesting here is, let's say that you host a website, you can keep the database at your level, and host the frontend on different nodes, if the US is DDOSed, your website could still work which is already great, plus you save your P2P system (still decentralized). If you want to decentralize the database, you can put it into a smart contract and send it to the network. For xenio we implemented a P2P chat who doesn't rely on the blockchain, but on a direct communication between two users (P2P), will also add video calls without overloading the blockchain, it is specifically made for the gamers. Like a decentralized Discord. To continue on the idea, Ethereum released its decentralized internet, you can locate the users for sure, you can modify swarm in order to make it annonymous. Like you said last time when i asked for the maidsafe architecture ""dig"", so, go ""dig"" david. However, collaboration won't be possible with rude and disrespectful people.  But, for sure this kind of post gets deleted which is the proof that safenetforum mods are biased, one of them asked money from us even if he was thinking that NVO is a scam, i refused, and told him to go away.  As a result, safeforum dillutes all the interesting posts, i decided to stop the drama last time, and not to talk on the safenetforum thread anymore awaiting you to delet it, you left people insulting us freely while protecting dirvine. Now it is simple, either you stop destroying the image of NVO as we need to get more users for the Wallet who will be released soon, after we will launch the DEX and would like to get more people into the project. If you don't respect that, i am ready to free some of my time to ridiculise maidsafe, the Xenio github will be one of the first proofs that we can build a decentralized internet very quickly, Xenio is an awesome project, who wants to decentralize the gaming system of Steam, and reward the users and the server providers who will let the users play they favorite game, and meet each other on MMORPGs. There will be also smart contracts for the game developers who wants to integrate to the platform, Xenio will bring more volume to NVO, which is not bad at all for NVO.  So, yes i can do many things at the same time, as long as the ecosystem is here, i can go on it.",False

As the wallet is a wrapper who works with the DEX. So when a coin is implemented into the wallet, i have to be implemented in the DEX, this way we keep a clean work, the wallet will be available soon.  For Safenet, we promised to wait for about 4 monts, there is still a little less then 3 months, if it is not ready we will go with our solution. This is what we promised to do.     Quote from: rsa on August 23, 2017, 07:31:46 PM Quote from: nemgun on August 23, 2017, 04:36:28 PM I am recruiting someone to make a small exchange on the new NVO website, NVST/BTC.  Is that a DEX? I'm sorry, but what if someone think this as NVO's strategy to collect more BTC from traders without meeting what have promised (A DEx) !!  I believe when you open only NVST/BTC trade in NVO.io, mostly ICO holders will dump NVST within themselves.  Many will loose their $.  If you are starting NVST/BTC trade in NVO.io, why not list it in other exchanges as well (there are many who actively lists new coins. Ex: Liqui, Cryptopia, HitBTC, Binance are few)  If NVO is equally interested in ICO investors and is confident to meet its promise, NVO should hold selling NVST until you release your DEX with few other coins to trade.    It won't be a decentralized exchange, and there won't fees, also you shouldn't forget that some investors invested to trade the token, it was just a small bonus, nothing more. It is not really a priority, regarding cryptopia, they refused to list NVST because they haven implemented Counterparty, however, Coinpayments will add NVST to their platform, they are synchronising the blockchain. Regarding the price fluctuation, it is normal to get a dump, however, with the comming updates and the release of the wallet and DEX, the price will rise for sure.

I just want to load up on more NVST while it's cheap!   It is not because of Poloniex, as you may know the recent BCH pump rised the mining profitability, which draws more miners, i had a talk with Yani about it and apparently BCH retargets the difficulty very often which risesminers interests. Check the Bitcoin hashrate graph, you will see the reccuring drops, from 8kPh/s to 3-4kPh/s. It is a lack of hashrate who causes the transactions delay and high fees.

And at this point I think there's a philosophical aversion to paying someone to list the token...I mean, why pay someone to list it if they're already going to take fees?  Understandable, however, the main ingredient in any exchange (centralized or not) is liquidity. Deploying a small BTC/NVST exchange on the website will only benefit current NVO followers/contributors. Nova already has the members and liquid to expand trading NVST.  I do get the philosophical aversion if that is the only way to get listed. It takes a lot of work for an exchange to list a new token and unless the volume would guarantee investing in the effort, it is the reason exchanges pick and choose what they list. In Nova's case, it is more of a reasonable fast tracking fee and benefits the NVO community by introducing the token to a large audience.    It is not that easy, needless to talk about the different aspects to check, the aim and objectives of the project have to be taken in count regarding the decisions, even if the community have a great role to play there.

Quote from: resu12 on August 23, 2017, 10:54:02 AM Yeah, the most important is to do your best to offer what you promised to the investors, we really expect something great and your preview wallet video looks promising. Then you can work about exchanges and advertising, but now it is more a waste of time, and maybe pointless if there is an official NVST/BTC exchange in NVO. I am disappointed that the price harshly fell, but people who invested in NVO should have done it because they believe in this project and should trust the devs and hold NVST at least until the exchange is ready. If the work was as expected, the price will naturally skyrocket on its own and we can all profit.  However, even though you should put every effort possible in the development, you should also be more active in the communication domain. Please... The website have never been updated since the end of crowdsale, and you repeated many times that there will be a new website soon, but where is it? Official communication on Reddit is rare. Only Nemgun is active on BitcoinTalk. Don't let your investors lose truth because of that and sell their NVST in consequence. Or do you actually have something to hide? Are you actually very late in the development but don't want to admit this? Without proper communication, we can believe everything.   Wise words, especially the first paragraph, i appreciate your point of view as it matches my own. You are right about communication, however, i already said multiple times that i don't like other social medias, i feel a lot better in Bitcointalk, writing interesting posts and keeping them for future reference. Yani and Ton are active on slack, Yani is always talking with people on slack providing support and guidance. Regarding the possible delays, we said that we will wait for safenet, and as promised, we will wait, meanwhile we check the different alternative options. Also, we don't want to have a competitive clone of NVO at the release while we haven't even been listed, this is why we are wating for patenting the project, it will still be open source, the reproduction will be limited, it will also bring a market advantage to NVO.

First, Counterparty DEX is not ""horrendous"". Slow speed and high transaction fees make it unwieldy. Not good for active trading. But it is safe to buy or sell tokens there and safe to ""leave"" your funds there.  Second, no dex can ever fully compete with centralized exchanges in user experience. There is a trade off between ease of use and safety/freedom. Projects that promise everything simply lie.  Third, people who do not care about decentralization should not hold nvo tokens. It makes no sense as an investment. Except very short term  last, it is disgusting to see people begging to be listed on some shitEX.  Any shit is good enough to pump quickly and exit.

How exactly doe NVO try to be different from those other approaches out there?   Yes, the decentralized exchanges and more globally, decentralized infrastructures are good for the cryptos. As of now, Bitshares is the most competitive one, they support about 30 Coins, with a lot more assets. NVO wants to provide trading for more cryptocurrencies.  Most of the other decentralized exchanges are like Waves DEX, which can be compared to counterparty, i mean internal exchanges using proxy tokens or other processes.  NVO won't create assets.

I totally agree that, user experience have to be the most important point to consider, however, it is not that easy to provide a technology or software that is easy to use, functional, bug free. Some users can exchange on counterparty DEX without any problem, some others can't, it depends on what you are used to. If you trade only on centralized exchanges you will be pissed off by the high latency of counterparty DEX. If you are a decentralization or crypto addict, you will handle it.",False

I'm afraid to have to pester your thread but I'm a fan of another project, Enjin, which your own team member NEMGUN has been trolling for about 4 weeks now. They had to close their original thread because he basically took over it for reasons that I believe have to do with the Enjin team blocking him after things didn't go so well. So they created a new moderated thread. At that stage NEMGUN not being happy asked Lauda, one of your escrows, to setup a new non moderated thread to troll them even more.  But not only that, he went further and asked Cryptodevil (you guys know who he is right?) to look into the project... Long story short he ended up creating a scam thread. However no scam has been proven so far, only a lot of nonsense coming from NEMGUN and Cryptodevil trying to find excuses to prove the project is a scam, which he has failed so far.  This is the original Enjin thread that was taken over by NEMGUN: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2028112.0  See how nice and unbiased he's been? Take some time to go through it if you want to know why Enjin created a moderated thread. They were victims of NEMGUN intelligent posts.   I believe as a team member of a respectable project which raised 7 million in a token sale (NVO), this attitude really stinks, also makes me think that he has a lot of time on his hands to spend trolling other projects rather than help build his own. I really hope not all of the NVO team members are like that because I'd be worried about the progress of NVO.  Just want to share an extract of what I posted on the scam thread here after his post below which prompted me to have a look at NVO, the token sale and how you guys protect users and the team. He tries to suggest other teams (that don't want his advise any longer after dealing with him a little) that token sales should protect the users and the team. See below:      I see your own NVO token sale provided protection for both the users and team right?  https://blockchain.info/address/3AiGej11G8jUXvEBPvQKPLiHXC7ruUCp1Z (NVO Token Sale Escrow Address)  Total Received 3,405.38710067 BTC Final Balance: 0.00272019 BTC  So where are all the remaining BTC supposed to be released over time after milestones were achieved gone?  From your own thread:  Quote - 30% release at the end of the crowdsale. - 30% at the delivery of the beta wallet and first API Cluster - 30% At the delivery of the Beta Validator - 10% At the delivery of the plugin system  The funds won't be released until the escrows agree that a milestone has been reached  I see no BTC left in the escrow address but I don't see the address/es where the remaining BTC are held, I mean for transparency sake you should at least post the wallets containing those coins on the OP. I see no other escrow address with any BTC available on your thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1917456.0  What happened then? Who's escrowing NVO's BTC now?  The last update on your blog was in June: https://medium.com/nvo-exchange not bad, well done keeping the community informed! Not even a post sale blogpost to say thank you to your contributors. You raised the money now who cares about releasing some updates right?  How are you protecting both users and team? Come again? I didn't get that...  Cryptodevil, want to look into it? (Joke)  Lauda, you were one of the escrows... Know anything? (Joke #2)  I'm not saying NVO is a scam, but transparency-wise I've seen better, the information above should be clearly shown at least on your thread, website, or a blogpost. Would be interesting to see the remaining BTC in an address. Look at your own turf before going criticizing someone else's.  I think these are fair questions regarding NVO. Wonder if the information is hidden somewhere, for someone that just learns about NVO today (such as me) and what's available on your website or blog.  I also think you guys should keep an eye on NEMGUN because what he's doing doesn't do NVO any favours.  Have a good day.",False

The new address is: 3QV4kZtdzE8S2XdYXMbYQrgaJYBfDnypCC.  The rest of the funds, ETH ETC DOGE XRP had been consolidated and they are been exchanged for bitcoin on exchanges, it have been announced.

Regarding the github account, yes, it will be empty untill the launch as some people are really interested with the technology and want to use it. I had a lot of contacts with people who wanted to use this technology, and as i said that NVO should keep its advantage, i decided to patent the technology, while keeping it open sourced. It is mostly to avoid doing scams using the project. Alex is in charge of finding the right lawyers for that, and as we partener with CPS, i can definitly tell you it will be decentralized with very interesting technologies, as we said during the crowdsale that we will deliver a plugin for CPS. CPS is already a very good payment processor, but it will be the best one. The target is to be better than paypal as they tax you a lot, and is centralized.  Regarding the withdrawals, the escrows will be able to confirm soon.  Do not insult NVO, Enjin is an ERC20 token, centralized, made to take advantage of the ethereum hype.

Quote from: rsa on August 08, 2017, 08:47:09 PM Please, anyone know when will we see NVO in exchanges?  It's been so long the crowd sale has ended, but still NVO is not available in high volume exchanges.  NVO as a DEX; I guess must be having a talented team, including web developers.  Having such a team, NVO's website looks cluttered as seen in day_1 (plus very minimal modifications).  May be it is only my concerns that how NVO handle the challenges of a DEX if there is such a delay even in face lifting their web site.  Anyway, since Nemgun and Lauda are always active here, irrespective of the look & feel of website ATM or timelines in listing NVO in exchanges, hope we will see NVO team will come up with a great DEX.  We already sent demands to different exchanges, they are all focused on BCH now, however, coinpayments will list NVST. Thanks for your support   Quote from: Knepala on August 08, 2017, 10:16:40 PM Tonbi said on slack they are having a whole new website made. They aren't bothering with the old one because it will be completely replaced. However personally I don't see the harm in taking just a little time to at least update the roadmap.  Yes the website will be changed, we are coding it, but we also have different things to work on, we organise our work schedule depending on the different tasks, each one having a set amount of hours/day and then go to a different one, this way we can progress everywhere, even if it is slow, at least it is moving.  Update for NVO : We added two secondary architectures to NVO, we are focusing on NVO. The result of the two other architectures is the decentralization of Coinpayments, which is a decentralized payment processor (maybe the first) and a real decentralized bank, i can't give the name of the project nor give more informations as it is a parallel team. this is why i focus so much on the technology of NVO as it will offer a lot of services in the future.",False

Meaning, the address that you've deposited to should be empty. If the system queries the current balance (I am not sure) of those addresses, then it would show you zero.

It means that it is just a way to destabilize NVO and its investors. Secondly, the roadmap haven't changed, even on the website. It is normal to have problems at the begining as we started to work, we demanded an architecture which is normal but we have been unable to find it. As soon as we finish to stabilize the global architecture we will push it on github, it is not a problem. Architecture ==> Requirements ==> Skills ==> Recruitments ==> Estimated delivery time ==> Roadmap ==> This is how does it works. This is why i asked the safe architecture, but they don't have it, which caused some issues. From the side of NVO without maidsafe, the architecture is already made, you may have seen on the screen, you should have an idea about the features of the wallet, which means there was an architecture, requirements, skills. Now for the validator, i said that i will use blockstream tech, as element lets you use a sidechain who's purpose is to record trading informations to let people trade offline in a decentralized storage. I am working on this architecture, how to fully decentralize it, how not to keep controle over it. This is why i asked for a maidsafe architecture, the safe launcher have been replaced by safe browser, forked from https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker , i know about the next developments related to browsers as they want to change the way we use APIs and websockets, browsers want to implement the usage of P2P technologies and use them instead. My problematic here is that i don't want to get access to the private keys, this is why i talk about a decentralized exhcange, no one should have access to any information. I am not interested by self-encryption, i want to kepp nothing on the user-side, i checked it, and it is not what i was looking for, this is why i asked an architecture to know the full features, where will it go. It is totally legitimate to ask for such a document. I asked for this document as would have helped me to bring developers for maidsafe in order to work on the issues, the unfinished code, and what haven't started yet. Meanwhile, as i haven't got the document, i have a second project with personal working on it, i found solutions there and though it would be helpful, it is legitimate too, it would bring a fresh air in the project, but it went in a drama. I never said that we won't use maidsafe, as i can't help them, can't offer a technology, i can just wait, i said that in 4 months if they are not ready we will have to check for a different technology, and it have been said during the crowdsale.",False

I also said quite clearly I was not one of the investors.  ""we demanded an architecture which is normal but we have been unable to find it.""  It would be 'normal' to raise the $7M AFTER looking closely into maidsafe and how safenet works, not before.  ""This is why i asked the safe architecture, but they don't have it""  They do have it, but it is all in parts/sections. The documentation exists in massive repositories, each piece of the picture being bigger than many crypto projects are in their entirety.  There is a mountain of text, whitepapers, the wiki github, everything you need except a spoon fed single document of 10,000 pages that contains it all in one place.  ""Meanwhile, as i haven't got the document""  All the documentation is public. You can go and find whatever you want, don't expect very busy maidsafe devs to walk you through anything, just go an find whatever it is that you need, you've been told where the data is.  ""I do not need to listen to the podcasts or see videos, I need to see the code, I have done it, now I need to see the architecture""  You've done it? Have you looked on github? Have you seen how much code there is any how many sections/libraries. No human being could have taken a good look at their code in that time. It just sounds mad. Code for what. It's like saying 'I've had a good look at the code for the internet today, now someone tell me about the architecture'.  This is not some simple little DLT project which is contained all in one whitepaper.  ""What is missing, what is needed, what needs to be deployed and what are the means I have to deploy for NVO""  You can take a look at the roadmap to see what's missing, but really it is not so much a question of what is left to be done, but what can or do you want to help with? There are things left to be done everywhere. It is a huge beast of a project. They are working hard on datachains part2 now, but that's way too complicated for anyone to just dive into, perhaps you'd like to work on some simpler stuff around safecoin now that mutable data has advanced far enough as an easy way in, or if you want to help make the APIs as developer friendly as possible that might be a good place to start. To be honest, if I was skilled enough to help I'd be looking at the areas I had skills in and seeing what I could contribute, not demanding the conductor of a huge orchestra stop playing and walk you round introducing you to each instrumental section, or to give you a document that not only describes the song being played, but the employment rights of the musicians, the building plans and the accounting stuff for ticket sales. All these things are speerate and have their own areas, the conductor is too busy to walk anyone through it all, even someone who would like to help if they can. It is not an easy thing to help with, they hire very selectively and try to waste as little time as they can catchng up their own full time staff. They don't have time to personally take on catching up potential helpers who they don't know.  ""You should do some cleaning in the repo, keep it clean, you said you have migrated from safe launcher to a safe browser, but safe launcher is still there.""  It is still there for a reason, some app devs were using it for their own builds of mock routing... or something like that anyway. It will be removed when it is no longer being used by anyone.  ""Imagine that you builds a hotel, you're just going to tell him, that it is more beautiful compared to the ancient with more features. He won't care about that, he will ask you the plan to know where to begin.""  Great example, and if you take a hotel in this example what you are asking for is a single document that contains the building plans as well as the business plans for the hotel, the accounts, the grocery orders for the kitchen and the employee records. All these things exist, but not in one place, what part of this hotel are you interested in? It is all made out of code and all built in the digital world, but it has even more parts that are even more distinct than in these examples.  ""I hope you understand what I'm saying, it's simpler to make mine that's all.""  I am being completely honest and not facetious when I say that if you can make your own safenet before maidsafe has launched then I will absolutely apologise to you in a very public way. I would love for you to achieve those goals - 'privacy, security, freedom, for everyone'. That is what I really care about (I suppose I'd like to get rich off it too, but that isn't how I found crypto and it's not why I'm here). If you can win us those goals then I will become an evangelist for every future endeavour from you. The only thing that might help me sleep at night is a solution to the dystopian future of centralised control that looms over our heads. If you can save my kids from that then I will be forever grateful.  The reason I defend David Irvine is because he has been working hard to try and achieve that goal for over a decade and he has always been completely honest and transparent, and he has never done it for the money or to try to get rich - unlike most other projects in crypto.",False

Advice to the arguing sides  @Jabba if you want to do melodramas, go do them somewhere else, what is this are you supporting or are you challenging the NVO team, or are you simply having too much time so you've decided to waste someone else time.  By ""trying to help the investors"" you're only hurting all of us. All of us knew it is based on MaidSafe - a network that may or may not achieve the requirements NVO has, we still went consciously into NVO's project.  The only thing positive, not from you but from this ""Forum Drama"" is that @nemgun will try to make the network they need.

Some was scared regarding the recent events in China, and we refunded them. So yes, people are refunded whenever they ask for it, without even disturbing the escrows, why do you mingle into it, people on safenet have said they want to be refunded, they have been sent private messages, and they have not replied . Ton said he was going to put his own money and not the funds from the crowdsale, in order to spare the development as we withdrawn 9%, not 30% because it's enough for now, for the next milestone.  You should stop saying it's a beast, it's complicated, if you have the skills you can help on simple tasks. As long as we see maidsafe as an endless task, it will never end. There is no problem about the conductor to continue to play, I have nothing against that, he can play without interuption he is not disturbing me at all. But I will explain, it is a developement project, so to do a roadmap you need architecture, and if you can not give me this architecture I can not go ahead, I understand an architecture, But I do not understand random indications given to me. Imagine I am a contractor specializing in building, an old lady  having problems contacts me to help her. She tells me that the plumbing is broken, I would ask her where is the leak, where are the pipes, she would answer me asking to guess. I say okay, I'll guess their location and try to do some research. Once it's good, she tells me there's an infiltration in the house, I tell her ok I'll fix it. She will tell me that she has an electrical problem, I will ask her the electrical plans, she will answer me vaguely remember the indications of her husband ... I could give many more. Let me say that I repaired all the problems that she indicated to me, leaving the house I take the car to go home, the old lady calls me saying that there was a small earthquake and That her house was destroyed, I her why, and she replie that the pillars were rusty. Conclusion, everyone would have just lost his time and money trying to repair without taking into account the architectural aspect, and working blindly. We would have simply had to rebuild the house since the start. It's the same thing in development, especially when you have a beast, it's one more reason to make it architecture to avoid hacks, minimize the bugs ... Now, I said that one of our members would go to see maidsafe, offer them a global audit, it is normal all companies do it, and afterwards we will judge on what we can start seriously.",False

Too much panic and FUD taking place. I like the project and I finally figured out how to put a buy order in on Counterparty. As soon as I can get some more fiat converted to crypto, I plan to buy a bunch more.  The primary reason that this price is so low is due to it being traded on Counterparty. That platformed is so non-user-friendly that's I'm surprised that anyone actually figured out how to use. Had you guys used Waves platform instead, you would have a much better price and a much easier platform to maneuver. I was so frustrated that I almost gave up, but then I realized that if I'm having this much difficulty, a lot of other are probably experiencing the same frustration. I know that when this token gets listed on other exchanges, it's going to skyrocket. Even EtherDelta, which I haven't tried to use yet, is probably easier to maneuver than Counterparty.The whole issue with different addresses within CounterParty not being able to communicate and not being able to transfer funds from address to another within CounterParty is absurd. My thoughts are if a discombobulated contraption like CounterParty can exist and be worth nearly $10, NVO should be able to blow that figure out of the water.

Regarding the documentations, i don't agree with the usage of multiple whitepapers, even presidents write whitepapers, but they write only one because they have only one project. I asked for this architecture in order to planify the implementation of NVO into maidsafe, and also how will NVO help maidsafe. In exchange i received messages asking to send funds directly to maidsafe, and message asking to dig, i said that NVO will finance a part of the development. Instead, i have been directed to podcasts, which isn't how a development company works. Irvine asked me to check this link : https://safenetforum.org/c/community/podcasts Everyone can consult it, i found around 300 hours of podcasts there, if a developer costs 40$/hour, i would pay him 12.000$ to listen the podcasts, without starting to work. He would turn crazy imagine listening for that during 8 hours a day. Jabba, please don't troll me here, I'm really holding on to myself, i advise not to troll me or disrespect me. I advised to check an IT consultant, he would have said that it is catastrophic, because of this incident, and the lack of global architecture of maidsafe, i have to review the architecture of NVO and reverify it, it is not a problem, it will take about 2 weeks but i will get a result.  Once again, no one officially said that NVO ""pivoted"" from safenet, we gave a word and will stick to it. I said that you still have 3 months, maybe this Kick in the anthill will awake you. I said since a long time that if in 4 months if safenet isn't ready, we will have to consider different technologies.  Now, you provide a poor post saying that you are one of the supporters of maidsafe, and you haven't invested in NVO, so please don't say that NVO collected funds because of maidsafe. We loosed a lot of investors because ou choice for maidsafe.  People who invested on NVO did it for the success of the project, we have to lead it to a fruition, what ever the difficulties we will have to face. We can't be hypocritical. I remember of an old post of dirvine who said that NVO isn't listed on all the exchanges, comparing NVST to MAID, except that he forgot how he got listed, and how he got value on exchanges.  I know who helped irvine to list the coin, i won't talk in his name, but i can tell you that this person didn't knew about the results of the project in august 2017. I could ask you to check your promises on bnktothefuture and check your old roadmap, you shouldn't continue to talk like that, and start working instead of talking.  If i was a bad guy, i would have simply said that safenet isn't ready, and sleep while they work. But it is not what we want to do, we have been honest and straight.

As you have already been told, SAFE is too big to have a single all encompassing document. There is no single document to describe all the web architecture either. As neo pointed out to you  ""That is like asking for the unified (or single solidified) architecture for the internet protocols. You won’t get it and it doesn’t exist, incomplete overviews do exist. That is because the internet is made up of a number of protocols, TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, NTP, UseNet, and so on.  Similar while SAFE is being built there is not going to be any unified document of the architecture.""  Ok, now to this crazy youtube/podcast business you keep referring back to. David hasn't made any podcasts?! He has been interviewed a few times ofc, he linked you to all kinds of different data to get some background. Really, if you have already held the crowdsale one would have expected you to look properly at Maidsafe first no? The TEXT is all there for you to read. Whitepapers, repositories, code etc are all there for anyone brave enough to get stuck in. SAFE is not some simple little blockchain project that can be knocked out in a few months, it is new protocols and new layers of internet architecture.  If you take the time to look at the actual code and read the whitepapers and the blog or wiki you will find out just how big this beast really is and why you were laughed at for saying you'd knocked out a safenet 10.0 over the last two weeks.  As for getting an IT consultant to review it, jeepers, you do realise we have members of the community who have been in IT for over 40 years and worked on the original web protocols? It would be a hard job to find someone more qualified to review it all and it would take them many months, not a few days or even hours of dismissive confusion.  My post clearly said that those who did invest because of maidsafe (check my first post in this thread) would probably bail, which ofc they will, I did not say everyone only invested because of maidsafe - although I suspect many people will lose confidence seeing your break away from them.  Your comments about getting listed on exchanges etc don't make any sense. You do realise Maid was listed in 2014 as an omni asset and it went straight on polo after breaking crowdsale records at the time (modest by modern standards)? Maid went on exchanges because there was huge demand for it then, that's also why it was a top 10 asset on coinmarketcap for 2 years. I don't know what the reference to bnktothefuture are about, that was a recent raise and no one has ever made any 'promises'. You are talking trash and there is zero substance to it.  I don't think you're a bad guy, I think you are arrogant and naive. I also think you'll feel the consequences of your mistakes over the last 24 hours much sooner than you think.  I was not trolling you and I will not continue this discussion if you don't want me to, but you have to let me respond to your crazy and inaccurate statements. What kind of $100M+ project is based on podcasts?! Of course text and code is all that matters. Did you watch any of those ""300""??!! hours? Was David on any of them? Please check your facts before you slander good people. There is no single document because it is a huge machine with many cogs, all of which are clearly documented. David never solicited you for money, that was a forum user, David just said if you want to give them money they'd take it.  Anyway, I didn't invest so there's no need for me to get any more involved. I just felt bad for having spoken up for the project when there was criticism early in that thread. I've learned my lesson and will just stay out of it unless I really know better next time. It is a shame, you are a good guy and we were becoming friends, but you've walked so far in the wrong direction now that I fear it will be too hard to turn back to the right course by the time you realise your mistake and what SAFE is about to become.

However, there's nothing wrong with being 26 - just a lot wrong with being arrogant, abrasive, ignorant, untruthful, threatening, and the likes  Welcome to the forum, are you an investor to say that the investors want to be refunded ? I concluded that your unique problem is the funds collected by the crowdsale as it apears to be bothering you, we won't give money blindly to maidsafe, as many users in the safenetforum wants to. I said that we were ready to fund developers to work on maidsafe, as only an architecture can provide the requirements, which will result in the required skills, it alse tells you where you are, and where you are going, i have been asked to dig in order to find these answers, this is how i understood that the project is managed in a chaotic way. The only way to solve the issue is to delet everything and start with an architecture, a starting plan, something organized and ordered, and most of all structured. Be sure that i asked Yani, myself, developers and two consultants wether they could work with the actual state, they said no because it is disoredered and they have troubles to find a starting point. that's why i said that it would be better to erase everything and start with new basics, as it is like asking a builder to build a home without a plan, there will be no harmony, no sismic calculation, it is the same. I am giving examples to carry a message i want you to understand. The result would be simply offered to the maidsafe community, but i see that it annoyed you, i have been asked to give money instead, people mocking me, no one even tried to know what i was talking about. I offered a technology, developers, a smart investment, and no Jabba i don't have time to investigate, i too busy to try to help maidsafe in the background, one of the team members will soon meet David Irvine, he will simply tell him, if you need a logical help, no problem, and we ask nothing in return. Else you have a solution in the next 3 months, it is very simple.  I am abrasive when i see something wrong, it is normal that i get angry. I just asked something elementary, the order, your organization. No one answered that. The subject have even been rerouted to the kardashians.",False

I'm all for young people . I was all for nemgun when I first heard about the project and spoke to him in PM. But if you were in school uniform for two years after the birth of a project then it's probably wise to be a tiny bit humble and recognise that you have very little experience next to these other folks though. It was just the audacity of it that got me. Vitalik never showed this kind of disrespect to David and he was younger with more achievements behind him, they discussed the differences in their approaches and philosophies in a civilised way, and Vitalik showed and was shown respect. I apologise if I came off as age-ist, that was not my intent. I was just trying to hammer home why he should maybe be a little bit humble before he really knows what he is talking about - there is no way he can understand what SAFE is or how it really works yet, it takes weeks/months of dedicated work for that, even for a super-bright young coder with lots of blockchain experience (since SAFE is nothing like a blockchain).  Anyway, I get your point, I should not be so personal. I just feel a little betrayed since I stood up for nvo and quite liked numgun before yesterday's episode. Cheeky bugger speaking to David like that with no evidence, really made me angry and upset me... as you can probably tell.  Anyway, I'll leave it there. People can make up their own minds.",False

You keep repeating yourself and ignoring the response.  What is about SAFE specifically that you want to learn about? Do you want to learn about Data Chains (more effort than learning about blockchain from scratch), or do you want to learn about Routing (that's a really big one and not for the faint of heart), or Data republish, or Node ageing, do you just want to take a look through the APIs? Perhaps you want to see more on how the economics and farming rewards will work? Or is SAFEcoin itself more interesting to you?  OORRRRR do you want to see some very broad big picture stuff so you can find out where you want to dive in? If you want the broad big picture stuff to get the 10,000 ft view then yes, I'd say the blog and some of the videos and podcasts are a great place to START. There are not 300 hours there and David has only appeared in handful of them, but there are plenty of good ones to get you started. Once you get a picture of how all the pieces fit together THEN you can dive into specific things with plenty of documentation to guide you - RFCs, mountains of code, plenty of text write ups and whitepapers, mathematical analysis and a dedicated developer forum to ask questions in etc.  You went to David with a question like ""So, this new internet thing, how does it work, I want a single document explaining it all for me?"" He is way too busy to guide anyone through the answer to that question. Of course there is no short answer to it. As he said, dive in and ask questions. It is hard work, many developers who are used to much simpler ideas and projects do shy away from it. Its value is not determined by the ease with which you can grasp it all from documentation in one place though. Its value will come from the utility of the product if it works - just like the current web it seeks to replace.  I don't know why you keep referring to the podcasts rather than all the text links. You already had your crowdsale, you should already have the 10,000ft view. I think the reason David gave those links as well is because you did not seem to understand what SAFE is or how it works. You said you had created safenet10.0 on your own in a few days. Of course that sounds crazy, so David linked you to information that would help a noob get the big picture of how it all works. You didn't even bother to investigate though, you just declared that you know best and the project can't work because it is too big to put in one document.  I do get emotional about maidsafe because it is a very important project. That browser you love so much was built by someone in the community with donations funded by us last year - before crypto exploded and money was more of an issue. I personally donated 1btc towards it back then. You are right that I feel passionately about this, but I think I do it for the right reasons.  No one wants or needs nvo money though - apart from your investors.  BIGbtc, a random forum member, kept asking for it, that's just his way. No one else is trying to solicit money from you. Please show me any evidence of anyone from maidsafe asking for money when not in response to being offered it?

I was lucky to have a computer at the age of 3 years, you should know that all developers says they had access to a computer from their young age, the thing is that today my Son have a smart phone, he have access to a much more powerful computer than what I had, so the future generation will be much more impressive than the one of which I am a part. Simply because they will adapt more easily to computers and new technologies than me.  The problem is that when we see someone like David Irvine, we expect to see something more ordered and disciplined because they he have the necessary experience to understand that everything must be ordered. On the other hand, what put me off is that i haven't found an architecture, nor this order at maidsafe, instead i have found podcasts.  With age I would start to lose my memory, I will have to start writing everything, arrange it, put it in place so as not to forget it, and don't lose people around me. It was an education I received from my father, and I have been punished all my life for discipline and order. I applied this method and it is thanks to that that I succeed in my career.  Now that I have recruited a mentor, spokesperson and representative who arranges and structures my ideas, validates the work done, I am lucky that he is an IT consultant whom I seek advices from, very Respectuous, resonable, and I told him that I can have many ideas and that I need help to structure all that, you can say that he does a lot of baby sitting with me , i know that i have defects and I try to correct them.  But to say that I betrayed maidsafe simply because I pointed out the error committed by David Irvine is serious. I remind you that at 40-50 years you can remarry, make a normal life again, it is not like you were 70 years old. But when there is something, I can not be hypocritical and silent, it is not my style. And I was not disrespectful, I was threatening yes with development, it is my right to ask my supplier to do his job properly because I have to answer my investors, it is not logical that the core tells you to dig when you ask for information, or that it does not have time to talk and redirecting to the podcasts.  It is also my right to give my personal opinion when I say that it is managed like an IT sect, because I can not imagine a developer listening to 300 hours of podcasts, at the rate of 8 hours a day, he would go crazy, That's why I said to delete them because they have no utility.",False

You should do some cleaning in the repo, keep it clean, you said you have migrated from safe launcher to a safe browser, but safe launcher is still there.

Quote from: greyskies on July 31, 2017, 01:49:41 PM Oh look at what I posted whilst the fund raiser was being carried out and no-one listened to me:  Quote from: greyskies on May 19, 2017, 12:17:51 PM There's some big warning signs here.  Firstly, it's a decentralised exchange but the key part of the code won't be open source or explained? That's a fail straight away.  Secondly, I'm highly skeptical they have a bullet proof algorithm in place. It looks to me like they are just hoping to raise a ton of money and figure it all out later on - hardly fair on investors. Either that or it's a carbon copy of one of the existing DEX algorithms that are working out in the wild - e.g. Blocknet.  If you guys can't answer questions on how it works, you are not going to inspire shrewd investors to part with their money. Blocknet for example uses check lock time verify to lock up the funds used for the cross chain trading swaps until the transaction is complete. It has anti-ddos measures in place to prevent orderbook spam. People run the service nodes which handle the trading fees, masternodes cost 5000 Block and collect a proportion of the fees. And so on. How do the validators handle all of this?  ""It looks to me like they are just hoping to raise a ton of money and figure it all out later on""  Well, if we were interested by the funds, we would have taken the 30% of the first milestone directly, however, we took just what we need around 9%, we don't want to waste the funds.

So what I'm asking is the global plan, I give you an example:  When you take a mason to build a house, he asks you the architectural plan, you do not tell him dig, or check with the neighbor he will explain better, or go see the plumber he has an idea, or dig well you will find Chalk and you will understand what I mean, or even learn. He already knows his job, he already know how to build and you ask him to learn ?  Imagine that you builds a hotel, you're just going to tell him, that it is more beautiful compared to the ancient with more features. He won't care about that, he will ask you the plan to know where to begin.  It's the same thing when you say you're going to do an internet 2.0, you need a plan, imagination is good, but you have to write it down and order it. And so you understood that if I have to recruit developers for maidsafe, I will just lose money by telling them dig, you have months and weeks paid to dig. This is a fundamental explanation because it means that you still have nothing at all, you tell people, understand our idea, and invent it, that's why I said I will do My own safenet if you do not manage to do it because I have to find out yours by myself. I hope you understand what I'm saying, it's simpler to make mine that's all. Understand that you still have not started serious things, simply because of lack of structure. A lot of people could understand what I said.  Soon a team member will meet David, he will ask if we can send someone for a global audit, in order to prepare an architecture, the reports will be shared by both teams, the audit would give a global note, an architecture we could publish publicly, from there, we could all work more seriously, it is the most professional solution i can offer. If we have a negative note from the audit, we would have to go for a different technology, something more reliable and realisable, It is enough just to be honest and to put to the evidence.",False

Now admittedly I don't understand the coding and network side of hows its built so there maybe there is some way it can be done that I'm not aware of. I would make the project open source through github; otherwise it does come off as brash and arrogant to raise millions for a promised project built on the network essentially saying ""Hey we trust this network enough to build our project on it"" then turn around and say ""Wait nevermind the project is too disorganized and cluttered to build our project on it so we're going to build the project on our own network."" That sounds both very unrealistic and makes the team look disorganized on top of it because now the roadmap and details have changed and that in turn makes NVO look like a pipe dream to investors.

What is alarming indeed is the fact that this comes out within the first month after ico ended.

Regarding the website, it will soon be updated, we prefered focusing on the distribution and development, we didn't found the time to properly work on it, however, in the next few days the website will be updated.  Thanks for your feedbacks, the team really appreciates them.  Regarding the sweep process, there are some issues with counterwallet however, we found an alternative confirmed by the counterParty community : https://github.com/Jpja/Sweep-XCP-Paperwallet  Just ensure that you put the right name : NVST and to set the miner's fees to 0.0008 BTC or higher.    Hello.  Is this related to 1st august? So exporting I mean having ownership of the BTC private key from couterwallet  is not enough?   So form reading the info of that page: https://github.com/Jpja/Sweep-XCP-Paperwallet  i have understood that i should do the following:  1) Install electrum wallet on my computer 2) generate a new BTC address 3) send all my BTC from counter wallet to this new address generated in electrum 4) download the sweep.html from https://github.com/Jpja/Sweep-XCP-Paperwallet 5) follow the instructions from that page and send NVST from address in counterwallet to the new address that was generated in electrum.  Please can you confirm this?! Also if anybody has already done that by using this sweep.html can you confirm that it works?  Thanks.   Hello, yes many exchanges are slowly disabling their bitcoin wallets because of 1st August. Your method is one of the many possible ways to do it, you can also create an address using coinb.in and send the tokens there using either Jpja's repo, coindaddy's public API, or counterwallet.  Regarding 1st August and its effect, nothing will harm you as long as you have the private key of your bitcoin addresseS. As of my informations,3 splits could happen, but what ever happens, as long as you have your private keys, you are safe.  Yani reported many successfull sweeps using Jpja's repo.

I have checked the price of NVST and it is encouraging, at the end of the crowdsale, the price was 18k satoshi, now 32k satoshi, it is really good. Bittrex haven't replied yet, i think they have a lot of demands, thus delaying the response as there was a lot of crowdsales recently.    Quote from: resu12 on July 16, 2017, 12:19:01 PM Withdrew some coins from Poloniex. But since then they are still stuck on Poloniex and are ""Awaiting Approval"" for no reason. Many other users are experiencing similar problems with this exchange (with some waiting for weeks without support replies). Any centralized exchange have full control of your funds and can play with them as they wish. It's hard to trust them, but nevertheless we need exchanges.  That's why I invested in NVO and wish full success to this project. Good luck devs. Please deliver us a great, revolutionary exchange and send NVST to the moon Mars !  We are on it, we already started working, the result will be just excellent, we will keep you informed. we will soon contact maidsafe to organize a schedule and start working with them too.

We already have a tiny volume on NVST, it is not really satisfying, we asked for listing on cryptopia, and bittrex doesn't replies. Actually, i think that bittrex is too busy with all the ERC20 bullshit, as ETH is just a good hype today. We will have to wait for gmaxwell an lukejr to calm down jihan with uasf, as jihan thinks that he is the king with his radiators. Once this period passes, the pressure will go down, which will give a clearer vision to the exchanges and reput ETH to its place with his hyped smart contracts, I have never seen as many crowdsales in my life as since the appearance of the ERC20 tokens, and it looks liketo be a big priority for the exchanges, whereas it is bullshit in my eyes. Bancor made a crowdsale of 156 million USD and today they are 80 million USD, investors have lost over half the value of their investment, I think Ethereum is definitely bullshit. Apparently Jihan wants to redo the splitting scenario (Like ETH and ETC) with Bitcoin, but I do not think it will work, Bitcoin is not bullshit like ethereum, Bitcoin has allowed other Blockchains to be developed like nem, stratis, nexus, shit ethereum, blackcoin (which I like very much), litecoin (which is very good), whereas today ethereum has solved the problem of stupid hypers, Making it easier for them to write whitepapers, since they are not able to do it, that's why there are many of them, they put more marketing in the whitepaper than anything else, it's more an advertisement paper. I do not worry too much about NVO, because it is going to do its decentralized exhcage, and bring the centralized in the right track, because they are more interested in the quantity than the quality of the projects. Ethereum was at 0.2 BTC not long ago, now it is a 0.075 BTC, more than half the market cap is lost, while Bitcoin lost just 30%, mostly due to a miner, it is normal as Bitcoin is a POW crypto, compared to the ethereum which loses nearly 60% of its value, without any problem, apart from may be the transition to POS but it's been running for a long time, their biggest loss I think is due to their smart contracts, the ERC20 tokens are killing Ethereum, and it's not finished yet, maybe they're going to raise in September, and then we will wait for the next scam next year, it's always like that with Ethereum. I bet Ethereum must be beging god to make Bitcoin raise to help them go up, because when Bitcoin comes up, everyone gets up.",False

But I'll try to make this as simple as possible for everyone:   Where will my tokens be sent?  Your tokens are sent to a Bitcoin Wallet Address that you control.  That address is:  1. If you sent BTC from a wallet you control, the tokens would have been sent there. 2. If you sent BTC from an exchange or some other place that you do not control, you need to contact the devs directly.  You didn't follow the instructions, and they have to manually address that. 3. If you sent AltCoins, you should have listed a personal BTC wallet address that you control in the nvo.io crowdfunding site, and they were sent there. 4. If you sent AltCoins without listing a BTC wallet address or listed a BTC exchange address, see #2.   How do I view my tokens?  Now that we've established WHERE your tokens went, there's a question of how to view them.  Two options.  1. If the BTC wallet is accessible on CounterParty, log in there and they should simply be visible as NVST. 2. If the BTC wallet is NOT on CounterParty, type in the public key (NOT Private Key) at: http://xchain.io and you will see a list of them there.   What can I do with my tokens?  Right now?  Not much.  You can trade them in private person-to-person transactions if you want to, at whatever values you and the other party agree to.  But otherwise, you simply wait for them to get listed at an exchange and a market established for them.  The developers should really be providing information on whether they are working with exchanges, the status and timing of that, etc.    EDIT: It appears there is a very limited market established on the CounterParty wallet site, so you can buy and sell NVST there and convert to XCP, which have a more established market value.  However, the number of buy and sell orders are extremely limited, so it's not a liquid market now.  Thus, buyer and seller beware.    What are my tokens worth?  Will I make a profit?  This is a free market.  The tokens will be worth what someone is willing to pay for them.  Think of them as an ownership share of future profits from the exchange.  If people suspect the exchange will be more profitable, the value of the tokens will go up, and vice-versa.  If the exchange fails, they will go towards $0.  There is no guarantee of profits - if there were, everyone would have invested.  Crowdsales and ICOs inherently are risky by nature.   What about my NVSX?  NVSX are how the exchange will distribute a share of its profits to the owners of NVSTs.  They will not exist or be relevant until the exchange is up and running.  If you own 1% of the NVST tokens, and the exchange distributes $10,000 in fees it generates, then you will get $100 worth of NVSX tokens.  Developers: I think this is accurate, but I am a random person here.  You should be creating something like this, and plastering it all over your website and emailing it to your all crowdfund participants.  You'd save yourself a ton of trouble and get critical information to all your investors.  It's really pretty ridiculous that your website timeline is not even updated to say the Crowdsale is over, let alone having any useful information added.",False

I spent 3 minutes writing up that FAQ a couple of posts above.  If you did that on day #1 and posted it on the website, the 5 minutes you spent on something like that would have saved you many, many hours of time answering redundant questions, and would have saved hundreds of investors a lot of frustration and confusion and endless back and forth on these forums.  Doing all the distributions and then updating the website with information that's no longer important is a much less efficient approach.  At this point, I'm not sure there's much to be done.  But in the future, my advice is to put communication about problems at the top of the list, and then address them after, instead of having the whole community in an extended state of confusion.",False

We might need to export the private key from ledger to some other wallet like jaxx. 2. We can enter our public address at the website xchain.io and see the balance of tokens that have been sent to us and are now associated with our bitcoin wallet. I have done this and it works. Put your public bitcoin address into the search box (the bitcoin address of your Nano S that you gave to nvo when you sent your funds) and it should show you how many tokens you have. As I said, it worked for me. 3. I found this simple app that someone has designed for the Ledger Nano S to enable us to receive and send tokens. I am new to this and not a programer and so I still have to understand properly how to use this app. The first link is to a ""live' copy of the app and the second is for the discussion thread where I found it. https://ledger-cp.herokuapp.com/ https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/5l0i2c/ledger_blue_and_counterparty/  That is it so far; I hope this helps.

NVSX will have a fixed price of $0.99 and can be traded for Bitcoin automatically using Counterparty exchange or through the validator without fees. NVST price will not be fixed and will be decided by the market.  NVST and NVSX are not the same. NVSX will be issued proportionally to the amount of fees collected by the validator’s usage.  do you see an operational exchange that collects fees? I do not,False

This is a discussion, a place to ask questions and an opportunity for us who 'want to' or 'need to' know to 'meet with' and 'gain knowledge from' those who do know and want to share their knowledge. Please let's all stay civilised.  I for one do understand why I have invested and have read the applicable white papers but still do not yet understand the language and specifics of this subject. Nevertheless, I want to know and want to learn and am certain many others do too, which is why we have come to this forum. Without forums like this it becomes much more difficult for 'those in the know' to tutor 'those in the dark'. Surely it is beneficial for the community as a whole to enable and facilitate learning so that the community can grow.  Without a doubt, people often don't read, don't pay attention, don't concentrate, don't follow instructions, don't listen, don't act logically and don't do what 'we' think they should do.

Bounties? There were no token bounties.  Quote from: wiked1 on July 05, 2017, 03:20:18 PM Developers should absorb bounties with buy support so price NEVER goes lower than initial price. No. They should let the market decide the price of the token.

A few comments for the developers:  1. Stop spending all your time blaming your customers for their mistakes.  Yes, we get it - you're unhappy they didn't read the instructions and it's caused you a bunch of extra work.  However, when tons of people do it, perhaps the problem was in the quality of the instructions.  This should be of special concern to a company who's key goal is to build a simple easy-to-use interface.    2. Stop using this thread and Slack as your only means of communications.  You have a website.  Use it to post updates where everyone can see them, instead of people having to hunt through message boards to find the latest news.  Your website hasn't been updated at all since the crowdsale ended.  Posting updates is not hard - or at least, it shouldn't be for people who saying they can set up a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange.  And it's a whole hell of a lot more efficient that posting individual responses to a bunch of message board posts.    3. Don't do ridiculous things like post on twitter that people can get their money back, without any explanation of why you're suddenly offering that service or what has changed.  A medium that limits you to 140 characters and is not remotely read by the majority of your investors is not the appropriate venue for a gigantic piece of news like that.  EDIT: You also have everyone's email addresses when they signed up for your Crowdsale.  That's another route to communicating with people that ensures that everyone sees it instead of just whoever's on these random forums.  You raised upwards of $7 million from a lot of people.  That's great and means a lot of people believe in your project.  You have to now act like the leaders of a legitimate company, instead of acting like children on a message board and being annoyed that people want information about the money they gave you.  You have a responsibility to communicate openly and clearly with the people that put their faith in you and invested in you.  ",False

Because we put warnings and other notifications and guides in relation to the crowdsale.  We give them the possibility to rectify these errors either by PM on bitcointalk or by slack. Because I take care of bitcointalk with my only pseudo, nemgun, @marto on slack, do not consult anyone else except us.  After these eight hours we will send close to 14258500 NVST.  Investors who have committed the error of sending from an exchange or another service and who do not follow the guides, will have to forward their UserID TransactionID Email address ID skype and their time zone either via bitcointalk by sending me a PM Or by slack by sending a DM to @marto.

We said of course, but suggested some mechanism to help that happen would be required. Routing for example is way to much to jump into (for most). So we think there will be willing on both sides to get some further help. I think that it would be great if ICO type raises on particular networks did use capacity themselves to ""fund"" core development. It would be a nice model that I have seen elements of in c++ etc. (boost) but even just this kind of offer is a good start.  So @tonbi it will be very helpful if this all happens, best of luck and here's to a fair tail wind.  Lets all hope it helps us improve speed of delivery or testing etc. It's not easy to plug devs into safe core libs, but it's not impossible either, we need to get better at it so this will be good from that perspective to. ""  Reply from Nemgun:  ""Hi @dirvine, Alex told us about your meeting, and about the great updates, for now i am ocnsolidating the dev team and try to find versatile developers,  i always ask for two conditions, knowledge about blockstream and safenet, i talked to a dev team, i won't give their name but i have their principle agreement,  i made an offer as their development is close to be finished in exchange, they will assign their developers to the project for some hours a day, and tasks, this will be financed by nvo, in the objective to provide support to maidsafe and to try to synchronise both projects. Effectively the developers aren't easy to find,  so as soon as i finish the consolidation of our dev platform, and have a good visibility and check for their proffessionalism (i don't want anyone of them to leave us on the way) i will ask maidsafe for a meeting to see what we can do.  It will be up to maidsafe to take the final decision.

In fact, scrolling through it mentions importing private keys to counterwallet or NVOT wallet multiple times.  Quote If you are sending Bitcoin, Do not send from an exchange, pool or most online wallets and services, as you don’t control private keys. You will lose NVOT.  1. In the Personal bitcoin address section, submit a bitcoin address you control private keys. This is mainly used for depositing with altcoins. If you send with Bitcoin, NVOT will be sent to the address you used to send Bitcoin. So if you deposit twice with Bitcoin using two different addresses each time, NVOT will be sent separately to those two addresses.  2. Choose the cryptocurrency you want to use for deposit, copy address and send funds.  3. Wait until crowdsale is over for NVOT to be sent out to your address submitted in Personal bitcoin address section if sent using altcoins.  There is only 1 Bitcoin address for all participations, whereas each participant gets an unique address for depositing with altcoins with a balance checker. A normal bitcoin wallet is fine for holding NVOT, but you won’t be able to “see” and “send” the NVOT unless you are using a CounterWallet. Later, NVO wallet will also support NVOT, so you can send or import private keys.  If you are unsure on which bitcoin wallet to use, you can send Bitcoins from Copay, or JAXX, or Exodus. These wallets are more user friendly for new users. You can also use the links listed in Personal bitcoin address section.",False

For someone who invested 1 BTC in the crowdsale and who now will HODL approximately 5,000 tokens, this would amount to a continuous passive-income stream of about $1,500 per month, received in bitcoin (?) directly to your associated BTC address connected to your NVO.  A pretty nice setup for sure  To do this, the exchange would have to spin out about $150,000 worth of commission income per day (a penny per 15 million NVOT tokens) and to get to that, at 0.2% vig rate (half of the 0.004 total charged to maker/taker) they'll have to be moving about $750,000,000 (750 Million) $75,000,000 (75 Million) thru the exchange on a daily basis (NOTE: Edited per correction below, my bad math LOL sorry).  Yes it's a big number for a startup company that hasn't barely even written ANY code yet, LOL, but to me it's do-able.  Just pulling a random guess number out of my ass I'm giving it about 20% odds of success on 80% odds of failure: that means maybe lose a bitcoin today, that's worth about $2500, at eighty percent likely (let's be real: ICO's are gambling LOL) but on the other hand, 20% odds of having a permanent, continuous passive income of $18,000 per year in a couple years...?

I love the idea but I would never invest in something I can't have a saying in how to develop or run the product unless I have conducted business with this person before.

I bought NVOs with ETC and ETH. However, now, the webpage does not accept my password. Trying to get a new one and it even does not recognize my email. Trying to contact the support and I do not get any reply, not even an automatic reply. What?s going on?  Thanks  I can sign with my Bitcoin escrow address or with the ETH or ETC addresses to proof my payments to NVO  Just keep trying... but the good news for you that it should not matter if you lose access to the webpage. This is because the tokens will be sent to the addresses you deposited funds with. Just keep those and the private keys carefully until you regain access.   Thanks, Today better. I got a reply from support. However, I am still out. They offer me to try the  'forgot password' button. Of course I did that several times but  I wastold that my e-mail address was unknown. Today, slighty better, but still not right, I get the message ""Please check your emails for a confirmation email."" But I keep not getting any email. Support also offers me to join the slack, but I also tried that several times since yesterday , but I still did not get the invitation in my inbox, neither in the spam folder. So, nothing. I will wait for the token distrubution and I hope the NVOs to be in my scrow bitcoin address. Anyway, I found all this a little bit weird....  Regards",False

What you gave was your public key, when they distribute the NVO you must find your private key and import that to their website. Just be patient for the BTC you deposited to show up though.  The Dashboard on NVO.IO doesn't track the Bitcoins deposits, it is not required because of the escrow address, anyone can check the state of its transaction on the blockchain directly. The most important is not to send from wallet services like blockchain.info, coinmama or exchanges like poloniex, bittrex, or services like gambling. The bitcoins must be sent from the entered address on the dashboard, and this address have to be a private bitcoin address whom you own the private key.  Because you will receive the Tokens into the address you send from.   I have sent from https://wallet.counterwallet.io/  after exporting the private key.  I hope this is OK  otherwise please instruct me what can I  do to resolve the problem?   Thanks.    Nothing more to instruct, you did it the right way.

The most important is not to send from wallet services like blockchain.info, coinmama or exchanges like poloniex, bittrex, or services like gambling. The bitcoins must be sent from the entered address on the dashboard, and this address have to be a private bitcoin address whom you own the private key.  Because you will receive the Tokens into the address you send from.     Quote from: thesavoyard on June 26, 2017, 05:29:08 PM One last question, why does the bitcoin escrow address not have a balance next to it? I sent BTC there.  It doesn't have a balance because originally, people were confused about it, and though it was their address.     Quote from: bkbirge on June 26, 2017, 05:45:29 PM I really hope the devs stagger their crypto sells at the conclusion of this ICO.  Also, I think if I ever manage to start up a coin and go ICO I will definitely figure out a way to either explain better or code around the whole ""can't fund ICO from exchanges"" thing, it is not that complicated once understood but half the thread is about this and I'm pretty sure they could have raised a lot more funding without the confusion. Anyway, a day out and nvo looks like it's going to be a funding success, here's to the devs following through on their plans for a future exchange!    Thanks for the feedback, you are right somehow, but the problem is that it is not as easy as what you think, there is a lot of users who still relies on web services to use Bitcoin, that's why the concept of the crowdsale is kind of difficult to understand for some. Usually you login, click on some buttons, and then you have address to send to, after that you have your tokens. The NVO crowdsale is different.

I sent BTC there.  I have the same question. I send bitcoin yesterday. Transaction is confimed by bitcon network. But there is no bitcoin balance in nvo.io no zero no nothing. Why? Alcoins show just zero balance and they should because I have not made any deposit by them. But why there is no bitcoin balance?

Anything is better than centralized exchanges telling you what you can and cannot do with your own money. They're basically banks without the government backed insurance.  Yes i heard about it, i am sorry for the guys who have ETH stuck there, it is really bad for ETH as most of its volume is coming from Poloniex. Yesterday even coinbase had issues.

Or will you publish them at some time? Because at the moment there are so many changes on the market ( ) and it would be interesting to see which rates you are calculating with  At the end of the crowdsale we will get the rate to calculate the conversion, after that, we will check all the balances and calculate the price of the token.

Thank you. I did not receive anything either, but I do not think it is needed, as long as your transaction is there, everything is fine.  On a different topic, I have a question, since the crowdsale is about to end, what it is going to happen if someone sends a transaction but the crowdsale ends before getting a confirmation? Does he receive his money back? Or since the transaction was sent before the end of the crowdsale he will get his tokens?  Yes, as long as it have been sent.

The CounterWallet web-wallet now CANNOT import an address via private key: it only now ""sweeps"" which is not really sufficient!!!  This needs to be made more clear by all here who are recommending use of the CounterWallet I think.  It's leading to some confusion.  2. ANY ADDRESS for which you have the proper, correct private key WILL BE OKAY to use for the NVO crowdsale address, but...  2a. ... we will not be able to ACCESS our NVO tokens until after either the NVO wallet itself is able to support NVO tokens...  2b. ... OR we may be able to access our NVO tokens IF/WHEN the CounterWallet (or another counterparty-supporting wallet) enables priv key IMPORT (and not just ""sweep"" functionality)  3. Our NVO Tokens WILL be able to be ""SEEN"" at least, upon issue at the end of the crowdsale, by using a counterparty 'explorer' such as https://xchain.io/  4. But, again, just being able to ""SEE"" them via https://xchain.io/ will not allow them to be moved, transferred, sold, etc... UNTIL such time as real wallet support becomes working (again either via NVO Wallet itself or maybe privkey import feature in something like CounterWallet  SO: Bottom Line...  1. IF you have just a privkey and address that's not coming from CounterWallet... be prepared to just HODL awhile after crowdsale is complete.  (Personally this is what I'm going to be doing, using my custom generated address from VanityGEN)  -OR-  2. IF you absolutely MUST have ""access"" to your NVO Tokens immediately upon crowdsale completion (not just ""see"" them) then you absolutely MUST ONLY USE THE COUNTERWALLET with it's own internal ""native"" bitcoin address *ONLY*... and ""sweeping"" some other address there via a priv key IS NOT GONNA WORK.  ---  This is my current understanding of the situation... hope it helps to clear up any confusion over the last couple days.

Anyway the tokens are kept in the owner's possession.  Please correct me if I said something wrong.",False

In due time, guides will be issued, but if you are really worried, you can join on slack and the team will guide you.

I am still reading thru all the ANN thread to be sure I understand everything before investing, but time running short LOL and I'm still only on page 33 at the moment, so I wanted to jump ahead here to the end and ask a question (hope this is not a repeat of anything earlier, apologies if so...)  Anyway, SO, okay... I understand I need to use a bitcoin address where I have the private key FOR SURE, for this to work in the future.  I used VANITYGEN to make up my own custom ""1nvo..."" address for this.  So far so good.  Was able to import this address into a web wallet for SENDING the bitcoins, so that should be okay?  And/OR if in the future there's any problem about whatever web wallet I'll use for this (OmniWallet or blockchain.info, whatever) as long as I have preserved the priv key everything should be okay to access my NVO value in whatever other way is best at that time (the NVO wallet itself, presumably...?)  My QUESTION is about the CounterWallet alternative, that's also been noted earlier in this thread.  I made a wallet account there and looked to see IF it was possible to add my VANITY ADDRESS via private key, BUT it appears that CounterWallet only will SWEEP a balance from an entered private key and put the funds, instead, onto it's OWN address???  Repeat: CounterWallet does not seem to be able to directly ""ADD"" a bitcoin address using a private key (unless I misunderstood something there?)  So, Is this correct?  And, if so, please clarify my understanding that THIS IS NOT what we need for correct working of the crowdsale... yes?  On the contrary -- seems to me that use of the CounterWallet address is ONLY advised to be by way of their OWN address in the wallet (albeit, yes, they provide private key) and ONLY because this wallet will allow us to ""SEE"" our NVO tokens right away (as ""counterparty"" assets?) whereas using another wallet and bitcoin private key will require us to WAIT a bit (but, how long?) to be able to see our purchased tokens, after the crowdsale is over....?  Again, is my understanding of this correct?  Please advise.  Bottom line, I'd prefer to use my custom vanity address for this IF possible, as long as it won't take TOO long after the crowdsale is over to be able to confirm my purchase in the NVO wallet itself: if it's gonna be MONTHS later, well, then maybe it'd be better to use the address provided in the CounterWallet system instead.  Thanks in advance for reply.  Hope this was clear enough question LOL   You are right about allwhat you said, except that you can your balance using counterparty explorer, or https://xchain.io/ Yes, they sweep the address, because they consider that it is unsafe, the problem here is that you have a vanity address.  You can still keep it as is, and retreive the address using xchain, and create transactions manually. Or wait untill NVO releases a wallet update. It is all up to your decision.  Feel free to ask if you have more questions, you can join us on slack too.   OK so just to follow up on my question and Nemgun's answer...  1. The CounterWallet web-wallet now CANNOT import an address via private key: it only now ""sweeps"" which is not really sufficient!!!  This needs to be made more clear by all here who are recommending use of the CounterWallet I think.  It's leading to some confusion.  2. ANY ADDRESS for which you have the proper, correct private key WILL BE OKAY to use for the NVO crowdsale address, but...  2a. ... we will not be able to ACCESS our NVO tokens until after either the NVO wallet itself is able to support NVO tokens...  2b. ... OR we may be able to access our NVO tokens IF/WHEN the CounterWallet (or another counterparty-supporting wallet) enables priv key IMPORT (and not just ""sweep"" functionality)  3. Our NVO Tokens WILL be able to be ""SEEN"" at least, upon issue at the end of the crowdsale, by using a counterparty 'explorer' such as https://xchain.io/  4. But, again, just being able to ""SEE"" them via https://xchain.io/ will not allow them to be moved, transferred, sold, etc... UNTIL such time as real wallet support becomes working (again either via NVO Wallet itself or maybe privkey import feature in something like CounterWallet  SO: Bottom Line...  1. IF you have just a privkey and address that's not coming from CounterWallet... be prepared to just HODL awhile after crowdsale is complete.  (Personally this is what I'm going to be doing, using my custom generated address from VanityGEN)  -OR-  2. IF you absolutely MUST have ""access"" to your NVO Tokens immediately upon crowdsale completion (not just ""see"" them) then you absolutely MUST ONLY USE THE COUNTERWALLET with it's own internal ""native"" bitcoin address *ONLY*... and ""sweeping"" some other address there via a priv key IS NOT GONNA WORK.  ---  This is my current understanding of the situation... hope it helps to clear up any confusion over the last couple days.  Ton, Yanni, Nemgun, Lauda, etc... please clarify my understanding of the above IF anything written here is not correct!  Hope this helps  As i said in the last post, your case is special, as you want to keep the vanity address, it would be  best if you wait for the release of the NVO wallet to import the address directly into the wallet. Meanwhile, you can still use it, and check its balance using the explorers you mentioned.

You just need to control the private key to the address(es) you've used to invest with. All you have to do is import the private key(s) into counterwallet. Pretty simple. This guide covers investing with counterwallet, albeit it does not mention importing private keys: https://medium.com/nvo-exchange/how-to-contribute-to-the-nvo-crowdsale-d3e4453e3d7d   yes, I saw this article, however looking at the counterwallet you can import only the 12 words you get to re-generate the wallet, the only thing I found for importing the address using privkey to counterparty/counterwallet was a sweep option  https://counterpartytalk.org/t/how-to-use-private-key-to-import-btc-funds-from-external-address-to-counterwallet-address/1225  can't find a thing about using a btc address generated with vanitygen (for example) using counterwallet  The sweep process is due to the fact that you send your private key over internet, so it is wiser to sweep rather then import.

It is obvious that developers would focus on introducing support for the most popular altcoins first. I would be glad that they include every coin they used for their ICO: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, ETH/ETC, Maid, Dash, Waves, Doge.

Paper wallets are for cold storage. 3) It does not matter what wallet you are using as long as you have the private key to the address that you're sending from. This means that online wallets, exchanges and similar won't work. A list of supported wallets can be found in the post that I have linked above.  Quote from: SEnergy on June 22, 2017, 01:49:05 PM when sending BTC, in instructions it clearly states that ""when using 2 different btc addresses, NVOT will be send to each other according to the deposit"" - but I can enter only 1 BTC address, so how does that exactly work? It does not matter which BTC address you put into the dashboard unless you're investing with altcoins. Therefore, you could invest Bitcoin without even registering on the website. I recommend investing from the same address multiple times rather than multiple addresses as you would have to keep track of multiple private keys.

Once the campaign is over, will you stagger the sells of the coins you've collected? Any worries about a series of big sells orders causing a dip just as you are funding? Just curious if there's been any thought given to this, or if it's a valid concern at all. I know in the world of stocks there are people who are trained to specifically sell a little at a time when exiting large positions to maximize their profits.  The values will be frozen at the moment the crowdsale ends, from there the price of the token will be calculated, the cryptos will be converted slowly in order to avoid dumps, the difference will be supported by NVO.     Quote from: _Ricardo_ on June 21, 2017, 04:19:53 PM Good afternoon ! I have some questions:  1- I used Bitcoin's personal address as an Electrum address, and made my contribution with altcoins. I backed up the private key of the Electrum address; 2- I created a Bitcoin address on CounterWallet, and I verified the possibility of using my private key to import future NVO Tokens through the private key that I imported from the Electrum address.  ===> Now my doubt I read that this import is not immediate (private key electrum <==> Token NVO inside the counterwallet), it may take some time.   Can I change the personal address bitcoin (from the Electrum wallet) in the NVO panel by my Counterwallet address (from what I saw the most appropriate address)? Will this change replace the Altcoin addresses on the NVO panel?  Grateful.  It all depends on your decision, but changing the address on the dashboard won't change the Altcoin addresses. If you sent Bitcoins, you have to notify the team, preferably on slack, because the NVO tokens will be sent to the address you sent from.     Quote from: Bothebu on June 21, 2017, 04:23:49 PM I use Electrum as my bitcoin wallet.  I registered one of my Electrum wallet addresses on NVO.io website, but I have not sent funds yet.

Thank you and I apologize if this has been asked and answeered.  NVO token is a counterparty token, which means that it follows the bitcoin blockchain. You can change the address on the website without any problem as you haven't sent Bitcoins or Altcoins. You can't see the NVOT using electrum, but you can do it using counterwallet, or the NVO wallet, after the update.

This doesn’t, of course, make it untradeable via other exchanges, which could give it varying prices and some volatility regardless of any efforts.  NVOT will trade at whatever the market decides, NVOS will be stable at $0.99. Unless I just really didn't grasp the concept properly.  Who is going to guarantee that NVOS will be stable at $0.99? Do you think that NVO owners/developers would start bying NVOS when the price goes under 0.99 USD? I`m still confused about a lot of things regarding this project and most of the posts here sound like japanese to me.   I understand the way you view this because in an open market there is no way price can be fixed without intervention of the external party which in this case is the developers. My concern to this is that will there be a particular exchange where this will be done and aside that how long will the support will be for the token in case market forces are swinging in both ways?  You just control the supply of tokens like tether or any other currency that is tethered to USD. Obviously tether has been having some problems lately but no algorithm is perfect so it's do be expected with NVOS as well. Maybe NVOS will be their version of tether that you can buy on their platform.  No, Tether isn't comparable to NVOS, it is totally different.     Quote from: xibeijan on June 21, 2017, 02:02:39 PM Quote from: nemgun on June 20, 2017, 12:10:10 PM  Imagine that we are in a room you and me, and that we have made a program for a system of probability. And we do not want to know the result, first we are going to do the program that flips a coin randomly, except that if we want to see the result, it must be recorded to be able to read it, except that In this case, the result must go to the safenet. The first question is that we have made the algorithm, we know it, and have the decryption key, except that to be sure not to know the key, we will ask the blockchain to generate a random decryption key, and give us a smart contract, it will convey the coin to safenet.  So the smart contract is only the vehicle of the coin that we fliped. The computation will be used to flip the piece elsewhere. We will not have the decryption key.   Please explain what you are trying to say more formally and mathematically because that is nearly incoherent.  If you cannot express your algorithm mathematically, then there's zero chance you can implement it.  It is not because you have not understood that I can not implement it, does not judge without understanding.  I will start step by step so that you can understand, each time we finishes one, we advance towards the other.  There is not only one algorithm, there are several, so we have three key elements, a blockchain that synchronizes the wallets and encrypts the data, the smart contract that comes from the blockchain that carries a private key and the address randomly and encrypted, and the smartcontract swap.  Now that you have an idea of the definitions, let's move on.  So A wants to place an order:  The wallet creates a smart contract, and sends it directly to safenet without being kept on site while being hashed in double sha256. The decryption key remains on the blockchain.  PS: the user does not have access to the multisig or any other access. View that the wallet is not the stokage space of the orders.  This is the first phase, if you have any questions, I answer then we go on.

Quote from: xibeijan on June 20, 2017, 05:58:17 AM Quote from: Wind_FURY on June 20, 2017, 04:47:13 AM Nemgun, I have read some comments that Maidsafe is taking too long in deploying the official release of their project, is this a concern for NVO and will it be affecting you seriously in any way?  This is a big concern to me.  Maidsafe is promising the moon on a stick: a new internet based on a DHT and no blockchain.   We know this technology, have serious doubts and question such a claim. They have not released anything substantial and everyone is waiting and waiting.  We have about 4 months to finish the exchange and the validator as we have engagements regarding the investors, partners, and community. If MaidSafe isn't ready untill there, we said that we will offer to help them, if they refuse, we will go for a different option, like Radix, or create our own system, which would need about 2-3 months of intencive work.  The idea is to form a team that will be sufficiently experienced to make good progress on the project and to help other projects that may need it.  As you know we secured the funds with milestones because the money can make you crazy, that's why the goal is to deliver 100% of the project in 10 months if there is no SafeNet. And to be sure that the funds are not misused, because many projects end up finishing without delivering the project because they have been too late to issue.     Are you saying, that you are going to create a replacement for MaidSafe in 2-3 months if MaidSafe is not ready on time? With a team of people you DO NOT have yet? Something that MaidSafe have been trying to accomplish FOR 3 YEARS ?     Maidsafe is developing a new internet, which is not the case for NVO, we don't need the full safenet, plus they extensively test the features they implement and see their limit. in the case of NVO we need some elements only this why the development won't be as long as for safenet.",False

To my knowledge, sha256 is a hashing algorithm, - not an encryption algorithm. (For those not in-the-know, hashing algorithms are one-way computations by definition and purpose, and one cannot reverse the operation to get the original data from a hash.) Yes, it does transform information and produce a hash value of that information. But in practice, there's no routine mechanism to reverse that computation, - only some very elaborate hacking may be able to do that. So, yeah - it's kinda secure, if all you need is to compare it with another such hash to determine if the original data for the two hash values was the same (with a 99.9999% probability, as in very rare cases two very different pieces of data may actually produce the same hash). But there are no keys ever involved in calculating sha256, therefore no private key would ever be able to reverse the operation (one can only use a salt value to obfuscate input data and prevent dictionary attacks on the hash). And then, double-sha256 merely adds another round of computations where the first computed hash itself is hashed again using sha256.  I'd really like to get an explanation for the ""double sha256 encryption"" term, as that would constitute an incredible mathematical breakthrough.",False

I'm going to explain what a blockchain is, it is like a database, and I'll save hash in that database. So when the smart contract will be hashed in sha256, it will serve as an id. Now A wants to make a trade, it leaves coins for sale and goes offline, how the database will call its smart contract? She will call it using using the hash. I will help you learn a few things, when you read definitions ask yourself what are they for, you will be able to understand them better, so after the definitions, it is the functions.  I will give an example for others who do not know the development: https://satoshimines.com/play/c1397e2164317bcb411d91cc0799610a0d954368/#DONT_SHARE_URL  This is a satoshimine link, it serves to identify the player. What you see in red is the hash, no one except you and the database of satoshimines can have it, if you modify it you lose your account.  How will NVO work? It is necessary to ask about the double sha256, to bring more security. Now this pseudo blockchain, where does it come from? NVO will fork ? Which blockchain NVO will use? Which technology will be used? It is necessary to ask all these questions, I answer you, we will use the technology of Bitcoin, because in my eyes it is the best, with many developers who maintain it, the one that succeeds best, and the oldest in term Of experience, in addition it uses sha256. We can say that we are going to use a bitcoin sidechain, it will not be a fork.  The sidechain will work as a RAM, a cache for the duration of the trades, once the trades end, it erases the information and does not keep history, because NVO is a decentralized and anonymous exchange, it is not Not meant to track its users. And how will safenet be? Like a hard drive, where the smart contract will be sent for offline use.  So what's the utility of the user's wallet? It will be the CPU to connect the other two. He will link his signature to the sidechain so that the smart contract is made, and to launch the algorithm for the multisig, the result will simply register on the safenet, so the user will have access to nothing, apart from the Calculates and bandwidth.

I am still reading thru all the ANN thread to be sure I understand everything before investing, but time running short LOL and I'm still only on page 33 at the moment, so I wanted to jump ahead here to the end and ask a question (hope this is not a repeat of anything earlier, apologies if so...)  Anyway, SO, okay... I understand I need to use a bitcoin address where I have the private key FOR SURE, for this to work in the future.  I used VANITYGEN to make up my own custom ""1nvo..."" address for this.  So far so good.  Was able to import this address into a web wallet for SENDING the bitcoins, so that should be okay?  And/OR if in the future there's any problem about whatever web wallet I'll use for this (OmniWallet or blockchain.info, whatever) as long as I have preserved the priv key everything should be okay to access my NVO value in whatever other way is best at that time (the NVO wallet itself, presumably...?)  My QUESTION is about the CounterWallet alternative, that's also been noted earlier in this thread.  I made a wallet account there and looked to see IF it was possible to add my VANITY ADDRESS via private key, BUT it appears that CounterWallet only will SWEEP a balance from an entered private key and put the funds, instead, onto it's OWN address???  Repeat: CounterWallet does not seem to be able to directly ""ADD"" a bitcoin address using a private key (unless I misunderstood something there?)  So, Is this correct?  And, if so, please clarify my understanding that THIS IS NOT what we need for correct working of the crowdsale... yes?  On the contrary -- seems to me that use of the CounterWallet address is ONLY advised to be by way of their OWN address in the wallet (albeit, yes, they provide private key) and ONLY because this wallet will allow us to ""SEE"" our NVO tokens right away (as ""counterparty"" assets?) whereas using another wallet and bitcoin private key will require us to WAIT a bit (but, how long?) to be able to see our purchased tokens, after the crowdsale is over....?  Again, is my understanding of this correct?  Please advise.  Bottom line, I'd prefer to use my custom vanity address for this IF possible, as long as it won't take TOO long after the crowdsale is over to be able to confirm my purchase in the NVO wallet itself: if it's gonna be MONTHS later, well, then maybe it'd be better to use the address provided in the CounterWallet system instead.

Quote from: miso.dca on June 20, 2017, 07:38:33 PM Quote from: miso.dca on June 20, 2017, 10:16:20 AM saqwe - it is possible answer my two questions? 1. private keys = backup phrase? (e.g. bitpay uses as backup just this phrase or it is possible to export private key from bitpay e.g. like is in paper wallet?) 2. who will guarantee 99 cents for NVOS? It would be possible to sell it e.g. on poloniex? If so, who will guarantee price? because every week there will be lots ot NVOS tokens for sale ... if price on poloniex cant be fixed at 99 cents, how could people sell it in this price?  1- You should use counterwallet to solve this issue with no hussle. 2-NVO will guarantee the price, as NVO will buy them back. Not possible to be listed on Poloniex, at first it will be hosted on counterparty, and later added to NVO exchange.    huge thx for answers, but ... - bitpay is recommended by NVO .. but ok, i can use counterwallet - why on earth would buy NVO back NVOS? Why cant they send directly btc?!  It is not about been recomended, but the easiest one to use is counterwallet. It is about legal sides of the project, it is a way to protect the NVO token holders and to keep the exchange decentralized.     Quote from: KeyJockey on June 20, 2017, 10:55:14 PM Hi Folks:  Interesting project here... looks pretty good so far.  I am still reading thru all the ANN thread to be sure I understand everything before investing, but time running short LOL and I'm still only on page 33 at the moment, so I wanted to jump ahead here to the end and ask a question (hope this is not a repeat of anything earlier, apologies if so...)  Anyway, SO, okay... I understand I need to use a bitcoin address where I have the private key FOR SURE, for this to work in the future.  I used VANITYGEN to make up my own custom ""1nvo..."" address for this.  So far so good.  Was able to import this address into a web wallet for SENDING the bitcoins, so that should be okay?  And/OR if in the future there's any problem about whatever web wallet I'll use for this (OmniWallet or blockchain.info, whatever) as long as I have preserved the priv key everything should be okay to access my NVO value in whatever other way is best at that time (the NVO wallet itself, presumably...?)  My QUESTION is about the CounterWallet alternative, that's also been noted earlier in this thread.  I made a wallet account there and looked to see IF it was possible to add my VANITY ADDRESS via private key, BUT it appears that CounterWallet only will SWEEP a balance from an entered private key and put the funds, instead, onto it's OWN address???  Repeat: CounterWallet does not seem to be able to directly ""ADD"" a bitcoin address using a private key (unless I misunderstood something there?)  So, Is this correct?  And, if so, please clarify my understanding that THIS IS NOT what we need for correct working of the crowdsale... yes?  On the contrary -- seems to me that use of the CounterWallet address is ONLY advised to be by way of their OWN address in the wallet (albeit, yes, they provide private key) and ONLY because this wallet will allow us to ""SEE"" our NVO tokens right away (as ""counterparty"" assets?) whereas using another wallet and bitcoin private key will require us to WAIT a bit (but, how long?) to be able to see our purchased tokens, after the crowdsale is over....?  Again, is my understanding of this correct?  Please advise.  Bottom line, I'd prefer to use my custom vanity address for this IF possible, as long as it won't take TOO long after the crowdsale is over to be able to confirm my purchase in the NVO wallet itself: if it's gonna be MONTHS later, well, then maybe it'd be better to use the address provided in the CounterWallet system instead.  Thanks in advance for reply.  Hope this was clear enough question LOL   You are right about allwhat you said, except that you can your balance using counterparty explorer, or https://xchain.io/ Yes, they sweep the address, because they consider that it is unsafe, the problem here is that you have a vanity address.  You can still keep it as is, and retreive the address using xchain, and create transactions manually. Or wait untill NVO releases a wallet update. It is all up to your decision.  Feel free to ask if you have more questions, you can join us on slack too.",False

Is obvious $5000 ---) 5.050 NVOS ----) $5000   Instead NVOT will be on exchanges and price will fluctuate  i think:           NVOS -----) NVO Stake          NVOT -----) NVO Token   But the real question... what NVO Stand for?",False

We have about 4 months to finish the exchange and the validator as we have engagements regarding the investors, partners, and community. If MaidSafe isn't ready untill there, we said that we will offer to help them, if they refuse, we will go for a different option, like Radix, or create our own system, which would need about 2-3 months of intencive work.  The idea is to form a team that will be sufficiently experienced to make good progress on the project and to help other projects that may need it.  As you know we secured the funds with milestones because the money can make you crazy, that's why the goal is to deliver 100% of the project in 10 months if there is no SafeNet. And to be sure that the funds are not misused, because many projects end up finishing without delivering the project because they have been too late to issue.

But I would ask you to erase what's in your head, just two minutes.  Imagine that we are in a room you and me, and that we have made a program for a system of probability. And we do not want to know the result, first we are going to do the program that flips a coin randomly, except that if we want to see the result, it must be recorded to be able to read it, except that In this case, the result must go to the safenet. The first question is that we have made the algorithm, we know it, and have the decryption key, except that to be sure not to know the key, we will ask the blockchain to generate a random decryption key, and give us a smart contract, it will convey the coin to safenet.  So the smart contract is only the vehicle of the coin that we fliped. The computation will be used to flip the piece elsewhere. We will not have the decryption key.

Quote from: miso.dca on June 20, 2017, 10:16:20 AM saqwe - it is possible answer my two questions? 1. private keys = backup phrase? (e.g. bitpay uses as backup just this phrase or it is possible to export private key from bitpay e.g. like is in paper wallet?) 2. who will guarantee 99 cents for NVOS? It would be possible to sell it e.g. on poloniex? If so, who will guarantee price? because every week there will be lots ot NVOS tokens for sale ... if price on poloniex cant be fixed at 99 cents, how could people sell it in this price?  1- You should use counterwallet to solve this issue with no hussle. 2-NVO will guarantee the price, as NVO will buy them back. Not possible to be listed on Poloniex, at first it will be hosted on counterparty, and later added to NVO exchange.

Will the validator hold their own private keys ""that will be used in the multi-sig exchange operations""? If so, will these private keys get stored in the safe net? Now I am confused on how the private keys will be handled in a decentralized manner. Will the validator make use of it's own private keys at all? I assume yes cause the validators will have to authorize the multi-sig transactions during the exchange process to prevent double spending attacks. How are you planning to secure the validators private keys in the safenet with the fact that the private keys has to be decrypted in memory to authorize transactions.  Will the NVO team have access to the validator's private keys? If so isn't that a centralized point of failure in case of any sort of validators manipulation due to private keys hacks?

The private keys will be stored encrypted in blockchains/safenet to be decrypted and used at some points. The question is how these keys will be used safely in a decentralized manner? The only way I can think of that would make such process secure is to have couple of offline/centralized processors.

NEMergizer, I don't remember that you asked, but no problem.  To begin with, I do not want you to suppose without knowing the thing, because you could lose yourself. There will be no centralized processor because you already have it on your computer, and the program that will use it is called safebrowser (before it was safelauncher), it is it that connects you to safenetwork and that encrypts your data To secure them. The only flaw that I had that I resolved is that the person who had to send the private key to the safenetwork could crack it, or even keep it on his computer, this is why it will be encrypted then hashed in double sha256, and the one that looks like a blockchain will have access to the decryption key. Now what you need to keep in mind is how the safenet works, how it will use the computation and make its logical calculation. In safenet, you have your wallet which is the safebrowser, it uploads your information on the safenetwork by encrypting them in order to secure them, then they are duplicated at the farmers, so I will use some of the code of safebrowser and adapt it for The encryption process, so that users do not have access to the private key of the validator.",False

Every single token has been bought as soon as someone invested $1, that's how this crowdsale works. Now the number of investors can not be revealed. You may ask yourself why. The problem is that: 1) An investment from an unique address or inputting an unique address (i.e. total number of unique addresses in dashboard) != unique user. 2) Number of registered users != unque user.  Therefore, it is absolutely not possible to correctly state the number of unique investors. All that could be possibly provided is an estimate.

Whenever there is a trade, the wallet will use a part of the safebrowser to create the private keys and send them to the safenet, retrieve the decription key and save it in the blockchain.  So, now the gas can be barred, and whatever someone wants to trade with it, whether it is or not, the blockchain knows which key it is, it will all sympathy create a small smart contract that will go Recover the key and exchange.

The problem is, it is not decentralized exchange. Linking 2 of 2 multisig is almost the same as 2 of 3 but slightly more secure.  The validator can SPOOF the buyer or seller and default on their obligation after getting a valid signature.  So the example:  Bob wants to send LTC to Alice for BTC  Bob forms 2 of 2 with unique validator, Alice forms 2 of 2 with unique validator (potentially the same one or not doesn't matter the attack is the same either way).  Bob signs to send LTC under the assumption that Alice will be beholden to being honest by the validator.  The problem? The validator IS ALICE (and potentially the 2nd signature in Bobs tx too).  Bob sends the LTC, Alice doesn't bother to send her BTC in fact she withdraws it and takes Bobs LTC.  This is a pretty serious attack and thus this cannot possibly be decentralized exchange.  Only a lightning network and AT are decentralized exchange (and potentially microtrading in a 2 of 2 double deposit escrow).  Again, I'm not trying to rattle your cage or ""insult you"". I definitely want more people doing projects that are more secure than modern exchanges. But what you propose in safe network is a series of green addresses 2 of 2 accounts. It doesn't eliminate the risk of theft at all. Thats because the validator could collude with buyer or seller. Whomever runs those servers has a lot of power to spoof deals.",False

Quote from: Albortz on June 13, 2017, 06:23:53 PM I need a couple of more answers.  I read a lot about it and I am a little out of date with my ""skills"" lol  1) I linked a ledger BTC address to the NVO. Does that address work? Its my personal address no exchange wallet tho basically it should work, but its a 24 word seed not 12.... Also i have multiple currencies on my ledger. Do I risk them if i open a counter wallet with my seed (in case thats possible because its 24 not 12 words)  2) There will be 15 million coins divided by all investors. Do the devs receive further coins, or do they simply cut out 50% of the fees for themselves?  3) From the timespan, how long does it take to have the product ready and launched? There are so many details with weeks of development that i lost count.  Hope anyone can enlighten me lol  1- I advise you to either create a paper wallet and use it, or use counterwallet directly. 2- No, the 15M tokens will be distributed, NVO won't hold any token. 3- 6-8 months depending on SafeNet's status.     Quote from: dzimbeck on June 13, 2017, 08:05:40 PM  -snip- -snip- -snip- -snip-  You are saying I'm not a dev? Are you insane? I developed single handedly the world's first smart contracting platform BitHalo which was also the world's first multisig client and first dual coin software and also dev Bitbay. Never have I hired out a coder and write the 50,000 line software alone.  Now first of all, I'm not insulting you. ALL I care about is security its what I do for a living. I'm happy to see you guys are doing dev work but there is a problem with your branding. And please cool it with your assumptions I'm not calling names. Your response was amusing and shows you don't really read properly (I never once insulted you, your paper doesn't adequately explain the protocol)  What you just described 2 of 2 linked to 2 of 2 is NOT SAFE.  Basically the validator holding keys in each account can pretend to be the buyer or seller and double spend their payment. Basically what you are describing is multisignature exchange not decentralized exchange. It has some very serious security holes.  Validator can pretend to be buyer or seller, default on outgoing payments and cash in on live trades. Validators sign key can also be hacked and then double spent.  The only way to do decentralized trustless exchange is atomic trading (and maybe lightning network).  What you propose is more secure than let's say Poloniex but it is absolutely not decentralized. Now you can get angry, call this fud whatever. There is nothing in this for me except to point out the flaw of collusion in this design. Fix it or not is your call but investors be aware this is a multisig exchange, not a Dex.  On that note good luck.  Cool at least we're not grudging, you're welcome, let me explain how its going to work.  The situation you describe is true in the case where the validator is a single entity hosted on SafeNet, even if in order to get the private keys, one must basically break safenet.  The difference now (and this is a disclosed information) will be run simultaneously from different wallets, each wallet will have its own validator Instance, its job is to verify the orders and the transaction informations. During a trade, if someone manages to get access to its private key, he will be the unique victime of his cheating attempt, as the other instances won't accept his order.  It doesn't means that NVO will allow 0 confirmation bitcoin transactions, at this stage it would be hypotethical, a minimum of 1 block confirmation is required, however, LN integration is a must, as it solves a lot of issues experienced by the DEXs, Segwit will be helpfull too.  Regarding the possibility to send a transaction with low fees, the different validators will check this information too as the minimum will be determined by the validator depending on the network state.  I know about Bitbay and BitHalo, and i understand that you defend your ideas about atomic trading and i appreciate the exchange of idea.",False

There you see at least how many BTC are received and in how many transfers.  Right now its around 0.3BTC on average.       Something more. How does the NOVS system work?     1)  All fees are collected in one ""address"" or ""pot"" and once a week the NVOS will be send to the NVOT owner right?   2)  How is that calculated?     Do you take the dollar value (of fees) of each transaction at given time or do you collect all fees and take the dollar value at the time of the distribution?   3)  Also you wrote all NVOS will be worth 0.99cents. How is that possible?    All fees are probably based the currencies they originate from.  BTC -> LTC the fee will be either BTC or LTC (maybe both).

User A receives Dash right away, User B sees the Bitcoin transaction broadcasts to the network but it never gets confirmed.

Since users control their private key, it is possible for them to have a non-NVO wallet that also broadcasts transactions for the same address. If I understand it correctly, there would be a small window of opportunity (fractions of a second) between when the validator verifies funds on the network and when it broadcasts a transaction. A user could broadcast a transaction with their non-NVO wallet after the validator has verified funds but before it broadcasts a transaction. The network will accept the first transaction from the non-NVO wallet broadcast and reject the validators broadcasted transaction as a double-spend. An attacker could quite easily take advantage of this critical loop-hole, hence the need for some measure of ""Trust"" between users on the exchange when conducting a transaction. If exchange volumes increased to a high level, would it be possible for a trusted user to launch a continuous massive double-spend attack across the market resulting in huge losses to users? DEXs are still a new concept and I don't know if this is a vulnerability or if it has been addressed or exploited yet.",False

Basically the validator holding keys in each account can pretend to be the buyer or seller and double spend their payment. Basically what you are describing is multisignature exchange not decentralized exchange. It has some very serious security holes.  Validator can pretend to be buyer or seller, default on outgoing payments and cash in on live trades. Validators sign key can also be hacked and then double spent.  The only way to do decentralized trustless exchange is atomic trading (and maybe lightning network).  What you propose is more secure than let's say Poloniex but it is absolutely not decentralized.

The first plugin will be for coinpayments who wants to bridge a payment processor plugin into NVO. It will be one of the volume sources for NVO. It is also possible that Alex the CEO of coinpayments becomes the Marketing manager of NVO as he managed to get 200k users for coinpayments.

How does this platform differ from WAVES and BTS? What advantages/disadvantages does it offer over the aforementioned platforms?  After the Crowdsale and development is done for the coin, how will this platform gain traction (volume) against a large volume exchange like Poloniex?  Thank you for your time.  Also can this launch BEFORE maidsafe goes live?  I hear maid has had a lot of issues. its making me consider holding off.  If the validator is ready, and SafeNet isn't ready, we will first help them with the development, but if it is still impossible we have though about alternatives like, Radix or a even our own P2P network with our own blockchain using some cryptocurrencies features, it would take about 4 additional months to deliver in this case.     Quote from: Albortz on June 12, 2017, 09:17:42 AM I have checked this project out for days now and i like the idea, however there are some points i need to be clarified.   By owning NVOT I am basically shareholder from an asset exchange.  For my investment in the business I receive NOVS as dividends. So far so good.  The problem i see is the legality, by being part time owner or shareholder of an exchange for digital assets which are regulated in almost all countries. By offering the key function, your site works as an intermediary system, enabling the exchange of multiple coins. In most countries you would therefore operate an unlicensed business and all income/ dividends from said business would be unlawful and punishable by court.   How do you operate the site, where are servers, what security do you plan to not run into problems with FinCEN or other official authorities?   Especially in this case it is even more difficult since it is decentralized.  We will receive a fixed payout of 50% of the fees. Therefore it is not even like a dividend in classical meaning....    I hope you can explain how you wanna tackle the legal aspects of operating and investing in your project.     Thanks for the feedback, as i see in your post there is a mix of concepts, let me clarify.  There are no servers, except the API clusters and they are used to provide informations to the wallet users and as a basic support for the plugins who may require it.  The NVOS have been added to the project in order to keep the project legal as its value will be fixed at 0.99$, as any amount sent below 1 usd is considered as a donation or a gift, it won't be NVOT or Bitcoins, it will be a convertible token which will work as a faucet for the owners of NVOT, it will also give more flexibility to the NVOT owners as they will be able to either store the NVOS and exchange them later, or exchange them directly for Bitcoins. It is like asking wether a faucet is legal or not.  I hope that the answer helps you to clarify the different concepts, do not hesitate to ask for more informations.     Quote from: Wind_FURY on June 12, 2017, 09:32:47 AM What would be the first coins included beyond the demo release? Will Monero be included in that first batch of listed coins or will it be integrated later?  I ask because XMR seems to be the coin that is hard to integrate maybe because of its RingCT feature? I know Jaxx had a hard time integrating it, and dropped it from their road map.  The first coins to be implemented will be the NVOT and the coins supported by the crowdsale, then will come the others. We are aware of the difficulties regarding XMR, the plugin system will be handy to include them into the wallet as we will be able to create a customized environment to handle XMR which will ease its integration.

Mainly this gets started with NVO.IO Exchange. So there won't be any complications In the buying and selling of the NVO coin.  the team will examinate all the possible sollutions regarding exchange listing and will inform all the participants of news regarding this point.

Ton will amortise a portion of the marketing, and will setup the administration side, marketing, design, support. Yani and I will recruit some developers and assign them the different tasks as we would have done the working dashboard, with the research results as a developer have to do a minimum of research before working on a project to get damiliar with the tools he will use, that will save time for the development, for sure we will listen to the developers regarding the possible improvement ideas and issues.  An API documentation needs 1 to 2 months to be redacted, the team will have to follow the timeframe of the documentations, Yani will work on the wallet with the designers and implement the features on the go, he will have to communicate with the API developer(s), I will work on the validator, and another dev who will implement the different coins with their assets.  Meanwhile, Ton will be in charge of the support and will take care of the communication, he will also work with the designers to get a fluid and clear design.  Alex will take care of the NVO promotion as we are at 99% sure that he will be the marketing manager and will work with Ton.  After the 1-2 months of intencive work, i will spend 1 week watching drangon ball, marvels, drinking beer and sleeping, as i will need to recover  (i am sorry for this off week but need to have some rest)  After that, we will proceed to the tests and fine tuning during 21 days, the operation's duration will be about 4 months. From there i think that our team will be heated enough to support MaidSafe and help them. The development fees will be taken care of by NVO, not MaidSafe as all the projects supported by NVO. As we don't know about the financial situation of the different teams. It is in the interest of NVO to help all the communities as this is what will bring the volume in the future, and MaidSafe could see and evaluate our skills after these 4 months.",False

Thanks for correcting.     I would like to share with you the answers to some interesting questions :   1) Why do you think LocalBitcoins is way more successful than the existing DEX projects out there? 2) What would make Poloniex and Localbitcoins users switch over NVO. 3) What are the real reasons users choose the exchanges they choose? 4) And why the hell people are using awful and inconvenient sites such as LocalBitcoins and BTC-e? What is their added value that makes them so popular ?  1- Because localbitcoins offers the possiblity to exchange FIATs to Bitcoin directly, and one of the most popular demands regarding this kind of exchange is Paypal. 2- Regarding Poloniex, it is mostly an issue regarding the platform's bots, because sometimes during bitcoin's high/low phases, the bots linked to Poloniex slows down the platform. Bittrex for example is newer compared to Poloniex, but they earned reputation because they sorted the coins, there are no forks or shitcoins there, and it was one of the first exchanges to add coins like Waves and the reçently strong coins. One of the poloniex's strengh was the support of XMR and ETH. Now, could you please check the XRP wallets ? How many users would like to use NVO for Ripple ? How many developers would like to use NVO for their projects ? About ripple, the 24H volume of Ripple is around $136M, if we can get about 40% of the volume, how many users will be interested to use our DEX ? ie: if we have 40% of the XRP volume in the NVO DEX, it will bring around $80 USD Weekly, in means that the holders will get $1.120.000USD. The crowdsale is around $2M, after two weeks all the holders get their funds back. Needless to say what will happen if they keep on holding them. Most of the wallets are non official, you can check them, some of them are good, but NVO can do better.  Regarding localbitcoins, they don't have a wallet, how about implementing them on NVO using the plugin system ? Both projects would benefit from it.  3- Reputation, innovation, the ability to add new pairs quickly. Because it is not easy to add a new coins and maintain them, there are always wallets on maintenance.  4- BTC-E is a fake volume, their code system is used as a support way by third parties platforms. Localbitcoins is popular because you can use a lot of different payment methods who are not supported by exchanges.  The wallets are customisable, anyone can either create a plugin, or a ""mod"" for the wallet, like a trading ""mod"". We will work on the plugins to provide as much ""mods"" as possible for the different users, everyone will have the basic wallet, and then they could choose a special modes and switche between them. The most important is the validator, as it will meet the ideas of everybody.   What is the actual, tangible invention or innovation that NVO brings?  The main innovation brough by NVO is its mixity, NVO won't be a DEX only, but a complement to the blockchain projects. Not a way to get money out of fees, but a way to join projects together. NVO isn't a blockchain to be compared with other blockchains as it is not required, except to get more funds, regarding development, it is not mandatory to use a blockchain for a DEX.   I would like to also ask if your team is aware that the ""Launcher"" will soon be deprecated for a new paradigm that is called the ""Authenticator"".  It doesn't change anything, what ever happens the most important is to get access to the network in a way or another, from there, you can work your own solution or adapt the existing one.   I'm a linguist. I understand language barrier. Please, seriously consider hiring somebody with impeccable English and communication skills who is not just excited about the project, but who has perfect understanding of the technology and at the same time the ability to communicate this understanding. Correct spelling is very important in order to make a serious impression, including on forums like this. I'm not talking about a marketing monkey, but a serious public relations person.  Effectively, we will try to recruit people with a minimum of development knowledge, and the required communication skills, not only for english, because NVO have to be international as it is decentralized.",False

Suppose I sell my asset X through NVO, buyer sends me asset Y and in the meantime I transfer my asset X somewhere else through a native wallet. There's a chance I get asset Y for free.  Thanks for your support, this have been addressed, and here is the content :  The answer to 0-conf attack vector is in the reddit thread. Effectively when you validate a transaction without confirmations (0-conf), there is a risk for Double spending, or replace by fee, speed attack ... but this can only happen in the case of a normal address, in the reddit thread he didn't considered the specifications of a 2-OF-2. In the case of the validator, the trades will be handled using multisig 2-OF-2, which means that when you will trade using the validator, you will have a shared 2-OF-2 address with the validator, this will prevent this type of attacks as the validator's won't allow such transactions or manipulations. Once the Validator allows a transaction and process it, you won't be able to issue an attack as you will need the agreement of the Validator. Unless you corrupt the validator, which means breaking SafeNetwork, regroupoing the framents and then decrypting them, all of this, just to get at the validator and try to corrupt a single address. These steps are actually not feasable, maybe in 10 or 20 years using quantum computers or using a lazer computer with graphen components. Even if you do it, you won't be able to corrupt more then a single address, the one you will share with the validator because the addresses will change randomly.  Really intresting.  Does this system need multisig support in all the coins? may be I'm wrong but I think Waves doesn't have multisig yet.  Another question: ever tought adding NEM to the supported coins? NEM has multisig support, has assets, but no asset exchange yet.    Thanks for your feedback, i really appreciate it.    Comme par hazard, le responsable marketing de NEM nous a fais le plaisir de nous contacter aujourd'hui, j'espere pouvoir m'entretenir avec eux dans pas longtemps, c'est déja un excellent pas en avant car NVO veut travailler avec touts les projets Altcoin. On utilise counterparty, on stock sur maidsafe, on veut utiliser toutes les blockchains.  Regarding your question, here is one of the advantages of using SafeNet, we can create tailor made sollutions depending on each cryptocurrency, as some have solved the 0-conf problem, tx maleability or other flaws. Which means, no, it is nor mandatory but it will depend on how the crypto handles such problems.  Yes Waves doesn't support multisig.  I am the developer in charge of the validator, i decided not to create a blockchain as the Validator isn't meant to be competing against other blockchains, instead, he will complete them and use them and proof that they can be securely used safely. It wasn't really possible to explain these points into the whitepaper because it is a very wide subject as it will need a lot of time for each crypto.",False

If you need anything or have any question, feel free to ask us.     Quote from: MarketMagic on June 11, 2017, 11:41:20 AM Quote from: nemgun on June 10, 2017, 11:00:16 AM Hello everyone, I would like to tell you about a problem that the team has been facing for around 3 days now. A certain person suddenly appeared, named Roboteddy and posted a thread on Reddit with false information and speculation at a time at which none of the developers were available. The CEO of the project had deleted that thread as he wanted to redirect it to Slack, so that Yani or I could answer him. In hindsight, we realized that deleting it, even temporarily, was a mistake. Therefore, we have apologized for this deletion. The user has then threatened to defame us via social media, even though we reauthorized him to post the thread. I have wasted 48 hours responding to misconceptions from a madman who tried to talk like a developer using erroneous information just in order to give bad feedback to the team. Today, he has allowed himself to defame the project on another subreddit.  I think that many developers from various projects have had enough of certain trolls that were just trying to bother and destroy their projects. This kind of troll manifestation that attempts to mislead newcomers in the Bitcoin and altcoin communities are well known. Despite of everything, we are supposed to welcome them properly by explaining things as they really are.  Therefore, I am calling out any developers, users of both altcoins and Bitcoin to come and evaluate me on the project’s thread in order to correct the image of said project.  I wish the community would be welcomed in the face of such problems. NVO is a project that is on the same spectrum as the policy of Bitcoin, namely decentralized. It is not a blockchain that competes with other blockchains; NVO is trying to bring a plus to all of the blockchains.  Please take this post and this request into consideration.  Thank you all.   https://www.reddit.com/r/NVO/comments/6g2wwr/originally_deleted_by_mod_reposting_fundamentally/ https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6fghd6/thoughts_on_nvo_decentralized_exchange/dipmoyl/?context=3  I read through troll comments and he makes convincing argument to noobs which can be destructive however the burden of proof lies with his argument and he still has not proved his point successfully with facts.It has however made me hold back before buying any NVO tokens when they are released on exchange eventually until the whole project is seasoned.

By owning NVOT I am basically shareholder from an asset exchange.  For my investment in the business I receive NOVS as dividends. So far so good.  The problem i see is the legality, by being part time owner or shareholder of an exchange for digital assets which are regulated in almost all countries. By offering the key function, your site works as an intermediary system, enabling the exchange of multiple coins. In most countries you would therefore operate an unlicensed business and all income/ dividends from said business would be unlawful and punishable by court.   How do you operate the site, where are servers, what security do you plan to not run into problems with FinCEN or other official authorities?   Especially in this case it is even more difficult since it is decentralized.  We will receive a fixed payout of 50% of the fees. Therefore it is not even like a dividend in classical meaning....

Quote from: rigel on June 09, 2017, 08:41:55 PM Quote from: nemgun on June 09, 2017, 03:38:32 PM  Hello, thank you for the question. In fact, NVO will allow assets trading, for now, you are seeing it from a centralized point of view.  The model of NVO is A sends to B, so if you have a Waves Asset, and wants to sell it for BTC, and found someone who wants your Assets and offers BTC, both will exchange asset for crypto.  It is as simple as that. The ratio is decided by the traders.  Very nice!  I'm now wandering how can you cope with  race conditions and double spend attempts in cross chain trades.  Suppose I sell my asset X through NVO, buyer sends me asset Y and in the meantime I transfer my asset X somewhere else through a native wallet. There's a chance I get asset Y for free.  Thanks for your support, this have been addressed, and here is the content :  The answer to 0-conf attack vector is in the reddit thread. Effectively when you validate a transaction without confirmations (0-conf), there is a risk for Double spending, or replace by fee, speed attack ... but this can only happen in the case of a normal address, in the reddit thread he didn't considered the specifications of a 2-OF-2. In the case of the validator, the trades will be handled using multisig 2-OF-2, which means that when you will trade using the validator, you will have a shared 2-OF-2 address with the validator, this will prevent this type of attacks as the validator's won't allow such transactions or manipulations. Once the Validator allows a transaction and process it, you won't be able to issue an attack as you will need the agreement of the Validator. Unless you corrupt the validator, which means breaking SafeNetwork, regroupoing the framents and then decrypting them, all of this, just to get at the validator and try to corrupt a single address. These steps are actually not feasable, maybe in 10 or 20 years using quantum computers or using a lazer computer with graphen components. Even if you do it, you won't be able to corrupt more then a single address, the one you will share with the validator because the addresses will change randomly.  Do not hesitate to ask me more questions.

A certain person suddenly appeared, named Roboteddy and posted a thread on Reddit with false information and speculation at a time at which none of the developers were available. The CEO of the project had deleted that thread as he wanted to redirect it to Slack, so that Yani or I could answer him. In hindsight, we realized that deleting it, even temporarily, was a mistake. Therefore, we have apologized for this deletion. The user has then threatened to defame us via social media, even though we reauthorized him to post the thread. I have wasted 48 hours responding to misconceptions from a madman who tried to talk like a developer using erroneous information just in order to give bad feedback to the team. Today, he has allowed himself to defame the project on another subreddit.  I think that many developers from various projects have had enough of certain trolls that were just trying to bother and destroy their projects. This kind of troll manifestation that attempts to mislead newcomers in the Bitcoin and altcoin communities are well known. Despite of everything, we are supposed to welcome them properly by explaining things as they really are.  Therefore, I am calling out any developers, users of both altcoins and Bitcoin to come and evaluate me on the project’s thread in order to correct the image of said project.  I wish the community would be welcomed in the face of such problems. NVO is a project that is on the same spectrum as the policy of Bitcoin, namely decentralized. It is not a blockchain that competes with other blockchains; NVO is trying to bring a plus to all of the blockchains.  Please take this post and this request into consideration.

If you sent from an exchange directly to the escrow wallet, please join the slack channel for further support. If you sent from your exodus wallet, and submited the sending address, just keep the private key safe.  Cryptocurrencies provide Two keys, a public key, and a private key. The private key is used to sign transactions, sign messages, controle the address and the funds held by the address. When you will receive NVOT into an address, you will have to import this address into an environment who supports CounterParty layer, for example, counterWallet, or NVO wallet.  This is why you need an address whom you controle the private key. And it is always a good practice to keep the controle over your private key.  For more details, please check this website : https://counterparty.io/docs/faq/     Quote from: Heruur on June 07, 2017, 09:35:56 AM The project seems to be ambitious. It's only a DEX cryptocurrencies ? Do you plan to set up FIAT gateway ?  There are different ways to add support for FIATs, mostly using the plugin system as you will be able to third parties functionalities from your wallet.     Quote from: Technologov on June 07, 2017, 10:33:13 AM I ask you seriously: please consider to pay dividends without relying on the Bitcoin network.  Fees have tripled ovrr the last month,  and they could quintiple till next year. Do you really want to pay $20 dollar fees to get our dividend? Maybe it's possible to utilize a cheaper block chain,  like Ethereum Classic,  or build counterparty on top of Litecoin, where fees are way cheaper than Bitcoin? Bitcoin fees are goind through the moon, and so will Counterpartybfees, because it's based on Bitcoin. Investors will want dividends, without paying outrageous fees to Bitcoin miners.  Avoid relying on the Bitcoin network at all costs !  At least you can consider it for version 2 of NVO.  To Herur: yes. Maybe USDT will be supported.  Digital currencies, that are backed by fiat, but not fiat itself. It is written in the white paper.  Fees won't be paid by the holders of NVOT, it would be unfair. Instead, they will be processed in a single transaction paid with the fees paid by NVO. As long as the size of your transaction is lower then block size, you can send it, and include as much outputs as you want.     Quote from: Chris! on June 07, 2017, 07:50:59 PM Will this be similar to shapeshift only in the sense that I could trade Bitcoins for litecoins for maidsafecoins for ETC and back to BTC and it's just 1 fee to go from each or is it like current exchanges where there are bitcoin and eth markets + a few other coins on certain exchanges?

I'm just thinking of investing some now, siting on it and possibly investing more without having to use lots of different addresses. You know, the K.I.S.S. principle.  Shapeshift is centralized, in the case of a DEX, the assets/currencies are sent from user A to user B, so you can't exchange a currency to another without having to pay for the fees of each transaction. Regarding the pairs and markets, they have to setup the pairs because else NVO will loose because of the safecoins consumption.

Unless there are new coins, you will find the same ones on NVO exchange.

Quote from: btcunbranded on June 07, 2017, 04:52:14 PM This seems to be heavily advertised at minute. just wondering what sets this apart from all the other dexs appearing  The most important difference is that NVO isn't a blockchain project, and that it will be built on a decentralized distributed storage network, Safe Network. It is also a multi cryptocurrency wallet who will provide the users with a lot of features. Please, have a look at the white paper : https://nvo.io/assets/whitepaper.pdf     Quote from: dexcell on June 07, 2017, 01:53:43 PM Hi guys, few questions.  1. What is the timeframe after the Crowdsale the product will finished and launched?  2. Will the product launched even maidsafe still in alpha stage? Or will it wait for until fruition, or just use whatever method available for the validator since the product is ready?  3. Looks like there is only one full time developer right now. Of course even one smart developer can pull it single handedly in the beginning, just like FB and Microsoft in the early days. But how long after the crowdsale you are going to recruit full time members and staff? What is the plan?  4. Do you plan solely using the crowdsale fund to fund the development and marketing? or do you have plan to inject your own funds into this project?  Because the hard part in my opinions is the marketing to attract users to use this exchange, if the crowdsale only managed to raise such as $2-3MM i think it's quite hard to compete against the big boys. Do you guys also open to pitch to investor and get series funding to expand? (since basically you guys own 50% of the shares/revenue because half of 0.2% transaction)  Thank you    1- The beta project will be available around 6 months after project, with all it's ""sides"" including, Wallet, Cluster, Exchange, Plugin system ... with regular updates. 2- We have to wait untill MaidSafe releases mainnet, they are actually in alpha2, the team will work on the testnet to setup the validator, but a version outside of the safenetwork will be available during that time. Other solutions are available in case of a SafeNet fail. 3- There is one full time dev, Yani, there is me, as i will work with him, and then for sure other devs will be recruited, the team is already thinking about some devs who can join. The wallet will be open sourced, so people can participate to the development with the team. 4- The team's funds are already engaged into the project. And they are not in the crowdsale.  No, it is not comparable, both offers different products and solutions. And it is half of 0.4%, when you exchange, there is a maker and a taker, exchanges (centralized or decentralized) take fees on both, in this case 0.2x2 = 0.4     Quote from: n1que on June 08, 2017, 01:18:26 AM Quote Step 1) Enter a Bitcoin address to which you control the private keys to.  can I use my bitpay bitcoin address for joining the crowdsale? bitpay is an android application, there is no private keys, just passphrase. but the btc itself is in my phone, not at their server.    I don't advise you to use Bitpay, as they will provide you encrypted mnemonics only as they use HD wallets, you can derive the private key, but it is a long process. the best you could do is to create a wallet here : http://wallet.counterwallet.io/ Send bitcoins to that address. send from that address to the escrow address. submit the address into the dashboard.     Quote from: jaredthesovereign on June 07, 2017, 10:19:50 PM What are the plans for including a FIAT gateway?  Which fiat currencies will be available? Will this be handled via coinpayments integration?  There are lots of possibilities about that, it could be coinpayments as they are NVO partners, and any other service provider can enable the support for FIATS using the plugin system. It won't come from NVO, but from service providers.      Quote from: bkbirge on June 07, 2017, 09:53:37 PM Sorry, yet another ""how do I do this"" question.

I am rather confused on the NVOT retrieval/distribution process though. I sent bitcoin to the provided bitcoin escrow address after entering my exodus bitcoin wallet address in the right column of the crowd sale page. You state that when the tokens are sent to us we won't be able to see or send them, but we should make sure we control the private keys to the wallet we sent bitcoin from. And you also mentioned how the NVO wallet will be able to hold NVO later on.  I am not sure exactly what role the private keys play or will play but the following is just an assumption, will I need to enter my exodus wallet private keys into the NVOT wallet to retrieve/see my NVOT tokens? Or will some other process involving my private keys be required to retrieve the tokens? I'm sorry if this has been asked before somewhere but I went through each of the previous posts on this forum topic and didn't find anything that addressed this exact issue apart from mention of controlling private keys.",False

What is the timeframe after the Crowdsale the product will finished and launched?  2. Will the product launched even maidsafe still in alpha stage? Or will it wait for until fruition, or just use whatever method available for the validator since the product is ready?  3. Looks like there is only one full time developer right now. Of course even one smart developer can pull it single handedly in the beginning, just like FB and Microsoft in the early days. But how long after the crowdsale you are going to recruit full time members and staff? What is the plan?  4. Do you plan solely using the crowdsale fund to fund the development and marketing? or do you have plan to inject your own funds into this project?  Because the hard part in my opinions is the marketing to attract users to use this exchange, if the crowdsale only managed to raise such as $2-3MM i think it's quite hard to compete against the big boys. Do you guys also open to pitch to investor and get series funding to expand? (since basically you guys own 50% of the shares/revenue because half of 0.2% transaction)  Thank you",False

The validator will be hosted on a decentralized distributed storage platform (SafeNetwork) which will provide a lot of possibilities to solve issues related to live and offline trading. As an example, using multisignature addresses doesn't means centralizing the process as it will be done by a user and a decentralized process hosted into a decentralized ecosystem.  As i said, it is just one of the many possible sollutions, as they are ranging from soft, to extreme degree.  You can also check this link : https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_cross-chain_trading  There is an interesting solution to the atomic trading issues you talked about.  Rest assured that the team will never release a trading pair if they are not sure about the security of the process.

A safe BTC transaction requires 6 confirmations, but I don't see how-to achieve it in this case of decentralized exchange.   Thanks for the question.  There is a section in the whitepaper who explains how this part will be handled, when you withdraw from poloniexw, or other similar services, they don't broadcast a trasaction right away. Instead, they group them, and send a single transaction. This is how the distribution is going to be processed and it can be done as long as the TX size is lower then the block size. From there, you can create a single transaction with several outputs and pay a marginal fee.  This is one of the situations where the validator is handy, because he will ensure that you won't attempt to realise such operations, as he will check (several times) the informations sent by the users and process them in order to allow a trading, and the usage of multisignatures, smart contracts, LN channels would be also a part of the sollution.  As i already sead, NVO doesn't want to compete against other decentralized exchanges, or centralized exchanges, NVO aims at using the technologies provided by the multiple blockchains to create an as safe as possible environment for trading, and to provide a multi crypto wallet with as much ""functions"" as possible while giving the possibility to its users to choose what function they want to include into their wallet.

You are asking for money and yet you don't understand the protocol you will be using nor were you able to answer. I've been a crypto dev for 4 years and coded BitHalo and BitBay. Just linking me to wiki about AT when I already know how to do AT with checklocktimeverify is not a sufficient answer.  There is only ONE way to do decentralized exchange between blockchains and that is atomic trading. It cannot be done without checklocktimeverify because of malleability.  Also 2 of 3 escrow like BitSquare is not decentralized because of simple theft and collusion in escrow.  2 of 2 with microtrading works like in BitHalo but it's tedious and expensive and unpopular.  So the only way is AT and it must have a web front end in JavaScript and no blockchain download to become popular.  You can't just launch a project and be like ""give me money and I will build a decentralized exchange""  Sure man that's what everyone is doing right now and I'm getting tired of it. Make a full fledged decentralized exchange and then.launch a token. But your marketing whitepaper and response shows me you didn't have a specific protocol in mind to stop double spend and malleability  Like I said there is one way and to my knowledge Blocknet is the only coin doing it (maybe also Komodo)  Atomic trading  OK maybe you can build LN in every coin but that would be insane engineering costing millions or years  By the way when peoples money is on the line there is no such thing as ""safe as possible given the tools in the coin"" there is completely secure and not secure.

I don't agree with you when you say ""give me money and I will build a decentralized exchange"", we are not scaming people and i don't tolerate such a lack of respect, and please don't try to minify the project saying the team isn't capable to deliver it.  Now let me answer as a developer, the one who will make the validator (for free, not to bother the development funds), as Yani will work on the wallet, and manage the development team, there will be another developer who will work on coins implementation, and another one for the API clusters, i own't disclose any information regarding because they are still not recruited, they will be paid hourly.  Yani will manage the development team, after the beta2 yani and i will work on the plugin system as it is also into my interest to build it, we will even deliver a plugin for coinpayment integration, it is an insider information but i think that most of the people knew about it.  Now let me talk as a developer and explain to you how your informations are restricted, as you are talking about have been done, and what is going to be done.  - OP codes manipulation is an option, and it may not be used. Because this is related to bitcoin only, and it would restrict NVO and would deprecate the plugin system. - 2 OF 3  multisig addresses isn't an option at all as the two other participants could cheat on the validator, then the validator won't receive fees, and it is not in the interests of NVO. - 2 Of 2, you are seeing it as like as you open a direct streem between A and B, which is useless because in the end, what will do the validator here ? in your case the Validator is what you call an Escrow even if it is not his main purpose. In the case of NVO, the 2 OF 2, i will try to explain it in the most way so that you can understand it :  A and B want to trade, A will create a 2-OF-2 with the validator, B will create a 2-OF-2 with the validator. Once the validator verifies the order informations are good, and the transactions are valid, he will issue the required redeem scripts.  The validator will be hosted on safenetwork, i wish a good luck to any hacker who wants to hack into it, or even find it into the safenetwork. Actually with your closed logic, it will take you up to a life or two, unless someone gives you the sollution but it would too late as you won't be able to use it again.  Do not say that you are a developer as long as you can't innovate, developer = innovation not stagnation.  - NVO isn't a blockchain, it is a multi function wallet, with a DEX built on the safenetwork. You can still check their website, with the help of the plugin system, NVO can be a payment processor.  - Now talking about having enough, and fledged DEX, and about marketing, i asked not to give too much details about the validator on the whitepaper, because i wanted to explain it myself, and to explain the phenomenous amount of possibilities offered by the validator and the plugin system, as if i had to explain exactly in details the validator, we would have to create a lot more whitepapers, as he answer to Two big issues about decentralized trading, double spending and offline trading.  For marketing and community reasons, i prefered to let people's toughts open, so that future project developers can innovate using the NVO plugin system and its validator, which will enrich much more the NVO project.  - I don't want to say bad things about komodo but personally i don't really see how it can be usefull. I don't want to insult these projects, but most of them recreates blockchains, this a difference that most of the people have troubles to understand, NVO isn't a blockchain, it is a project who USES blockchains, it integrates them and complete their services.  - I never said that we will create LN for each coins, i said that it would be usable in order to let people know what is the actual stage of developer, in case someone decides to create  an LN DEX, and it wouldn't cost millions, nor years. And actually a lot of coins are already implementing their LN, you can check them.  -You know, even Bitcoin can be hacked in the future, everything is hackable, the technology is moving vary fast it is not frozen in 2017, there is no such ""secure"" system, and there will never be, even matrix (the movie) have been hacked.   To conclude, you gathered all the shits from the other projects and you throwd them here without even understanding the project, i would have appreciated if you asked me questions about NVO first, instead of throwing unrelated projects problems, and then you insult me even more when you say that i ask for people's money.  No longer insult me without real arguments.",False

NVO isn't selling its idea, they aim to create a community to launch its idea.  Example: If a project releases a token with bonuses and other goodies, the investors will dump the coin because of the bonus system, as they would think it is free money, while in NVO, it won't happen this way. For me, this policy is really bad because it is made to get as much money as possible, while it is more interesting to bring a healthy ecosystem and community around the project, which will let NVO to be deployed smoothly.",False

Quote from: lrntox on June 03, 2017, 02:25:20 AM There are many DEX, the coins and what is the difference?   This DEX is based on a decentralized network, actually most of the existing DEXs are on clearnet which means that it is semi-centralised in a way or another, while this one aims to be totally decentralized and automated. Most of the other DEXs use nodes on clearnet, NVO will be on safenet which is a decentralized network.  This is a minimalistic description, please read the whitepaper. You then ask me more questions.   Quote from: saqwe on June 03, 2017, 07:29:10 AM Quote from: lrntox on June 03, 2017, 02:25:20 AM There are many DEX, the coins and what is the difference?

Yep, in his post he'll mention a counterparty wallet. You need to make this kind of wallet. Counterparty is the only kind of bitcoin wallet that can receive and store your nvot.    No, CounterWallet will let you ""see"" your NVOT, you can receive them in any bitcoin address, that's why people don't have to send from Exchanges or Web Wallets or Third parties as they will be stuck there !

In the case of NVO, the Tokens will be used as a faucet, it is a way to help controle the price of the Token using a sub token at a fixed rate. Please have a look at my last post.  There are some great partnerships who will let NVO exchange grow in term of volume which is the main concern for decentralized exchanges. Another aspect of the project includes the creation of plugins to bridge together different projects from a single wallet. So instead of having 20 wallets on your computer, or having to keep logins for 100 service providers, NVO will let you do this directly from the wallet.

The large investors who are looking for early bonus have to understand that the strengh of a currency comes from it's community, NVO isn't here to create social divisions, NVO is here to serve everyone from smallest to largest. Do not forget that 90% of the community tested at least once a faucet to understand bitcoin by micro payments.  This is something that will resound with a lot of people like me. I am definitely part of that 90% of community who was curious to try Bitcoin and of course got my first payments after a few days of using a faucet. I am sure 90% are also like me who don't have much and are waiting so long for a chance to put our small coins into something we can share equally if it grows. NVO looks like one of this, and I am very close to making the decision to make it my first ""real"" choice for supporting.   Thank you for your comment, and i welcome to the adventure, in fact, NVO wants to get all the community, not only bitcoin, but all cryptos.

I would be greaful for some feedback on the questions i have regarding the NVO Crowdsale if possible?   First Question - I took an interest in this project prior to the initial launch date. I registered on the site to take part in the crowdsale, as part of this process i was given a user I.D.  As the date arrived i tried to log-on, but obviously there was an unexpected demand and the crowdsale launch date was subsequently set back.  Today i have tried to log-in to the crowdsale again now that things have stabilised, but it didnt recognise my login details, so i instead signed up as a fresh user (useing my original login details & email etc.). This worked and i was asigned a different user I.D. which i can use to log-on  Do you see any issue with this i.e. my email and password wont be still linked an anyway to my originnal registartion and cause issues down the line?   Second question - I was planning to contribute in the form of BTC from a Blockchain.info account, do you see any issues with this. Reading the website, if i deposit from Blockchain.info. then any distrubution of fee's in the form of NVOT would be sent to this same address. Is there an option to have funds sent to a different address at a later time?  I assume NVOT would be credited to the Blockchain.info account in the form of BTC, so i should then be able to transfer this BTC to a hardware wallet (which im awaiting delivery of - out of stock) at any time in the future?  any help appreciated, Thanks, KR",False

If you have anymore questions feel free to ask either in the thread, by PM or in slack, the NVO project is open and wants to be as user friendly as possible.  So let's answer your questions.  First question :  There was a lot of troubles at the initial launch, now they have been solved, server upgraded and the traffic can be managed with a relative ease, but most important, the security issues have been solved. Regarding your account, some have been lost due to database enhancements, but the team kept a copy of it, so your informations and old user ID can still be recovered. If you haven't invested it is better to create a new account.  Second question:  You shouldn't invest from a blockchain.info wallet, even if the wallet's private key can be recovered, it is not advised to do the operation as it can return some unexpected results. the best is to create a counterparty address and use it to invest, this way you will find your NVOT directly into that address.  The investment process may be complicated for some users, but we will do our best to guide you.  So :  1- Create a wallet at : https://wallet.counterwallet.io/ 2- backup the passphrase 3- Send Bitcoins to your counterparty wallet. 4- Register in NVO and login. 5- Insert the counterparty wallet's address. 6- Send from your counterparty wallet to the Bitcoin escrow address.  Finished, you will receive your NVOTokens into that wallet, and as it is a counterparty wallet, you will be able to see them.  Do not hesitate to contact me or the team (slack) if you need more informations or guidance.  Could please specify the model you are awaiting for ?

Can you guess what will be the final balance in BTC?  I don't want to speculate on that, the project isn't focusing on money. The most important is to focus on the project development, the crowdsale is just a step. The team doesn't want to ""imagine"" how much they will collect, they are more in a logic of ""how to best use this money"" because the real objective of NVO is to bring volume to the exchange, and they can't bear to disrespect the community as it would be bad for the investors, and the futur users.

For simpler explanation, check the video. For more details check the whitepaper. It's between wallet to wallet so we can process orders quickly for users. The problem would be users are required to be online for the exchange to happen so offline trading won't be supported right away and high volume orders might take longer than traditional exchanges during the early stages of development. That's why it's important for us to raise money for liquidity and get partners that are market makers. There are several methods to tackle the problem with offline trading, but it won't be part of our main focus until online trading works well. The problem with offline trading is it won't be fully decentralized(semi) however it is doable. There are also other methods that rely on the Safenetwork that we could do as well that will keep it fully decentralized, but they haven't been developed yet as of this moment and will be worked on during alpha 3.  The wallet for NVO will be open source and the state of the validator will be decided by token holders. We will use money from crowdsale to hold a reserve for bugs bounty and it will scale with the exchange so more money will be added to the reserve as the exchange becomes more profitable. Unlike centralized exchanges all assets are controlled by users even during exchange. Theoretically, if we encounter critical bugs/vulnerabilities, there is a much smaller window for theft in both time and quantity compared to centralized exchanges due to hackers having to target very specific settings which can be prevented as we set up more system of independent checks minimizing the risk of theft from even small incidents. Ultimately, if there are problems it will mostly likely because users don't secure their computers from malware.  Yes we both have experience dealing with exchanges and crypto currencies projects. We have a partnership with coinpayments and are endorsed by the Maidsafe team because they believe in the capacity of this project. If this project is impossible to implement then the first people to realize that would have been the maidsafe team so rest assured this is not impossible and will be done. For Yanni last project, he was working to help to build a centralized exchange called veserus.com which is still in development, so there is experience working from both sides.  It's easy to doubt development for decentralized exchanges and forget that nearly every non-DEX has been hacked and struggle to stay in business for continuous years. These hacks can vary from human errors to third parties vulnerabilities on traditional networks. Non-DEX not only control users assets they control users' info and the market itself. Centralized services form a monopoly on the decentralized economy.  We have endorsement from the Maidsafe team while building this project on the Safenetwork. It takes a few post on the forums to request for help from the community, and issues can be resolved because when it comes to developments there are solutions its just a matter of finding the best one. Along the way we may get hacked and we can't say we won't because any service or website saying that would be lying. We can get hacked, but it's set up so the incidents are minimized even if we do. You can read the whitepaper on the scenarios and how we plan to prevent it. We also have very flexible set up on what technology we can work with to secure the exchange such as a solution to double spend . There will be a rewarding security bounty reserve so people are always encouraged to find vulnerabilitie. Our wallet and plugins system also ensures we are not only building an exchange but a encouraging a shift from centralized services to become more decentralized so that all decentralized services get a bigger market share. Hopefully more people will understand what we are trying to build and realize it's importance.",False

Ok, let's see if I get it, working example:  suppose I hold 20% of all NVOTs. Suppose t is the interval of time between NVOS distribution.  Scenario: During t, 10 BTC are collected as fees and 10 ETH are collected as fees, so 20% of 50 % of that is to be distributed to me, that is, 1 BCT plus 1 ETH - NVO company holds 50% of all fees. So far, so good. Now, based on which market will you give me the amount of NVOS corresponding to that 1 BCT and to that 1 ETH in dollars??  I understood that when you come up with the price of all fees of all cryptocurrencies in dollars, you will use the formula NVOS=0.99USD to generate the adequate amount of NVOS, that's very clear. What I'm struggling with is how this calculation will be done.  Isn't it easier in each scenario to distribute the cryptocurrencies themselves? Specially if your schemata is seen by regulatory agencies in different countries as an online exchange and with the risk of the entire thing being shut down? You are distributing dividends with price tag in fiat.  I don't know about the tech challenges to do this, though.",False

In USA, 1$ is valuable, but lower then 1$ isn't valuable, this is why NVOS will be used, NVO doesn't want to get regulated by the governments because it is a decentralized exchange, regulating NVO means centralizing it. So as 1$ is a reference in USA, the Team decided to lower the price of NVOS by 1 cent in order to avoid legal issues regarding the distribution of funds, this process lets the NVO Wallet usable worldwide without limitations like Bitcoin.  The NVOT and NVOS will be counterparty assets, built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, so the NVOS will be exchanged for Bitcoin only. While NVOT can be exchanged like any other asset/currency.  Once you put your NVOT in the NVO wallet, the validator will be aware that own X amount of NVOT, and will then send you a proportional amount of NVOS. Each time a trade is concluded, the validator will calculate the fees values in bitcoin.  Then he will process the distribution of NVOS, 50% will be sent to NVO and 50% will be distributed to the owners of NVOT.  NVO will issue buy orders once a week to buy back the NVOS at a fixed value of 0.99$ in BTC. This process will be automated later.  How the Validator will send the NVOS to NVOT holders ? The validator will convert the collected fees from Altcoin/Asset to Bitcoin. Then he will exchange the Bitcoins to USDT in order to fix the value. Finally will send NVOS proportionally to the amount of fees collected, and will distribute them proportionally to the amount of NVOT held by the wallets.  After a week, NVO will buy back the distributed NVOS to feed the Validator for the next week and so on, this process will be automated in late development stages.  This will incentivise holders/investors/owners of NVOT by keeping their tokens into the wallet, thus reducing the risk of dumps.",False

So the marketing will be of Word of mouth type and a minimum of visibility on clearnet especially to bring new users to the exchange.  For the rest, i think that the advanced features and plugin system will draw a lot of users there.

My apologies, but how to create my own BTC address in the wallet (to use for the dashboard in NVO)? Do I create a BTC address in the Send tab or in the Receive tab - of the BTC QT wallet? I know how to do it - just need to be sure which tab to use, as I don't use BTC much. File -> Receiving addresses -> New (label is optional, but I suggest marking it as NVO because you need to know where your counterparty tokens are).    Don't forget to backup your wallet.dat. It is best to join the Slack team if you need direct assistance.  I was looking for these answer. Good thing i read instead of posting the same question. I am still lurking around the project and reading the white paper. It was less reading aftaer i read this. Thanks.  I thank Lauda for this awesome work, i hope that it will help a lot of users.

This project isn't a token sale project, it is a fair crowdsale, some investors sent less then a dollar, and others up to 16k usd, and even more.  let me tell you why am i pleased to see this diversification, because the investors are going to be users. NVO won't serve only large volume orders, it will be used by several users from small to large traders. It could be used by someone who needs to quickly and securely exchange small amounts from a crypto to another. It could also be used by service providers to exchange their Altcoins for Bitcoin in a secure way.  NVO wants to be fair with the whole crypto community, either Altcoins or Bitcoin.  The large investors who are looking for early bonus have to understand that the strengh of a currency comes from it's community, NVO isn't here to create social divisions, NVO is here to serve everyone from smallest to largest.

I'm clueless about 90% of the technology involved, but from the economic point of view it looks very clever -- I have hope that the completion of the work comes soon and that the community adopt it.  That being said, what is not so clear is how to calculate/estimate the financial return. This needs to be clarified, I will invest some Bitcoins, but how many of them depends if I can have a rough notion of what to expect.  I understand that in part this might be due to Safenet's costs not being that clear yet, but after reading the whitepaper I don't understand 100% how the fixed price NVOS=0.99USD will translate either in fiat, or in bitcoins. You won't work with fiat, so what will be the parameter of distribution of NVOS and, especially, what exactly they will worth? Will NVO literally deposit dollars in my account upon redeeming? Will NVO guarantee that my NVOS can buy bitcoins? I don't get it.  And how many NVOS will be generated per distribution period? I understand that they split 50% for NVO company, 50% for NVOT holders, and from the latter each person gets as many NVOS as the share of NVOT they hold. But then, if too few NVOS are issued then each person get less, since somehow you say that NVOS=0.99USD.  It would be interesting to post here a working example.  cheers",False

Step 2: Generate a new address in your wallet and send the amount that you want to invest to it.  Mandatory steps: Step 1: Register an account on the NVO website: https://nvo.io/register.php. If you've sucessfully registered, you will see this screen:  Step 2: Confirm the account by clicking the link that you've received in your email account.  Step 3: Log in: https://nvo.io/login.php Step 4: Enter a personal Bitcoin address, one to which you own the private keys to (do not use exchanges, web services, and similar). This will enable you to see the Bitcoin escrow address and will generate an unique address for each coin.  Step 5: Depending on what you want to invest with, there are two possibilities here. Step 5.1: If you are investing Bitcoin, then send from the personal address that you've previously entered. Step 5.2: If you are investing any altcoin, then send to the addresses that you see in your dashboard. The tokens will be credited to the entered Bitcoin personal address.

I will add your project to the DEx thread when I get time. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1338970  Feel free to post there to introduce yourself and explain your project a little.

The problem is that if you don't input a bitcoin address you won't be able to receive NVOT as it is a counterparty asset. As soon as you input an address, your altcoin addresses will be revealed.   Why XCP???  Why not ETH?  Is there a reason?  I just don't understand why you'd start on XCP when projects are having problems and leaving XCP.  If you could please explain clearly your reasoning behind issuing tokens on XCP, that would be awesome.  Also, let's say XCP dies or we decide XCP is not a good fit later on, will you be able to migrate to ETH or another blockchain?  Is the benefit of XCP only to get started cheaply with less effort building a BTC dividend paying ETH contract?  XCP is the one huge drawback I see in this project.  While Storj and others are getting off XCP, you are getting on.   Thank you for your comment, first i would like to ask you why do you think XCP is dying ? Currently XCP is one of the most advanced layers for Bitcoin, it is secured by Bitcoin, their team is implementing smart contracts, and lightning payments. What ever happens, Bitcoin will always be the top crypto currency, Ethereum is still far behind Bitcoin, this is my point of view as a dev.  I am sure that Storj have good reasons to leave them, but it doesn't means that XCP is worthless.

Sadlyn ot for now, due to the limitations of the APIs, but they are working on it, and will enable a better balance checking system. which will be used to bring informations about the global invested funds.  Is it not possible to track this via escrow address on blockchain?  Yes you can, because you won't send to NVO, you send to an address controled by the escrows. If the balance doesn't show up, it just means that the API is not providing the information.   Quote from: blacque on May 27, 2017, 04:57:40 AM hi,  [forgive me if I am meant to have figured this out or derived this by reading the crowdsale materials so far]  I'm only a small fish:  is there a minimum amount of BTC, ETH or other of the acceptable coins I have to send to the relevant address in my account on the logged-in NVO crowdsale website?  In other words, what's the minimum contribution/'investment' amount for me to participate in this crowdsale?  e.g. 1 ETH minimum, 0.01 BTC minimum, etc?  cheers  There is no Minimum, it all depends on you, but as said Lauda, it is better to send like 0.01 BTC as a minimum because it would be too small compared to others, and you won't have much Tokens.   Quote from: tofm2 on May 27, 2017, 05:51:26 AM Hi, I have contributed by sending XRP, but I do not see the amount of sent XRP to my account page although my transaction was confirmed (of course I have done the correct operations with BTC paper wallet)  https://bithomp.com/explorer/rHyZ3Hdje9tzoBwgxp1W5nr4qt1KhiHcpQ  please comment  Thank you for your participation, the balance on dashboard is about the displayed address, your investment is under the controle of the escrows, no need to worry about that. Actually the team is setting up some nodes to provide the required informations as the APIs are limited. Sorry for the inconvenient.   Quote from: dsem on May 27, 2017, 05:55:04 AM Hi, right now I invested in eth on the crowdsale, but I do not see my confirmed eth on my dashboard yet. How many confirmation the dashboard needs before I could see on it? Thanks  The investment goes to an address controle by an escrow, there is no confirmation limit, the dashboard shows the current balance of each address, it is just limited by the APIs, that's why it is not showing up. The team is working on that. Thank you for your participation.

The actual system is more adapted to the project then to the usual platforms, because of counterparty, the most important is to secure the investment. I personally prefer to offer a slightly more complicated way to invest, rather then complicate the withdrawals. Generally there are always pumps after crowdsales, so i presume some investors (traders) will try to benefit from that, you can check this on the coins historical prices, sometimes the value is raised by x10.  Chronobank had a crowdsale of 5 millions $, if you check them on coinmarketcap, you will find their market cap at 11 millions (ticker : TIME), they have been dumped recently. This is the pressure i am talking about, so what ever happens, NVO have to respect and secure the investors as much as possible. That's why it may appear complicated, but we respect the ideas and feedbacks of everyone.

So, let's say that you want to exchange Bitcoin for ethereum. You will create an order, this order will be received by the validator using safe launcher (lots of possibilities here regarding implementation), this order will be set as pending order for matching. Once it is matched, your wallet will be notified, and will create a transaction, and sign it. The validator will receive your transaction and will check for the validity of the informations like the balance, the fees, the addresses ... once everything is ok, it will broadcast your transaction without your intervention.  The same process will happen on the other side, regarding the one who wants to sell ethereum for bitcoin.  Please feel free to ask more questions.

Your fees are astronomical. Buy better infrastructure.” While @ed_baker tweeted, “So let's see: price tanks, Coinbase goes offline. This is at least the third time I've seen this happen since March.” Adding to the complaints @StoicFrog tweets, “ETH dropped to $164 and your crap site failed to allow me to buy. Odd how your site crashes at the most opportune time for sellers & buyers.”   this project, if developed correctly , can solve this big trouble.   You are right, that's why NVO wanted to do a crowdsale, because it is not a project who can be done by a single developer on his free time, it needs a strong architecture and a competent team. I know the developer, and i can assure you that he have what it needs to  manage the development.  Thank you for your support.

They meant you should not send from coinbase nor xapo kind of web wallets as they are not allowing us to access the private key of your bitcoin addy.   how could i see my nvo tokens? To see NVO tokens you might need to import your privatekey into NVO's wallet (probably after moving out any of your BTC balances, if you concern).

I understand, let's follow the scheme :  1- Investor/Holder puts NVOT on the wallet. 2- Exchange collects fees, and prepares a distribution. 3- The validator sends the NVOS to the NVOT holders. 4- A sell order is open on counterparty DEX with the equivalent value of the NVOS distributed. 5- A holder can then exchange the NVOS on counterparty, for it's value in Bitcoin. 6- The NVOS are stored and their supply modified to maintain the price of 0.99$  I hope that it helps.",False

For the investors who sent funds, rest assured that your funds are kept securely in the escrows hands. NVO is sorry for this inconvenience. There is a new server and more protections, the website is currently under propagation. We would like to thank lauda for taking care of the scammers on slack.  First i would like to apologies for not been present on bitcointalk today, the old server has been removed and the website migrated in order to protect the investors,  So the propagation takes time to be realised. We added some security regarding attackers who slowed the website. Personally i am not a member of the team, but i am working with the developer to secure the platform agains these attacks, we are at 18 hours of development right now.  The investments are safe, the database is backed up, so you won't loose anything.  I personally have an idea about the scammers. Recently i had a discussion with a platform who wanted to take the project and remove the bitcointalk escrows. I asked the team to refuse, as these ico platforms are succeeding because of the escrowd of bitcointalk and because of the decentralization of bitcoin. Some people think that because of their disclosed IDs they can get controle over bitcoin.  Today, Simon dixon says no to altcoins, and that only Bitcoin matters, while he create an altcoin. Roger Ver says yes to altcoins and no to bitcoin, while he is a member of the bitcoin foundation (bitcoin.com). While i saw how the bitcoin core works, even Lauda asked to all the devs to participate, she/he is one of the protectors of bitcoin, and it is not for polotical aspects that i will question the bitcoin core's ecosystem.  I am not accusing them, but some other people are saying they are neutral while they are scammers. The platform i am suspecting asked the team to delay the crowdsale by 3 months in order to prepare a better marketing campaign and gather 10 millions minimum. I asked the team to say no, and they agreed simply because they would have lost the confidence of people as they engaged for a launch date. So they decided not to loose their word, and to go on.  I would like the scammers, if they continiue, they must know that they are annoying developers, and we could simply trace them as they are using bots for now. I can provide the proof that i hacked paypal when i was younger, i stole nothing, just wanted to take the challenge, they found me, and they prosecuted me, so i still have the proof which is an official court document. If they don't stop i will track them down even if they hide in their mom's stomach.",False

EON was everything I've been working on building with my team in the background with one exception EON is closed-source, proprietory, and is not open about the fact that it is closed to U.S. citizens. I was very disappointed; because I needed a trustless exchange like Shapeshift & Changelly; but with order-books; and high volume like Poloniex and Bittrexx. I DO program bots; so not being able to use a bot so I am not glued to my screen watching charts 24/7 is not something that excites me.    NVO does not have to have a web version, but it should at least have a web application similar to the NEM wallet, so someone can just download a folder, and click index.html and be able to use it in a web, as opposed to having to download an application and install it. Or be stuck to a phone. The reason I don't use other decentralized exchanges is because I have to install, and sync and it doesn't work on my computer without issues. I've read the entire 13 pages of this thread so I see where it differs from Bitsquare etc. I hope that it differs here too.  NVO to increase it's success should look at what other exchanges and their alternative competitions are offering. Particularly I think it should look at what EON is offering, and PRISM (by Shapeshift which is not an exchange but a portfolio...but one where you have to pay fees to use ETHER), EON's seems to be the RIPPLE of exchange alternatives with more features. EON is the blockchain version for their exchange Exscudo. That it has it's own blockchain seems to be a plus for it which is integrated into it's own exchange, where people can benefit, to integrate other features to it.  To do this in such a way where one does not have to give up their privacy as they are forced to do with EON -- and in a open way, we don't have that. I see that NVO is focused on having other wallets and services integrate themselves into it; so I imagine if someone offers USD/FIAT they have to decide NVO is worth it and could make their own rules -- but that's just an assumption. The whitepaper that was on the site is down.   NVO looks very well put together; but I haven't seen anything else. It should focus on aesthetics and beauty, modern interfaces and UI. But it also should look at Poloniex's system of order-books and charts, look at Gemini, and it needs to integrate the things that work in a slick clean way. Poloniex's chart system and the ability to look at the side to see which alts are performing well and which are bad, and how easy their order books are is why I like them. The DDOS attacks not so much.  NVO hasn't made clear how the team will profit from fees; I like that EON offers a way for regular people to use their 'tokens' to be able to receive some fees. From what I understand the only thing NVO tokens serve is for crowdfunding, and then they'll just be traded on an exchange; but other than supporting developers and being tradeable what real value do they give people? What benefits come to actually holding the token. Do my fees on the exchange get reduced? Do we get to purchase at a super low price?  I like that it's not doing an ICO, but if there is no benefit to purchasing it; the 'incentive' it's a hard sell to people who look at this not as traders but investors. Unless your target is 'only' traders? IDK if I have understood this correctly.  Right now I see NVO as something minimal. It's limited to the power of 2 people  whereas other projects have a greater team. Yes this has already been addressed, and I more than anyone understand what it means to work with a small team. I also agree that a small team is better than a large team of people who* disagree. But you're also limited in what you can reasonably do as just 2 people. What a small team can do at the most basic is make a most basic replacement, meanwhile other people like EON are making alternative exchanges that are only slightly less evil than Poloniex. NVO is very honest, I love that compared to EON and it's participants which don't have the same integrity. I'd like it see it compete directly against EON; it's truly decentralized alternative.  For NVO to really get attention and be successful it should also make a partnership with someone big, to get some backing -- if now not at a later date; I'm not understanding if it plans to integrate other exchanges or even how...but I hope that it integrates Shapeshift and/or Changelly, it would nice to have the option to have an order book if exchanges are being integrated into it as I've read. To be able to place in an order at the price you want and purchase from Shapeshift/Changelly when that order has been met.  If NVO is not focused on integrating other exchanges and just p2p. Look at how Shapeshift/Changelly have created liquidity, each in a different way, how can we tackle the low volume issues that decentralized exchanges have? I've not heard how this plans to be tackled so that people who are hesitant about this exchange can come on and know that there will be liquidity in the coin they want.  How easy will NVO be to use? Part of it is making it so easy someone dumb like me can use it. Should have charts integrated into it like any other exchange; really it has to be a good alternative, not just good enough. Even if it's not EON, to be attractive it needs to offer what Poloniex and Bittrex offer; with the ease and efficiency of Shapeshift/Changelly/Jaxx/Exodus. I really see NVO's potential.  It's hard for me to understand ALL that NVO has to offer against what it's not offering; though I understand basics. A decentralized wallet with built in exchange features, where the users decide the currency pairs they want not a centralized; where top wallets are added by the core team; but other wallets such as XEM or STRAT have to be added by the XEM or STRAT team...let me make clear that it is very unlikely that with all the work those teams are doing that they will have time to worry about building a wallet for this exchange btw. But maybe someone in the community will; I recommend that every coin that Changelly and Shapeshift offer, should be offered by NVO. Changelly as an example integrates and partners with an exchange; and you p2p with them while they do the work; you put in the price you want it they give you back what they could get at that time through Poloniex/Bittrex; Shapeshift similarly; but Shapeshift has it's own wallet reserve of coins. And this is how they are able to increase liquidity. NVO on the other hand seems to have a different approach; I need the whitepaper to understand. I understand the site has been attacked which tells me right now that NVO is seen as a threat to some group of people. So NVO must be on the right track.  I do feel like there is a place for NVO, I want to see that place. At least if NVO is not planning to compete against EON or Poloniex or Bittrex. I feel so strongly that we need NVO which is why I'm writing this indepth feedback; I think NVO is offering something we don't have yet; but it's a little bit behind the times because other exchanges are already being born right now; offering ICOs to compete.  Let it be clear that I realize that NVO is not EON; that EON has a blockchain which is why it can offer the services it's offering and that my understanding is that NVO is built on top of a blockchain? What was it counterparty? I'm not sure have been reading a lot of whitepapers and websites so can't recall all the details.",False

This system will protect NVO from dumps, as every NVO holder will receive NVOS, and the price will be fixed at 0.99$, this way, the operation will be legal as it is tiny amount, or micropayment, that's what will let NVO stay decentralized and legal, it will also protect the investors from the legal part. It will be like a faucet for the investors, and it will stay legal and combinable.   This is how the NVOS and NVO Token works. If someone decides to sell their NVO Tokens on a centralized exchange, he won't receive NVOS, as soon the buyer withdraws them to an NVO wallet, the validator will recognise him as an investor or holder and will send him NVOS.  http://i.imgur.com/iwAShLi.png   This is how the validator will do to send the NVOS to the investors.  http://i.imgur.com/jsr3euR.png  This sytem will protect the NVO Token from dumps, and will favorite the growth of the token's price proportionally to the generated volume as the NVO Tokens will receive more NVOS.

Think outside of the box and make a small comparison:  | Traditional exchanges | NVO | | Centralized | Decentralized | | Competitive fees | Competitive fees | | Exit Scam/hack Risk | No risk of exit scam/hack. | | Private keys owned by the exchange. | Private keys owned by individuals. | | Privacy loss due to registration and verification tiers. | No privacy loss. | Someone could probably come up with a better and more detailed comparison if they spent more time.

As you said, NVO isn't a blockchain, and it is not built on top of a blockchain. NVO intends to use the blockchains and their features to provide as much functions as possible to the users.  NVO don't want to compete or to be compared to other projects, after all, each one is working on his own and deals with his advantages and flaws even if the main problems are similar.  The safe networks offers a lot of advantages compared to a blockchain sollution. More stability, more features, more possibilities for the users, the Team won't have to focus on building a P2P network and maintain it, instead, they will use the existing networks.  You can imagine it like a nexus point where the technologies and networks can talk to each other.  And effectively the attack was important. But it won't happen again.  For the exchange integration, i aleready said that the exchanges could be added by the team, or by developers directly. Not into the wallet but as a plugin, and these plugins, aren't limited to exchanges only, anything who offers an API could be added as a plugin.  Thanks again for your great post.

After you do this, an LTC address will show for your account. Any funding sent to that address will be credited with tokens to the BTC address that you have specified.

Have you read any news regarding MobileGo, the biggest crowdsale ever? They've used the same model.   I personally as an investor try to find projects that have a maximum collection limit of between 10-15 million in the ICO so that when it comes to market the total capitalization of the tokens can be multiplied by the maximum number of times. Then invest near the end if you are conformable with the total amount that has been raised.   In this project you are saying that there is no maximum limit of collection and that until the end of the 30-day ICO you will distribute the tokens according to the money raised. Putting a maximum also implies a centralized decision on the value of each token. I find it better that the market decides the price per token, especially in a project focused on decentralization.",False

And im hoping for the success of this project because i also gain if that would happened.  You are missunderstanding the meaning of a crowdsale, an ICO tries to gather as much funds as possible regardless of the fairness of the operation. NVO wants to be fair with the investors, and considers that early investment bonus is like an insult to the investors and to the project itself as it would mean that they don't care about the tokens and just want to gather the funds, which is not false.  Also, allowing such distribution is like looking for whalers who will then dump the coin. NVO aims at gathering a community of investors/users/holders who invests into the project because they think that NVO has a real potencial, not only for economical reasons. NVO wants a fair and clean ecosystem.",False

Example: Harry Potter decides to create a blockchain in the wizarding world to avoid tax evasion that would restore voldemor once again. He will have his community but he will not be able to post in bitcointalk as he will be in the wizarding world. There is no exchange there, but he would be able to download the wallet NVO and to publish his currency into the wallet, which will bring more volume, it will be up to him to promote his currency without NVO's intervention.  Why NVO will redefine the banking system, let's check this link: https://www.uber.com it is a huge transport company which offers a decentralized service from particular to particular, when you register on the site they will Ask for your credit card, which reduces the vision field of decentralization. NVO will be a possible solution to this problem if UBER decides to use payments in crypto currencies, it is sufficient to integrate a plugin UBER which will allow a user to pay for this service via exchange by the Validator, the cab will receive Its payment by UBER, and UBER will receive its payment by the Validator, which guarantees the security of the exchange, and therefore of the service. Either the Customer sends the money to the taxi, NVO takes a fee, and UBER takes a fee if both customer and cab accepts crypto currencies, and in case the taxi does not accept crypto currencies, the customer will send cryptos to UBER then UBER will send fiat to the taxi. Hence the revolutionary payment processor system. I could give you lots of examples, that's why i said NVO is a revolutionary Wallet, Exchange, with advanced features, this project cannot be compared to others as NVO team offers large bridging capacities.  what about lykke? the offer secured trades too. but their system is to add coins. and not let the coins devs do this.",False

I understand your point of view, NVO will add for sure the most used coins because NVO have to generate revenues, the difference is that people will be able to add their own coins. Do not forget that NVO is a modular project, meaning that users will have access different services from the wallet, that's why the developers or community members of a coin will be able to add support for their coin into the wallet.",False

If SAFE works then it seems like a given that it will be popular and get a lot of attention - censor-resistant internet with no servers, decentralised farming so free access to any user with spare resources, and the first crypto that's a ubiquitously useful utility that you have to burn/destroy to store or serve data on the network (everyone needs to store or serve data). It scales, has zero tx fees, no confirmations so instant txs, PoR so no wasteful mining, it's private by default, secure, and it has a fixed supply.  Let's face it, SAFE might not work, but IF it does then we can pretty sure it will be the most popular crypto currency fairly quickly - no barrier to entry as you don't have to 'buy' it, plus it has HUGE utility appeal/demand (Tor, bittorent and bitcoin have many millions of users, SAFE will be more robust and easier to use than any of them, with a whole lot more to offer besides).  I think SAFE projects like NVO and PDC have great potential. They will start off with no competition on the network. First mover advantage for a social network or exchange on a new, decentralised internet could be pretty huge.

New experimental exchanges can struggle to capture attention, we don't want to NVO to be another Bitsquare which is known as a service neglected by the users.   Hello, thank you for your interest and welcome to the thread for the new comers.  First i will answer about the fees, they will stay fixed at 0.2%, which is a competitive rate compared to the most famous centralized exchanges like pointed by aubert, these exchanges fees are at 0.25%. I want to point also that these fees are lower compared to bank systems. Why am i giving this example ? NVO will redefine the bank system.  The difference between Exodus, Jaxx and NVO is that NVO's plugin system will let cryptocurrencies developers to provide support for their coin into the NVO wallet. In the case of Jaxx and Exodus, it is up to their teams to add support for coins while in NVO it depends of the cryptocurrencies developers Which makes NVO's coin support decentralized simply because there will be no more looking for the top 10 currencies in marketcap to know what to add.  It is true that NVO will use this method at its launch but will deliver at the same time its plugin system.  Example: Harry Potter decides to create a blockchain in the wizarding world to avoid tax evasion that would restore voldemor once again. He will have his community but he will not be able to post in bitcointalk as he will be in the wizarding world. There is no exchange there, but he would be able to download the wallet NVO and to publish his currency into the wallet, which will bring more volume, it will be up to him to promote his currency without NVO's intervention.  Why NVO will redefine the banking system, let's check this link: https://www.uber.com it is a huge transport company which offers a decentralized service from particular to particular, when you register on the site they will Ask for your credit card, which reduces the vision field of decentralization. NVO will be a possible solution to this problem if UBER decides to use payments in crypto currencies, it is sufficient to integrate a plugin UBER which will allow a user to pay for this service via exchange by the Validator, the cab will receive Its payment by UBER, and UBER will receive its payment by the Validator, which guarantees the security of the exchange, and therefore of the service. Either the Customer sends the money to the taxi, NVO takes a fee, and UBER takes a fee if both customer and cab accepts crypto currencies, and in case the taxi does not accept crypto currencies, the customer will send cryptos to UBER then UBER will send fiat to the taxi. Hence the revolutionary payment processor system. I could give you lots of examples, that's why i said NVO is a revolutionary Wallet, Exchange, with advanced features, this project cannot be compared to others as NVO team offers large bridging capacities.",False

You will have the possibility to add your prefered coins to the wallet, read the big post, i know it is long.  Quote from: Lauda on May 20, 2017, 11:32:07 AM Quote from: FlightyPouch on May 20, 2017, 11:23:31 AM   We can't say still that it may have, but it has a potential, but what I am looking for is their Bitcoim wallet where you can have a full control of your currency assets, even in the exchange, you can have full control. The wallet may be still under development, but I know many users are looking forward to it too. Think outside of the box and make a small comparison:  | Traditional exchanges | NVO | | Centralized | Decentralized | | Competitive fees | Competitive fees | | Exit Scam/hack Risk | No risk of exit scam/hack. | | Private keys owned by the exchange. | Private keys owned by individuals. | | Privacy loss due to registration and verification tiers. | No privacy loss. | Someone could probably come up with a better and more detailed comparison if they spent more time. This makes it perfectly clear why such a project has extreme potential.  Thank you Lauda, much appreciated.

Too add NVO.IO is a kind of wallet/exchange that offer a unanimous account in which consumers will surely love no personal information will be taken from you unlike some wallets that require personal info and verification to be compliant with some government requirements.  The wallet aims to provide an alternative to original crypto wallets. It means that users will be able to use their wallet as like as any other wallet, except that it will have a lot more features, a DEX, multi coins and so on. i know that yani wants absolutely to add coin controle feature to the wallet for all the coins who supports it.",False

This is why i appreciate your questions because they will go directly to the FAQ.  First, the anti-ddos features are mandatory, nowadays you can't release something on a network without anti-ddos features. Second, i just had a look at blocknet, it is not that i will say a bad thing about it, but i would look like to. Both projects are totally different, blocknet is a blockchain project, i understand now why you talk about algo. NVO isn't a blockchain, she uses the blockchains, maybe even blocknet can be used, because NVO is a software. Instead of comparing the validator to a blockchain, compare it to a decentralized escrow as by the end of the development, he will work on his own, without the intervention of the NVO team. A video will be released soon with draws in order to explain the project.  I know their developer very well, i am a developer too, i help them, they are friends. They will use nodeJS mostly for the Validator, maybe some other languages too. Why NodeJS ? Because it is a dynamic language widely supported who have still a lot to deliver.  It is like asking the recipe of coca-cola. I can also tell you that your comparaison with an algorythm isn't exactly how the Validator works, as he will have a lot of other functions, the ""algo"" is just a segment of the whole machine as the validator will be able to work with multisig addresses in different ways for different purposes.  Once again, NVO isn't a blockchain. And you don't need tokens to use the decentralized exchange.  Thanks again.",False

Yes Bitsquare and NVO are close, so does the other decentralized exchanges. Except that NVO's revolution is that it will be up to the community to decide which coins are going to be traded, not to NVO. The trading fees will be lower as it will consist of the TX fees plus exchange fees of 0.2%. It is like for Bitcoin, as he won't ask the websites to add him, it is the websites who add Bitcoin as a payment method. That's how the plugin system will enable the support for more coins, the community will add them. I do like the modular aspect behind the system, which is yet to be seen in this ecosystem.   The second revolution is the Validator as it is a solution for decentralized offline trading, which is the main issue with decentralized exchanges, and the main advantage of centralized exchanges. NVO is like Mac or Linux, while centralized exchanges are like Windows, The developers could understand this comparaison.  Third advantage, NVO won't be able to fake volume as there won't be the possibility to add remote automated trading as the wallet will be the gateway. The centralized platforms use to give an API to remotely trade on their platform, which lets them use shadow bots to fake volumes, while they are covered by TOS as their resposibility is limited. The video which  was released helped with briefly understanding the difference between (as I still don't have time to read the whitepaper). This sounds very good. Thanks for answering.  Quote from: coininterview on May 20, 2017, 03:37:58 AM I also do not think this is a money grab out right.  They are clearly have an escrow and a development timeline. I do agree their messaging is a bit minimal but sometimes thats not worth scrutinizing. If they time is essentially very limited at the moment, I'd find it better to focus on development and whatnot rather than communicating (which can be often a waste of time due to e.g. repetitive questions). Just be patient. The crowdsale starts soon, and I'm sure that they will answer whenever possible.",False

I invite you to read the whitepaper where more details are given. I also posted about this part with a given example :  Quote Let me explain to you why 2 tokens. NVO Token will represent the market cap of the NVO project. let's imagine a daily volume on the NVO exchange of : 500.000 USD. Weekly it is : 3.500.000 USD Let's say Bob exchanges Bitcoin for Alex's Ethereum. NVO will take a fee of 0.2% at the moment of the transaction from Bob and from Alex which will result in a total of 0.4% on the transaction. During a week of trading, NVO will collect 0.4% of the trading volume which is 3.500.000 USD resulting in 14.000 USD. NVO will keep 7.000 USD, and share 7.000 USD among the  NVOT holders. In order to get deeply in the details, and know how much an investor will get as a return, let's say that NVO collected 300.000 USD from the crowdsale from 200 investors or bakers. The average investment by investor would be 1500 USD. As the weekly collected fees would be 7.000 USD / 200 investors, it would return an average of 35 USD. In this case, NVO won't have troubles regarding legal stuff as it will process tiny amounts, and won't be forced to be centralized by an authority. But if NVO does a 5.000.000 USD  volume daily, which is reachable, it would bring 35.000.000 USD weekly volume, 140.000 USD fees collected, and 70.000 USD for the investors which will result in 350 USD weekly for each investor on average. Monthly it would be 1400 USD, and this would attract the attention of the authorities depending from which country the investors are using the wallet. In order to protect NVO and the investors, the NVO team decided to create the NVOS who's value will be fixed at 0.99$. On the legal plan, as the price of NVOS will be lower then 1$, it's processing will be considered as a gift, which will keep it legal, like faucets.  If you have questions about the volumes, please visit this link : http://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/volume/24-hour/ You willfind a list of exchanges with their daily volume, you could then have an idea of the future volume of NVO.",False

NVO aims to be completely oriented towards coin/coin trades? I would guess that a combination of Bitsequare and NVO could phase out some of the traditional exchanges. I have never used Bitsequare, thus I haven't really ever done some real research into its setup.  That's why I did not work as a university professor, if not I would have put my students to sleep and nobody would have understood anything. The proof is that I start again.  Yes Bitsquare and NVO are close, so does the other decentralized exchanges. Except that NVO's revolution is that it will be up to the community to decide which coins are going to be traded, not to NVO. The trading fees will be lower as it will consist of the TX fees plus exchange fees of 0.2%.  It is like for Bitcoin, as he won't ask the websites to add him, it is the websites who add Bitcoin as a payment method. That's how the plugin system will enable the support for more coins, the community will add them.  The second revolution is the Validator as it is a solution for decentralized offline trading, which is the main issue with decentralized exchanges, and the main advantage of centralized exchanges. NVO is like Mac or Linux, while centralized exchanges are like Windows, The developers could understand this comparaison.  Third advantage, NVO won't be able to fake volume as there won't be the possibility to add remote automated trading as the wallet will be the gateway. The centralized platforms use to give an API to remotely trade on their platform, which lets them use shadow bots to fake volumes, while they are covered by TOS as their resposibility is limited.

Thank for this feedback, this is what i was waiting for since a week.  Let's go step by step :  - User send a trade request.   an object containing the request details, pairs, amount, value, wallet id (random number to identify the owner), addresses required for the trade  - Trade request received by the validator    - Trade request verified      Verify addresses balance, existance of pairs.    public data storage of the request with request id minus wallet id  (private storage)  - List for order matching  - If order matching, process orders    retreive orders    verifie balances    trigger transaction from wallet (wallet sends update request to the validator, who will return a trigger or cancel message)  - receiving signed Txs from wallets  - decode transactions :     if decoded transactions are valid    If recipient addresses matches    if balances match    if currently transacting    if TX fees are correct    if exchange fees are correct    if no op_return (in case of btc)    if no data (in case of eth)  - broadcast transactions   These informations are a part of what yani gave me. They don't want to go too deeply into the details of the validator because it is a central component and people have to understand the whitepaper, they will open it's source when he will be finished.  I hope that it helps you to figure it out and that you understand that the validator won't be open sourced, the wallet will be, so does the plugins.

Firstly, it's a decentralised exchange but the key part of the code won't be open source or explained? That's a fail straight away.  Secondly, I'm highly skeptical they have a bullet proof algorithm in place. It looks to me like they are just hoping to raise a ton of money and figure it all out later on - hardly fair on investors. Either that or it's a carbon copy of one of the existing DEX algorithms that are working out in the wild - e.g. Blocknet.  If you guys can't answer questions on how it works, you are not going to inspire shrewd investors to part with their money. Blocknet for example uses check lock time verify to lock up the funds used for the cross chain trading swaps until the transaction is complete. It has anti-ddos measures in place to prevent orderbook spam. People run the service nodes which handle the trading fees, masternodes cost 5000 Block and collect a proportion of the fees. And so on.

Let me explain to you why 2 tokens. NVO Token will represent the market cap of the NVO project. let's imagine a daily volume on the NVO exchange of : 500.000 USD. Weekly it is : 3.500.000 USD Let's say Bob exchanges Bitcoin for Alex's Ethereum. NVO will take a fee of 0.2% at the moment of the transaction from Bob and from Alex which will result in a total of 0.4% on the transaction. During a week of trading, NVO will collect 0.4% of the trading volume which is 3.500.000 USD resulting in 14.000 USD. NVO will keep 7.000 USD, and share 7.000 USD among the  NVOT holders. In order to get deeply in the details, and know how much an investor will get as a return, let's say that NVO collected 300.000 USD from the crowdsale from 200 investors or bakers. The average investment by investor would be 1500 USD. As the weekly collected fees would be 7.000 USD / 200 investors, it would return an average of 35 USD. In this case, NVO won't have troubles regarding legal stuff as it will process tiny amounts, and won't be forced to be centralized by an authority. But if NVO does a 5.000.000 USD  volume daily, which is reachable, it would bring 35.000.000 USD weekly volume, 140.000 USD fees collected, and 70.000 USD for the investors which will result in 350 USD weekly for each investor on average. Monthly it would be 1400 USD, and this would attract the attention of the authorities depending from which country the investors are using the wallet. In order to protect NVO and the investors, the NVO team decided to create the NVOS who's value will be fixed at 0.99$. On the legal plan, as the price of NVOS will be lower then 1$, it's processing will be considered as a gift, which will keep it legal, like faucets.  If you have questions about the volumes, please visit this link : http://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/volume/24-hour/ You willfind a list of exchanges with their daily volume, you could then have an idea of the future volume of NVO.  What a long explanation,, now i'm understand about NVO and NVOS and Good Luck for this project   At least my long post was usefull, thanks for the morale up. I am here to help you, so if you have questions do not hesitate.  I would like to thank you for the questions you asked, and the awesome feedbacks, it is really good for the team's morale.

Monthly it would be 1400 USD, and this would attract the attention of the authorities depending from which country the investors are using the wallet. In order to protect NVO and the investors, the NVO team decided to create the NVOS who's value will be fixed at 0.99$. On the legal plan, as the price of NVOS will be lower then 1$, it's processing will be considered as a gift, which will keep it legal, like faucets.  If you have questions about the volumes, please visit this link : http://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/volume/24-hour/ You willfind a list of exchanges with their daily volume, you could then have an idea of the future volume of NVO.",False

This system will protect NVO from dumps, as every NVO holder will receive NVOS, and the price will be fixed at 0.99$, this way, the operation will be legal as it is tiny amount, or micropayment, that's what will let NVO stay decentralized and legal, it will also protect the investors from the legal part. It will be like a faucet for the investors, and it will stay legal and combinable.   This is how the NVOS and NVO Token works. If someone decides to sell their NVO Tokens on a centralized exchange, he won't receive NVOS, as soon the buyer withdraws them to an NVO wallet, the validator will recognise him as an investor or holder and will send him NVOS.     This is how the validator will do to send the NVOS to the investors.    This sytem will protect the NVO Token from dumps, and will favorite the growth of the token's price proportionally to the generated volume as the NVO Tokens will receive more NVOS.

Waiting for details about ICO so who will be on escrow side?  Thank you for your support, it is a pleasure to see that bitcointalk community is still welcoming, i recently complimented the safe network community for that. It is a real plesure to see the same in bitcointalk.  The escrow identities will be delivered after the crowdsale details are released as the team wants the escrow to be as decentralized as their project.",False
