We’re glad to announce that 1 million SCR tokens is set aside for purchase on the OpenLedger exchange as open.SCR tokens here starting February 2.  These SCR tokens are reserved from the 18.6 million tokens available during the Scorum Crowdsale.  This is the first step towards open market trading for SCR and offers current OpenLedger DEX users along with the wider BitShares community the chance to add increased liquidity to the SCR cryptocurrency.  Until the crowdsale ends on February 11th at 17:00 GMT, SCR tokens will be available on the OpenLedger decentralized exchange as open.SCR. This first version of open.SCR will have its value pegged at 1 USD until the end of the crowdsale and will guarantee the wallet holder receives open.SCR tokens of an equal amount when the Scorum blockchain is launched.  Open.SCR will be paired with bit.USD so that the community of traders on BitShares decentralized exchange can easily purchase SCR tokens without registering on the Scorum Crowdsale website. Along with further visibility, this offers SCR buyers a chance to purchase SCR in cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin and ethereum.  After the Scorum blockchain and wallet are launched in March. Open.SCR holders who wish to redeem their open.SCR for SCR tokens will send their open.SCR to OpenLedger accounts with their Scorum Wallet address. OpenLedger will then send them the same amount of SCR to their Scorum wallet.  Fans of Scorum who have joined the Scorum crowdsale already will be able to generate the private keys to their Scorum wallet and transfer the SCR tokens to OpenLedger and trade open.SCR in their wallet once the Scorum Blockchain and Wallet are launched. Once there, they can participate in buying further open.SCR or filling orders for open.SCR from other users on the exchange. After the end of the crowdsale, open.SCR will no longer be pegged at 1 USD and the open market will dictate the value of SCR tokens.  https://medium.com/@scorum/scr-tokens-available-on-openledger-dex-942c3940dd8d",False

I'll try to answer them one at a time:  1. Total supply is 20M SCR and 10 million SP. More will be created through conversion if needed. IE if EVERYONE wanted to change their SCR to SP (very unlikely), then more SP will be created to meet that demand.  2. You will get a Scorum Power registration bonus for taking part in the crowdsale. The details of SP registration bonuses is listed in the whitepaper.  3. You can convert some of your SCR into SP immediately if you'd like more influence in the blogging platform.  4. SP can be ""bought"" only for SCR at a 1-1 ratio. It will also be earned in the blogging platform as rewards for content creation and curation.  5. 1 SP will always be worth 1 SCR, no matter what the SCR value is on the open market. SP will not be tradeable on exchanges or directly transferrable to other users though.  Hope that helps!",False

I think the answer is going to vary a lot depending on the interest of the user. For me our core function will be the blogging platform because I enjoy writing and reading about sports. There's nothing wrong with fantasy sports or sports betting, but it's just something I don't see myself spending much time on. For other users, the opposite may be true. Especially ""pro"" bettors who dedicate a lot of time and money to sports betting.  The real genius of it is that all active users will benefit from the their activities across all functions. For example, if the betting exchange becomes very popular and there is an increase in demand (thereby revenue) for ad space within the betting exchange, then active users in the blogging platform will see an increase in pay-out from the ad revenue that is shared among writers, curators, and even block-signing witnesses.",False

Our analysts have assessed Scorum ICO initiative and are proud to present the in-depth report on the project.   Scorum is a platform for sports blogs, users of which can earn not only by publication of original content but also by active discussion and voting. The main idea is borrowed from the Steemit project, but the emission of SCR tokens will be limited, and the project’s functionality will be more diverse.

Advertising and article promotion within the blogging platform. Authors will be able to promote their posts at a nominal rate of .01 SCR per click which is significantly lower than other CPC ad costs. This advertising will be purchased in SCR and the revenue from ads will be split according to this framework:    2. Scorum will welcome partners to sell their sports goods or services within the platform. As the user audience grows, this will be more and more favorable for other businesses within the sports industry. Paired with the blogging platform where athlete representatives can promote the goods of their sponsors and the utility to pay for goods and services with SCR accumulated in user's accounts, the partner programs will give Scorum members an easy and efficient means to spend SCR without needing to exchange it externally.  3. The photo database will offer sports photographers a place to showcase their work and offer high-resolution images for sale to sports fans around the world. From this, Scorum will collect 10% while the author will get 80% and the final 10% goes into the reward pool for active photographers.  With these three revenue streams designed to both sustain Scorum and reward the community for its activity within the platform, we won't need to charge fees for other popular services such as daily fantasy sports or the betting exchange. These commission free services will naturally expand the audience of sports fans interested in utilizing SCR within the platform.",False

One of the dynamics I've noticed while using Steemit is that an initial ""buy-in"" to boost your posts can lead to more visibility in your posts and therefore a higher reward pay-out for the author and commenters/curators. Even among the most die-hard sports fans, the amount of money they spend on sports-related purchases varies widely. What we're presenting is the chance gain value (in SCR and SP) for engaging in the active sports community.  For some, that may mean writing and publishing sports coverage and building a loyal reader audience. For others, it will mean winning big in fantasy sports or placing wagers. Remember, we're focused on the merits of decentralized economy so it will be up to the individual users to utilize SCR and the Scorum platform in ways that enrich their fan experience through their own efforts. To focus wholly on the utility of SCR, we're including parts of the platform where fans can spend their accumulated SCR on sports-related purchases like live streams or tickets to events or even sports merchandise.",False

The main advantage is to ensure that major buyers of SCR tokens are guaranteed the best discount during the whitelist token sale. We've set aside 2 million SCR for whitelist participants, but the list is open to all applicants who purchase more than 1000 USD worth of SCR tokens. In theory, there could be more interested whitelist buyers than SCR available. So for large-scale buyers we're opening a private channel of communication through which they can make a deposit to guarantee their purchase amount will be available at the appropriate discount.  Another equally important reason for this is to establish and maintain trust and confidence between our team and the people that believe deeply enough in our project to purchase a large quantity of SCR tokens during the crowdsale. They're belief in the vision and the team is paramount to the ongoing success of Scorum as a whole so it is well worth putting time and a more personal effort into maintaining it.",False

Much of the initial development funds will be spent on establishing contracts with statistics providers so that our statistics centers have the latest in-depth sports data for Scorum users to access.  Integrating and expanding Scorum as a competitor in the US sports media industry will require significant funds to tailor the design of the platform to fit the needs and interests of each unique fan community. Other significant costs include getting licenses for HD live streams of sports events so that we can offer them to Scorum users.  Marketing As a direct way to get connected to the widest audience of sports fans, Scorum will use professional athlete promotion of the project through its ambassador program. Scorum’s blogging platform will provide a direct connection from athletes to their supporters and the partner programs will give the fans exclusive deals to buy merchandise endorsed by their favorite athletes.  Scorum ambassadors will make use of a variety of promotional strategies to incentivize fan participation in Scorum including: - Autographed jersey and merchandise giveaways - Event ticket lotteries with a chance to meet and chat with Scorum ambassadors - Live online chats with athletes through Scorum’s platform - Personal blog posts and updates on Scorum - Active users and fans will get to meet and greet ambassadors at Scorum Fest and other regional meet-ups.

This VP is spent 5% at a time on each upvote and is replenished back to full over a five day rolling timeframe. If you upvote everything and anything, your votes will have less and less power. - Rewards for a given post will be shared among the author, commenters, and upvoters. The more engagement with a post, the more rewards get distributed among users involved. This is weighted towards those who vote or comment earlier, so it is users best interest to find the latest high-quality content and upvote or comment on publications that will be popular with the most amount of users. In this way, the reward system is highly self-moderating. - To protect against ""immediate"" upvoting, there is a 30 minute window after publication where a higher percentage of the rewards go to the author, diminishing from 100% during the first minute down to the standard rate at minute 30. - Publications are only active in the reward pools for 7 days after the first upvote, after which they will be archived and removed from the reward system but still readable. - The content users see will be heavily self-selected as they follow certain authors or topics. Low quality content will get fewer rewards and therefore not be seen as ""trending"" within a given topic.",False

The source is available in numbers of variations, as it has been forked and adapted many times. The original release is managed by an organization known as Cryptonomex. Graphene is interesting because it is Open Source, but also because it was developed in a very modular fashion, making it adaptable to many different uses. In addition to Bitshares, Graphene serves as the blockchain foundation for Steemit.com, a news aggregation site similar in concept to reddit.com and PeerPlays.com, a gaming site. FollowMyVote.com is another example of a service built on the Graphene blockchain. FollowMyVote uses Graphene to facilitate secure, yet private, internet-based municipal voting.

Scorum's protocol is implemeneted by our native blockchain written with C++ on the graphene framework.  From the white paper:  The Graphene framework is used to develop the blockchain protocol for Scorum. This solution has already proved itself both reliable and highly capable in such successful blockchain projects as Bitshares, Steemit, and Golos. The Scorum blockchain uses the DPoS (Delegated Proof-of-Stake) consensus algorithm.  The key advantage of this algorithm is its high-traffic network capacity of up to 10 000 transactions per second. Such performance is made possible thanks to a combination of several factors: 1. The schedule for the nodes signing blocks is known ahead of time. 2. Effective transaction processing in each node. 3. All data necessary for validating transactions is stored in the memory.",False

While we certainly don't plan to spend that much on the technical development of the platform, there are certain features that will cost quite a bit of money.  Getting licenses to offer HD live-streams of high-profile sporting events within the platform will not be cheap. Establishing partner programs with ticketing agencies and sports merchandisers will also require significant initial investment. Doing these things in just one country would be costly, but attempting it on a global scale is certainly going to be a long-term investment and process.  As more users join Scorum and the active audience grows, these costs should diminish as more established companies in the industry see Scorum as a platform they need to be a part of in order to keep pace with fans interests.

Marketing blockchain-based products with crowdsale funded projects is an ever evolving field.  To start with, of course, we're targeting our marketing campaign to crypto-enthusiasts who are more likely to participate in our crowdsale than the average sports fan. Our target markets are USA (US citizens are allowed to participate on our crowdsale) and Western Europe (we run localised campaigns in different countries), we also work in Russia and CIS. Though we don’t forget about China.  These days we’re focusing on the inbound marketing by providing comprehensive information that is easy to grab. Our core instruments are: 1. Our major assets are a localised regularly updated website and whitepaper 2. Long-form blogging on Steemit and Medium 3. Listing on ICO tracking sites (got listed on many of them, one of the most recent is the featuring we get for free on Cointelegraph) 4. We’re active on the most popular social networks like Twitter and Facebook, for instant messages we use Telegram chats and channels 5. We also establish presence on niche sites like Bitcointalk 6. Our code is available on Github 7. Prominent athletes vouch for Scorum (check out our YouTube) 8. We’re not active on media yet, but already got some coverage highlighting athletes support 9. You can also meet us at conferences and exhibitions, we also organize and speak at educational events and workshops 10. We offer a referral program, that allows participants to get Scorum Coins for free — 5% of each attracted purchase goes to the affiliate.   As we get closer to the crowdsale, we'll be intensifying our efforts to ensure massive awareness about it among our target audience.  Since our blogging platform and statistical center are already in the final stages of development, Scorum will be ready for a rapid rollout of the platform post-crowdsale. By that point, our major marketing push will center on the 2018 FIFA World Cup since it's a huge international event and a great chance for early Scorum users to publish content that will get world-wide attention. Writers on our platform will have a vested interest in marketing their own content as well since they are getting crypto rewards for it, so this will snowball in everyone's favor.""",False

It’s specialized for creating sports content and provides fans with the freedom to shape their own information space and get rewarded for expressing themselves and sharing their passion for sports.   The Problem Each month 1 billion sports fans generate 8.5 billion visits to a variety of sports media sources, creating a huge income for them. For far too long, these fans have watched from the sidelines; spending their hard-earned cash to support their home clubs, teams, and athletes. The current sports media industry has no interest in rewarding these fans and fails to provide innovative coverage for the modern world.   Our Solution We set out to unite the passionate fans of sports around the world into a bold digital media platform where active participants are rewarded for their engagement. A community that will drive innovative event coverage, reporting, and interaction between avid fans around the world. To achieve this, we designed the following key services:  ●  The blogging platform where both content creation and curation will be rewarded through a fair and transparent economic model. Released from the constraints of the publishing industry, writers will have access to innovative data analysis, a suite of editorial tools tailored to sports content, and a built-in photo database. ●  The statistical centers will drive sports data crunching to the next level. Not only can fans browse and dig into stats about their favorite athletes or teams, writers can utilize the centers using Microsoft’s Business Intelligence tools to embed interactive infographics into their publications. Live event streaming, tickets, and other sporting goods will also be available as a part of partnership programs. ●  The commission-free betting exchange allows users to quickly place bets against each other using our cryptocurrency. Integrated with Scorum users’ wallets and coupled with in-depth statistical analysis, sports fans’ venturing into the world of betting has never been easier.    Watch the Scorum Explainer Video   Economic Model Fundamentals Our economic model is based on three fundamental principles: ●  Scorum Coins (SCR) cryptocurrency and platform ecosystem need to be supported by the real economy. ●  All platform participants must be rewarded within the system. ●  These rewards have to be distributed in a fair and transparent manner moderated by the user community.  Scorum plans to derive income from three reliable sources: internal ads, partner programs and a photo database. We intend to use this income to keep improving the platform, reward active Scorum users and donate a portion of this income to charity.      Tokens We Introduce To ensure proper functioning of the Scorum economy, we are issuing the Scorum Coins (SCR) cryptocurrency and the Scorum Power (SP) internal token.                    ●  Scorum Coin (SCR) tokens is a liquid cryptocurrency which can be bought or sold at cryptocurrency exchanges or transferred to other users. These tokens will be available for purchase during the Token Crowdsale.                   ●  Scorum Power (SP) is an internal token that needed to enable technical interactions between the system’s users. It is possible to exchange SP into SCR in equal shares (1:1 ratio) within 12 months (this time frame can later be changed by the delegates). This measure is aimed at protecting token holders’ interests.   Scorum Coins (SCR) CROWDSALE SET FOR January 14, 2018 Tokens Crowdsale will go in the following stages:  1. The first 1.6 million SCR is available now during our presale at a 50% discount from nominal value (1 USD) !!!LIVE NOW!!! SOLD OUT!! 2. The following 2 million SCR will be sold at a 25% discount. 3. After that, 3 million SCR will be available at a 10% discount. 4. The 12 million SCR left after these stages will be sold at nominal value.     18.6M for purchase at the crowdsale, after which any unsold SCR will be set aside as Scorum Power Tokens for further project development, 930K will go to the Affiliate Program (the unused SCR Tokens will be burned), and 470K will be distributed among the project team.      People Behind the Product We have hand-picked a talented team of nearly 30 industry professionals who are working hard to develop and constantly improve Scorum. Our leadership brings together strong industry experience and knowledge of game theory, journalism, design and implementation of advanced technology. Our advisory board includes the representatives of a successful IT company, a legal guidance from a seasoned San Francisco-based attorney who specializes in launching start-ups in the blockchain industry, and prominent athletes. The full team and advisors can be found here.  Backed up by Athletes We’ve teamed up with NBA star Timofey Mozgov, Olympic Champion Alexandra Patskevich, and other top athletes across major sports to bring their experience and professional insight to Scorum.     Mainstream Appeal The potential Scorum audience is estimated at one billion people worldwide, roughly the number of people who regularly interact with digital sports media currently fragmented among the many traditional platforms. Scorum’s transparent and fair reward system, data driven sports coverage features, and integrated commission free betting exchange will give active sports fans an all-inclusive way to engage with like-minded fans around the globe.   Passion for sports must be rewarded.

To set Scorum apart from the numerous “pump-and-dump” ICO schemes that have come to the crypto market over the last few months, our bounty program is designed to attract end users to our project. We are committed to creating a sustainable, rewarding, and long-term community of sports fans worldwide.    To that end, our bounty program has three facets. First, our Scorum Coins affiliate program will give a 5% reward to participants who share links that lead to purchases during the Scorum crowdsale (ex: someone follows your link to the crowdsale and purchases 1000 SCR, you will receive 50 SCR from our affiliate pool). Follow this link to find out more and register as an affiliate.  Second, we’re creating a 100k Scorum Power token bounty program for Steemit users. This is designed to attract an audience that is familiar with the rewarding blogging platform that Scorum will establish. Steemit users who join this bounty will get equal shares of the 100k SP bounty with double rewards going to the first thousand participants that join Scorum.  Third, we’re incentivizing early adoption of our platform by offering 221k Scorum Power tokens as registration rewards for community members, with higher rewards for early registrants.  ",False
