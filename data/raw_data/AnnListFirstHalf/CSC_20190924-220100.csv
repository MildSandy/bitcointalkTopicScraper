Stake Mining impacts your mining revenue - and once we're on exchanges and one's able to bid on renting speed you won't be limited to bid restrained by the bitcoin's value. that means potentially more revenue for the bidder and more revenue for the miner, whereas nicehash will only get you 5-10%+ the average revenue.  TLDR - this is not just just a pool, this is a complete ""ecosystem"" built around a coin dedicated to users that miner cryptocurrency.",False

Appreciate it.  - we managed to fix the password reset feature - about the account requiring activation, we're still working on trying to see what's causing the problem - the update rate of the miner was set to 30 minutes, that's why the profitability was recalculated more often but the miner didn't switch between the coins (we used 30 mins because it might cause increase in resources and might cause crashes) - we've lowered the time period and now it should be updated every 2 to 5 minutes so it should fix the problem  - we've implemented an auto refresh feature on the dashboard, it's now refreshing every 1 min - the slight delay is of less than 1 minute because the miner is sending the updates every 1 minute, doing it any faster will increase the resource usage on the miner and it's just not worth it for anyone - we've fixed the settings glitch in the next update, it's already on site you can redownload it  - now about the averages and the hast rate: the averages calculated on site are just taking in account the last submitted speed, that's why the variations, but in reality both the revenue and speed are more stable. - also part of the variations come from ethminer, but again it shouldn't be reflected on the revenue rate overall - as for the 40-50% hashrate I think it's something on your end, it should definitely get +95% of the normal speed  - as for the crashes, mind giving some more details on when is it happening?",False

I suggest to just add highlight to the chosen coin when clicked - Refresh is great, unnoticeable, works properly - The hashrate shown in the dashboard is always in MH, even though some coins are in KHs - I'm also very skeptic about the accuracy, it gives around 5-7MH on scrypt (emc2), which is far more than I usually get, I suggest putting scrypt and x11 coins in a seperate place for people with asics - For some reason changing the coin works only for a few minutes then it returns it to whatever it was previously, so i couldnt test ethhash extensively, just emc2 - The hashrate on ethhash is like 30% of what i should have, that's something definitely with the client compatibility, have you tested it on various CUDA versions, drivers, etc? It's not my rig, i get full hashrate via any console miner. For the record, I'm using CUDA 9, unfortunately don't have a place to test it on earlier versions. But it shouldnt really make that much of a difference since I used both ethminer and claymore with full hashrate, I really have no clue what's the bottleneck. - The system crashes occur randomly after 30 mins or so, tested with both base clocks, underclock, overclock, with different drivers, always the same outcome. The only thing i notice is while it's running, a window in the background (in my case afterburner) keeps minimizing and restoring every 30 secs or so. Shouldn't really happen.

I've changed it now to grey, so it should be visible on any monitor - I fixed the stupid bug in the dashboard regarding the speed - changing the coin should work now and custom mining / non auto also should  The update is on site.  Now, regarding the speed. First just go into the /miners file and launch the start.bat Let me know if the speed is stable for ETH. If it is, then it means our miner is using too many resources and it's killing speed. If it's not and the speed is also low, then I guess it's ethminer's version. What gpu's are you using?  Now about crashes. Once every 90 seconds the miner tries to update the temperature and the fans, this might cause slight issues with some gpu versions. Make sure you're running the miner as admin firstly. Also, check to see if the CPU usage is really high.",False

The coins will be used by the platform to reward the miners or could be used to stake mine (you can read more about it on the documentation).  The coin's value at the time of the list on exchanges will be $0.05 and we're pretty confident that it will grow from there. The listing will be happening after we have a fully working beta platform so that we don't crash the coin if we list it too early.  We're not offering action in the CryptoSoft as a company but we're offering tokens as in CryptoSoft the coin that's going to be used by the platform.

As far as I understand you're asking about the revenue system and how will it be rewarding the miners, right? Here's the complete formula of the revenue per minute:  (base_value + coin_profitability_bonus + active_users_bonus + stake_miners_bonus) * rig_speed * 60 seconds  base_value = variable that's depending on the CryptoSoftCoin's market value coin_profitability_bonus = the mined coin's profitability (there's a chart on the /dashboard of the platform)                                     - now the profitability is proportional to the mined coin's value                                     - and inverse proportional to the mining difficulty                                     - so, to conclude we don't care about the coin's price, but about the coin's profitability  active_users_bonus = variable that's depending on the number of active miners on the platform stake_miners_bonus = more or less bonus depending if the stake miners predict right or wrong",False
