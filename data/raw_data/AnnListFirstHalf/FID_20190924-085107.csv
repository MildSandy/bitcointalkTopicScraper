Fortress provides users the freedom to access to any exchange around the world at once. Furthermore, Fortress will be integrated with the Fidelium mobile app, which features a multi cryptocurrency wallet, and a debit card payment system interface. We make everything efficient.    Introduction of Fidelium Debit Card Integration       Our mobile app, which will work as both the multi-cryptocurrency and the app interface for the debit cards, is scheduled for April release, with the beta version aimed for March as well. To facilitate the integration process, we signed a contract with a Major Card provider back in November of 2017. We are currently in the process of finishing up the multi-cryptocurrency-support wallet and will soon start integrating the debit card system into our app. Once our app is completed and fully integrated with the debit card system, users will be able to spend any supported cryptocurrency, not just FID, to make purchases in everyday lives.
