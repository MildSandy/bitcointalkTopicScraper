The last one was ages ago, and we haven’t released an update in the interim because we wanted to be able to share some awesome details about what we have been doing this last year, the current capabilities of the platform — and where we are going with it.  So first of all — the Horizon State platform is now operable! This means we can onboard customers and have them use the software to make their decisions and cast their votes. Obviously this is a huge milestone for the company (#buidl right??) and we are very proud of what we have achieved. Comments and responses from potential customers are very positive, all saying how beautiful the platform looks, and how easy it is to use.  From a technical perspective, the platform was developed and delivered as a web application rather than an app. The main reason for this decision was to allow a rapid pace of development and testing. Another reason for both CoinPocket and the platform to be delivered in this manner is to provide low friction for users.  The reasoning behind it is that users are less likely to download an app just to vote once or twice. This is proving itself to be the right decision, as some of the potential customers are wanting to link the application directly from their website or even map a subdomain to our application (in the format of https://vote.awesomecustomerusingblockcha.in) and not everyone is enthusiastic about asking their users to download another app on their phone.  Having said that — an app is very much on the Horizon, and we will start working on one in the next few months.  The technology stack we are using is mainly React, .Net, Solidity (for smart contracts) and some Java thrown in for specific parts of the system.  Speaking of the blockchain aspect of the system — as we mentioned before, our goal is to be chain-agnostic rather than tie ourselves down to a specific chain. This enables us to use chains that have different cost models, throughput and technical capabilities.  Right now, the platform works with Ethereum, NEM and Halo. All are public chains. Halo specifically is very interesting to us. Being a fork of Ethereum, it allows us to use smart contracts in the same manner that Ethereum does. However — using a different consensus mechanism, it is much faster than what Ethereum currently provides, and using a different incentive mechanism — it allows zero-cost transactions. This means that the part of the cost of the vote contributed by the actual blockchain (gas cost) is reduced substantially when using Halo. Unlike Ethereum, it is not affected by the load on the system, or the price of Ethereum. Unlike NEM it is not affected by the fluctuation of price of XEM.   The last part we want to talk about is the component-based setup of the UI (User Interface). We spent a lot of time creating a library of components — distinct UI elements — that are all interoperable, and all use the same ‘design language’. Having developed the system this way means that all components ‘change together’ if we need to make a visual or behavioural change to one or any of them. It also means that creating complex user interface elements is many times like putting together Lego pieces: every component we have can be attached to other components and ‘just work’.  Building our component library this way has allowed us to develop a new type of vote for a potential customer in a couple of days — rather than a couple of weeks. We can see the effect this has on our development speed, where the last pieces we completed were considerably faster to develop than the first few iterations.  Moving forward with development, there are a few interesting results counting algorithms that we need to develop for our customers. Complex types of voting like preferential vote or weighted candidates, need more than just the transparency and accountability that the public ledger provides. In some cases you can’t just tally up the vote and declare a winner — as there are other considerations to account for.  We will address the challenges and how we solve them in a future update.  That’s all from us! Have a great week!  https://medium.com/horizonstate/",False

The estimated costs to challenge this case, and potentially proceed through the mediation process to reach a settlement is an eye-watering expense will see the business become insolvent, and ultimately force its closure. We have in good faith explored all possible avenues to resolve the issue outside of the legal system in good faith to this time.  While we have made our sincerest and best efforts to make Horizon State self-sustaining on client revenue (which has included great personal sacrifices operating on a very lean budget to achieve), we simply can’t absorb this expense being forced upon us at this time.  We are very proud of the work we have put in as a group over the last 24 months, and recognition it has earned, which makes it all the more heart-breaking that circumstances outside our control have forced our demise.

The ADCA is an industry group made up of Australian businesses implementing blockchain solutions, with members working together to build understanding of the technology and engaging with government and regulatory stakeholders.  ADCA aims to encourage the responsible adoption of blockchain technology by industry and governments across Australia as a means to drive innovation in service delivery across all sectors of the economy.  ADCA counts among its members professional services firms EY, PwC, Accenture, KPMG and Deloitte; law firms Gilbert + Tobin, Allens, Maddocks and DLA Piper; and leading corporates such as Illion, Equifax, Perpetual, Optus and Computershare.  The news follows the recent announcement by the Australian government on the increase in funding towards blockchain research under its 2018–19 Budget. The government will set aside AU$700,000 in funding for the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) to “investigate areas where blockchain technology could offer the most value for government services”.  Australia is uniquely positioned to provide global leadership in the adoption of blockchain technologies, with ADCA partnering with the Australian Trade and Investment Commission on several trade missions to promote Australian blockchain businesses and showcase proof of concepts overseas.  As a member of ADCA, Horizon State will work with stakeholder groups such as Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) to advocate for the technology and help with setting best-practice standards for the industry.  Chief executive officer of the ADCA, Nicholas Giurietto, has praised Horizon State’s addition to the industry group.  “Horizon State is an Australian blockchain pioneer, building solutions that have the potential to transform corporate governance and even the efficiency and confidence in our electoral system,” Giurietto said.  Speaking from Melbourne, co-founder Jamie Skella said he was delighted the company was joining the ADCA as an industry partner.  “The ADCA offers Horizon State the industry network needed to build an understanding of the potential of the technology in order to advocate for best practices and engage with government and regulatory stakeholders,” Skella said.  https://medium.com/horizonstate/horizon-state-joins-the-australian-digital-commerce-association-d7d3ddc73d4f",False

If people can’t get online how do we expect them to adopt cryptocurrencies?  Horizon Communication’s goal is to efficiently bring internet and cell services to people wherever they are in the different regions we cover.  Horizon's integration of blockchain gives us advantages such as:  - Being able to send out dividends using ETH, White is much faster and easier than sending dividend checks.  - Tying in blockchain services for our customers using partnering Bubbletone (cheaper roaming) and Gladius (decentralized CDN and DDOS) services. We do this by adding in decentralized VPN and file storage services, providing state-of-the-art technology right in the customer's portal.  - Payment using cryptocurrency will be available at a discount to encourage use of digital currencies over credit cards, saving us all costs and enhancing speed of payments.  - Paying for our services using the Horizon token or hold the token for dividend. We'll also be opening up enterprise level services just for token holders. The same services we reserve for activities like data center access, priority support, etc.  - Digital identification on the blockchain. We can easily integrate the customer, if they choose, with any online service (shopping, banking, airlines etc)  Blockchain software development is moving at a breakneck speed, as well as the wireless technology Horizon is using to provide services to our customers.  There is technology coming down the pipe that could provide huge fundamental shifts and how our customers use the internet and cellular services in the years to come.  With Horizon integrating these services and technology early it allows us to stay ahead of our competitors and provide the absolute best service we can to our customers.  Blockchain is the future of data. Wireless is a future of Telecommunications.  Gilbert A Darrell is the Founder of Horizon.

Specifically — I am looking for people who code++.  I am looking first and foremost for talent and commitment — you have to be passionate about what Horizon State does — about our mission and promise.  I want people who have a broad set of skills, because you’ll need to be comfortable performing in different areas. You may be coding in the morning, testing someone else’s code before lunch, designing a screen in the afternoon and jumping on a conference call with a customer in the early evening.  We like people who work well in a high-intensity environment, people who always look to contribute, who don’t wait to be told what to do — they just go ahead and do it. People who actively find problems or think of ways to improve existing processes and code. People who come up with solutions, weigh them and execute.  Anyone joining now is one of the first few — so you’ll have a huge impact on the products, directions and culture. This means you need to be a leader. Maybe not right now, maybe you have never done it. But if you join Horizon State today — you’re likely to lead a team, product, effort or customer in a year’s time. I’ll be looking for leadership, potential and maturity.  We think of ourselves as a (possibly slightly dysfunctional) family. You are going to spend a lot of time with us — at the office, on the phone, hangouts, gym, trail runs, adventure racing or bbqs. You don’t need to love everyone in the family but you have to be able to work with them. Be self-aware, know your strengths and weaknesses. Mistakes and errors will always happen — it’s how you deal with and learn from them that counts.  We have offices in NZ (Porirua) and Australia (Melbourne), with some devs working from Barcelona and Paraguay as well. You don’t have to be in the office, but some overlap in working hours with the Pacific Timezone is expected.  We don’t mind what technologies you develop with. We’re not looking for Java, C#, JS, Solidity, Golang or any other specific language. If you don’t use anything in our stack but make a good case and seem like a great fit — we’ll still consider you.

As a contest winner I can assure you that this was great contest. I'm not member of Horizon State and even though I helped in bounty campaign (i.e. posting this thread, twitter, signature campaign, some articles) I received tokens for this, and didn't stay in touch with Horizon's Team, apart from reading Telegram. But it's impossible for me to read and take part in big discussions there, so I'm not very active recently. But I followed all the rules of contest and won, even not 1 time. Don't be so pessimistic.  There will be always people who don't believe in contests, but I believe and I win occasionally. I can provide you some other examples from real life. Several years ago I won iPad in a restaurant, there was a contest something like who will be #1 on spending in 2-3 months - will win iPad, several other who were in Top-10 also won presents. Some of my friends were making fun at me, saying - that company representative will win it, but I kept going to that restaurant and inviting friends, colleagues (that period I had many meetings so that's how I stayed #1, I didn't spend extra funds extensively) - and yes I won, I still have that iPad. And in student times many years ago I won mobile phone, only just by filling up questionnaire. Well, that time I was really surprised, the phone was new and at that times it was Nokia one of the best models at that time market. So miracles happen (even small miracles as we discuss in this case).",False

(I was happy to help with marketing a bit so I hold some tokens). During ICO the price of token was 0.06 USD, now price is $1.28 (and surely it will be higher when I finish writing this post).  There are several places where you can buy it, one of them is Cryptopia, on of my favorite exchanges. There you can buy HST as well as other tokens, other crypto, not only with BTC, but also with DOGE  DOGE itself is on the rise, I remember when it costs 24 satoshi, now it's 59, and was even more yesterday. In fact yesterday it crossed the point of 1 cent! That was important event for Doge community)  So that's how Doge trading looks, check my screenshot.    As you see, I have open orders:      I'm willing to buy HST for 94.9 Doge     I'm willing to sell HST for 16108 Doge  Big difference, isn't it? Of course, but I'm not a trader, I do it mostly for testing and educational reasons. I don't want to sell HST and I can't buy it a lot, as I don't have a lot of DOGE.  As you can see from My Market History somebody bought a bit of HST from me for very high price, so I got 4 and 8 DOGE. At the moment is was lowest price anyway. Then I bought a bit of HST with the price 176, 153, 53 Doge.

Is it possible to make the world better by using a blockchain and other revolutionary technologies? I believe that it will be so. And the more people learn about these opportunities, the sooner we can use them together.  In simple terms, a blockchain is a distributed database. For simplicity, let's take, for example, a book. This is our database. To make it distributed, we will divide it into separate sheets and distribute it to different people. The distributed database was obtained. Next, we say that everyone should make copies of their sheets and also give out to different people. In the end, we get a huge distributed decentralized database - to make changes to which is impossible, since it isn’t known who has and where all the sheets. It is thanks to this particular feature - decentralization, the application of a distributed database for conducting elections of any level is more than relevant and justified.  The principles of democracy can't work fully without trust in the purity of the voting process. It is here that the logic of the whole process of democratic elections is getting weaker and weaker from year to year.  April 2016 Philippines On the Internet was a complete database of voters: 55 million passports and unique fingerprints. Hackers carried out the action ""We are for fair elections"" on the eve of the May 9 elections in the Philippines, leaving an anonymous request to strengthen the protection of computers in the counting of votes.  April 2016 Turkey One of the largest pre-election information leaks: 50 million addresses and personal data of Turkish citizens, including the Prime Minister and the President of the country. In the general access was information about almost every citizen of Turkey: there are 77.6 million of them in the country.  June 2017 Russia The 2016 election in the US: there are still rumors that the hackers from Russia provided the victory to Donald Trump. In an interview with the American television channel NBC, Vladimir Putin said that databases are available to hackers around the world - from Asia to Australia, and it is possible that the organizers and performers of the action live in America. At the same time, neither side can firmly say whether the hacker attack in general affected the results of the elections and from where it was conducted.  So, the electoral system isn’t immune from attacks, and the results of any election can be questioned. Imagine a world in which no information can be trustworthy, because all the data can be manipulated. Imagine millions of people who don’t recognize any rules, laws and restrictions simply because no one can understand which of the rules are genuine.  In this dystopia everyone will be in the role of the hero of the old riddle about the city of liars and the city of honest people, not knowing who to believe. In the global information environment, hacker attacks will become increasingly coordinated. The main problem is that the effectiveness of digital security needs continuous support and improvement. A blockchain as a technology that can protect itself from any manipulation, looks like the best solution to the problem voiced. We just know the truth and don’t worry about trust. A blockchain is just such a technology.  The inevitability of the transition to electronic voting is noted in the European Parliament. In October 2016, Phillip Nicholas Boucher presented his draft document on the use of blockchain-technology in elections. Transparency, guaranteed by such a system, will significantly improve efficiency and honesty in the electoral process, the parliamentarian believes.  ""There should be no question as to whether a blockchain is necessary for elections. There should be only one question: how to integrate a block into the existing electoral system and how this process will affect the development of democracy"",the report says.  This will make absolute transparency, since the voice of any citizen immediately hitting a blockchain will be impossible to remove, replace, change. Pros, which carries a blockchain, can significantly affect how democratic procedures will be implemented in the future. The technology makes it possible to conduct elections in an open manner and record the voting results of each citizen in a blockchain , and then certify with a digital signature.  Therefore, if elections are organized according to the principle of functioning of a crypto-currency, the results will be known about a minute after the end of voting. However, the main advantage of the blockage could be the complete disappearance of distortions in the counting of votes.  In world practice, there are already examples of the use of blockchain-technology in the election process, for example, in Denmark the technology of the distributed registry was used as early as in 2014 when internal voting was held at the annual meeting of party members in Vidovre, a suburb of Copenhagen.  In the US a blockchain used candidates for inner-party positions in Texas. Also, the technology was used by the Republican Party of Utah in the voting for candidates in the primaries stage. All these cases of using a blockchain were successful, and it isn’t known about any problems that the politicians faced.  Too transparent elections.  One of the main tasks that will need to be solved when implementing the technology is anonymity. Almost everywhere in the world, voting in elections and referendums is secret, as the law says. After all, now a person who threw a ballot into the ballot box is sure that if he doesn’t want it, then no one will know who he voted for. And in the case of electronic elections, his voice will be preserved in a blockchain and will remain there forever. On the other hand, it would be possible to anonymize the vote before writing to a blockchain, but in this place there are so many vulnerabilities that attackers can use and distort the real choice of voters.  How will this work?  The main goal of Horizon State is to provide citizens of the state with an opportunity to receive information at any time with reliable accuracy about what is happening at different levels of state power. And to government officials, the completeness, authenticity and accuracy of all information will make it possible to successfully make strategically important decisions at different levels and in different spheres of state life.  How will voting work in a blockchain? Imagine that the election organizers will create digital ""wallets"" for each candidate or option of voting and each voter will have one electronic token HST that he can give for one of the candidates. Citizens vote anonymously through their virtual avatar, sending their HST to the purse of their chosen candidate. A blockchain fixes and confirms the transaction. The winner is determined by the number of HST-tokens in the wallet.  Voting will be available from any platform: from a personal smartphone to special city terminals. To identify users, system designers plan to enter maps, electronic keys or fingerprints - depending on what will be more convenient for users. The authors of the project hope that they will help start a new period in the country's democracy, as well as create reliable protection from external influences on the election results. If people get a guarantee of fair elections in this way, the state also doesn’t remain in the loser: citizens don’t ""vote with their feet,"" the opposition doesn’t begin witch-hunts after every election, the risk of political catastrophes and split in the society sharply decreases.  So, Horizon State is the decision that will make the electoral system reliable, and the results of any election can’t be questioned. Obviously, a blockchain in the electoral process isn’t only useful - it is necessary: •   Falsification of results and manipulation of the votes of voters are excluded. •   Automatic counting of votes makes the entire voting process not only transparent, but also fast. •   There are no vulnerabilities in the decentralized system, which can be used by hackers.",False

As tokens are used and come in, they will be entered into a pool of ready-to-be-recirculated tokens. This pool will be returned to the market at a rate of 20% per month. This means for example that if customers used 100,000 tokens at a specific month, 20,000 of those will be sold to the market the following month. Because tokens are used to pay for the use of the system, and as the platform is going to be using resources outside of the blockchain — the income from the sale of these tokens back to the market will be used by Horizon State as working capital, to pay the software and infrastructure providers for resources consumed, as well as other operational expenses.

Here is my today's post (on Steemit you can find it here: https://steemit.com/politics/@flodner/thress-reasons-why-voting-on-blockchain-is-a-great-idea )  Three reasons why voting on blockchain is a great idea  For many years I'm interested in politics, geopolitics, political philosophy, etc. I used to participate in elections as candidate (got less than 1% of votes, but I funded my campaign from my own money and I was independent candidate, which was very bad for that elections - almost in all districts party candidates won), as observer, as political analyst, and a bit as political technologist. Then for some time I was working as advisor to MP (and I'm still advisor on pro bono status).  That's why Horizon State's idea of voting on blockchain is very inspiring for me. In this article I don't want to go deep into technical details, you can check them in Horizon's State white paper, and to join Horizon's community on Telegram to check all the updates of development, partnerships as well as other news from crypto world. As for me voting on blockchain will have future benefits:      Decrease (if not elimination) of falsifications.     Of course falsification techniques adapt to technological changes. I remember many different falsification attempts, such as bribing voters, so-called carousels, ballots stealing, wrong calculation of votes, etc.     Accurate conduction of votes on blockchain should help to decrease the amount of falsification of votes. How exactly - this question should be developed, tested, firstly in different small votes, then may be on local levels, before the system goes to the national elections.      Cost-saving     Blockchain and IT in general has possibility to save lots of costs. Knowing how many resources, people, are involved into elections process - I imagine that huge amounts of money can be saved and allocated to another areas.      Time-saving     Blockchain and efficiency of voting process can save lots of time for people. I remember 1 year when the national, local and mayor elections were held in 1 day, and each person had 4 ballots, each ballot was huge and it would take at least 10 minutes just to read all the candidates, parties names. Then members of commission spent several days (!!) counting the votes. Voting on blockchain can save lots of time for everyone who is involved in elections process as organizationally, but also for all the voters - there should be less queues.",False

I already own some coins I purchased on LiveCoin.  What I've seen in your platform and in your videos does not address the issues we have with voting today! Voting turnout in my country, USA, and I'm sure many others, are at all time lows. This is because the establishment has done a lot to discourage voting and make it increasing difficult and more pointless to vote. I am not new to this rodeo. I donated thousands of hours to Bernie Sanders get out the vote canpaign last year, I was a canvas and recruiting captain, and I talked to a lot of people.

Paid voting - opt in and opt out, cash on the spot for voting, and benefits for homeless people voting, first time voters, etc! 2. Reaching out to students before they graduate! 3. Use your platform as a layer to allow MORE voting, to supplement mail in and in person voting. 4. Use your platform to do voting confirmations, and make it easy for friends and family members to share ballots, etc. Voting buddy situations so I know who hasn't voted, etc! Let's make this a community effort! 5. Ranked choice voting, etc! 6. Party affiliations - being able to change them easily, etc! Link up with other party members for gatherings and events! 7. Removing barriers to primary voting, etc. 8. Being able to vote from iPads, phones, etc! Why not? it's blockchain! 9. Social media linkage! Hey, I may want my vote encrypted, or I may want to share it with the world! Why not? Yes, I realize this is a conflict of interest for big corporations, but that's exactly why it needs to be available!  I understand this is a serious platform and you are trying to save the government money, but that is not what will give people power and voices. We need this technology in the field, yesterday!

OUR MOTIVATION  We live in a world where the smartphones in our pockets have more computing power than NASA had to get us to the moon, yet the way we govern our societies and organisations remains the equivalent of a pocket calculator.  Existing models for collaborative decision making once served our growing democracies well, yet today they are increasingly slow, expensive, and ineffectual. Public trust in their outcomes is eroding, resulting in voter apathy.  We need better shared decision making tools and processes in almost every facet of our community lives. We need them to be transparent and trusted, allowing deliberation and inclusion, removing barriers rather than stacking them up.  OUR VISION  Thanks to distributed ledger technology we can create systems that directly engage and empower constituencies, employing mechanisms enabling them to vote smartly and efficiently, giving them confidence that their voices will be heard, and allowing them to see, first hand, the results of their voting activities.  Horizon State has built a token-based blockchain voting and decision-making platform that delivers unprecedented trust through the integrity and post-unforgeable attributes of distributed ledger technology. Horizon State delivers a secure digital ballot box that cannot be hacked, wherein results can never be altered and voter identities are protected. Votes cast can be counted transparently, in real time, by anyone in the world. These counts can happen in perpetuity, as results are permanently retained on the blockchain and can never be changed. More than that - Horizon State allows voters to verify their own vote is accounted for, while maintaining their anonymity.  The platform promotes participation, facilitates deliberation and creates opportunity for informed decision making. It is a method to engage constituents on matters that affect them with immediacy. It is a framework where representatives can collaborate with their constituency with unprecedented efficiency. It is a method for families, communities, staff, and indeed entire citizenships to inclusively participate in the decision making processes that govern their lives.  Our product is already being used commercially by MiVote, an Australian political movement featured in the Financial Review , The Guardian , Fast Company , ABC , and on Triple J . Our early stage platform has facilitated the casting of thousands of votes to the blockchain since February 2017. Horizon State now intends to take this product to the world.  Building an Ecosystem  A truly great service enables synergy by being open and inclusive. Horizon State’s philosophy aligns with this by removing boundaries that hinder communication, interaction and cooperation. We are building an extensible platform that will allow us, as well as partner developers, to deploy a variety of products and services to the ecosystem that will further aid the processes of decision making and voting, all of which will use the Decision Tokens as the fuel for this ecosystem. Horizon State aims to provide an extensible, pluggable platform for decision making tools, processes and applications. There are a number of decision making systems used all around us, each of which has different requirements: general elections, postal votes, union elections, shareholders meetings to name a few. In addition to providing a suite of services and implementation types, Horizon State will be working with partners and service providers to build dApps (Decentralised Applications) on top of our platform. Those dApps will provide services for organisations using Horizon State to facilitate decision making processes, improve deliberation and participation, or provide customised registration and authentication modules.  Some possible examples of such dApps could be: • Content delivery by population slices • Smart contracts for unique voting mechanisms • Statistical modelling tools • Sophisticated simulators and what-if analysis • Smart surveys • Smart voting agents • Power BI dashboard integration • Prediction tools  Example of Usage Scenario  Poll: Should the Council Build a New Dam?  A local government’s water-works department wants to build a new dam to service the needs of the growing population and alleviate the pressure on the local infrastructure. The site identified for the dam borders on a nature reserve and some people are worried about the effect building a new dam might have on the native species.  The council may use Horizon State to poll their constituents. They would purchase the HST tokens from either the token exchanges or via a portal on the Horizon State product, where the price of the token is set by the free market. They then use those tokens to pay for the voting on the platform. The larger the number of people they want to poll, the more tokens they will need. As there is a finite number of tokens created during the ICO process, and no more will be created afterwards, the laws of supply and demand will dictate the token price.  HORIZON STATE TOKEN (HST)  Horizon State is a blockchain-based platform and ecosystem that enables efficient vote casting and decision making processes. The platform operates through the use of Decision Tokens (HST). These tokens are used to pay for the volume transactions and other services within the ecosystem.  Horizon State is currently engaging with governments, large corporations, blue-chip customers, local councils, unions, education facilities and non-profit organisations who will utilise Decision Tokens for polling and voting processes. New products and services across the ecosystem will require the use of HST, driving the token value and demand.
