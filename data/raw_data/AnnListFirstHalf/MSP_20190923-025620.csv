First one is that the swap of MSP will not happen. It is impossible for us to swap without precise balance records from Cryptopia, and since Cryptopia entered the liquidation procedure, the possible timeframes for resolution are unclear. Here is a quote from Cryptopia liquidators:  At this stage of the investigation the liquidators cannot estimate a date for when the liquidation will be completed. “As liquidators we have a responsibility to protect and preserve crypto-asset holdings for the benefit of those entitled to them,” says Mr Moore. “We are aware of and understand the frustration of Cryptopia’s customers. As there is no legal precedent on crypto assets in New Zealand and worldwide, the distribution of those assets and the overall conduct of the liquidation will require significant direction from the New Zealand Courts.” There will be no further comment from the liquidators at this stage.  We have offered Cryptopia to return the recovered 16.8M MSP and are still waiting for a reply. Crypto assets liquidation is indeed an unexplored area, so until we receive a direction, these funds will remain locked on our wallet.  Since the swap is now canceled, all trading restrictions are lifted as well. MSP is currently listed again on Lykke, and we will gladly collaborate with any other exchanges on additional listings.  Since our OTC Desk was a temporary solution addressing the lack of MSP markets, the situation is changed now, so we're closing the OTC Desk. All orders will be canceled, funds returned to their owners.  Taking these actions will allow us to focus solely on the exchange launch.  The second announcement is also related to obtaining a greater focus. Nearing the launch, we need to revamp our marketing and communications. While we are working on a renewed marketing and communications strategy, some steps are already apparent.  Our Telegram group will no longer be an official communication channel. You can talk to us via email and the support chat on our website, just as well we are going to improve our Twitter presence. Feel free to reach out to us using these platforms.  Another change in our communications is addressing the cadence of these Stakeholder updates. Writing them every month turned out to be not the best decision. A month is too short of a time frame for a quality report. Therefore, Stakeholder updates will now come out every quarter. Meaning next time you will receive a Stakeholder update will be at the end of September. It is not to say this letter is the last time you hear from us until then. As our renewed communications strategy comes to fruition, you will be hearing from us in our public channels.  For the past two weeks, we had a very productive meetup at our Tallinn HQ. The plan for the next quarter is in place, and the whole team is eager to deliver. To remind you where we’re at - our exchange UI is fully working, same goes for our trading engine which is ready and 100% covered with tests. Our client-facing KYC procedures are almost ready, however there is still work remaining on the back-office side. Deposits/withdrawals are still underway, just as well we’re taking our security very seriously and are planning to have third-party security audits before we can begin handling users funds. Stay tuned for further updates on our blog and Twitter!  Your Mothership Captain, Arseniy",False

Update re: Financial License - By early next week we should have a board resolution so that we can move forward with the license as planned (formality). As explained previously, the issue was that the Dutch government isn't providing any criminal record extracts which is required by the Estonian authorities for each board member.  I'll step down temporarily from the function (while remaining with Mothership as employee) until the Dutch authorities come to their senses. Case currently lies with the EU comission as an official complaint and they've already agreed to seek for a resolution with the Dutch government, acknowleding the issue.  #2. Token utility; I'm aware I've mentioned working on the token page and clearing up the confusion here; you can be sure we will adhere to the token utilities as outlined in the whitepaper unless otherwise agreed upon and communicated - which we haven't as of yet. We're looking into ways on how the token utility could be improved, but there's a lot of legal requirements involved here that makes it impossible for me to communicate it prior to sorting out the legal situation of what we're trying to accomplish with the MSP token.  #3. We will kickstart the podcast in 1 month from now (apprx. 1 September). It doesn't have a priority compared to the more important elements as developing the product, legal & banking. But are working on it and have outlined in the post here what the podcast will be all about: https://blog.mothership.cx/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-upcoming-podcast-series-by-mothership-1d416e05c256  #4. Trading tournament and product progress; Unfortunately I can't communicate these timelines without having full approval from the product team and confidence that the timelines we mention can be kept. The moment I do, I'll obviously not withold this information from you and I'd be more than happy to share.  #5. Market making / liquidity & adding coins; We will share this information later and closer towards the product launch.  #6. We're happy to welcome Alexei to the product team as software engineer! Alexei is from Estonia and will be joining us in the office from next week onwards. We've extended offers to two more developers and have contracted a kick-ass development team to help out the team.  #7. This past week, we've had 2 in-person meetings with banks. One of the banks has opened the accounts, the other one has mentioned they don't foresee any risks in opening said account within the next few weeks (we had to visit for in-person identification). There are however a few outstanding questions with them as to our KYC requirements which we are confident to get cleared. The payment gateway we've previously mentioned is still reviewing our case unfortunately, I've followed up with them this week and they mentioned to have escalated the case.  Either way, good progress on this front. We need multiple accounts in various EU jurisdictions to operate the fiat onramps, as otherwise our risk would be too high. If one country changes their legal situation around cryptocurrencies, making local banks even more wary of the situation, we run the risk of getting our operations shut down. Therefore it takes a lot of time and effort opening accounts in multiple EU jurisdictions to ensure we can provide these services in the near future.",False

We will report back when we have news on this front, but no more further bureaucratics to sort out! This license is needed to include fiat pairs on the platform.  #4.

Update re: Financial License - As promised, I would keep you up-to-date regarding our financial license status which is currently pending. All required documents were delivered to the Estonian authorities. However, unfortunately we’ve hit a small bump on the road. The Dutch certificate of conduct which was issued to proof that there has been no criminal activity for one of the board members was unfortunately insufficient by Estonian standards. This is because the Dutch Certificate of Conducts are no written proof that no crimes were committed which is required by the Estonian law.  The Dutch government does not issue proof of no criminal record by law, whereas the Estonian law requires such proof for the purpose of this license.  We’re currently in discussion with both the Dutch &  Estonian authorities with help of the Dutch embassy to try to get this right, nonetheless we’ve identified an option to move forward without this document temporarily until this issue has been solved. Fortunately the Estonian authorities have mentioned to us that they’re reviewing if they can accept the document as the Dutch authorities have directly communicated to the Estonian authorities that they can’t issue written proof of no criminal records by law. We should have a conclusion by next Friday. The authorities in Estonia are quite reasonable in their judgement, so we hope they will make a decision in our favour.  Nonetheless, it’s something that can relatively easily be solved through another less-desired path, but an option that has already been agreed upon must the authorities remain inflexible. Despite that, these issues are slightly frustrating as they take away time from other important elements.  #2. We’ve shared platform access with certain financial providers for compliance review. These providers will be able to allow us to provide the fiat payment gateways via MasterCard/visa, bank transfers, etc. Thereby we’re travelling the majority of the next weeks to have in-person meetings with multiple European banks for account opening. (Multiple bank accounts are necessary as the risk of having 1 account being closed down for whatever reason is high and would otherwise jeopardise our ability to provide services.)  #3. Thank you for letting us know what you’d like to hear from our podcast. We will surely address these topics, such as our plans for token utility. Discuss our customer support plans, legal situation, eResidency partnerships, etc. While I understand some of the earlier comments (Adam, we hear you...) about the podcast, we are doing this to provide you a better insight into what’s happening behind the scenes beyond this Weekly update. As I’ve mentioned before, it’s my goal to be as transparent as possible with you and this is just one of the avenues on how we can do this.  #4.

Update re: Financial License - As mentioned last week, we've had a small issue with a document from the Netherlands that was not getting accepted by the Estonian authorities. The process to get this document sorted is still ongoing, however we're discussing temporary steps to ensure we can move forward with the license without the need for that document.  Hopefully the Dutch government eventually comes to senses and provides the criminal records extract. They say they can't, because of ""privacy"" reasons. It's a little frustrating and hilarious at the same time. However, for now we are discussing on moving forward in Estonia with the license application, probably by temporarily removing the boardmember from the board, which removes the requirement for the document for now.  #2. Coming week, we'll have 2 in-person meetings with banks that we're in advanced discussions with. While it's not yet an homerun, we're getting closer to making this a reality. Together with the necessary payment gateways that we are in compliance review with, we can hopefully communicate good news here soon.  #3.

As many others around the world - we've had to get ourselves ready for the GDPR law that came into effect today. Fortunately our recent addition to the team, our head of legal, has been on this since joining and we've been able to get our current data storage solutions, privacy terms, etc into compliance before today. This took some of our necessary resources, but had to be done!   Let me know if there are questions on this.  #2. Last week, we've reported we applied for our financial license. The license review is still in process, but so far we haven't received any negative remarks or required amendments from the financial intelligence unit yet. The process may take a few weeks and we'll be sure to keep you updated. (normally they're a bit faster - but another government that is involved in the process is not the fastest with issuing one of the required documents 🙂)  #3. Our new brandbooks have been delivered by the designers and we're thrilled to get this out to the world! While I will keep you waiting a little longer as the website is currently being implemented, I did want to share with you a visual that they came up with which you can use as a new wallpaper! :v: (You can find it below this post)  #4. Next week we hope to have better views on the timelines for launching the open alpha (trading tournament). We know how badly you guys want to see the things we've built so far and for Mothership to go live, and so do we, but we want to ensure we're launching with a market competitive product that is not yet another exchange and that takes time and effort. That said, we're striving to get it out in the coming summer.  5. We also would like to finalise our decisions on the MSP token utility shortly and are currently making the final decisions on these.

Many of you here have commented on the Estcoin articles going around. While we have known this for a while, and some of you mentioned it already, this has nothing to do with us nor affects us in anyway. Estcoin is an idea by the eResidency team, but not the same thing. We are in constant discussion with the eResidency team to identify how we can support each other with promotion, ideas such as estcoin, etc. Estcoin is not completely off the table, despite what the headlines may suggest.  #2. The financial license is currently work in progress - the same issue is still holding it up - a document that needs to be issued by the Dutch and Russian government is taking longer than hoped for. However, we've good faith that these will come through within 1-2 weeks. (Funny detail, it takes the Netherlands longer to issue one document than for the Estonian government to review our AML & KYC procedures. Another good reason to be in Estonia.)  #3. Our new website has been implemented for the most part, some pages still need to be done, but I'm confident we will be able to get it out this month and open up the waiting list and referral system. We will have some cool prizes for the top referrers  #4. As mentioned last week, we would have some better insight into the timelines by now - which we do. What I can say is that we are confident and are striving to get the product out this summer. So you'll see significant movement towards this in the coming weeks.  #5. There's a lot of work behind the scenes that isn't very update noteworthy, but think off KYC integration into the platform, we are moving to a bigger office in 2 weeks to accommodate for the expanding team, we are discussing the launch strategy and starting to put things together for that such as the referral rules and rewards, emailing set-ups, etc. All good things that need to happen leading up to the exchange launch.  Any community ideas on how we can launch with a bang are most welcome!  #6.

Overall compared to last week we're still operating on the same timelines.  That said, the timelines we've set are slightly aggressive, so I'll keep you up to date each week on the progress.  #2. Financial license: The required document for the financial license is issued by the Dutch government and it currently looks like we'd able to get the dutch & russian documents to the Estonian government within 1-2 weeks. Unfortunately international documents require official (sworn) translation and legalisation, which makes the process a little tedious. Nonetheless, we're moving forward and making progress on this front.  #3. Website & waiting list is still on track to be launched this month. I'm working on finalising copy, getting the last pages done, implementing referral systems.  So far the feedback from our alpha testers has been great on these designs, and we'd hope you love the new branding / design and the trading view of the UI which we will show upon website launch.  #4.

This means you'll be able to invite friends to Mothership and potentially win some cool prizes such as Mothership swag, fee credits or an all expenses paid trip to Estonia to attend our office & exchange launch party. Thereby inviting your friends will bump you on the waiting list and will allow you to get earlier access onto the exchange once we go live.  With this website launch we are also revealing the first screenshot of the exchange and our new branding!  #2. Our new content marketer started last Thursday! Linh will be helping us with our company communication, social media, podcasts and bring our story and vision to the world. Give her a warm welcome, you'll definitely get to hear from her soon  #3. We expect to be able to deliver the pending documents for the financial license next week or latest early next week - we will let you know the status as per usual.  #4. We still have our referral bonus campaign live for introducing potential developers. If you know anyone who may be interested, please send us an email at careers@mothership.cx introducing us to the potential candidate. When he or she gets hired, you'll receive the mothership swag pack + €1000 worth of MSP Tokens! Why not give it a try :wink:?  #5. Some of our remote team members will be visiting us in Tallinn next week and we are excited to have most of the team physically in one place!  The constructions on our new office have also started, which we should be moving into next month. Once the office is ready and more presentable I'll share with you some pictures  #6. If you have participated in the ICO, you will receive an email from us during the next week. Please keep an eye out for this email as there will be important information in there and an exclusive offer for our dear contributors to do with the exchange launch.  -----",False

MSP serves as a core part of Mothership, and is required for: - Access to Premium and Platinum account tiers - The Mothership app platform layer - Community curation and insight rewards - Access to Mothership beta products - Mothership reputation management In addition, Mothership will repurchase MSP on the free market using 20% of fees from Mothership products. The repurchased MSP will be permanently destroyed. We will do so until 50% of the supply is destroyed.""  Very interesting model - have you had any thoughts, how this affects to the price of the MSP-token, if platform starts to create revenue? It should increase the value, but it is a bit tricky to predict. Price can go to very low even MSP-tokens are repurchased - or if nobody is willing to sell the price will go to infinity.",False

The Mothership team is excited to introduce you to the new Mothership Genesis! Genesis is a platform for conducting EU-based Token Sales with sophisticated security mechanisms, extensive KYC procedures and regulatory framework aligned with European Union and Estonian regulations.  For token sales participants, Genesis is a platform listing high quality projects which undergo thorough due diligence review by our team. With this initial release, BTC, ETH and LTC contributions are accepted. In the future Genesis will be integrated with Mothership exchange platform allowing participants the more extensive use of their accounts.  Genesis allows to conduct a token sale with all the legal paperwork set up to ensure secure and compliant process for all participants. We have built an easy on-boarding process, leveraging digital identities and simplifying KYC procedures. Besides the technical platform, we work closely with the project team, providing useful feedback, helping shape ideas, assisting with paperwork and token sale economics.  Integration with e-Residency & other digital identities The Mothership Foundation firmly believes that digital identities are changing the way we conduct business over the internet. Digital identity, especially e-Residency, is one of the reasons why we chose to incorporate and work from Estonia.  Genesis leverages digital identities for user authentication, allowing eID holders to jump the queue and verify their account for participation in the token sale in seconds, without uploading their passport scans or pesky utility bills.   An eID account verification is available to e-Residents, easing the process for 25,000 more people around the world. The digital identity service besides e-Residency is available to nationals of the following countries — Estonia, Finland, Belgium, Lithuania and Latvia, making KYC process a breeze for over 22 million people in the EU.  Token reservation with MSP MSP token holders will be able to take advantage of the right to reserve tokens before the sale at 1-to-1 ratio. Those reserved tokens will be available to purchase at the initial price of the sale. For example, if the token price scales from 6 to 8 cents during the sale, MSP reservations will guarantee you to take part at the initial price of 6 cents, no matter the progress.  The first token sale on Genesis We are extremely proud to announce our first-ever token sale hosted on the Genesis platform. The first company to start selling their tokens on the Genesis platform is Consensus.ai whose mission is to achieve collective governance based on the interdependence using advanced technologies. The goal with the first crowdsale is to fund the development and growth of Consensus AI platform and to set a strong base for the future token sales ahead on Genesis.   Consensus.ai Consensus is an open-sourced, decentralized artificial intelligence platform, powered by native cryptocurrency, and built with the vision to improve the governance mechanisms at all levels of organizational structures starting from startups and non-profits & finishing with cities and entire countries.  Once fully realized, Consensus AI will be able to offer automated, data-driven solutions to the most complex problems of our collective co-existence by modelling the potential outcomes of purposed changes.  Consensus is founded by Oleg Gutsol, an entrepreneur and software developer. Prior to founding Consensus, Oleg was the founder and CEO of 500px, a photo distribution platform, powered by image recognition technology and machine learning algorithms. As the CEO, Oleg led 500px from inception through hyper growth, with his help the company raised over $25M in VC funding from leading firms like Andreessen Horowitz, established major partnerships with Google, Adobe, Lonely Planet etc., and the 500px consumer platform grew to millions of users globally.  In 2016 Oleg turned his interest to the problems of collective governance and artificial intelligence applied to solving societal issues. Recently he also served as a Head of Global Growth at the Republic of Estonia e-Residency program, which provides the basis for the Consensus AI implementation.

This way, it will offer a legal framework for all the businesses running on the platform as they will be linked to the e-Residency (which is itself linked to your personal identity). This way it should prevent all the scams project we are used to see nowadays because e-Residency will able governments from all over the world to take legal actions against fraudsters and scammers. I think that's a good bet on the future because in few years, more and more countries will set up a clear legal framework about cryptocurrencies in general and if exchanges and cryptos don't respect the specific laws of a country in the matter they will be forbidden in this country for all the citizens. I believe USA is the most restrictive country about cryptocurrencies up to know and I wouldn't be surprised to see countries such as EU countries, Russia, China, ect... following this path. We will have to adapt cryptocurrencies to match the standards of the real world somehow, governments and banks won't let us the choice. The question is how to do so without sacrifying what cryptocurrencies are all about (cf. decentralization, money's ownership and so on) ? I think Mothership is a part of the answer to that. Correct me if I'm wrong.  @Bamsterdam And to answer to you about the centralized subject. Yes a centralized exchange can always be attacked or hacked but you can't have all the advantages of something without some disadvantages. Just don't leave your coins on exchanges for long periods and you are good to go, I don't see much problem on that.",False

Estonia is a great place to start new companies, with 100% remote government services, progressive laws and unique tax system. Estonia is the first country to offer e-Residency, a government-issued digital ID available to anyone in the world. It is a legally binding signature that allows to register an EU based company entirely online. Technically it is a pair of RSA keys linked with your identity.  Estonia is the first country in the EU to implement the European 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (4AMLD). The bill is scheduled to pass by 27 June 2017 at latest. https://www.riigikogu.ee/tegevus/eelnoud/eelnou/fb03e20e-caf7-463d-9b60-ddf6021742b2/Rahapesu%20ja%20terrorismi%20rahastamise%20tõkestamise%20seadus/. The bill introduces a clear definition of cryptocurrencies and sets regulations for exchange platforms and wallet providers. These entities will have the right to use identification of a person and verification of the identity of a person using information technology means in accordance with the procedure established by the government.  Estonia estimates 10,000,000 e-Residents by 2025. Mothership is proud to be working with the Estonian government’s e-Residency team to help build the future.  Our partner from e-Residency team is Oleg Gutsol, a serial entrepreneur and now a Head of Global Growth at e-Residency.

Crowdsale  MSP will be built on the Ethereum platform as an ERC20 token. There will be a total supply of 200,000,000 MSP.  MSP serves as a core part of Mothership, and is required for: -  Access to Premium and Platinum account tiers -  The Mothership app platform layer -  Community curation and insight rewards -  Access to Mothership beta products -  Mothership reputation management  In addition, Mothership will repurchase MSP on the free market using 20% of fees from Mothership products. The repurchased MSP will be permanently destroyed.  Each MSP token will be priced at $0.04 in ETH on the start date of the crowdfund. The crowdfunding will run on Ethereum Smart Contract, accepting ETH payments in exchange for MSP tokens. Tokens that remain unsold by the end of the crowdfund will be permanently destroyed.  The token will be distributed as follows: 70% of MSP tokens will be available for purchase in this fundraising round. 20% of MSP tokens are reserved for purchase by our Strategic Investors. 5% of MSP tokens will be earned through the Mothership Referral Program in this fundraising round. 5% of MSP tokens will be reserved for the team and advisors.  Participants of the crowdfund will instantly gain access to their MSP, but the tokens will become moveable 24 hours after the crowdfund ends.  At least 50,000,000 MSP must be sold for the fundraising to be considered a success. If less are sold, all buyers will be refunded.   The Referral Program  Mothership is launching a referral program for this crowdsale. Each participant will be provided with a unique referral URL. -  A referrer will receive an additional amount of tokens equal to 5% of the tokens bought by all of their referred buyers. -  This additional 5% is taken from the reserved 5% referral fund, which will amount for 3.5% of the total supply if all tokens are bought using the referral system. -  The remaining tokens from the referral fund (1.5% + tokens left over from buys not using the referral system) will be distributed to all the participants, proportionate the the amount of people they referred that made purchases.",False
