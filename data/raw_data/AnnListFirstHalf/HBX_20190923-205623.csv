We can't say at the moment. We're in discussion with exchanges and token liquidity providers (like ShapeShift, Changelly, Bancor, etc). Obviously Binance, Bittrex, Kucoin, Huobi, seem like good candidates, but we cannot promise anything. We need to work this out with our lawyers.  Quote from: Imsunny007 on July 28, 2018, 02:49:22 PM I check the roadmap and it is found a very promising project, the team behind the project is truly professional.  What is benefit to buy this token from that upcoming crowdsale can you please explain about that. ICO investors will get what kind of advantages to hold this token I didn't find this into that thread.  Thanks Imsunny007, appreciate it mate. The HBX token fuels Hyperbridge protocols and the BlockHub platform. Purchasing the HBX token will allow you to utilize those when launched & reduce fees. The token can be locked up for contributions to crowdfunds, voting, purchasing products, in-game items, trading assets, as product owners giving bounties to uses, and more. We're working the details of this into the whitepaper soon.

Hi sagar150cc, max token supply is 1B (1 billion). Initial supply is 350M (350 million). Another 200M will be sold inside the platform over the next 2 years.  Quote from: jagtap123 on July 28, 2018, 09:28:24 AM what is your plan about exchange listening?  Hi jagtap123, we're in discussion with our lawyers to figure that out. Everything about the Hyperbridge protocols and token scream utility, but we have to work with local lawyers from each jurisdiction to get approval, at least in the beginning. In the meantime we have started relationships with exchanges and token liquidity providers (like ShapeShift, Changelly, Bancor, etc).  Quote from: Altamash K on July 28, 2018, 10:34:18 AM What benefit this project can do world ?? And on which exchange the tokens in going to be listed ?  Hi Altamash, we believe through decentralized protocols the world can be greatly improved, disintermediation, efficiency, collaboration, security through contract rules, to name a few. Hyperbridge protocols, or some form of them, will benefit and change the world. We have to work hard to be open, transparent, collaborative. It's all in the execution. We need to be building usable tools built on this technology. We'll be proposing standards, working with other projects in the space, funding developers to use our protocols, and hosting hackathons around potential end-products. Please see our website for more! https://hyperbridge.org  Quote from: Bilal butt on July 28, 2018, 09:10:54 AM Awesome project it seems like different strong team combination with having potential keep it up.

This fact will be able to cause some big doubts from all investors.   Hi ERossin! I hear you, these numbers aren't always clear. We have consulted with our advisors and friends (relatively big crypto investors), and although not the lowest, have structured it so it shouldn't be a problem. They are locked for 1 year, with a further staged release over 1 year (this contract will be open source soon). These are distributed among the core team, and used in offers to bring in top talent in the tech industry. No single person will own more than 3% of total supply. The amount was based on this, and precedent, as other tokens such as 0x / Wanchain / Dragonchain / etc. have all been 30% or more. Thank you for voicing your thoughts and for feedback.",False

By providing tools that allow creators to easily deploy blockchain-enabled projects, Hyperbridge is removing the barriers that limit contribution to the innovative process.    BlockHub is our digital distribution platform that is driven by decentralized protocols, which will be the home of a next-generation crowdfunding process.  The BlockHub platform will unite producers and consumers by equipping developers to crowdfund, publish, and market their applications. Users of BlockHub will be able to find new and innovative titles within a vibrant marketplace, while also having the option to earn tokens and reputation by taking actions that support projects and the overall ecosystem.      What Problems Does Hyperbridge Solve?  Restricted competition in the gaming space  The gaming industry rewards predictability, and limits competition from small developers. The risks and cost associated with successfully publishing a game title is high. Due to the saturation of franchised titles and sequels, often backed by substantial marketing budgets, smaller developers fight to gain visibility and market share.  Indie gaming is a highly creative environment, but many of the developers in that space do not have access to the community, funding and marketing necessary for their games to compete.     Crowdfunding is broken - current models are slow and charge high-fees  Middle-man means higher fees: Traditional payment providers charge 2.9% + 30 cents for every single transaction, but is usually between 4.5% or 5%. (e.g. Kickstarter documents processing fees at 3% + .20 cents per pledge, but payments can fluctuate as high as 5%).  Centralized crowdfunding models are limited in lowering fees go because they remain dependent on 3rd party payment providers (E.g. Paypal or Visa).      Unfair Marketplace for Developers  The current gaming industry operates on a centralized model. Large distribution platforms wield enormous power in the distribution and publishing of content. As a result they charge steep publishing fees and take a sizeable percentage of the profits. Developers with smaller sales volumes have to endure long periods to recoup their investments, and even run the risk of publishing at a net loss.      Unable to Maintain Quality Control An issue with current digital distribution platforms is their inability to curate and manage the content they publish. Without curation, marketplaces become flooded with spam. With too much intervention, marketplaces are accused of  censorship. The issue with current platforms is that a centralized authority is the one managing the marketplace, making the decisions about what users do and don’t see.This isn’t ideal, but is currently the best the industry has. Without a meaningful way for communities to decide on what they play, centralized authorities will continue to guess what their users want.        How BlockHub Works     Supporting a competitive environment  The BlockHub economy will support small developers by helping them manage the entirety of their project lifecycle from start to finish. Our tools will enable small developers by giving them access to the community, marketing and funding they need to compete.    Ensuring a Fair and Sustainable Marketplace for Developers  BlockHub’s decentralized marketplace eliminates middlemen from the model. In their absence, BlockHub’s protocols are designed to provide an economic benefit for independent developers, artists, and creators so they can fund, share, and distribute their work with far less friction. This means that developers receive a larger share of profits. BlockHub will also assist developers in establishing immutable digital rights and licensing, providing them with the tools, community and support to compete against larger studios who presently dominate the market.     Next-generation, smart-contract driven Crowdfunding   Smart contracts on a blockchain will facilitate the funding of game developer projects within the BlockHub ecosystem. BlockHub will use a standardized protocol for developers to propose project ideas, specify funding requirements, schedule milestones, and outline contribution tiers/incentives. BlockHub users will easily be able to contribute cryptocurrency to the projects they support, and provide them a platform to vote on the success of individual milestones.   Cutting out high-cost middlemen → more money goes to the creator, instead of being soaked up by the payment gateway. Lower fees →  by removing middle-men and conducting transactions in crypto, fees will be dramatically lower than our centralized counterparts (e.g. the average Bitcoin fee stood at .4825%) Faster + More Efficient - Creators are paid out faster so they can continue on creating, instead of languishing and fighting to survive while waiting for their profits to be released to them     Maintaining Quality Control  BlockHub will maintain a higher standard of curation relative to centralized platfroms by using a decentralized model of reputation based community voting. Curators will be designated through the reputation they have gained through various platform actions. Active and prospective developers will also be structured into ‘tiers’ based on their community-governed reputation to help maintain this quality.  Developers who have a successful history of producing quality games on BlockHub’s platform will have less restrictions for implementing future ideas. “Unproven” developers will be held to a higher level of scrutiny up until the point in time in which they gain reputation and prove that their intentions are in line with the mission and values of the ecosystem.  Lastly, this environment will also be managed and directed by the community, through smart contracts to prevent spamming and to ensure a diverse and healthy game development atmosphere is maintained. Token holders will ultimately have the capacity to vote out content that doesn’t meet their quality thresholds.       Features    Through various Software Development Kits (SDKs) and protocols embedded in BlockHub, developers can manage the entirety of their project lifecycle from start to finish.

We're actually more focused on PC crowdfunding as those titles will make a natural transition into our marketplace, while mobile game distribution will be unfeasible under Apple's publishing policy. There may be opportunity to use BlockHub as a game portal on blockchain-enabled smartphones, but nobody is using those yet as far as we know (Sirin Labs is attempting it). We will have a mobile app for browsing crowdfund projects and the marketplace, but it won't be blockchain-enabled, as non-Apple payments are against their policy. (Even outside of the Apple ecosystem, if you're pulling in decent revenue). So far as we know, public mobile crowdfunding isn't very big yet though either, so we'll see what the future holds  Best,",False
