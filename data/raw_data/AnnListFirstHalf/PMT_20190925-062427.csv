His opinion about DAO PlayMarket2.0: ""I have been engaged in cryptocurrency mining since 2013, and the PlayMarket 2.0 project interested me first of all with its unusual mining mechanism. In fact, this is not a traditional way, it is more like the cooperation of users. At the moment, Google Play earns almost 30% of the total income from the sale of applications and then spends it at its discretion. PlayMarket 2.0 offers to divide the income received among the cooperating members: the commission for the developer is significantly reduced; the owners of the nodes that help the network work receive a reward in the form of a percentage of the turnover. All these advantages show that working with the PlayMarket 2.0 project can be more profitable than cryptocurrency mining."" More info on the web-site: https://ico.playmarket.io/",False

Google has been far more permissive than iTunes’ walled garden, but even they have occasionally used a heavy hand to get reject or remove apps that offended. What PlayMarket is trying to do is completely put the power back in the hands of the developers and users.  After an initial ICO, starting this November 8, PlayMarket will begin marketing to both developers and consumers. The developers can use the platform to raise funds to create their apps and get marketing support. Users can find apps that they think have promise and invest in their development, gaining benefits of dividends from future profits earned by the app, in game, purchases, etc.  PlayMarket will then be a decentralized organization. Developers and users will find each other through the platform. Useful apps will be supported and promoted by the wisdom of the crowds. The PlayMarket tokens, will be useful not only in the PlayMarket ecosystem, but also tradeable on any cryptocurrency exchange that lists it.
