Hi to everyone  I'm thinking about investing in dtr and today that I saw the tweet that big news is coming I'm more inclined to do it soon as it is already a functioning product and dtr is still low priced. Therefore, I have some questions.  First, guys who are more familiar with the project - what do you speculate that this big news could be?  Second, the team isn't investing anything in marketing yet, but as the market is slowly reversing, it could happen that they start marketing activities in the next months. How this normally looks like? Which channels are normally used? Will they target more expericed users and promote on places such as this forum or target people who are joining the party as the bull run starts (e.g. Invested in bitcoin / ethereum on fiat-crypto exchange 2 years ago, but have very limited or no experience in crypto-crypto trading). On the other hand, if bull run starts, also competition will step up marketing - what is your opinion on whether tokens.net will be able to make impact and differentiate themselves from competition in such situation?  I would appreciate any insights. Thanks in advance",False

Access to listing pairs. We have enabled a direct link from Balances to the listing pairs. If you navigate to Balances, currency down arrows are hyperlinked. When clicked, a drop-down menu appears where you can directly navigate to the trading pair. This is a great productivity improvement.   Activity Log. Activity log is another security feature that provides a detailed report on your account use.   API Access IP Lock. Another security feature comes for our clients that use API to mitigate unauthorized third party access.   Export CSV. Withdrawal requests, network transactions, transaction history, trades and orders can now be exported in CSV format.   Fees Payments. If you navigate to Settings, under section Fees, you see your DTR holdings available throughout all your sub-accounts. If ""Use DTR to pay fees"" is selected then the system will subtract the corresponding amount of DTR from that sub-account when any trade is executed with your liability to pay fees. This only occurs when your DTR account covers the whole fee payment, no partial coverage is possible.   Hide Zero Balances. With growing number of listings hiding a zero balance feature was a natural step to manage your balances more closely. If you navigate to Balances, a check-box has been added ""Hide currencies with no balance"". If the checkbox is selected, only non-zero balances remain visible.   Market Depth Chart. Market Depth Chart provides graphical market depth further out the curve. Order book is only visible for a certain number of orders, for orders above that you may rely on the graphical part.   My Watchlist. Watchlist items can now be manually rearranged using drag and drop functionality for keeping your most preferred listing pairs on the top.   Sessions Monitoring. To improve the security tokens.net has enabled sessions monitoring. If you navigate to Settings, under section Sessions, you see which devices are currently signed into your Tokens.net account, provided your operating system, browser, IP location and activity.   Withdrawal Label. Withdrawal label may be used optionally to add personalized memos. Some find it useful so we have added them.   Withdrawal Request Cancellation. If you swiftly change your mind or during the pending approval phase you may now cancel your withdrawal request. This is only possible until success system message in the status column is shown.   Happy trading in 2019!   Tokens Team",False

Its just no name exchange with few members and  low volume. Voting system insures that coins will be slowly listed in next few years (if necessary).  Fact is, relatively  very very  little money was invested in the project (so where did the rest of our money go?). And what happened with assets from Quantum? The exchange exists, but as such it is completely uninteresting and some benefits from it in this form can not be expected. It could be therefore more or less just an excuse that something has been done, (but it is not a serious project as promised). Burning system at this speed will take another 50 years.

Dont. Its crypto. Why you doubt about the team. Merlak create exchange Bitstamp witch is most LEGIT in Crypto space by the way in my opinion. And what is good there. He probably have most knolage then any other in this business. Lets rewind time back when Bitstamp was hacked. Now you know what mean LEGIT in some point. Why they would trew away such magnificent project like Tokens.net is. I dont see even one reason for that. Only what bothers me too is that the team is so quiet that we do not even know it exists. But look this dont have just minuses. Let me give you plus on this. Lets say we will know the date when marketing start. We will probably pump the DTR before newcomers ).  Lets focus now on project and little update it after my last post:  DTR VOICE (new) As you see its only way you can now list your cryptocurrency. Some DTRVs was seed to active users. Each user get 1000 DTRV. You can see this over ETHScan around 79 days ago when was a lot DTR with amount 30 DTR seed. Same day when we get those free 1000 DTRV. If you count them you get number 119. It might be we have that time 119 active users what is logical and give you quantaty of 119.000 DTRV. Next interesting transactions was 59days ago when DTRV was at prcie 32DTR. You can even see this on tokens.net chart DTR-DTRV when big green spike come. Lets say this is quantaty from tokens.net and give you amount 108 transactions (almost same like 79 days ago). Lets guest that in that point we have very limited supply of DTRV like max 500.000 DTRV (in this number even tokens.net DTRV) without any future airdrops anymore. Now lets go to Disctruction even link where we can see that realy loooot DTR was burn coz of DTRV (more then half). There you can even see that the tokens team sell their own DTRV. And coz they want BURN go fast they put own DTR form selling DTRV to burn and earn nothing. Only plus for them is each time any crypto is listed with some quantaty of DTRV they get them back and can sold them again. I dont know how long will this process go on but in some point they wont send own DTR to burn but they will sell them on market. Probably in this point price of DTRV wont be anymore like s now but around 500-1000 DTR (my opinion). And what is soo magnificent? Everything.. that mean they give this desission full to the people. Look like in some point decentalization in centralization. Does any exchange do this. NO.  So I think more time team have in this bear market to develop new things on exchange and not spending money, more % we have that this Exchange will be one day in top 10.  Anyway try to find hotwallet from TOKENS.NET  And ofcorse its long long term project in one point. Anyway i dont think we will get any of new users with marketing right now. So we must wait when all other projects will run out marketing and BTC will start bull then we can come on stage.  GATCHA fraudulent? I dont think soo.

IPL is on 5 place best selling token on chart. No shit. Open Blockfolio and insert IPL and check exact 24h period and try to check on LiveCoin real time trading. You will see its not that much like it is on CMC 24h vol. So they faking with people and try to show people that they have lot 24h vol trades and this coin is now virtual potential as good coin. DDDDD. LOL. And people will buy that coin for high price coz dont have real volume on that price like is now. So easyly can cut from Livecoin 2x 0 in 24h volume to get real volume. Lot people belive what write on CMC. Thi is not legal and in future will be coz of regulations this exchange closed. Now lets go back to our DTR and Tokens.net...  24h volume on tokens.net is real and cant be fake it. When they turn on FEE and BURNING. End of story... Do have any other exchage that tool to prove real volume? Nobody. Maybe BINANCE is first in line coz of burning... So thats next generation exchange... REAL LEGIT VOLUME  And ask your self do you realy think that Merlak will one day say: sorry exchange not start like we thing. Project closed. LOL. I am almost 100% NOT. Why?

The platform was built in just three months, an achievement that nobody believed would be possible. However, we dismissed the sceptics and delivered on our promises. The feedback we received from the community was very positive and although some minor corrections and updates were necessary the platform performed extremely well.  Public launch Although QA underwent testing throughout all of its services we were occasionally caught off guard by the imagination of our customers who gave us immediate feedback regarding the ways in which they interact with the platform, observe process flows and understand its features and functionalities. This necessitated some minor touches, corrections and updates.  Three months following our beta launch we hit another important milestone. We opened our site to the public on 31 July 2018 and started accepting customers from all over the world. We have since been busier than ever implementing new features, new cryptocurrencies, strengthening our security and signing new business partnerships.  Stasis Euro (EURS) Tokens.net became one of the first marketplaces that implemented Stasis Euro (EURS) stable coin. This is an accomplishment we are extremely proud of as it proved how quickly and reliably we can respond to new market products and demands.  What have we been doing We have been adding new currencies and opening new trading pairs on a weekly basis and will continue to do so in the future.  Unfortunately, we also had to make some sacrifices in order to achieve our objectives. Due to the current market situation we decided to postpone the delivery of our mobile app. We strongly believe that its launch at this stage would not add much value to the company. This is why we assigned all our engineers to work on the web platform.  What to expect We plan to roll out DTR Voice system on 1 November 2018. On this date all our active clients will get 1000 DTR Voices deposited to their Tokens.net account. It will subsequently be possible to use DTR Voices to vote on future cryptocurrency listings and trade them on our platform. All proceeds derived from future sales of DTR Voices will be used to burn Dynamic Trading Rights (DTR).

What is a shit coin is a very much subjective opinion, while most of us are that 95%+ of the coins are shitty. But that doesn't mean that tokens should list only 5% of the so called ""good coins"". The market will decide what is truly a shit coin, as this coin will die out. Tokens will just give a chance to coin to prove itself it is not shit - many will fail.  I think important is to have a lot, a lot of pairs. So you can trade whatever you want. And this will bring traders on the exchange - so we have everything on one spot.

I can see why someone would get frustrated with Tokens though. They haven't done much to add new pairs. You don't even have for example XRP on it yet (personally I think XRP is shit but it's 3rd in marketcap so...) but there is a bunch of Slovene coins/tokens. Which is welcome. Just... add more top 10, top 20 marketcap cryptos as soon as possible. I know you can get them all elsewhere but do you want me to get them elsewhere or you want me to use Tokens? You have seen the latest spike in interest in XRP. Wouldn't be cool to tweet and advertise Tokens as a place where you can trade XRP with no fees when everyone was eager to buy it? What actually bothers me is the lack of communication from Tokens team with the community. Damian tweets something every 2 months and that's it. They missed the mobile app release date. It's October already and still no news. At least update the roadmap and let us know. Another thing is the promotion period. There is no marketing done. According to the whitepaper, 20 % of the ICO funding should be reserved for marketing. That's fine if they are waiting, whole crypto market needs some catalysts to turn bullish and bring in more people investing every day anyway but there are other means in how to bring in new users. There are bounties, referals, etc. You can check out what Binance did, they nailed it. You can't just expect new users joining on their own if they never even heard of Tokens or why would you switch to an exchange with very small market depth for most of the trading pairs when you can use the established counterpart. It seems like running in circles. This no fee trading doesn't help much if the orderbook is empty and sometimes you can't even trade more than 1 usd worth of the coin so there is not much advantage in it for me as a user.

Two days of not having access to my DTR feels as if I lost my investment.  Used Gatehub to buy Quantum instead, and it was my first time using their exchange since I signed up long ago. The UI is nice, and I had a great experience. It was even letting me send additional Quantum to my wallet by automatically shapeshifting the XRP I have in that wallet. I understand that DTR has potential to be listed on Gatehub per what I read on XRP Chat forums. That would be great, or any other exchange rather than Livecoin because others have issues with the same problem, not only on DTR tokens but other cryptocurrencies as well. I appreciate the effort of the team, and am fully supporting the two projects Quantum and Tokens.net. 2018 will be a big year, and I plan to hold on well into 2020. Best of luck fellows.  Praying my DTR gets back in my possession from Livecoin. Very disappointed in this Livecoin exchange (and why I am supporting Tokens.net, so experiences like this are not to happen with a solid team behind the new exchange) and I am hoping the team chose an exchange that will eventually resolve my issue as I am talking about a significant about of DTR. Considering I am going back to holding that same amount of DTR, I am not missing out on anything but simply the feeling of having the coins registered to my own private key.  Edit: I am not the only one having trouble with DTR deposits onto Livecoin. Tokens.net need to find another exchange immediately because the only available one is absolutely flawed and the developers will be complicit to allowing DTR tokens to be screwed over by only listing DTR on Livecoin with such great issues that being are unable to access their tokens after a WEEKS time. Accountability needs to be taken as Livecoin did not even give a warning on DTR deposits being this slow. Only when I read their forum page I found that other DTR token holders are going through the same issue.",False

BNB will only burn up to 50% of the total BNB in supply while I believe DTR will burn forever.  Also, keep in mind that DTR has a mechanism built-in to burn tokens in real-time when trades are made via an Ethereum smart contract. This makes DTR EXTREMELY deflationary in comparison to BNB and KCS. Of the token-based exchange business models that are emerging, Digital Trading Rights has probably the best shot at moving with the trends.  Just my personal opinion of course, but if you just look at BNB, KCS, and  COSS growth over the past month and specially the past week or so...it's obvious that there's a lot of room for these token-based exchanges to emerge, knocking the old non-token exchanges out of the picture.  These token-based exchanges are actually beneficial to smaller traders because we get discounts and better opportunities! I've written a couple articles on token-based exchanges so far - Kucoin & Binance - below are the articles if you want to take a look. - https://keepingstock.net/kucoin-exchange-based-token-that-earns-you-a-daily-dollar-cost-average-and-diversified-portfolio-2f532a432ed1 - https://keepingstock.net/binance-exchange-fueling-a-hot-new-era-of-token-based-exchanges-models-ecb5559ac623   I'm probably going to reach out to the DTR to get more details on the project and write an article on them as we get closer to the launch of their Beta or Alpha at least. We're VERY early in their growth, but these exchange tokens fly fast so follow closely!

Binance offers an option of using their BNB to pay for the transaction fees, however not mandatory. If you do you receive discounts (1st year 50%, 2nd year 25%...). DTR will be mandatory used for transaction fees.  Binance is using 20% of their profits (gathered from fees) to burn out their tokens, until they reach 100M tokens. The rest will be used in the future when Binance will be ""decentralized exchange, where BNB will be used as one of the key assetts as well as gas to be spent.""

At first I was pumped about this project but I have a few issues with it now that I think it may be trash... :  1.) if it isn't aligned with Bitstamp and getting that volume, then that means its actually a competitor to it which sucks and is a joke...  2.) Even in the whitepaper itself, the token plateaus in price at 500% increase and is pushed as a ""safe haven""...what that means is that it is stable and isn't going up in value...safe haven is like tether which sucks big time for investors...  3.) I can't get any response from anyone on any site or board...and there is very little activity anywhere to be seen besides the paid for regurgitated paid articles about ""the next gen platform"" which is concerning...  4.) this same type of push was made for a previous project called Quantum which while it has gone up in value somehow (good sign that we can dump this DTR sheet and get out), the project seems like garbage with no volume on Bitstamp which is the primary promise of backing this slimy looking slovanian dude...  5.) This coin will be in direct competition with Ripple at some point as it is the same concept without the ""next gen platform"" which I think is stupid...what is next gen about it again? If ripple pivots toward the common consumer at some point, which it will, then DTR is in big trouble..  6.)

How will they fund my 1658 DTR?  Will it automatically go back on the ETH account I sent my funds from?  How do I see which account I sent it from? Please add a blockchain or web entry that shows me my balance, which account I funded it from, funded for how much, date and time, etc.  These are blockchain basics.  At a minimum, post a spreadsheet with those details or send me another email with my complete details.  The most important thing I want to know is how you will send me my 1685 DTR once this ICO is over.  Do I need to send you a new ETH account address?  Do I have the option of using a different ETH address than what I funded it with?  How does it work for BTC and XRP buyers?  I bought this ICO because I was solicited from Gatehub.  I trust Gatehub and also bought Quantum there.  This lack of basic bookkeeping is making me not trust it though.  Have you ever heard of a smart contract?  When I bought the DRP ICO, I sent ETH and within 2 minutes I saw my DRP ICO balance in my wallet.  It was locked and I couldn't trade it because the ICO was still in progress.  A few months later I used my same Private Key to vote through the ETH network to unlock the tokens.  DRP actually used ETH bookkeeping and features for the ICO sale and unlock.  Maybe there is a level of competence difference between DTR and DRP programmers or maybe I'm missing something.  Why do I care?  I care because this email doesn't feel safe.  I have to spend a lot more brain energy to remember what DTR I have and guess how I'm going to get it on the blockchain someday.  If you care about customers and want customers to feel good about your product, then just share everything on the blockchain or a spreadsheet or whatever you have.  don't send a half baked email with partial information that just leads to more questions that can't be answered.  Your customers are blockchain customers.  we expect to be self service.  We don't want to ask you what our balance is.  We want to be our own customer service rep and check our own account independently.  That is the beauty of the blockchain.  Please quit hording the information to yourselves.  That is not decentralized.  That's not what I want to buy or invest in.  I want to be equal to you and have equal access to your information.  Do you wonder why BTC is such a simple easy product and has virtually no unique features, but is the most valuable?  It's because I feel like I'm an equal when I purchase BTC.  There is no customer service and I like that.  I am the company or employee as much as the others.  I can also mine or sync the whole blockchain if I want to.  If you aren't open like bitcoin, then you are jumping on the blockchain bandwagon trying to catch some free upswing from the real players doing the real work like BTC.  It's easy to be real.  Just put your books on the blockchain and don't give users any reason to ask you questions or call you because everything is right there for them from the beginning.  If they can't find it themselves, drop features and make it easier for them.  Quit putting yourself between the users and the product you're telling them is already theirs, but isn't yet.",False

Should the ICO money run out, the platform must not discontinue. To solve this problem, the company will liquidate small amounts of tokens to fund operations.   Crypto/crypto trading will provide lighter compliance requirements, therefore traders will have much easier way to start trading. Uniqueness of DTR provides long term decrease of effective transaction fees, what we believe will attract market makers, whales and other traders that seek low and cost effective trading vehicles.
