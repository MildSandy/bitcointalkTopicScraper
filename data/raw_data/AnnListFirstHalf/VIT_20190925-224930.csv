A five-year-old boy, watching the friends playing in the yard, dreamed of a beautiful world in which everyone knows that everyone around is as kind and good as himself inside ...  With this dream, he grew up until one day he came up with the idea of how to approach her:  ""To make it so that all people record their lives and be transparent to each other. Transparency will increase trust, which will entail the cognitive resources of mankind will be released and self-realization will be multiplied. Thereby everyone will be happy, and progress will grow very much""  Now it is the mission of Vitavisor company   ...VITAVISOR FEATURES...   The Vitavisor is a wearable computer in the form of glasses with a web camera, small projector for the eyes and person identifier. Its users are united in Vitavision net.  First, Vitavisor is a solution to the problem of trust in information in the internet: Only owner can use the Vitavizor. This is due to the identifier, a device that scans the user's retina every second. If ""stranger"" try use it  - the device will immediately lock. Inside the Vitavisor network no one hides behind the pseudonym, all are registered through own passport. All user actions are recorded. You can always see who visited your page and what was viewed on it.  Secondly, the included Vitavisor always records from the first person. What would the user not do at this time: communication, study information in the system or simply keep a record of life. As grow time of use of the Vitavisor the percentage of the recording of life will grow too.

To more correctly understand the speech in communication. To extract more information after communication. To send information directly from the source, and not in your own words and in your interpretation. To develop a sense of responsibility for their words and deeds. To develop discipline and awareness, it is easier to cope with procrastination and frustration. To analyze life as an object and systematically manage its quality.
