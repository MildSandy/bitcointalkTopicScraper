To make this real, we created a ENGZ token (Energizium token) as a way to raise funds in a Initial Coin Offering (ICO). The pre-sale is starting today and are going to end on 1th December.  WHO IS OUR CUSTOMERS As Energizium Coin is focused on the energy market as a way of improving the sector, using blockchain, our potential customers for the moment are the major industries in the electric energy sector. However, our portfolio can be expanded according to the growth and acceptance of the Energizium network.  PURPOSE OF ENERGIZIUM The main purpose of Energizium Coin is to promote the improvement of electric sector and energy distribution through a blockchain network for information exchange.  WHAT IS ENERGIZIUM TOKEN An Energizium Token (ENGZ token) is a digital transaction execution key that represents an Energizium Coin. The Energizium token was created as a form of internal distribution on the platform before the official launch. Since the blockchain is not yet active, putting pre-sale ENGZ token was the way we found to raise funds in a safe and advantageous way for the user, who can collect their tokens, removing from the internal platform and selling the tokens for a price higher in the main exchanges  WHAT IS THE PRICE OF AN ENGZ TOKEN The price is $0.05 on pre-sales each token. Price may vary according to post-launch demand  READ THE WHITER PAPER https://energizium.com/white-paper.pdf   VISIT https://energizium.com to know more about it.",False
