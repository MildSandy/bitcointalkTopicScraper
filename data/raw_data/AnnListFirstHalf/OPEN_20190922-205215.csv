We have properly prepared and consulted with legal professions and are very confident that this case is worthy of pursuit. Our group of bounty participants who are now seeking damages are the “real” first supporters of the project, who saw the vision of the team and committed to an unusually lengthy campaign (at a loss if you take into account the massive opportunity cost) while others left. This is why this is a regrettable decision on our part as we are believers in the project, but upholding contractual obligations is essential, if the global bounty community is to continue thriving.  We have not received any response whatsoever from any representative from the OPEN team concerning our claims, which beyond doubt have not been excuses with unsubstantiated falsehoods. Sometimes ignorance can turn out to be a successful strategy; however, it is not so in a clear cut case of fraud as this. We can guarantee you that we will employ every aspect of the law to not let this theft OPEN is committing go unresolved. Some in the community may have benefited from this blatant breach of contractual obligation (by receiving misappropriated funds), but you should be concerned how this is destroying the industry. If we allow this precedent to go unchallenged, it will only be a matter of time until it happens to you, too.  If the terms, which were coherently expressed, are not met according to the interpretation of all legal statutes governing contractual activities and upon which we entered this contractual relationship, we will be forced to begin legal proceedings in several jurisdictions. We expect an answer until Thursday, July 5th. You have a relatively concrete deadline now and we are still hopeful for you to realize that blatant theft should not be left to define the OPEN project.  We certainly know what we are doing and we understand this subject very well. Some of you might feel some misled curiosity, resulting in a strong desire to find out who we are and what we can achieve. Some might hope we fail, and some might hope we succeed for the sake of integrity and legal compliance.  Blockchain is here to create a level playing field. It is a neutral technology. It doesn't know moral discussion. A poor guy pays the same transaction fee as a rich guy. Is it fair? Well, there is an incentive for someone else to create a cheaper network if there is a need for it. The signature and content campaigns were open to anyone at anytime. The terms have been clearly laid out and confirmed publicly and privately by the OPEN team various times in the relevant thread and in private discussions. With that being said, in closing, we would like to state our belief in the project; however, such disregard of honorable business practices must be held to account. We eagerly await a just reply from the OPEN team.  Full payment under the terms and conditions is requested by Thursday (July 5th). I implore the OPEN team to reach out to me anytime by 7/5 in order to prevent any judicial litigation.  Kind regards!",False

In fact, it is rather the opposite. Today, we found out that OPEN isn't the team we always thought they were. Breaching contracts and denying to deliver transparent spreadsheets (as is industry standard) is as bad as it can get for every bounty participant individually and for this wonderful globally established industry as a whole. An industry they used - or rather abused - to get the word out efficiently and which helped them to reach their goals in an extraordinary manner.

And honestly speaking, we all should be warned investing in a team that is willing to pull an illegal trigger anytime while calling such action a matter of ""fairness"". We are not asking for fairness, we are asking for sanctity of contracts. Dear OPEN team: get familiar with the term ""pacta sunt servanda"". I still hope that there are no extra lessons needed for you. I think I am speaking on behalf of every deceived bounty participant.  I do listen to the community and I am asking the OPEN team for nothing more than compliance with the terms we all agreed upon by entering the bounty campaign. Together with my team I collected all available evidence over the course of the campaign, which will help us substantiate our claims against the OPEN team expediently.  We do have a first legal opinion from a renowned law agency, which is clearly in favor of the bounty participants. In consultation with the agency, I will now be reaching out to the OPEN team, and in particular to Ken Sangha, for a very last time tomorrow CA morning time. Work is now being done on a final statement and once it is ready, it will be forwarded to the OPEN team. If the decision by the OPEN team remains as it is, which is a breach of contract, legal action will be taken shortly after.  I would like to kindly ask any bounty participant who wants to see her- or himself represented to reach out to me via private message. Feel free to keep the discussion going, but I will not further comment on this matter until we either have an answer from the OPEN team that they revoke their decision to violate the law, or until I get the permission from the law agency to further communicate on certain issues publicly.  I know that stepping forward with an issue of this kind might also attract a lot of hate from the investor community. I deeply regret this situation came to existence at all. However, I sincerely ask everyone to do your own research on this matter and to keep in mind that I am not asking anyone to change terms to my or anyone's advantage. The request is to stay legally compliant, to stick to the terms as they have been outlined for almost 9 months and verified various times upon public request (see here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2150904.msg31728482#msg31728482) and private request in private telegram conversations with the OPEN team.  I am looking forward to hopefully achieving a legally compliant solution with the OPEN team. If that will not be the case, I would like to emphasize that this is not an empty threat and we will lodge an appeal.  I will keep you posted tomorrow.  Thanks and best regards!",False

Token  180,000,000 OPEN tokens will be sold in the ICO with a total token supply of 1 billion. During the ICO, one OPEN will equal $0.10 USD with a hard cap of $30 million.  Team  Ken Sangha, CEO: Many years’ experience in leadership roles in business with the most recent being as founder and CEO of DoublePlay Entertainment Inc.  Andrew Leung, CTO: Over ten years’ experience in software engineering with the most recent being with TribalScale as the Director of Engineering.  Dennis Lewis, Director of Marketing: Over 30 years’ combined experience in marketing with the most recent being icosuccess.com and Suchapp.  Chase Smith, Lead Architect: Over three years’ experience in research and development with the most recent being a Technical Due Diligence Officer at Veritas Due Diligence.  Verdict  Open Platform is taking on a huge task by building the first platform to integrate traditional apps with cryptocurrency payments on the blockchain. After looking at the team (experienced successful entrepreneurs), whitepaper and roadmap, it looks like Open Platform will be one of the top performing infrastructure projects over the next 12 months. Infrastructure and Platform ICOs tend to do very well in the long-term as long as they hit their milestones. When researching previous successful infrastructure ICOs I have noticed that these are type projects that can bring in 10x – 100x ROI because of the impact they have on the current application market.  Risks      Being the first to market as a payment processor may have many challenges but this is a minor risk as the company is being led by successful entrepreneurs who have started and sold successful companies in the past. -1.5     Not having a public sale always gives seed investors an advantage as discounted token prices are negotiated before a token hits the first exchange. -1.0     Although Open Platform is making it easy to integrate with the blockchain for payment processing there are other sleeping giants that may enter the market such as Facebook, Google, Stripe, and Paypal. -0.25  Growth Potential      A rock-solid leadership team having started and sold successful companies gives the team a unique advantage. The leadership team has built companies from the ground up and sold them successfully already. +3.0     Open Platform has already announced backing from Draper Dragon Network, which has been involved in companies such as Skype, Baidu, and Tesla. This backing and support from such a well-known network in Silicon Valley will help Open get exposure to big money players in the startup investment world as well as attract business connections and contacts they may not have been able to establish on their own. +3..5     OpenPlatform is one of the first to build an easy to use payment processing infrastructure to traditional business that wants to accept cryptocurrency. One of the main hindrances of crypto funds entering the free market is access. OpenPlatform is connecting the two worlds together. +2.5     For a company building such a robust payment processing infrastructure, the hard cap is low with room to easily go 5x initial investment even after landing on its first exchange as long as the product delivers. +1.5  Disposition  Being one of the first infrastructure platforms allowing existing developers and applications to integrate with cryptocurrency payment processing in an easy, plug and play way positions Open to be one of the top ICOs of 2018. Open Platform receives of 7.75 out of 10.   original: https://hacked.com/ico-analysis-openplatform-open/",False

There were some state ministers who expressed some objections to such an industry getting a foothold in the country but there were also who came out in support. There was no clear pronouncement yet from Putin on this matter though his language is more inclined to the opening of the Russian market for cryptocurrency. We have to remember that there are many Russians already into the ICO market one site is estimating that 10% of the ICO market is cornered by the Russians.  Russia can be a great addition to the available market for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency and once this can be open there would be more explosive growth in there. The county is now also preparing to absorb an influx of miners who are getting out of China and since Russia has the available power supply for mining then this can be a symbiosis relationship. OpenMoney must then be including Russia in its plans especially for expansion.,False

E have to remember that the SEC in this side of the world can be so powerful as they can just close any program anytime by just merely calling the project proponents and order for any entity to refund the participants of their money.  This is one reason why we should be glad that OpenMoney is really taking the time and do all they can so that they can't be categorized as issuing security but tokens according to the two tests talked about in that medium article. Since ICO is still a new type of a platform there will always be confusion as to many definitions related to legalities and I am hoping that soon a clearly defined regulatory framework can be established to deal with this issue once and for all.,False

This is a perfect example of the primary issues that are faced when preparing the blockchain for the mass market. To fully realize its potential, the the platform needs to have faster transaction flow while maintaining its decentralized state.  Right now, the volume of transactions that can be processed on the blockchain at any given point of time is slow, whereas Visa can process around 50,000 transactions per second, Bitcoin can only take about 3 per second, and Ethereum can take about 15 per second.   When we consider that Visa accounts for 150 million transactions per day on its own, the need for change is clear.

We take the roadblocks to consumer adoption very seriously, so naturally we asked the question: what’s missing for the would-be cryptocurrency consumer?  Aside from the obvious – you can’t yet use cryptocurrency in conventional applications or on most existing websites as a form of payment, something we are actively solving – the thing that struck us as much-needed are receipts. Where are they?  As it stands, it’s convoluted at best and impossible at worst to produce an actual receipt for a cryptocurrency transaction. Outside of using a service like ethscan or blokchchain.info to prove a transaction occurred between digital wallets (and even this isn’t a complete solve), it’s pretty hard for the average person to prove they sent payment to a specific person for a specific thing, and conversely pretty difficult to prove the opposite.  That’s why we’ve created the OPEN State – an immutable, irrefutable, permanent receipt that lives on the blockchain. It can handle any type of payment transaction you can imagine, from movie tickets to subscription services and more. And, since its backed by the blockchain, it’s a receipt you can’t lose or alter. Not only is this great for cryptocurrency adoption, it’s great for businesses and consumers at large.  For more information, check out our white paper!",False

These do not fit with the way that trustless networks work. For a trustless network to be sure that information or a transaction is real, it must validate that transaction with other nodes. This means that each transaction on a trustless network is many times more expensive than one that is off-chain.  The general rule of thumb for decentralized networks like blockchain is that: - Computations are much more expensive - Storage is much more expensive  In the future, even as decentralized technology expands its grasp it is necessary to look at the blockchain for what it is great at: getting trustless networks to come to a consensus. On-chain aspects can provide security, but that does not mean that every operation should be broadcast to and be done on the blockchain.  That is why the OPEN Platform is so essential. We provide a seamless path for merging the on-chain and off-chain aspects of software applications while leveraging the strengths of each.  Want more information? Check out our white paper!",False

There is nothing wrong with utilizing a database for what it's meant to do, and helps to keep only components of an application that can truly benefit from being decentralized on-chain.  On-Chain - Relying on what blockchains are good at now, on-chain components of an application could very well just focus on payments, ownership of digital assets, game assets bought with cryptocurrency, and authorization/verification that you indeed bought x item to interact with smart contracts that are part of application.

This enables on-chain interactions of large volume databases/tables/user information whatever the requirement or scenario is.   Scalability and volume are elements that are done very well off-chain and will be done better off-chain then on-chain for a long time to come. That's why we're a little skeptic when we see some projects or ideas that indicate they are able to achieve X on-chain, whereas in reality that infrastructure is just not there. Currently the perspective is to not think of off-chain components related/replacements of decentralized architectures  but more so to let off-chain architecture handle what it does best and think of decentralized or on-chain technologies to Enable new features outside of how a DB would behave for instance.  the OPEN API enables developers to function much like the Stripe API (Where we enable propagation between on/off chain and also simplify it at the same time, think of Twilio API and Send Grid API, making complicated technologies simple for developers to use in a flexible modular approach.)

Here's a quick comment that you can reflect on!  The OPEN State is a new type of token interface that serves as a proof-of-ownership. It can be made uniquely tied to an individual to save a state granted by a central entity. Essentially, it can be said to act as a decentralized receipt.  The OPEN State is created in the Scaffold. Since each Scaffold can have a unique implementation of the OPEN State, it makes sense for OPEN States to have different attributes and functionalities. This gives a larger amount of flexibility in terms of what the OPEN State can do and represent.",False

Developers use it to primarily activate Scaffolds. This is done by staking OPENtoken for a set period of time. The developer is free to leave it in the Scaffold or close the Scaffold and retrieve the tokens. As the value of OPENToken will change due to the market, the value may be greater than when entered. In this case, a small percentage of this gain will be distributed evenly to members of the community with a positive OPENToken balance. The original value of the token and remainder of the gain will return to the developer. The tokens are simply returned to the developer if the value remains the same or has dropped. The token ultimately provides great utility for Developers to access and integrate cryptocurrency into their existing applications. In addition, the staking of the Token also encourages the use of the Platform and benefits members of the community, helping to establish a fruitful OPEN ecosystem. Future implementation in the token may include a premium when OPEN Token is used as the currency in the transaction. Read more about it in our whitepaper! http://go.openmoney.digital/obmtwp",False

What if there was a way to bypass all of those centralized entities, immediately accept and process payment in a multitude of currencies including crypto, and update the application database accordingly? This is what OPEN Platform accomplishes by bringing a decentralized solution to the developer. By connecting the developer’s centralized database to the blockchain, they can avoid the centralized payment structure that causes delay and fees, but also without completely altering their existing backend. OPEN’s solution is easily implemented and modular, taking the best parts of a decentralized approach and leaving the strength of existing centralized databases for developers.

A lot of you have been asking - What is the OPEN API? What does it do? Simply put, the OPEN API connects a complex centralized application database with both the blockchain and the user. Since it’s built upon existing infrastructure, it is easy to apply in any environment wiithout requiring the developer to complete any significant changes. The API provides an application layer for the user and developer to interact with the Scaffold smart contracts. Developers use the API to create their Scaffolds and receive payments from them. Users are able to pay the Scaffolds through the API. Lastly, the contractor may close out their Scaffold with the API, recovering their staked Tokens. The API unlocks the capabilities of our blockchain solution, providing convenience for both the Developer and the User.

In this example, we will go over a very brief explanation of how it is planned.  A dating app’s developer offers users an option to upgrade to a premium membership. They will implement the OPEN Platform to have faster access to funds, including cryptocurrency.  1. The developer creates a Scaffold for his dating app. The Scaffold is customized for his premium subscription model using OPEN Platform’s API. 2. The Scaffold is activated using OPEN Token. 3. Joe is having no luck dating lately and wishes to become a premium subscriber and using his OPEN Wallet, sends crypto of his choice to the Scaffold (enabled through the OPEN API) 4. The Scaffold receives the funds, checks all the properties of the transaction and when all parameters are satisfied, automatically sends the cryptocurrency to the developer as well as provides Joe with an OPEN_State as having paid for a premium membership. 5. The applicaiton’s database verifies that Joe has paid for the premium membership and Joe is granted the premium membership. 6. Joe finds and marries the love of his life! (They later have 6 kids and get a divorce, but that's a different story)  This was a very simplified version of a use case.

The OPEN Platform enables users and developers of mainstream apps to use and accept cryptocurrency while avoiding restrictions imposed by current payment infrastrucftures. The platform provides a technology stack that addresses the problems developers face for in-app purchases. These problems include centralized merchant entities that charge fees for their service and long wait periods to access the funds. The OPEN platform solution solves these problems by utilizing the blockchain and bridging the gap between users, the developer and the application database. This is done through Scaffolds, an intelligent solution for storing data on the blockchain. There is no need to flood the ecosystem with a multitiude of tokens for various in-app items as this would lead to unnecessary complexity.Now there is truly a way for decentralized payment in addition to accepting cryptocurrency in mainstream applications. By providing open source tools and a utility token for this technology stack, we encourage adoption and invovlement in the OPEN ecosystem. Other benefits of the OPEN platform include being easy to implement with very little re-work of existing applications and redistribution of gains after staking a token to token holders.  Please read more about all of OPEN platform's features in the whitepaper! http://go.openmoney.digital/obmtwp",False

Unlike other ICO projects whose tokens are only there for decorations, OpenMoney's OPENToken is really serving a purpose and the company itself is making sure that there would be a big demand for it. This will put more value into the token which can somehow influence its price positively.  In trusting our hard-earned money, it is so important to determine of the project has really a good future and can be viable.

What is a scaffold and how does it work?  One of the unique aspects of our solution for developers to accept cryptocurrency for their in-app purchases is the Scaffold. The Scaffold is a smart contract that bridges the gap between the developer’s database and the user. They can be created through our API and customized to suit the developer. Each Scaffold is created for a specific in-app purchase. When payment is sent from the user to the Scaffold, the Scaffold automatically transfers payment to the user and returns to the User a State that represents the purchase. For example, a Scaffold can be customized to issue subscriber status for a customer. The Scaffold will ultimately accept cryptocurrency from the user, provide the user with a subscriber state, and immediately send payment to the developer. No more lag time for developers to accept payment! The scaffold is very modular and can be implemented with minimal modifications to their application. The OPEN API makes this a seamless and simple operation. Find in depth details and use cases regarding the Scaffold system in our whitepaper!

I can sense that these people are really serious on the things they do and they are certain that building a loyal and strong community can be a very essential element for success. Sometimes it can all be community and when you coupled that with experts at the helm and an idea whose time has come...it would really be explosive.  The main idea here is using a very popular medium (an app) to push the use of cryptocurrency to the mainstream market. Getting there may not be that really easy as we would be fighting for the attention of the intended market but if we can provide them irresistible incentives to join OpenMoney then it can be a big boost. The whole community can be a big help in pushing the adoption of the infrastructure to be provided by OpenMoney.
