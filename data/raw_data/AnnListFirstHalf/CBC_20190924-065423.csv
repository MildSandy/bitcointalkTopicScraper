The CashBet team are all still here, working hard on the world's ONLY complete, crypto-ready iGaming platform.  NO team members have received any tokens yet as we are all locked up for several months and will receive our tokens over 18 months.  CashBet has just signed a major co-marketing deal with CryptoMillionsLotto.  They will be live, accepting around the end of July.  I will be in front of the Isle of Man Gambling Supervision Commission in late July to accept the first tier-1 crypto casino license.  Shortly after this, we will take the first wagers using CBC.  On August 1st, we intend to be one of the first operators to submit an application to Loterie Inspektion for a Swedish Gambling license under the new regime expected to go live on January 1, 2019.  Please stop spreading false information.  I'm sorry about the bear market in crypto.  CBC will ultimately be measured against the success of the company.  I am still here, hard at work on making CashBet successful.  No one from the team has sold ANY tokens yet because we have not received any.  The price of CBC will ultimately reflect the hard work we're doing.  Be patient and HODL.  Mike Reaves CEO & Co-Founder CashBet",False

These jurisdictions impose a high level of oversight to ensure a superior player experience that is both fun and responsible. Our UKGC license covers crypto gambling and allows us to operate a remote casino. You can read more about that here (http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/for-the-public/Safer-gambling/Consumer-guides/Gambling-with-digital-and-virtual-currencies.aspx). We are also in process to obtain an Isle of Man license, which will also cover crypto gambling.  The following areas are restricted from real-money gambling on our platform: Belgium, Bulgaria, China, Denmark, Estonia, France and French Territories, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Italy, Philippines, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, United States of America, US Minor Outlying Areas, US Virgin Islands, Syria, Iran, North Korea.  However, it's important to note that in addition to its utility for legal online gambling, CashBet Coin can also be used to make purchases in non-gambling social casinos.  For instance, CashBet has recently struck and agreement with game provider Greentube, to allow CashBet Coin to be used as a payment method on their Gametwist non-gambling sites. In this way, CashBet Coin will be able to be used worldwide across social casinos.",False

I want U to solve the huge problem that happened with bounty participants for Twitter campaign of Ur project! Bounty manager HUA_HUI has CHEATED ON US!  Let me explain u the whole situation (:  The total amount of twitter participants is 576. Firstly, he gave only 100$ for everyone (who has done all 3 weeks). It means that hua_hui has given only about 50k USD from promised UP to 150k USD for all of us. (where's other 100k USD?) But if we calculate the average reward we'll get the next: 150000/576=260$ for everyone. 100 is much less than 260$ Secondly, when we started arguing with hua_hui he added 25$ to everyone and we got 125$ lol Thirdly, the main issue... hua_hui said that he had predicted us on bounty thread on bitcointalk about his ""fixes"" that depends on a number of bounty participants (U can read it here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3283716.msg34244252#msg34244252) BUT IT'S A BIG LIE! And I can provide u with the proof that he added that message not long ago!  Go to google.com, write ""cashbet bounty"" in the search line. Then open the saved copy of bounty thread (by clicking green triangle, I bet U know it lol). U can see the saved cope from 1st of Maye and there is no ""prediction"" about twitter fixes at all. There are two separate messages titled ""reserved 1"" and ""reserved 2"".  We don't feel hua_hui's attempt to cheat on us and our completed work. Please, solve this problem!

Short answer: The twitter is allocated UP to $150,000. That does not means that the whole $150,000 would be paid out. The breakdown is as follows. $50,000 for less than 1000 participants. $100,000 for 1000 to 2000 participants. $150,000 for more than 2000 participants. Since we have less than 1000 participants, the total payout will be $50,000. It is in the 3rd post of the thread.  Full story: The twitter bounty allocation is up to $150,000. The $150,000 is meant for a 9 weeks twitter campaign but due to the regulation of necessarity of kyc, the bounty was delayed and when we have official confirmation of the procedure with the bounty participants, it ended up to be only a 3 weeks campaign. Nevertheless, the team still wish to reserve the whole pool for the twitter campaign and signature campaign. However, as twitter is a staking method, it would not be fair to signature campaign based on the amount of work done. As a result, we will have different tiers on the payout. $50,000 for less than 1000 participants. $100,000 for 1000 to 2000 participants. $150,000 for more than 2000 participants.    Please be assured that the allocated but yet to be given out tokens will not be kept by the team and will be used for more promotional activities so that the bounty participants can be involved. The details of the further promotions/bounty are still in discussion at the moment and more news will be announced. On top of these, we also concluded our telegram bounties i.e. airdrop and article sharing campaigns especially for the telegram bounty participants.""",False

CashBet Coin may be used in the following ways: White label platform partners will be encouraged, in the form of rate reductions, to use CBC to pay licensing and maintenance fees to CashBet.  T  CBC  may be used by other iGaming operators (social or real-money) as a deposit, payment, and withdrawal mechanism. In this way, CBC has a similar (but enhanced) utility to any other payment mechanism.  Content distribution partners will likewise be incentivized (in the form of lower rates) to use CBC to pay licensing fees to CashBet.  Casinos incorporating games from CryptoRGS will be required to offer deposit and wagering in CBC. CBC tokens may be granted to players as a reward for referring friends.  Players who hold a certain number of eligible CBC tokens will be offered CBC VIP status in exchange for executing a time-locked contract, sequestering the tokens in the players’ wallet so that they may neither be spent nor otherwise traded. This VIP management feature will be licensed to other operators who may accept CBC for purchase or deposit, allowing them to manage their own CBC-based VIP programs.  Here is a short video explaining what CBC is all about: https://youtu.be/aDlVaoMX--g    Hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions!",False

CashBet Coin is a utility token which provides concrete value and advantages to owners as well as CashBet casino partners and players.  CashBet Coin may be used in the following ways: White label platform partners will be encouraged, in the form of rate reductions, to use CBC to pay licensing and maintenance fees to CashBet.   CBC  may be used by other iGaming operators (social or real-money) as a deposit, payment, and withdrawal mechanism. In this way, CBC has a similar (but enhanced) utility to any other payment mechanism. Content distribution partners will likewise be incentivized (in the form of lower rates) to use CBC to pay licensing fees to CashBet.  Casinos incorporating games from CryptoRGS will be required to offer deposit and wagering in CBC.  CBC tokens may be granted to players as a reward for referring friends.  Lastly, players who hold a certain number of eligible CBC tokens will be offered CBC VIP status in exchange for executing a time-locked contract, sequestering the tokens in the players’ wallet so that they may neither be spent nor otherwise traded. This VIP management feature will be licensed to other operators who may accept CBC for purchase or deposit, allowing them to manage their own CBC-based VIP programs.  Hope this helps!",False

The activity of the CashBet platform is controlled by leading regulatory bodies. CashBet adheres to the highest standards ethics and openness. Cashbet the platform is licensed for certain activities pertaining to their regulatory function in the UK and Alderney. What people don't seem to get is that they have EXACTLY the same legal status in gaming as any other crypto casino or sportsbook because crypto IS NOT regulated in those jurisdictions. Jesus wept and you guys are willing to plonk money into this and don't understand the basics of gaming regulations? Fools > money > adios. Forgive me, but I don't understand, do you deny what is written in white paper? Or I don't understand something in the principles of CashBet's work? Hi TH. Cashbet refer to their original business as having legitimacy with a license for REGULATED gambling activity but are heavily leaning on that premise without actually saying that they are licensed for crypto-gambling because they are not. Alderney and the UK DO not allow crypto betting in any form with their licensing. Most crypto betting sites are blocked within the UK, for example. Every single gambling ICO will face exactly the same issue regarding regulation and there is no current format or structure to this. The EU and the UK in the last week have both basically said they want regulation of crypto's to happen and if that happens you can't be both regulated and offer a global gambling product, its completely illogical. Regulation is the concept of centralisation and licensing to a countries particular guidelines. I am looking forward to all these class action law suits that will be brought against people like Cashbet in the future.  CashBet is fully licenced by the world’s most reputable online gaming jurisdictions: the Alderney Gambling Control Commission (AGCC licence numbers 116c1 & 116c2) and the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC licence number 39620).  These jurisdictions impose a high level of oversight to ensure a superior player experience that is both fun and responsible. We are in the final stages of licensing thru the Isle Of Man which accepts cryptocurrency wagering.

Cashbet refer to their original business as having legitimacy with a license for REGULATED gambling activity but are heavily leaning on that premise without actually saying that they are licensed for crypto-gambling because they are not. Alderney and the UK DO not allow crypto betting in any form with their licensing. Most crypto betting sites are blocked within the UK, for example. Every single gambling ICO will face exactly the same issue regarding regulation and there is no current format or structure to this. The EU and the UK in the last week have both basically said they want regulation of crypto's to happen and if that happens you can't be both regulated and offer a global gambling product, its completely illogical. Regulation is the concept of centralisation and licensing to a countries particular guidelines. I am looking forward to all these class action law suits that will be brought against people like Cashbet in the future.",False

It is not. Both Alderney and the UK gaming commissions, which cashbet hold their regulated licenses under DO NOT allow crypto-gambling or any ICO's to be associated with their licenses. There is currently only one license, Gibraltar, that would allow any DLT (distributed ledger) to be allowed under their structure. Cashbet are suggesting that they will build and offer services to the rest of the non-licensed crypto space. They will have NO license to supply these entities because no gaming license they hold allows this to occur. So lets envisage it:  1. cashbet does its ICO 2. It raises investment for its coin 3. it starts to build services for the crypto gaming and casino space 4. those 40+ providers they currently have their regulated platform will not be available on this new platform (go ahead and actually ask them this) because those providers of slots and casino's also themselves have to adhere to regulation in the distribution of these games and don't touch crypto platforms (go into the gambling chat area and ask about when providers are not available or actually sometimes geo-blocked from crypto users) 5. Alderney and UK gaming commission say to Cashbet ""hey you hold licenses with us but we have no regulated crypto so supplying this area and promoting gambling of unlicensed crypto gaming sites is illegal in our jurisdiction. Stop or we will take away your license."" 6. They have a thriving business already so won't jeopardise that so will ditch the cashbet coin 7. As an investor you have literally no recourse legally as its an unregulated asset class in the UK. 8. Congrats you pissed your bitcoin against the wall.   ",False

(If anyone, by chance, has bought coins based on me being on the team, can get a refund, if desired)  As always, investors should have just the raw facts, and should decide for themselves This ICO is for CashBet Coin (CBC), which is a fully premined erc20 token. This coin has no independent entity or value. The value of CBC is totally dependent on the centralized CashBet company to follow through on promises. The good news is that CashBet company is legit and is not a scam. As an investor, you can look at it like a stock in the company, only w/o the voting rights. The more revenue the company has, the more CBC will be burned. At launch, the token will have the utility of being used to join a ""VIP program"". This would make the token useful for those investors who wish to play real-money slot machines on their cell phones. As with all ICOs, there is a real risk of direct loss of coins (eth, btc) from a social hack. ICOs should be providing audits of proper private-key security. CashBet is a user of the Ethereum blockchain and erc20 standard. They are utilizing blockchain to raise money, instead of using traditional VC funding. They are following all laws, and require all US investors to be accredited and all investors go through KYC, even though CBC is a utility token and not a security.  edit - Full disclosure: I am supposed to receive some CBC, somewhere between 1000 and 10,000 coins total.",False

Makes any sense to literally anyone to invest in this? Surely not. The owning business is in the USA, i'd like to see them take one solitary bet officially through this platform in the States - just one spin of a casino reel - in order to prove that they will be ok from their own piece-of-mind to break US law for this business to be successful. The entire gambling industry is currently spending billions to lobby the US federal government to allow gambling and somehow cashbet - who clearly understand from their own business model in Europe that they need to be regulated - think they can skip past this? No, of course they don't think that. They basically expect mugs with little knowledge or oversight of the intricacies of gambling and its legalities to invest in this ""gold-rush"" scheme. The biggest online casino market on earth is China and they are nailing crypto's to wall at the moment so and with the US market not being touched why would you bother investing in a scheme where the founders would not dare touch any regulated, licensed or banned countries with their platform, as they would actually be in contravention of their own licensing laws. I am actually going to take this up with the Alderney Gambling commission where Cashbet holds its licensing as I am quite sure by promoting non-licensed gambling they are in breach of their terms of holding that license. Guys, wake up and smell the coffee Cashbet are looking for a quick buck from us. Projects like Gnosis and Augur have tremendous merit but this is an utter sham.

Is it possible to support the goals and potential of blockchain, yet comply with laws at the same time  [/quote]  This is factually untrue. For this venture Cashbet IS NOT regulated AT ALL and is actually grossly in contravention of its Alderney and UK gaming license terms to be promoting any forms of gambling that are not regulated. They are regulated for casino gaming for FIAT currencies only. Any illusion to the fact that their licensed entity in Alderney or UK has any bearing to their ICO is 1. false advertising and as i've said before 2. a breach of their licensing terms in both jurisdictions. You can't play both sides of the fence on this one; you can't promote decentralised, unregulated blockchain gambling whilst in fact holding centralised, regulated licenses in order to undertake that. It is 1, completely illogical and 2, Cashbet runs the risk of losing their licensing in both territories as a consequence. Would these guys throw away their core business if the regulators demanded that they stopped promoting what they considered to be ""illegal gambling"" by their local governance terms? I don't think so therefore this project has very little merit and is literally just a cash grab by cashbet. The business model makes no sense whatsoever going by the terms and conditions the company has to work under. I expect the UKGC to at least write to cashbet to inform them of their terms of holding a license. Acknowledgment of either licenses in this ICO is illegal under their licensing terms also.
