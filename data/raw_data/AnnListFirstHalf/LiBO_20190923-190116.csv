Using Blockchain technology, the Liquid Bonus Medium eliminates most frictions preventing instant use of rewards and other customer benefits by introducing the interoperable Liquid Bonus (LiBO) reward tokens in combination with online marketplace having location-based (LBS) capability.  Being used as a single unified rewarding mean inside the decentralized borderless international environment, Liquid Bonus tokens shall play a role of the high-grade fuel for the next generation global loyalty and rewards ecosystem.  «3Data sourcing» TECHNIQUE  The Liquid Bonus ecosystem will accept, consolidate and present in an optimized form the following geo targeted data:   •   OFFERS FROM BRANDS AND SUPPLIERS - scheduled promotions and daily offers from manufacturers and suppliers. Recently, brands are increasingly active in the establishing direct contacts with consumers, so this communication channel is seen as no less important than retail;  •   OFFERS FROM SHOPS AND RETAIL NETWORKS - promotion campaigns and daily offers of single shops and retail networks are facing constant communication need for efficient delivery of their actual proposals to the target audience. We consider the notion of ""target audience"" not just as a usual classification of buyers, but rather as their current location. Indeed, targeting location to a country or city can’t answer the actual consumer needs due to the complex logistics in urban areas. Most potential buyers will likely reject to cross a city for catching some discounts. The only exception is seasonal sales with significant discounts but the majority of daily purchases made in the ""here and now"" mode. That is, in order to achieve higher effectiveness of sales promotions, retailer should be capable of establishing communication channel not just with visitors, but also with all potential buyers located close enough to be hooked by the offer. The era of developed information technologies and mobile communications makes it possible to replace all barkers screaming about local sale with an automated means of Liquid Bonus aggregating loyalty and discount offers and distributing related information to consumers located in the immediate vicinity of the point of sale.  •   CONSUMER FEEDBACKS - the main focus here is on aggregating information from consumers, primarily in the form of cash-desk receipts, uploaded into the system through the Liquid Bonus wallet application. In addition to the social component («being happy with a good daily deal, don’t hesitate helping others to get it and next time they will help you»), as an incentive for submitting receipt to the Liquid Bonus medium, the LiBO token «thank you drop» shall be automatically transferred from the system to the consumer’s wallet.    ----- yours, Liqbo.com ---   Telegram Channel (@LiquidBonus)  Telegram Group (@LiqBo_SUPPORT)  Twitter (@Liquid_Bonus)   Facebook (@LiquidBonus) Medium (@LiquidBonus) Youtube Channel   Reddit =========     STARTS 18 FEBRUARY 2018  =========  Liquid Bonus Loyalty ICO   =========  ENDS 30 APRIL 2018   ========= THE FIRST GLOBAL DECENTRALIZED INTEROPERABLE LOYALTY MEDIUM SOLUTION BASED ON STATE-OF-THE-ART SIDECHAIN WITH 2-WAY PEG",False

Soft Cap is established on the basis of our vision concerning the cost of developing and testing of the core system and mobile wallet with a minimum functionality allowing us to integrate 2-3 Loyalty Nodes belonging to early adopters from retail community and carry out pilot operation. If we will fail to accumulate an appropriate funding during this ICO, it may be extended or interrupted depending on visible ICO perspectives and (or) alternative funding options which may appear to that date.  In case of insufficient funding raised through ICO, we reserve the right to cancel the issuance of ERC20 tokens thus the entire volume of LiBO tokens shall be issued inside the Liquid Bonus Blockchain. In the latter case, we will discuss with every contributor and accept individual decision whether to return funds or distribute Liquid Bonus tokens which will be incompatible with the ERC20 format.

ONLY TRUE INDUSTRY EXPERTS HAVING LONG-TERM EXPERIENCE     The Liquid Bonus® Loyalty is announcing its first Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in order to grow and develop its business worldwide.   The Liquid Bonus® Loyalty is a global business targeting the loyalty and discount industry, eliminating country borders to serve retail customers around the world. With a successful proof-of-concept already in place and a number of essential partnerships underway, Liquid Bonus® Loyalty is announcing its first Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in order to grow and develop its business worldwide. This PRE-ICO expires on March 18, 2018.   The modern loyalty and discount market is looking like a global mobile communications ecosystem having no automatic roaming. All brands and retailers offer closed-in programs that are absolutely incompatible with each other. Consumer is no longer able to master such extensive offer even at the regional level. Coalition programs, aimed to minimize this friction by unifying of user interface and widening loyalty borders, cope with this role only in part. Despite the coalition programs boom in recent years and popularity of such business model, coalitions have not been able to carry out the task of loyalty decentralization and simplifying access to a variety of offers from different brands and retail networks. This has been clearly shown by the following recent study: Bond Brand Loyalty Report ‘2017 called «THE BATTLE FOR LOVE & LOYALTY» (in collaboration with VISA) stating “MEMBERSHIPS ARE UP, WHILE MEMBER ENGAGEMENT IS AT CAPACITY”.  They add, ""The cumulative points liability for all U.S. Programs is estimated to be valued at roughly $100 billion."" This shows a tremendous market potential which Liquid Bonus Loyalty aims to address with its original blockchain solution answering retailers' demand for fast transactions. For further questions about Liquid Bonus Loyalty offerings or features, please visit www.liqbo.com or search Internet for Liquid Bonus.   The Liquid Bonus® Loyalty is a global, decentralized intermediary working to facilitate existing loyalty and discount programs, by:  •   Overcoming the growing pains caused by the inability for customers to manage effectively more than 5-7 loyalty subscriptions; •   Developing a smart way to get rid of excessive liability caused from expiring proprietary loyalty points by converting them into interoperable LiqBo® tokens; •   Uniting loyalty and reward programs into a distributed, secure and unified medium; •   Allowing instant transfers of proprietary bonus points to interoperable LiqBo® tokens, and back, for an optional loyalty providers' conversion fee; •   Enforcing strict anonymity of all loyalty providers' data; •   Providing the highest level of security to protect transactions and data; •   Providing a common user-friendly mobile interface for every participating loyalty program.  All of these valuable features have been combined in one system, using the modern blockchain approach, while responding to retailer’s demands for fast transaction throughput. The use of state-of-the-art “SIDECHAIN with 2-WAY PEG” implementation means that the Liquid Bonus® Loyalty solution is a main contender for becoming the loyalty application of the future.  The unique Liquid Bonus® Loyalty tool for end-users fulfills all major social and reward needs of retail customers. With its comprehensive functionality and user-friendly mobile interface, it presents valuable advantages over other loyalty applications for retail users.  Join The Liquid Bonus Token Sale! CURRENT MAX BONUS: 50%  THE TOTAL TOKEN SUPPLY IS FIXED AT 1 billion (1 000 000 000) LiqBo Tokens of which  480 000 000 (48% equivalent 32 000 ETH) available in tokensale 370 000 000 (37%) reserved for internal use by the decentralized loyalty ecosystem and shall be imported into the hi-speed Liquid Bonus Loyalty blockchain at commercial launch (these tokens shall not be traded as ERC20) just 150 000 000 (15%) reserved for the team and advisers  Initial coin offering is in ERC20 format We accept ETH for LiqBo and (!) other currency on demand (!)

Every program shall bear the costs for the creation and deployment together with operation, which will never allow making loyalty systems a truly mass product, affordable for smaller market players.  Expiration of points — an extremely unpopular measure that hurts service expansion, but this is inevitable for every retailer at least until there is an alternative way of limiting deferred liabilities.  E-cash and card transactions help to simplify the presentation of privileges to consumers and redemption process, but transition to cashback inevitably leads to the loss of the loyalty “game” with consumers, thus loosing the key success factor of any loyalty program. Banks and payment systems are in love with cashback, but is it so useful to retailers !?  Mastering cashback as a replacement of bonus points leads to direct competition between retailers which, instead of paying-back for their investments in loyalty programs, throw their marginality into the furnace of price wars    CONSUMER LIMITATIONS restrain the evolution no less than the factors described above  The relentless pressure of program proposals has already led to loyalty market saturation — to such an extent that it affected the ability of consumers to effectively use their subscribed programs.  The complexity of signing-in and adaptation is due not so much to the complexity of working with a single program, as to the problems faced by a consumer who has to repeatedly go through the same procedures  Control — it is already impossible for average consumer to effectively accumulate and timely reward bonus points of numerous loyalty programs    If the current trend will not change very soon, and the number of proprietary centralized loyalty and discount programs will continue to grow at the same pace, then the percentage of active users will drop down to 30% by 2020.  This will cast a doubt on the feasibility of creating new legacy loyalty programs.      Comments to the basic set of properties necessary for making possible the decentralization of loyalty ecosystem:  Any customer-specific data, business algorithms and methods, as well as operating conditions of existing loyalty programs should remain confidential in case of their joining the global decentralized loyalty ecosystem;  Economic viability and unification are also the determining factors of success.  It is essential that the consumer abstraction from numerous proprietary loyalty interfaces is not proclaimed mandatory, but it will be a rescue for those consumers who have already accumulated so much fatigue that they are potentially ready to ignore any other loyalty proposals.   https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-hjC_morlSdpHmAJLkvEGw.jpeg  LIQUID BONUS® — is an independent, universal and compatible instrument allowing to minimize or compensate the most of the friction and problems inherent in existing centralized loyalty systems.  Every Interface (Gateway) between the existing legacy loyalty programs and external decentralized Liquid Bonus® ecosystem will be fully controlled and operated by an appropriate participating program, which will be able to setup and change input/withdrawal transaction fee and other condition(s) if and when necessary.  Direct use of Liquid Bonus® tokens shall make it possible to increase the customers involvement in the loyalty ecosystem. This applies consumers who can more effectively manage the accumulation and redemption of privileges through the unified compatible user interface, as well as suppliers and smaller retailers unable to setup and operate legacy loyalty system.      The global ecosystem of loyalty without the intermediary Liquid Bonus® infrastructure is looking like the global cellular communication ecosystem before the introduction of automatic roaming service. At that time, all mobile network operators worked autonomously, providing communication services solely to their regional subscribers. Some of them have later managed to sign direct agreements with other operators thus only covered subscribers were benefitting from a manual roaming service (roaming by prior application). In fact, such transitional business model is very similar to the modern loyalty coalitions that do not eliminate the main friction of centralized systems thus remaining “local” by either geographical or business feature.    The global ecosystem of loyalty having the intermediary Liquid Bonus® infrastructure shall be very similar to the modern mobile ecosystem having an automatic roaming service as unified and transparent service. Indeed, when going to another country, we never think of which mobile operator provides communication service. But it often happens that subscribers connect & call through competitive network, operated by a company which is in direct competition to the home network operator. Nevertheless, this seemingly ambiguous situation does not prevent subscribers from getting the telco service & paying for it, and at the end of the day, it turns to be not so ambiguous for mobile operators profiting from a seemingly contradictory business.   https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sPl0EwCTFGbeFocPeSI17Q.jpeg  Blockchain was chosen as core technology for implementing a decentralized loyalty ecosystem, not as a tribute to fashion, but primarily as a  -technology that enables trust to a lot of non-trusting Parties and doing it without a trusted Arbitrator who must have 100% confidence of all participants.  -open technology, allowing to ensure confidentiality to every participating Party (otherwise regulators would never blame crypto-currencies for non-transparency of participants)  technology that has an excellent properties for multiple peers and communities     Organization of the global Liquid Bonus® ecosystem in terms of its operation and development should be implemented as an Association of Participants. All decisions will be made on the basis of consensus. By the way, this method of decision-making process has been built in our blockchain software as an algorithm.  After its commercial launch, the global, decentralized, compatible blockchain Liquid Bonus® Loyalty system will be operated and developed by its associate members.    I have got the following questions at the conference: “Which role the developer of the system sees in its operation and further development? and Where is your commercial benefit from the creation of this Liquid Bonus® Loyalty ecosystem?”  Currently FINSTICK Innovations bears the whole burden of financing the development of the Liquid Bonus® Loyalty ecosystem. We intend to return our investment through the initial LiqBo tokens offering (the further issuance of LiqBo tokens will be carried by Participants on the basis of consensus). In addition to it, FINSTICK Innovations intend to remain a part of the Liquid Bonus® Association by operating one of the Liquid Bonus® Core Nodes (thus entitled for getting a proportional part of operating fees). We also intend sell technical consulting and system integration services which are among FINSTICK Innovations core business activities.  Currently, the valuable stake of the pre-mined LiqBo tokens is already being offered to investors and companies that are interested in early participation, including the process of integration, pilot and launch of the decentralized Liquid Bonus® Loyalty ecosystem",False

The rapid development of mobile devices and networks has led to an unprecedented consumer awareness strengthening the status of this party dictating market rules. More and more trading procedures are being transferred from offline to online. Supply chains and consumer product distribution are being adjusted to the dominant online processes too. Retail has actively joined the technological race. From mastering simple IT solutions focused on WEB interface and automating existing business processes (primarily CRM), it has moved to a truly knowledge-intensive sectors of the IT economy, such as big data and the artificial intelligence. Taking into account the universal desire of cost reduction by further improving the concept of self-service in still common offline stores, it is difficult to overestimate the importance of such projects. 2018 shall not make revolution in the development of retail industry. Nevertheless, it will definitely be remembered as a year of adaptation to the new consumer-centric conditions and rules of making retail business.  2018 will be the year of  Showing reduction of the lower and middle level stuff of the offline retailers. The steady sales and business automation along with the progressive introduction of artificial intelligence shall inevitably affect the corporate HR policy and lead to a revision of staffing. This year, computers will continue to actively replace humans at customer service and call centers, legal and financial departments, as well as at offline retail outlets.  Mass introduction of proactive sales model, which will become the key success factor for business development. The leading retail market positions will be successfully taken and consolidated by those players who will be the first to master and use emerging applications based on artificial intelligence and big data. Automated proactive sales will ensure both — the demand forecasting process based on big data analysis and automation of consumer motivation algorithms. Therefore, stories like the one happened to the American teenage girl, whose father found out that she was pregnant later than the retail network offered goods for newborns, shall finally move to the category of everyday in 2018.  Decentralization of loyalty and discount programs. According to a perennial market research, the trend of loyalty market saturation has been confirmed last year. Bond Brand Loyalty Report ‘2017 called «THE BATTLE FOR LOVE & LOYALTY» (in collaboration with VISA) concludes “MEMBERSHIPS ARE UP, WHILE MEMBER ENGAGEMENT IS AT CAPACITY”. In fact, the situation is even worse, since their figures show slight decline instead of stagnation. The number of active memberships have declined from the average 7.8 active memberships per user out of 10,9 (72%) in 2014 down to 6.7 active memberships out of 14.3 (just 47%) in 2017. “Since our 2014 study, the average number of Program memberships per American consumer has increased steadily from under 11 Programs to over 14. Meanwhile, the number of Programs in which Members are active, meaning they have earned or burned Program benefits or rewards, is virtually unchanged at just under 6.7 (47%). This suggests that Americans are willing to enroll in additional Programs, yet their capacity to engage has reached a threshold.” — concludes the report  Thus, in order to overcome this negative trend, retailers and loyalty providers will have to start reviewing their loyalty strategy this year. Indeed, all existing centralized loyalty programs are complicated and costly, especially those having inhouse issuance and redemption process in combination with customized compensation scenarios and proper security level of loyalty transactions. At the same time they hardly reach compatibility with other loyalty systems which can be achieved through regional or industrial coalitions. 2018 shall bring new initiatives and solutions aimed for uniting diverse loyalty programs into a single, decentralized ecosystem which will guarantee proper confidentiality and respected interests of every participating Party. This shall give a fresh impetus to the loyalty market development by expanding it to a new global level. Moreover, decentralization will be able to spare loyalty programs from highly unpopular measures aimed at limiting the amount of deferred liabilities such as proprietary points and miles. An external decentralized intermediary system shall allow consumers to keep their bonuses, thanks to withdrawal option which can be used prior to expiration of proprietary points and miles. Thus the surplus of corporate liabilities caused by constant bonus issuance process will be additionally compensated by this option enabled with decentralized loyalty ecosystem.  Comprehensive simplification of retail purchasing process, increasing convenience for consumers, the introduction of pre-ordering and self-service systems for offline stores, the further development of distance order trading with flexible delivery service. In 2018, buyers will no longer be surprised at the lack of cashiers on exit and cash-desk queues have good chance to turn into exotics already this year. There is a great potential for further development of automated delivery systems for remote and sparsely populated areas using drones and other exotic means but conventional courier delivery business will continue to evolve together with an increase in online sales.

We have decided to put it for indicating that we take care about ""Liquid Bonus"" notion which is exclusively related to our solution.  Ref.: Ordinary individuals don't know such existence of this kind of service.  Indeed, there is long way to go. We have noticed that it is not so clear at the beginning. And unfortunately this statement is valid for both - consumers and retailers. Being very limited in financial resources, we have decided to fully focus on retail community thus you may have already discovered that our crypto-community marketing is very weak. That is also why you absolutely deservedly criticize our website... it will be updated on the following week (ongoing, not just for fixing mistakes but with updated content). So please stay tuned!  Ref.: And very true, I for one, haven't redeemed my air miles and got expired.  Air miles is a very best example showing the friction. Being employed by a big international company & having 1-2 flights a week, I was earning 100% free holiday flight for my whole family. After I quit & moved to a more sedentary life, I have never earned even for a class upgrade! Now all my 'gold member' airline cards are pure waste and remain still until airlines will allow me exporting my tiny earnings out for further accumulation at Liquid Bonus ecosystem. You're right, unredeemed miles and points could be happily donated, reused or even sold to an interested Party. And from my point of view, this is absolutely necessary option for consumers for maintaining their loyalty.  Companies fail to issue those points-n-miles with unlimited lifetime for avoiding of an uncontrolled accumulation of deferred liabilities but on the other hand, they have no other solution except that unpopular expiration killing numerous business opportunities.  Decentralization is able to solve this issue helping all - consumers and issuers of points  The Chapter II of our story is the global marketplace for promotions, discount and loyalty programs (Liquid Bonus wallet with an appropriate interface & aggregation features) but unfortunately the application isn't ready yet so we prefer to avoid much communication around it.  Honestly, we do it all by our own hands & facing lack of funding for a traditional ICO marketing campaign. From the well-known ""egg and chicken"" ecosystem we have chosen the second - even if we fail to attract ICO funding allowing us to release the system quickly and fund initial market launch, we will continue it by the existing small team.. better later than never!  Crossing fingers to be in time launching first version of mobile client before end of this ICO (just Android, unfortunately we have no cash for building wallet for iPhone in parallel), we are confident that it will be completed & launched in either case.  In order to finalize our beta solution & make pilot with 2-4 retailers (we already have candidates waiting for completed solution) we need just about 500 ETH - peanuts compared with market potential and interest from retailers!  Hope that despite being long I was helpful)) Enjoy your day    ----- yours, Liqbo.com ---",False
