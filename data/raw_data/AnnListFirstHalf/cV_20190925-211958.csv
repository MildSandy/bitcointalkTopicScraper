On page one the team says reports can only be bought with cV token (in the ""6 arguments...""-section) . And they say staking lots of cV gives you discounts for their services. On other spots I find the information saying reports can be bought via other Crypto and FIAT as well, but we get discounts when we use cVToken . which one is correct?  Then, how much discounts would one get for each of these models? I don't understand Lithuanian and therefore cannot check their live services by myself.   I mean, we have a total supply of roughly 10bn ( ~half in circulation) tokens at a market cap of about ~5mn $ . Staking for discount would give the token obviously a high demand and it would shorten the supply and therefore rise the price. At which price level would a report buyer still benefit from the discount if he buys token to stake for discount?  EXAMPLE if a car dealer buys 1 mio. cV at 0.01 €cent :-) he has to pay 10.000€ . he holds the coins and gets a certain discount for the report buys. lets say 10% . If a report costs 10€ he gets 1€ off . so he has to buy 10.000 reports to get break even, then he still holds the coins and his ROI increases from now on. good for him. because a lot of car dealers want the coins cheap now, they buy for the discount. price rises to a certain level. lets say x10 to 0.1 €cent. so the one buying now needs 100.000€ to buy cV and needs 100.000 reports to be bought before he gets break even. will a small business ever consider doing so? or will the big ones buy the coins in huge amounts and hold them for eternal discounts? i don't know....  the whole thing of the price expectation for me is extremely dependend on the discount model. but i cannot find any infos.  and if cV buys cVtokens instantly on exchanges whenever they get paid in FIAT or other cryptos and they do sell of their cVtokens instantly whenever beeing paid with cV, there is an endless circulating supply of cV tokens on the market. why would the price rise at all? i mean, if we hodl like 50 % of the coins (circulating supply right now) , but cV floods the market with their (now) locked tokens, then at what level of demand would the price of the tokens rise?  happy for any ideas and comments on this :-)",False

This is dot com bubble 2.0. Most of today's crypto investors who're falling over each other to invest in these retarded ideas are either millennials who were too young to experience dot com bust or those IQ deficient simpletons who have absolutely no understanding of real world economics.  During the height of dot com bubble, it was similar story, all kinds of crazy non-realistic idea coming out every day. All you had to do was to add hot catchphrases of the time i.e website, online, email etc and you had an amazing revolutionary business idea. Everyday mom & pop type investors would rush to pour money without thinking much about the feasibility of the idea. No doubt people made serious money while the bubble lasted and smart were those who got out before it all went kaput.  Similar trend is going on now.

You break your leg and time is critical, you need an extremely fast surgery. Essential data about your health history is stored on a decentralized distributed database. You can access it within the minute or grant access to relevant parties in that moment. Could you do the same with a centralized database sitting in the US?  Let's assume.... I could go on with this game for hours. You fail to understand what blockchain is able to achieve in its purest form (as Satoshi developed it) and way beyond (blockchain 2.0 / 3.0). And although I don't like the comparison with the Internet because it's too often used by people who do indeed have no clue about blockchain, I must use it now: If someone told you in 1995 what the information economy will look like in 2010 and how many things you are going to manage from your computer or even smartphone, what would your response have been back then?  You should get familiar with the concepts of particularized trust and generalized trust and how these two impact the process of globalization. Once you read up on those two concepts, please come back and continue the discussion about blockchain and their impact on a globalized, denationalized, more efficient and less trust-dependent world. Trust drives up costs. Build systems that decrease the requirement for trust and the whole world will be better off.  You are right, many projects from today will fail. But we all know that the Google and Amazon story is too good to be true too often anyway. However, I am thankful for everyone making the first step despite the biggest risk to fail. How often did you make the very first step in an industry? I admit, I have never done it.",False

Soft cap is 6850 Eth. Which is when we sell all tokens for both wave1 and wave2.  With latest price increase in both Ethereum and Bitcoin - we will recalculate this model and the amount of ETH before we release the contract publicly.  P.S. Just to remind you, our ICO starts on December 26th 6:00 PM UTC+0 (London time)  -carVertical-",False

Our ICO will be executed in 6 waves in one smart contract which opens on 26th of December and lasts 100 days or till we hit hard cap. We chose this approach because this is not a random ICO campaign. We started coding this solution and ICO came on a side.  Wave 1 is considered as pre-ICO. Wave 2 is soft cap.:  Wave 1 1050 ETH  BONUS: 45% Wave 2 5800 ETH  BONUS: 35% Wave 3 7000 ETH  BONUS: 25% Wave 4 7000 ETH  BONUS: 15% Wave 5 7000 ETH  BONUS: 10% Wave 6 7000 ETH  BONUS: 5%  Total 34850 ETH  TOKEN PRICE: 1 ETHEREUM = 103 644 cV + Wave Bonus  https://www.carvertical.com/images/token-waves.png?updated=20171202,False

Quote from: renxin on December 12, 2017, 04:51:48 AM this is a very promising project, will this plan or standard be enforced later? this is a bit of a violation of people's privacy after all  Hey renxin, thanks for your question!  carVertical is creating incentive mechanisms for owners, so that they could get value for data their vehicles generate. We understand that people own their data, and we want to provide them with the power to control it. This means that we will operate on the behalf of the car owner, and only with his permission we will share data with third parties, in return awarding the vehicle owner with cV tokens.  Hope this answers your question!  -carVertical-",False

Here you can check whole token flow: https://www.carvertical.com/images/token-flow.png  I can provide 6 subjective arguments proving why carVertical Token value is going to grow in the future carVertical:  1. carVertical is projected to start generating revenue from its products in July 2018. Our cash flow analysis states that in five years we will hit a revenue of 27,204,000 EUR with EBITDA of 10,524,000 EUR.  2. Token will be the only way to buy carVertical services. Stacking comes in place: person who owns more carVertical tokens gets significant discounts when buying our products. That means cheaper API calls, reports, whitelabel, car insurance and other services.  3. Token value will directly correlate with effectiveness of our service. Effectiveness of the service will be determined by efficiency of our machine learning and mathematical models. Machine learning and mathematical models will get better over time with more data.  4. The users carVertical onboards generate more and more data over time. So the value of the token will grow exponentially with the number of users we will onboard.  5. The team is already building this product. ICO came as a opportunity, not as a goal. This proves that carVertical is not just another ICO. We have signed agreement with Diginet, biggest classifieds website group in Baltic states, to deliver white label solution for their auto classified sites.  6. All national and privately held registries will move to blockchain in a few years. We’re going to be the first “sitting at the table” when governments and big companies come searching for the solutions to their needs.",False

Hard Cap: 15 050 ETH Soft Cap: 3 050 ETH TOKEN PRICE: 1 ETHEREUM = 240 000 cV + Wave Bonus  Here are a few reasons why we did that:  1. Ethereum price. Our initial financial calculations for business and software development were set for ETH price of 300 USD. As of December 12th, it now costs more than 600 USD.  2. Rational thinking. We have rationalized costs and time of product development. These costs are smaller than preliminary estimates, since we have no point to raise more money than we need.  3. We’ve done more. Our product development is already up front with our initial schedule. This means that we have managed to do more with our current assets, and as a result, there is less development needed after the ICO.  4. Choosing a new strategy. We have made initial agreements with European automotive classifieds on delivering white label solution. By approaching this strategy, we came to a conclusion that it is much easier and cheaper to penetrate into new markets by offering a white label solution. Comparing this to regular B2C report selling, the market penetration is 40% cheaper.  5. Our profit margin. After making new financial calculations, our projections show that our profit margin is bigger on both B2B and B2C products. This translates into the fact that our cashflow projection in year 3 and 4 will be bigger than we have estimated before.",False
