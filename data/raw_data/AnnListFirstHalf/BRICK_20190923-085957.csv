Currently some functionality of the product is already successfully implemented in our platform, which is commercially used in Russia, Cyprus, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. The goal of ICO for Brixby is expedited development of additional universal features and rewriting platform on blockchain -this will allow us reach our goal of launching platform globally. We are planning to do the blockchain based platform pilot prior to the commercial launch in three countries: India, Kazakhstan, and Mombasa - this all before 2019. By 2019 we shall have a well-functioning and pilot tested planning, this will allow for a rapid global launch of decentralised platform as described in Brixby whitepaper. The acquired tokens will give the platform users the right to use the platform as soon as the basic features are released, we believe we are able to do it in the next 6 months and make secured transactions.",False
