So dont judge the project before it  is  born. Give FSB time to leverage their awareness and than you'll see the value go up. And if you  bought  into  the ICO at 4$, dont consider it an loss.  Give them time. Comparing  to other  ICO the total volume is mid-low, so if  the team falls through with leveraging awareness, keeping to their roadmap and list on exchanges we will see the value sky rocket.

It's worth doing and having a read as there is some interesting information.  I have quoted the article below translated.  Quote  Compliance with regulations is important, but not something engineers should deal with — it would only hamper innovation. Read up on this issue in reports by Chinese media on our efforts.  Compliance is important, but it is not handled by engineers - it only hinders innovation. You can continue to understand this topic from another Chinese media report on our efforts.  The latest wave of financial technology may change traditional systems and improve the lives of consumers, but promising small start-ups are hampered by complex compliance laws, rules, and regulations before they begin operations. A new European start-up company has provided a solution to this global problem, which is also an important factor for the Chinese market.  Financial technology is an irresistible force, but now it is facing an irrevocable target: compliance with regulations. Talented small financial technology development teams may come up with groundbreaking technologies, but before they bring them to market, they will have to hire a team of lawyers to ensure that they comply with national financial and consumer laws. New ventures with transnational ambitions must go through this process as they enter each new market and economic region.  Alexander Mullins discovered the problem and decided to do something about it. His company, Forty Seven Bank, allows developers to create new technologies under their protection and provide them with access to all bank licenses so that they can fully comply with the regulations in any market they operate. ""Engineers and founders should not focus on things like compliance, risk management or building customer service organizations. If we do these things for them, they can focus on what they are good at and sell their products in parallel."" Marlins said.",False

The fact is even ethereum is on its way to moving away from mining to proof of stake, which will mean all that power being used for ethereum will shift to another coin, but the fact is at that point ethereum will be no where near  as electricity hungry as it currently is.  Mining coins will remain but, the fact is mining won't be the reason fiat survives. Eventually their will be fiat replacements, thare basically Proof Of Stake or some other hybrid Proof of XXXXXX, and you'll be able to just run mobile wallets, perhaps even banks like 47bk will run masternodes for said currency as well as other banks to maintain consensus and everyone will instead of fiat just use a phone with NFC to pay their bills.
