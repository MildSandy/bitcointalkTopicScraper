In order to answer your questions 1) you can see our daily predictions here: https://roboadvisorcoin.com/crypto-predictions/. 2) 3) The unsold tokens will be burnt. More precisely: * we will generate 4,000,000 RAC, then we will allocate 2,000,000 RAC to the ICO and we will keep 2,000,000 RAC for the platform. * Then at the end of the ICO, in case the Hard Cap is not reached, we will see how many tokens were issued during the ICO. * So assume that X RAC tokens will be sent to contributors. * In this case, we will keep X tokens for us. * The remainder 4,000,000 - 2*X  RAC tokens will be burnt.  So at the end of the ICO (in case the ICO will be successfully), the proportion between the tokens sent to contributors and the tokens kept by the plaftorm will be guaranteed to be 50% and 50%.  Probably we will have to update our whitepaper to make more explicit what happens to unsold tokens.    ",False
