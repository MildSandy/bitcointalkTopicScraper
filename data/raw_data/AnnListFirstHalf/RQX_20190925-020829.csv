This decision was primarily driven by the feedback on the proof-of-concept model and further supported by the extremely valuable suggestions made on the Merchant Area and mobile App by advisors and team members.  By pausing the ICO, the development team can modify their scope to focus on improving our three core applications that were identified as; The Requitix Merchant Area, the Woocommerce extension and other addons as well as the new Requitix Mobile Wallet/App. The project manager and developers have committed to complete these key modifications in the next 60-days.  By modifying the team focus and applying more attention to these three components now versus after ICO, we are confident the project will sustain better long-term value for the RQX token, and provide improved stability with a solid beta of the complete Requitix solution.  Everyone that sent ETH has now been refunded, and all remain eligible for the same pre-sale bonuses, when the ICO resumes in February.  For all of you that have registered and been working on bounties, those programs will still run albeit a little longer so if you have any questions, please contact us at contact@requitix.io and weâ€™ll be able to assist more.  We will close/lock this thread and start a new one in the coming days.",True

For example, on a dating site, if the owner uses Requitix then that user is scanned through a database of known scammers. It scans for username, IP, email, photo and profile text. If that user gets flagged then the user is blocked at the IP level. That's before the user ever gets into the site. This is just a part of Requitix and doesn't have anything to do with the blockchain. It's just an added bonus for using Requitix. Now this works with any type of site. WordPress, Magento, Drupal, Joomla or any other CMS system. Again, it's just a part of what Requitix offers.  Another component is the Trusted Reviews. All too often ecommerce sites are hit with fake reviews done by their competitors. There is a whole market that allows this to happen. Sites like SiteJabber, PissedConsumer, RipoffReport all allow anyone to post an anonymous review and competitors pile on fake reviews on all these sites. The review site owners won't remove them so they just don't care about the merchant. It's all about them. Well that stops with Requitix. Merchants that user Requitix will be able to let their customers create a review of the transaction. If someone pays with Requitix then there is a 30 day window they have to leave a review of the transaction. They can only leave one review. That review then shows up on reviews.requitix.io and it's verifiable due to the transaction being on the blockchain so there's no way to fake it.  Hope that helps.",True

Thanks for the reply. It doesn't just scan the IP. It scans the IP, username, Email, Photo and text within any text box area. While we can't go into direct specifics of how it works I can say that it's adaptive and constantly updating and changing to catch these types of people.  If we can protect the consumer and the merchant with scammer/spammer protection how is that not a win for them? Add in the trusted reviews component and it makes the system even more valuable. When it comes to reviews every online merchant has been hit with fake reviews about their site. There's a whole industry setup to profit off of fake reviews. With our system fake reviews will not exist. Consumers are only allowed to review the transaction they just completed and only one time. Once it's  reviewed it shows up on reviews.requitix.io.  If you're a merchant that sells products/services online then you're going to like it. There's no downside. Even the transaction fee is a hit. Most pay 3%. Requitix merchants will pay point 5%. Not even one whole percent.  Again, thanks for the reply and if you want to know more please ask.",True

It's not just a token for a dating site. It's a whole ecommerce solution. We are using dating because that's our industry and it made complete sense to start it in this space for the simple fact that two of our four components are a huge issue in the dating world. Trusted Reviews and Scammers and Spammers. Our proof of concept in dating just worked for us to launch out of.  What makes us different than others is we offer 4 components: Trusted Reviews, Scammer/Spammer protection, Zero Chargebacks and .5% transaction fee (Free for 6 months for first 250 merchants). It works with Woocommerce, Drupal, Magento, Joomla and others. We are also integrating it with Boonex.com, AdvanDate.com and a hose of other software projects. Dating is a small space compared to the overall ecommerce world that we will be penetrating.  Hope that clarifies your question.

This is a very important topic. As many ecommerce site owners will tell you, unscrupulous competitors have been known to create fake reviews attempting to smear or destroy their online reputation. This is a tactic done by some very large organizations as well, and happens to just about any ecommerce site out there.  Site owners are people too â€“ And discovering false, misleading or negative information about them feels unjust and can cause a horrible feeling inside.  When any anonymous person out there can purposefully destroy someone's online business, it becomes a chilling fact of Internet business that must be addressed, and with the Requitix Confidence System, we help alleviate and solve those worries.  How? â€“ By having a system that only allows your true customers to post reviews.    The system works like this; When a customer pays with Requitix, they will have 30 days to create a review about the product or service. This review is only allowed when a transaction is created on the blockchain. The customer can post one review per their transaction. Once the review is posted, the transaction is available on our review site. Site owners can send potential customers to the review site to confirm real reviews from real customers.  Merchants can now have confidence in a genuine review system that also benefits consumers by allowing them to make informed buying decision, based on legitimate reviews.",True

Our main proof of concept site was created in 2002.  Also, we have big names in the dating business as advisors on our team. Marc Lesnick runs the largest internet dating conference in the world and is well known in the dating business and his conference brings in names like Match.com, eHarmony.com, Flirt.com, Microsoft, Google, OKCupid and a host of other big name dating sites. Michael Carter owns the largest niche market dating sites (263 sites). Andrew Boon owns Boonex.com, the largest social community software provider in the world. Bogdan Fiedur is the cofounder and CTO of bitjob.io.  All the links on requitix.io work just fine.

They will be able to publish a review which others will trust and there will be zero charge backs.  Some banks charge outrageous amounts per chargeback. I've even seen $50.

The .5% transaction is taken off the total transaction at transaction time. The API handles that. For example.
