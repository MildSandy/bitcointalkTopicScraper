Good idea to reduce the cap. Will the total ICO cap also be reduced?  I'm interested to invest, yet I'm a bit afraid to be doing it a peak of the Eth price now. Can you please explain what the BTC price at ICO will be based on? Eth - BTC of that moment? USD - BTC?  Can you also fix the LinkedIn link's of all team members?

It is written further how it will be done.   I'm interested to invest, yet I'm a bit afraid to be doing it a peak of the Eth price now. Can you please explain what the BTC price at ICO will be based on? Eth - BTC of that moment? USD - BTC?  The token value in USD is not constant being dependent on ETH market value. The ratio 1,000 AMT = 1 ETH (without the bonus) is a constant defined and prescribed in a smart contract, so it cannot be changed. At PreICO stage 1 ETH is always equal to 1,500AMT, but its equivalent in USD will vary, depending on ETH market price. Initially, when we were making our plan, ETH price for was about $ 450, so our Hard CAP was evaluated at 2,700,000 USD or 6000 ETH. But we could not foresee such a rapid increase in ETH cost. Having discussed the current situation, we've made the decision to stop the fundraising and token releasing tokens as soon as we reach the necessary amount (2,700,000 USD), i.e., at a price of 1 ETH = 1250 $ we will stop fundraising as soon as we reach 2160 ETH.   Can you also fix the LinkedIn link's of all team members? Many of the buttons now lead to the ICO website instead of a LinkedIn profile. It looks a bit sloppy.  Thanks for indicating this. It will be corrected in the nearest future.",False
