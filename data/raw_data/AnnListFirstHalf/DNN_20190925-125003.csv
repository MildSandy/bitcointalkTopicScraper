In response, the duo launched the Decentralized News Network  (DNN) with the goal of creating a platform ‚Äúby the people for the people‚Äù using digital currency. DNN uses economic incentives and utilizes the technology used in digital currency so that the content can never be hacked, taken down, or censored.

If fake news was presented to you, or came down your news feed on social media, would you recognize it? The article, website, and content may appear to be legitimate, but it can be virtually impossible to authenticate the information being presented. Until now, that is. The future of media is evolving at an exponential speed, thanks to the blockchain and sites such as DNN.media. In fact, fake news and unbalanced reporting have met their match through this platform, which drives accountability through a peer-reviewed process. DNN is using the power of the Ethereum blockchain to allow for a fully decentralized network. Meaning, the platform can never be hacked, taken down, or censored. Blockchain technology was originally devised for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, but the tech community is finding other useful alternatives for the technology, such as in the media industry.

For publishing content, Steem then rewards its users with STEEM granted, their content gains popularity, while at the same time, incentivizing dialogue around this content. Other than subjective mining, DNN bears little resemblance to Steem. The best way to think of Steem, is it is a tokenized Reddit on the blockchain. Rather, than reward users with Karma, users of Steem are given STEEM. In turn, creating a platform that fosters content deemed as quality by the community.  CreativeChain on the other hand, is focused with authorship assurance and creating customizable distribution channels for content. While CreativeChain does have the ability to create smart contracts and social networks to interact with communities, there is no clear-cut solution to addressing the problems surrounding news in particular.

Are too many forks a bad thing? Yes, but I don't see them being a threat to the robustness of the network. Not to mention there are plenty of fixes the Ethereum foundation is working to address these attack vectors (e.g. Casper).  In the case of the attack against DAO, the Ethereum network still functioned (https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/06/17/critical-update-re-dao-vulnerability/). There will always be some vulnerability in how code is written, the immutability of the blockchain is quite solid.

DNN will harness the benefits of the Ethereum blockchain to allow for an infrastructure that can never be infiltrated or taken down, regardless of how concentrated an attack is. Since computing power will not be consolidated, DNN will not suffer from having a single point of failure - something that exposes most companies when their security is compromised.  DNN‚Äôs core purpose is to present political news in as unbiased a view as possible, free of any corrupt incentives or hidden agendas that plague most news corporations.  DNN‚Äôs news will focus exclusively on the balanced and factual observation of current affairs, rather than opinion and propaganda.  Decentralized - DNN harnesses the power of the Ethereum blockchain to allow for a fully decentralized network that can never be hacked into, taken down, or censored.  Censorship Resistant Content published to DNN is stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring immunity from any efforts to suppress writer content. No Central Authority DNN relies on consensus amongst content reviewers, rather than a central authority, to determine what should be published. Permanent Content DNN's content is persisted across community-managed servers, so that each retains copies of everything.  Factual - DNN presents news in a thoroughly accurate way, combining the openness and freedom of blogs with the formal fact-checking of news organizations.  Robust Review System An extensive review process allows for fact-checkers to validate writer submitted content for overall accuracy and legitimacy. Comprehensive Guidelines DNN's guidelines and content policies direct reviewers on how to vet articles before they get published to the network. Reviewer Feedback Reviewers can interact with writers by attaching notes to articles, which contain feedback on how to better organize content.  Collaborative - DNN involves readers, writers, reviewers, and publishers providing key contributions that make up the underlying functions and structure of the network.  DNN Tokens Activity on the network is driven by its currency called DNN, which are distributed in proportion to a contributor's effort. Incentivized Collaboration All users on DNN are rewarded for their collective actions, thus establishing a community that thrives on incentives. Interchangeable Roles Users can seamlessly switch between reader, writer, and reviewer roles in a fluid and open environment.   OUR MISSION  DNN will focus exclusively on factual and thorough perspectives of current political affairs, while rewarding all parties involved.  Our mission is to create political news content that is both empowering for its readers, as well as representative of the integrity of its writers. We aspire to become the most trusted and democratic political news alternative to mainstream media.    HOW IT WORKS  Simply put, writers produce and submit content, which is inspected for accuracy by a randomized set of reviewers on the network. Articles deemed acceptable enough (as per DNN‚Äôs guidelines) will be published to the network and made available to readers.   DNN Workflow  Each participant on DNN is rewarded for their contribution, in the form of DNN tokens. Writers, reviewers, readers and publishers all earn reward for contributing to the network.  DNN is comprised of four types of actors that each have key roles and contributions that together, make up the underlying functions and framework of the network.  Writers Writers, or reporters, are individuals who submit political content in the form of articles. Whether the individual is a freelance journalist, casual blogger, or an average consumer of global news, he or she can contribute to the DNN.  However, since anyone can submit articles to DNN, getting published is not guaranteed. To increase the chance of getting published writers should ensure that they closely comply with the DNN content guidelines to mitigate the chance of reviewers rejecting their piece due to Infractions.  The DNN content guidelines are a set of agreed-upon best practices for constructing political pieces that are both comprehensive in scope and that convey the facts clearly and concisely. Articles that are submitted to DNN go through a series of stages before being submitted. See picture below.   Article Stages  Reviewers Reviewers, or editors, read and vote upon submitted articles before an article is available for public consumption on the DNN‚Äôs article feed. The review process includes basic tasks such as noting grammatical errors, pointing out inaccuracies and questionable statements, as well as content classification.  Most important, however, is that reviewers ensure articles adhere to the DNN content guidelines.  Reviewers do not have the ability to modify articles, but rather can accept (i.e. vote to have content published) or reject (i.e. vote to prevent content from being published) any written piece. To make sure that no single reviewer has the final say on whether or not an article should be publicly incorporated into the network, the network will assign seven random reviewers to validate the article. The seven reviewers are chosen in a process called the Review Selection Bid, as seen in the pic below.  All seven reviewers are completely unaware of one another‚Äôs identities; they vote and leave feedback in complete isolation to avoid groupthink or any form of collusion.   Reviewer Selection Bid  Readers Readers are news consumers. Readers can comment, add notes, share, upvote, bookmark articles of interest, and denote articles they deem questionable.  Unlike readers on traditional news platforms, readers on DNN play an active role in helping to shape the news they read, which includes participating in Reader Suggestions whereby article topics are put forward by you, the news consumer.   Publishers Unlike readers, reviewers, and writers who are human actors of the network, publishers are server nodes which act as a proxy between human users and the DNN network residing on the Ethereum blockchain.  Specialized open source software consisting of the complete DNN user-interface and network interface, is bundled and installed on each publisher. One important point of note here is that publishers do not possess any article or user data, but instead, read from and execute commands to the DNN network.  Apart from communicating with DNN‚Äôs network, publishers communicate with one another through a peer-to-peer protocol that makes use of the same cryptography behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. Using this peer-to-peer protocol, publishers are able to relay details about their state to nearby node hosts.  The main purpose for publishers is to provide an attack resistant transport for the DNN software, rather than host the DNN software on a centralized server, which introduces a significant point of failure.  Storing DNN‚Äôs software on a decentralized network also allows the community to run and manage it without the need for an external facilitator or trusted intermediary.   Publishers Nodes  The Review Process Before an article can be published to the network, it must first undergo a careful review to ensure that it is factual and abides by the DNN content guidelines. Each reviewer is required to place a bid to review the article they are interested in. The first seven reviewers from the pool with the highest bids are selected to review the article. During the review period, reviewers are able to provide written feedback and vote to reject or accept the article into the network.  The actions performed by each reviewer are completely unknown to the other reviewers and more than 50 percent of the reviewers must approve the article in order for it be added into the network. If the reviewers choose to reject the article, the writer has the option of submitting the article again after making any suggested changes, in which case, a new set reviewers will be assigned. The diagram below shows a complete overview of the review process.   Article Publish Flow   THE TOKEN  The central payout unit of the platform is called DNN. The DNN is divisible by up to 18 decimal places and can be obtained in the following two ways:  Buy it directly from an exchange Earn it by contributing to the network  Writers, reviewers, and publishers are capable of earning DNN at the conclusion of the review process. The review process is considered to be finished when each reviewer has voted. The amount of DNN a user can earn is determined by the types of contributions they make to the network, (and in the case of reviewers, how many DNN they bid during the reviewer selection bid).  The payout of tokens is structured in a way that rewards the actions that ensure the articles in the feed remain as factual as possible and consistent with the platform‚Äôs Content Guidelines.  DNN are used for a variety of things within the DNN network.  Writers use DNN to pay for the Writer Fee associated with submitting their article to the network. Once an article has been accepted, writers can earn DNN through the engagement generated by their article.  Reviewers earn DNN by determining whether an article should be accepted or rejected by the network.  Publishers earn DNN by hosting nodes on the network. Each time a review has completed, a small portion of tokens will be evenly distributed to each publisher node proportional to how many tokens the publisher node holds.   NETWORK STACK  DNN's network will be built using Ethereum smart contracts, IPFS (eventually Swarm or Filecoin), and ZeroNet.  Smart Contracts When it comes to Ethereum, smart contracts written in Solidity are used to persist verified and accepted articles, in turn creating a published article feed. DNN will utilize smart contracts to facilitate the entire review process and payouts.  The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) IPFS is a complete peer to peer network that allows for the storage and retrieval of hypermedia. Since the amount of gas required to store articles becomes less cost-efficient as the platform scales, only a reference to the article is stored within Ethereum (i.e. a IPFS hash pointer to the article). The hash pointer used for the article will be a reference to its complete contents in IPFS.  ZeroNet DNN ensures availability of its web application through the use of ZeroNet, though with slight variations. ZeroNet is a completely decentralized and censorship-resistant network built using the same cryptographic structure as Bitcoin and the technology of BitTorrent.  One thing to note is that the DNN is completely separate from the the DNN blockchain network. Like BitTorrent, ZeroNet works by seeding data ‚Äî in this case the DNN web application ‚Äî to hosting nodes that are interested in using the data.  Hosting nodes, known as peers, download (""leech"") and upload (""seed"") the DNN web application between each other rather than through a centralized server. Throughout the DNN, thousands of hosting nodes spread out across different geographical regions, containing complete copies of the entire DNN web application and making it available to interested viewers.  In addition to the traditional BitTorrent approach, which requires users to install software in order to download data from the BitTorrent network, the DNN application network can also be accessed simply through a standard web browser. Users have the option of connecting directly to public hosting nodes or by navigating to DNN's domain and letting DNN find an available hosting node.  Anyone can become a hosting node if they download the DNN application directly from the DNN domain instead of viewing it through a web browser. Once a user becomes a hosting node, they will automatically connect to nearby peers and begin to seed the DNN web application.
