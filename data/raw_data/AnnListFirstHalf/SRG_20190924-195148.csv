Rather, there would be an inscription ""I'm not an adviser to this project"" or ""it's probably a scam"", well obviously not ""someone to contact the police"" Well, of course, if we wanted something to hide or to lie, probably we would have banned everyone and prevented all users from publicly watering us with dirt ...

Rather, there would be an inscription ""I'm not an adviser to this project"" or ""it's probably a scam"", well obviously not ""someone to contact the police"" Well, of course, if we wanted something to hide or to lie, probably we would have banned everyone and prevented all users from publicly watering us with dirt ...

The price of one token will be 2 USD. And total amount of them - 20 000 000. Also you can buy SRG tokens for such cryptocurrency as ETH,BTS and ShapeShift. All tokens (100%), sold and distributed during the ICO, are provided by 50% of the company’s profits. SRG token sale starts on the 4th of October in 2017. At the end of the ICO period, the SRG tokens will be traded on the cryptocurrency exchanges. Tokens which won’t be sold during the ICO will be burnt immediately after the ICO.  Every six months, after ending of the Eco period, SRG will allocate 50% of the profit for the payment of rewards to the token holders. As the SRG token is a profit share, its value for the token holders directly depends on the profitability of the SRG Community.  Our strategic goal is to connect a large number of games to the SRG system, to promote the community and build up the client base. Therefore, we will ensure a stable growth of the company’s profits and an increase of the volume of payments to the token holders every half-year. That will lead to increased demand for SRG tokens because the profitability of this token for holders will outstrip its competitors.   - GMP-tokens are issued exclusively in exchange for the currency entering the SRG system. For every 10$ - 100 tokens are issued. With GMP you can make in-game purchases in all games included in the SRG system. Also, this type of token can be converted into Ethereum tokens, which any participant can withdraw to his wallet that supports this type of payment. The purse address will need to be specified in the personal account in the SRG system. Then, specify how many GMP tokens you want to exchange. After this, the referent receives an equivalent amount in ETH-tokens. Moreover, all referees have the opportunity to trade tokens on stock exchanges.  This type of operation is also convenient for game developers participating in the SRG system as they always have access to reports on all payments made by referrals.",False

Powered by successful Swiss international Job Platforms Jobstoday.ch; Jobstoday.de; Jobstoday.at; Jobstoday.pl, Global Jobcoin ICO has become very popular among cryptocurrency investors & enthusiast within a few days.  It is not a surprise since Global Jobcoin ICO is backed by an established & successful company. The Job platforms are already in the market since last 3 years & have already more than 5000 clients & 1 Million + users registered on their platforms.  On the market, there are many ICOs being announced daily but most of them don’t even have any company structure, no product, no prototype or the team has no experience in product & business development. Global Jobcoin ICO has ticked all the boxes for a successful ICO. It is apparent from the presale & extremely high interest in the crowd sale. Independent ICO rating agency ICObench.com has rated Global Jobcoin 4.7 from 5.  “The fact that any investor can check that we exist since 2014 & have a working successful product in Switzerland, Germany, Austria & Poland, gives them confidence that their investment is safe with us”, said Sanket Deshmukh, Co-founder & CEO of Jobstoday & Global Jobcoin. He further added, “We receive daily at least 100 mails from our potential investors who like our ICO & are pleased to invest in it. Today’s ICO investors are smart, intelligent & they see the potential in ICOs with working product. Distribution of tokens is very important factor in deciding about the ICO. Global Jobcoin founders only hold 10% of total tokens, so the manipulation of the price is not possible. Lots of ICOs are keeping a lot of tokens for themselves so that they can manipulate the price. We have been very transparent with our investors from the beginning & that makes a big difference. Besides that, we will only have a circulating supply of 70 Million tokens & we will also invest 10% of our global profits in buying back Global Jobcoin tokens from the market.”  “Cryptocurrency investors are pushing the technology to its next level. ICOs are here to stay & the ones with successful products will give the investors a good return in short or long term”, said Lukasz Ochnik, Co-founder & CTO of Jobstoday & Global Jobcoin. He further added, “We hear about various scam ICOs daily, I personally never invested in any ICO which doesn’t have a legal company structure, experienced team & at least a prototype. Another important factor is whether the company address is revealed on the website & they can be found in company registration directory of that country. I don’t understand how people should invest in an ICO if the company does not even want to reveal its address. We spent 2 months in planning the ICO with our great team. We looked at various factors & how we can guarantee our investors the return that we promise. Our token holders not only benefit from our rising token price but also from the 20% dividends that they receive from our worldwide profits.”  The Global Jobcoin presale is currently in progress & minimum investment of 10 ETH is accepted, tokens are guaranteed through a SAFT agreement during the presale. The public crowd sale will start on October 28. The hard cap is set at 200,000 ETH, which is approximately $60 Million.  About Global Jobcoin  Global Jobcoin is an ERC20 decentralized token to pay for services related to employment. Using the Ethereum blockchain, this token is created for employers & employees worldwide. Global Jobcoin will be used on all Job platforms of Jobstoday in Switzerland, Germany, Austria & Poland.

The price of one token will be 2 USD. And total amount of them - 20 000 000. Also you can buy SRG tokens for such cryptocurrency as ETH,BTS and ShapeShift. All tokens (100%), sold and distributed during the ICO, are provided by 50% of the company’s profits. SRG token sale starts on the 4th of October in 2017. At the end of the ICO period, the SRG tokens will be traded on the cryptocurrency exchanges. Tokens which won’t be sold during the ICO will be burnt immediately after the ICO.  Every six months, after ending of the Eco period, SRG will allocate 50% of the profit for the payment of rewards to the token holders. As the SRG token is a profit share, its value for the token holders directly depends on the profitability of the SRG Community.  Our strategic goal is to connect a large number of games to the SRG system, to promote the community and build up the client base. Therefore, we will ensure a stable growth of the company’s profits and an increase of the volume of payments to the token holders every half-year. That will lead to increased demand for SRG tokens because the profitability of this token for holders will outstrip its competitors.   - GMP-tokens are issued exclusively in exchange for the currency entering the SRG system.

We have 2 types of tokens.  - The SRG token is a token issued exclusively during the ICO period, which entitles you to receive a share of SRG’s profits every six months. The price of one token will be 2 USD. And total amount of them - 20 000 000. Also you can buy SRG tokens for such cryptocurrency as ETH,BTS and ShapeShift. All tokens (100%), sold and distributed during the ICO, are provided by 50% of the company’s profits. SRG token sale starts on the 4th of October in 2017. At the end of the ICO period, the SRG tokens will be traded on the cryptocurrency exchanges. Tokens which won’t be sold during the ICO will be burnt immediately after the ICO.  Every six months, after ending of the Eco period, SRG will allocate 50% of the profit for the payment of rewards to the token holders. As the SRG token is a profit share, its value for the token holders directly depends on the profitability of the SRG Community.  Our strategic goal is to connect a large number of games to the SRG system, to promote the community and build up the client base. Therefore, we will ensure a stable growth of the company’s profits and an increase of the volume of payments to the token holders every half-year. That will lead to increased demand for SRG tokens because the profitability of this token for holders will outstrip its competitors.   - GMP-tokens are issued exclusively in exchange for the currency entering the SRG system. For every 10$ - 100 tokens are issued. With GMP you can make in-game purchases in all games included in the SRG system. Also, this type of token can be converted into Ethereum tokens, which any participant can withdraw to his wallet that supports this type of payment. The purse address will need to be specified in the personal account in the SRG system. Then, specify how many GMP tokens you want to exchange. After this, the referent receives an equivalent amount in ETH-tokens. Moreover, all referees have the opportunity to trade tokens on stock exchanges.  This type of operation is also convenient for game developers participating in the SRG system as they always have access to reports on all payments made by referrals.",False

All tokens (100%), sold and distributed during the ICO, are provided by 50% of the company’s profits. SRG token sale starts on the 4th of October in 2017. At the end of the ICO period, the SRG tokens will be traded on the cryptocurrency exchanges. Tokens which won’t be sold during the ICO will be burnt immediately after the ICO.  Every six months, after ending of the Eco period, SRG will allocate 50% of the profit for the payment of rewards to the token holders. As the SRG token is a profit share, its value for the token holders directly depends on the profitability of the SRG Community.  Our strategic goal is to connect a large number of games to the SRG system, to promote the community and build up the client base. Therefore, we will ensure a stable growth of the company’s profits and an increase of the volume of payments to the token holders every half-year. That will lead to increased demand for SRG tokens because the profitability of this token for holders will outstrip its competitors.   - GMP-tokens are issued exclusively in exchange for the currency entering the SRG system. For every 10$ - 100 tokens are issued. With GMP you can make in-game purchases in all games included in the SRG system. Also, this type of token can be converted into Ethereum tokens, which any participant can withdraw to his wallet that supports this type of payment. The purse address will need to be specified in the personal account in the SRG system. Then, specify how many GMP tokens you want to exchange. After this, the referent receives an equivalent amount in ETH-tokens. Moreover, all referees have the opportunity to trade tokens on stock exchanges.  This type of operation is also convenient for game developers participating in the SRG system as they always have access to reports on all payments made by referrals.",False

You, as a partner, invited referral, he bought something and you received benefits. If he invited someone else, and he purchased the goods, you wouldn’t be awarded. In multi-level referal system there can be two and more referral levels. It means that you receive benefits for those whom you invited, and for those who were invited by your referrals.  Why is this system so popular?  The aim of using this system is to expand the horizons of the website.The participants invite new members, and those in turn invite others to receive benefits.

But the way to achieve the goal of each project, for example: mobilego build their play market and want to attract developers there, dmarket creates a platform for selling and exchanging skins. Our team realizes the set goal with the help of monetization of viral marketing and the construction of an international decentralized loyalty program, this concept has not been used before, this is our highlight. With technical implementation you can find in Github",False

Now, I'm wondering which genre and what exact games will you be targeting as your initial games? This will be important because a bigger player base = more referrals, and an active in-game market would make your coins more attractive, and incentivize players to rope more people in.  Another concern I have is, what's unique in your concept that prevents a publisher from replicating your concept for their own games?
