Asia’s population, nearly one third of the world’s 7.5 billion people, is young, social, and aspirational. And they are avid consumers of promotions. In fact, 53% of the people in Asia, especially Millennials (across income levels), seek discounts and promotions on a regular basis. Current online “hot-promotions” presented to them, however, are often irrelevant with little or no consideration to time of day, consumer demographics and preferences, and consumer location. Clearly, Data Science and LBS will become requisite for proper Marketing Operations (MO) in this environment.  Merchants are beset with significant increases in the costs of Mobile Marketing, a problem that increases as the larger social network platforms and messaging platforms exhibit oligopolistic behavior in markets without anti-monopoly protections. While large, well-established companies have the funds and capabilities to publish their own branded app, the cost of running an effective marketing campaign on established social media and messaging platforms are prohibitively expensive for small and medium-size merchants. As a result, these smaller merchants often choose to not market online.  In addition, these larger social network and messaging platforms offer limited tools for merchants to identify and target high propensity consumers at specific locations and during optimal times of the day. Even if some of these functions are available individually, most of the merchants do not have the technical capabilities to combine available functionalities into an effective tool. Even worse, mainstream platforms provide merchants with limited telemetry as to the effectiveness of such costly marketing campaigns, making it difficult for merchants to “tune” their marketing and promotional efforts. This results in an ineffective and expensive service which fails to address the needs of (thinly-capitalized) small to medium-scale retail businesses.  HotNow has solved several of these problems by integrating LBS into its platform, and creating strong statistical tools and methods to give merchants the information that they need to manage their businesses much more cost effectively.",False

Most dotcom's pursued eyeballs and didn't worry about margin, let alone revenue.  HotNow managed to solve the chicken-egg problem of bringing both merchants and consumers to its platform. It found ways to acquire users at <$0.50/user. Its merchants found the HotNow platform to be upwards of 100x more effective than advertising on larger social media platforms. The platform seems to be working well, even without reaching critical mass. I look forward to seeing what HotNow can do with more growth capital and with the additional functionalities that blockchain tech will enable.  As an investor, I look for businesses and management team that can mitigate 3 major risks: market, technology and execution.  Market risk - HotNow has mitigated this. It's found a good base of customers who are willing to pay a price that generates profits for the company.  Technology risk - HotNow has mitigated this too. Its tech leadership and team are proven AND they are not trying to re-invent the wheel by developing new tech for the sake of its being new. They chose Stellar, an established platform, instead of developing their own tech.  Execution risk - HotNow has operating executives who have built businesses before. They build video games that attracted millions of players who transacted >13x/player/yr. I'm comfortable that this team can build the game mechanics to nurture a growing and engaged community. Its portfolio of games will be available to merchants as innovative promotional tools as well as community building tools.  I agree with Reji and Luke. In the current noisy ICO market, it's hard to find the opportunities that make business sense and that have the right operating teams to make it happen. I encourage you to learn more about the team here and their vision/mission/plan and perhaps you'll feel comfortable about investing here too.",False
