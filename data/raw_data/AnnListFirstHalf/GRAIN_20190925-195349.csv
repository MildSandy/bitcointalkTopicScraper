November update - The  state of our company  Our communication towards our community has been far from perfect and we would like to apologise for this. However, the silence did not stop our team to make progress as a company.  Adaption of the Platform: New Clients. We’re working on 5 proof of concepts at this moment. One of the concepts is a portal for about 1.500 GIG professionals. We expect the project to start in December and go live Q2 2019. Another major European company is planning to run their GIG work portal on top of GRAIN. We expect this project to start in the upcoming weeks and to go live in Q1 2019. On top of that, we’re currently collaborating with three software vendors who are going to integrate GRAIN in their software products to add payments/harvest/compliance to their value proposition. One of them is live and testing, it cost us 6 days to integrate GRAIN, our goal is to bring that down to less than 6 hours in the next couple of months.  Exchange Listing. We’re super excited to see all of the real-business value being provided by our technology. We expect the first real live situations with substantial volume to happen in the course of 2019. It will be our strategy to not list our token before we have customers (demand) who use our digital currency for business purposes. When the moment is right to decide and list our token on a public exchange, there will be a demand for a substantial percentage of the tokens in public circulation.

Freemind I understand your concern, it is normal, you are right that if it is not fulfilled now, the token can be devalued, they did not give an exact date, but, approximately, and it has not yet expired, there are hours ahead, I ask for patience until they see what they decide finally, but I have to admit, the simple fact of maintaining this conversation already devaluates the token, you know, so I'm sure the team makes the right decision and they end up distributing the token within the dates they gave, that is, within this month.  The opposite would simply render the token worthless, people keep the token if deadlines are met, if the payment is lengthened, as soon as they receive it, they will sell massively, and that will cause them to lose value.  It would be a shame, but let's wait these hours please, and see what the team's decision is.  mike, [29.06.18 22:17] [Respondiendo a Gothorum bitcointalk] Hey Gothorum, a lot of this waiting process is the negotiation process between listings. The process is slow and there is no way to pin point an exact date for this. We take this issue very seriously because unlocking a token without proper listings is horrible for the token.  We appreciate that you are excited for this project and want your tokens available as soon as possible but our advisors have made it clear that doing this in an unrushed manner is going to play out better for everyone.  That being said I am happy we have a set unlock by date that is not going to move and I'm happy it's not a month away.

There are so many moving variables and changing regulations you cannot expect exact dates and times for things like this to happen.  mike, [29.06.18 22:30] [Respondiendo a freemind] Bounty tokens are notorious for being dumped as soon as they are distributed.

This means that if the chosen payment options are Escrow or Currency Option, the volatility factor is removed. In the Escrow option, if when the time for payment has come and the value of GRAIN has decreased, GRAIN from the insurance wallet would be added to the escrow to bring the total amount needing to be paid. If the value has increased, then the extra GRAIN in the escrow is removed and added to the insurance wallet to that the amount paid is still the agreed upon amount. So say you were to be paid 50 grain which at the time was say $1 per grain for a total of $50 but when payment time came and the 50 GRAIN was $0.50 per grain, that would only be $25 so another 50 GRAIN would be subtracted from the insurance wallet and added to the escrow to equal the original $50. However, if say the value of the GRAIN at the time of payment due was $2 per grain, then 25 GRAIN would be subtracted and added to the insurance wallet making the payment 25 grain still equaling $50.  In the Currency option, the employer buys the grain to pay you with after at the time of payment but locks in the exchange rate when the contract is made. When the value of GRAIN has increased then the employer buys the GRAIN from the insurance wallet at the lower rate they locked in at. When the value decreases, the employer just buys the GRAIN at the lower rate with the premium the employer paid to lock the rate in going to the insurance wallet.",False

Grain helps the organization to save a substantial amount in brokerage/ trading services. Grain is not an open market to connect to employers. Grain is a back end solution where transactions take place and partners can sign for work agreements.  For every transaction, partners will get 50% of the fee and this fee is charged to the users. Partner FleXentral is used as the front end which gives solution which can be used for Grain infrastructure. Grain is flexible which allows all the types of agreements between contractor and user.  I just need some more clarity about the Grain because what are the major contract are they going to support because already we are seeing some blockchain transaction without any fee, but how can Grain overcome with those companies?

This means that if the chosen payment options are Escrow or Currency Option, the volatility factor is removed.  In the Escrow option, if when the time for payment has come and the value of GRAIN has decreased, GRAIN from the insurance wallet would be added to the escrow to bring the total amount needing to be paid.  If the value has increased, then the extra GRAIN in the escrow is removed and added to the insurance wallet to that the amount paid is still the agreed upon amount.  So say you were to be paid 50 grain which at the time was say $1 per grain for a total of $50 but when payment time came and the 50 GRAIN was $0.50 per grain, that would only be $25 so another 50 GRAIN would be subtracted from the insurance wallet and added to the escrow to equal the original $50.  However, if say the value of the GRAIN at the time of payment due was $2 per grain, then 25 GRAIN would be subtracted and added to the insurance wallet making the payment 25 grain still equaling $50.  In the Currency option, the employer buys the grain to pay you with after at the time of payment but locks in the exchange rate when the contract is made.  When the value of GRAIN has increased then the employer buys the GRAIN from the insurance wallet at the lower rate they locked in at.  When the value decreases, the employer just buys the GRAIN at the lower rate with the premium the employer paid to lock the rate in going to the insurance wallet.",False
