This wonderful day came when we updated https://wallet.beeqb.com/ . Personally, for me, the current version is an absolutely new level of the BEEQB development. What new features did we add: 1. Creating a company: Settings > Business wallet > Create company 2. Access roles: Director (can all), Accountant (can create, pay and manage invoices), Manager (can create and tmanage the payment), Administrator (manages company settings, can add employees by roles) 3. Payments - incoming and outgoing invoices with details from whom, to whom, when created, when paid, what discount, what amount in currency and BTC. 4. Interest rate (Settings > Interest rate) - you can set the company's rate both in the higher and lower side of the current one. This rate will be used for invoicing. 5. Discount (Settings > Discount) - which your company gives to BeeWallet users. 6. Receipt of funds is, perhaps, the best solution that exists in the existing market. You can send someone your address with qr, send your address with a QR with the amount, send the invoice to another BeeWallet user or a registered company, send a link to the account to the mail to anyone and at the same time track whether the invoice was paid or not. It is worth noting that you can send money from your personal wallet to the company only in one case - by paying the bill. The next step is the API and 2000 users.",False

Sorry I'm having a hard time absorbing what you're trying to say anyway I'm just wondering do the team have a group of people that's assigned to promote this project? Because so far I haven't seen this project being promoted in youtube nor in twitter yet but I've seen some people posting about it on facebook but it's not present in the facebook ads section, or maybe I just didn't notice. I just think that It's always important to have a really good promotional team for a project to be successful, seeing the targeted amount it's quite big, so in order for this project to definitely achieved its targeted amount this project needs to be known by a lot of people beacause so far the community is still quite small, so that it will attract a huge market and a large number of big investors.",False

You are absolutely right. And our mistake is that we are developing the product, and did not go to the ICO, like everyone else, with beautiful pictures only. The presence of the product places restrictions on discounts and bonuses. For example, we can not afford to give investors a 70-90% discount in the ICO process, as 95% of the projects did.

We have already created a brand strategy for the token, which will ensure the growth of the value of the token. This strategy consists of three large sections: 1. Positive news about BEEQB. Since the product is already at the beta testing stage, the first news after the release of the token on the exchange will be the launch of a stable version of the product and the announcement of the first customers.  2. New markets and new customers. Already after entering the token on the exchange, you can pay in Bitcoin in 5 countries: Great Britain, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Russia. The opening of new markets will also be a positive news. In March-April, we plan to launch the BEE payment platform, that is, you will be able to pay for goods in BEE.  3. Expansion of the BEEQB functional. We plan to launch several unique services by the end of spring, which will be appreciated by an even wider audience of customers.

Most likely, that hype will not be. There are several reasons for this, which I consider important to sound: Reason # 1: The advertising budget for the ICO will eat the lion's share of the liquidity of the token. This is justified if the project has no product and its creators can not ensure its creation. We are creating a product that will enter the market in the coming months. To date, BEEQB is a sample of the project's antiscores. And every crypto-investor says ""there would be more such projects"", while everyone says - create a hype. But for us it means to freeze the development of the project for several months. That is, to fire employees, hire marketers and advertisers and swing traffic to ""pictures"" and promises of a beautiful future. This is not our path. Reason # 2: We are aware that current investors are our best friends and they will get far more benefits from friendship with us than from investing in any project. Reason # 3: Most projects reflect this way: ""If we raise funds, then we will implement our project, we will not assemble it, well, it's okay."" We do not think so. We create a product that is really needed by the market, customers, business and all those who hold the crypto currency. Regardless of whether someone likes BEEQB or not, sooner or later you will become our user, because there is no alternative and will not be. Only then, we are sure that the token will cost 10-20 times more expensive. And this will not happen in a year or two. This will happen next year. It is a fact. Therefore, an investment in BEEQB is a necessity for the entire crypto community.",False

Do you know that only Bitcoin is accepted for payment? Do you know that there is only one “store” that allows you to make payments for the “second” crypto currency? No? We will not keep intrigue and immediately say: this article is our personal, analytical material, which, in our opinion, will allow investors, clients and interested enthusiasts to penetrate a little more deeply the problems that we are trying to solve. Really. There is not a single store in the world that accepts any currency other than Bitcoin. More correctly, there is one that takes yours Etheres, converts to Fiat and instead of you makes purchases on Amazon. But this is not a shop. This is a big, more likely, unsolvable problem, especially since Bitcoin has high volatility, and the “speed” of Bitcoin can be made up of legends. We have witnessed ICO several products that are torturing the illusion of introducing their own tokens as a means of payment for the mass market. Token on the basis of Ethereum, of course. One can agree that UTrust, Monetha and STK began to take the first steps to ensure that the business received a tool for receiving crypto-currency payments. But, each of the listed has a significant drawback, which makes us say that these services can not solve the current situation — they are all a payment transport, which makes an already expensive transaction (services are calculated for an average check of $ 5–15, and when a low average check platform fee and mining fee can reach up to 30% of the check) is even more expensive by 1–1.5%. If to simplify, then Monetha is a payment service based on Ethereum, UTrust is a processing platform based on Ethereum, and STK is a rival of Apple and Android Pay, based on Ethereum. What innovations can you expect from tools that, at the start, already have strong competitors? And most importantly, the need for them, business, is questionable. These services will work well where there is a legal base for circulation of crypto currency and in the business that is ready to spend another 5 to 10% for the output of tokens in Fiat. Do you also wonder where it is?  There are several questions, the search for an answer to which, deprives each of the companies of interest of future customers: 1. Can I instantly bring tokens to Fiat without going to exchange? — No. 2. What if the rate of the token collapses? Does this mean that I will lose money? — Yes. 3. The Token exists on the Ethereum network and is its token, what if Ethereum itself collapses or does it have another fork? Will your token fail? — Yes. — Will, together with Ethereum, your network also be unstable? — Yes  We brought these services because potential customers and investors of BEEQB often compare us to each other.  In contrast to the “competitors” BEEQB goes on a different path. We create a payment terminal that accepts Bitcoin and BEE, while the transaction confirmation on the Bitcoin network does not exceed 40 seconds (using the BEE wallet and wallets of our partners), and BEE payment is made in 1.84 seconds. At the same time, upon receipt of funds to the account, the company can immediately, rightly receive funds to the bank account without entering the exchange or making any additional transactions. So we guarantee business: 1. The legal purity of the transaction; 2. Absence of losses when converting to Fiat; 3. Independence in choosing the currency of payment acceptance; 4. The ability to pay crypto currency to other platform customers, including employees and suppliers. An important aspect is the fact that BEEQB does not need complicated and expensive integration. It is enough to download the program to the cash register and get started. Somewhat chaotic, but we hope that we explained why BEEQB has no competitors and why “competitors” will most likely not be in demand by the market. Token Presale live.

Technological changes and additions in the development process of BEEQB. 1. We decided to change the front end technological solution. And in the coming month we will migrate from AngularJS to ReactJS. There are several reasons for this, one of which is the need for a more universal solution that requires significantly less resources at high loads. 2. We started developing our own wallet, which will support Bitcoin and BEE. This decision is dictated by the need to develop a much more functional wallet than what is now. The main functions that we put into the wallet: 1. BEE currency support; 2. Ability to add a user to the account (use of one wallet by several users); 3. Set daily and monthly limits for other users of the wallet; 4. Support for the SnappyConfirm protocol - a quick confirmation of the transaction in the Bitcoin network with any mining fee; 5. Creation of corporate wallets.",False

Therefore, we decided to fix the rate at the time of investing and at the time of sending the tokens. And count the number of tokens purchased at a larger rate. Thank you for being with us.",False

Japan, Bahrain, Estonia, the United States, Denmark, Sweden, South Korea, the Netherlands, Finland, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia, anyway allow you to pay in the cryptocurrency. According to Bloomberg, 100,000 companies around the world accept cryptocurrency payments. In another 15,000 companies you can pay the crypt without any restrictions. In this case you can use cryptocurrency same as use cash. However, if you compare the buying process with cash and cryptocurrency, you can find some, none solved problems.  The process of buying by cash looks like this:   1. You: come to the cashier; 2. Seller: $35, please; 3. You: get a wallet out of your pocket and pay the bill. 4. At the same time, if you only have a $ 50 bills, you will get a change at the checkout; 5. The transaction is completed At the same time, the company loses from encashment, crediting funds to the account, hidden and public bank payments, which ultimately becomes a reason of price increasing of the goods.  With the cryptocurrency everything is different. Today, there is no store where prices are quoted in Bitcoin. Therefore, the buying process looks like this:   1. You: come to the cashier; 2. Seller: Calculates the amount of the goods, and recounts to Bitcoin (at the company's internal rate); 3. Seller: 0.33BTC, please; 4. You: Get the smartphone, scan the QR code, transfer the specified amount; 5. You: Wait until the funds come to the account, and this can take more then 12 hours, and only after that you can pick up the purchases; 6. The transaction is completed Also, such a transaction is not legal and the company will have to pay a substantial fine and in most countries of the world.  Seller can make a mistake in the rate calculations, transaction can be failed, your phone can lose connection or you can be out of internet.  Progress does not stand on one place and the next milestone in the introduction of cryptocurrency into the mass market should be the developed infrastructure for accepting payments in the retail and corporate markets. The start of the next milestone, by our opinion, should be the emergence of business systems for transactions with native support for crypto-currencies. BeeQB is a such a system. It should include a mechanism for receiving funds and a mechanism for confirming the payment of the transaction.  In fact, BeeQB is a new ecosystem where entrepreneurs can absolutely legally get payment in the cryptocurrency, and buyers can safely, accurately and without overpay use the cryptocurrency for reckoning. Thus, in fact, a new economic cluster is created, connecting real business and the world of crypto-currencies.  How does BeeQB work? Cryptocurrency is a tool of peer-to-peer payments and this fact is the main brake on the globalization of cryptocurrency payments.  In the BeeQB we changed the principle of route of transactions. When the seller asks necessity amount from buyer. That is, in order to seller receive ""0.33BTC"", the seller should set a stable payment terminal. Like it works in Visa. In order to do this, we need to develop a new currency with a new consensus and a new paradigm of application. A currency that would combine all the best from cash and electronic money and would be deprived of their weaknesses. That’s why we’re creating BEE.  It looks like this:   1. You: make me burger – $5, I wil pay in BEE. 2. Seller: Selects payment in BEE, (The system automatically recalculates the BEE rate based on the rate on the selected stock exchange, bills at the time of the transaction, for example ""3.15 BEE”); 4. You: Bring the phone to the payment terminal. The terminal scans the QR-code on the phone, verifies it. The payment instantly goes to the seller's account minus 0.1%. That is, the company instantly receives not only a confirmation of payment, but also the payment. 5. The transaction is completed.  We understand that it is easier to develop a new cryptocurrency, rather than making it popular and in demand. Therefore, at the same time with the development of BEE, we are developing an infrastructure solution for the BEE service, which is named BeeQB. BeeQB combines all the necessary tools for doing business and it is a tool of working with BEE.   RoadMap   1. 2014 - the birth of the idea of BEEQB; 2. 2015-2016 MVP creation; 3. May 2017 first beta version of product; 4. August 2017 - BEEQB works in the Motiv; 5. September 2017 – BEEQB tested by 140 companies; 6. September 2017 – BEEQB works in the Pack4baG; 7.

Creation of electronic cash registers. 20. Q2 2019 - the network of more than 10,000,000 customers; 21. Q2 2020 - in the network of more than 100,000,000 customers 22. Q3 2020 - the integration of BEEQB and the BEEQB API into 2,000,000 outlets worldwide, including 10% of AAA retailers. BEE uses 300 million users. The total turnover of trade operations in BEE is more than $ 100 billion.  BEEQB team   Advisory board   First clients To launch beeqb, the strategic partners of the project will provide their own user base. We think, at least, on the coverage of 15,000 active users, access to which will be possible without additional advertising costs from the outset. This will provide us with a strong foundation for further development and rapid growth of the profitability and profitability of the project.  Token functions BEEQB tokens will be used on the BeeQB platform and will not be limited to the platform in the future. BEEQB tokens can be used for the following purposes: 1. As a currency for online and offline purchases / sales of goods and services; 2. Accrual of interest on sales to owners of copyright on property; 3. Purchases of premium accounts for wholesale and retailers; 4. To buy BigData analytics.  Why now? At the moment, the real business and the market of cryptocurrency are not connected with each other. Between them there is no safe and affordable way to exchange. The turnover of the Crypto-currency market exceeded $ 100 billion, and hundreds of thousands of people are cryptocurrency holders, who are deprived of the possibility of a simple and affordable method of paying for real goods. From this gap between the worlds, both, end customers and business suffer. We represent BeeQB - the first business platform for legal settlements between holders of cryptocurrency and real business around the world.
