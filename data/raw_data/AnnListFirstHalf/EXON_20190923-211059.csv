The solution will combine blockchain technology and unique digital user identities.  The introduction of blockchain technology has drastically changed the mechanism of workflow in cross-border trade which can help in improving overall customer experience without compromising the safety of sensitive information.  Silsal was conceived to address the gap in the market for exporters and importers, to provide easy public access to transaction status updates, reduce the need for paperwork, calls and physical visits, as well as to speed up information exchanges. Initially, the technology will be offered to freight forwarders and their customers, and subsequently extended to the rest of the trade community as a complementary tool to the existing mPCS, Maqta‚Äôs Port Community System.

It records and checks every transaction, which makes the network safe and reliable. This technology eliminates the need for any third-party or central authority for transactions or exchanges. Users control all their information. The data are complete, consistent, timely, accurate and widely available. Operations can shorten the transaction time to minutes and be processed without days off. Projects based on Blockchain are decentralized and the risk of hacking is zero.  Therefore, many companies are developing projects using this technology. The second reason is the attractiveness of investments. Earlier, in order to invest in start-ups, it was necessary to go through a bureaucratic procedure and the threshold of minimum investment was quite large. Now everyone can invest in any project.  Ethereum is one of the largest projects on the Blockchain. Developers created a platform that can benefit programmers, entrepreneurs, social entrepreneurs.  Blockchain is a technological trend that affects very quickly various industries and companies around the world. It is expected that the global market of Blockchain projects will cost 20 billion dollars in 2024. The average investment in such projects in 2017 exceeded $ 1 million.  One such project is Export.Online. A team from the real sector that offers solutions to the existing problems and complexities of exporters associated with starting and operating in international trade. The project combines disparate tools and databases in a one-stop-shop mode, allowing clients to reduce their time to prepare and execute an international transaction more than 3 times. Thanks to cooperation with leading financial institutions and service companies, the whole range of services accompanying international trade will be realized on the platform: factoring, bank guarantees, trade finance, deferred payment of customs duties, logistics services, a smart contract, arbitration of bargains and more.",False

Are there more problems than solutions?‚Äù  In the world economy, logistics is a key factor in trade and, therefore, an important factor in the welfare of the state. Current logistics systems are inherently unstable due to emissions of hazardous materials (CO2, NOx, particulate matter), noise and high prices, which must be paid for in terms of infrastructure load. While the European Commission set a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in 2015 to 60% compared with 1990, the share of greenhouse gases increased from 25% in 1990 to 36% today.  Here are the main problems logistics is facing today:  Reducing transport costs: rising fuel prices increased wages, and peak inflation indices increase transportation costs on a daily basis.  Processing huge amounts of information: logistics managers have to process a lot of data every day, in addition to coordinating the smooth execution of operations. The scope of their work includes ensuring security and personnel, downloading materials, checking route maps, authorizing bills for fuel, etc.  Compliance with the rules: The rules of transportation, standards and safety can vary from city to city, from state to state and, quite obviously, from country to country. This leads to the fact that it is difficult for parties to agree on a mutually beneficial solution.  The international platform Export.Online offers a solution of these problems. The project combines disparate tools and databases in one-stop-shop mode, allowing Clients to reduce their time for preparation and execution of an international transaction by more than 3 times and improve the efficiency of their business by increasing the productivity of their employees. Users do not need to have a large staff or independently look for different professionals on outsourcing, it is enough to connect to the platform and implement the entire process there.

While the current market simply couldn't absorb the huge amount of additional investment in such a short time, the level of investment shows that firms and investors are ready to get on board, but the market currently is not ready. The reduction of popularity of cryptocurrencies may be a result of a drop in price of lots of cryptocurrencies . in January 2018 discusses search patterns of the previous three months, and suggests that general interest in crypto has dropped so significantly, the price could ultimately hit $7,100. This was an understatement compared to what really occurred. Back in February, the price of bitcoin briefly fell below $6,000 in what was considered a new low following ‚ÄúRed Tuesday‚Äù and the recent sell-off that had taken place. However, the overall interest in cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology remains.  Venture capital being invested into upcoming projects will likely be more beneficial for the advancement and development of blockchain technology compared to investing into a cryptocurrency position directly. There are some great cryptocurrency and blockchain projects in existence currently, but over the following months we may see projects that are truly game-changers.

It is an international trading platform that is created to solve the existing problems of exporters associated with the start and conduct of activities in international trade.

The WallMart retailer was one of the first to believe in the bright future of Blockchain, it is testing a new IBM technology for mango supplies in the US and pork in China. Blockchain will provide full information about any goods entered in the database in seconds.  Blockchain creates a digital record of the operation in a distributed computer network, providing almost instantaneous execution of safe and standardized transactions (including cross-border transactions).  The birth of such technologies should be welcomed by regulators. The large-scale adoption of Blockchain is especially beneficial for importers and exporters: it provides them with access to financial resources, which many of them lack today.  Blockchain is capable to render assistance to business in the solution ofthe mentioned problems in two aspects. First, the transition to this technology provides a fundamentally new level of security: Blockchain allows not only to digitize contracts and other paper documents, but also to provide digital identifiers for the goods themselves. As a result, the risk of non-fulfillment of contractual obligations disappears (or substantially decreases).  Secondly, Blockchain enables the companies participating in the transaction to enter data and receive information about the goods in real time, without using their own digital infrastructure. As a result, companies and financial institutions have the maximum amount of information, which allows users to conduct transactions without the risk of non-fulfillment of contractual obligations of one of the parties.

What are we waiting for?  It‚Äôs hard to imagine a person who has the Internet, and who has never heard of ICO. In 2017, this method of attracting investment has become a record holder in terms of speed and volumes of collected amounts, as well as in the number of curious, and sometimes frankly fraudulent situations.  However, such way to quickly attract capital is not only full og with new ideas, but also scammers who want to mislead unqualified investors and illegally obtain other people‚Äôs money. Similar cases often occurred in 2017, such as the crypto star-tup Confido, whose founders disappeared from $ 375,000 after the ICO.  ICO is a very young and not yet adequately regulated tool. But already some countries began to control the industry. In the middle of 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States (SEC) published an explanation of ICO and their risks and a comparison with traditional methods of investment. On September 4, 2017, seven Chinese financial regulators officially banned all ICOs in the People‚Äôs Republic of China, demanding that the proceeds from all the ICOs that had already passed were refunded to investors, otherwise the offender would be ‚Äúseverely punished according to law‚Äù. ICO is also banned in South Korea at the legislative level. At the same time on March 8, 2018 in The Korea Times there was a message that the authorities are planning to legalize the ICO, explaining this by the need to promote technology based on the Blockchain.  In September 2017, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) published a guide on legal responsibilities for companies that organize the ICO.  Regulation is a complex process where it is necessary to find a balance between protecting the interests of participants in the cryptocurrency market and improper control and appropriation of private funds. Hope that this balance will be achieved, and the market of cryptocurrency will become safer. There is a need and even there are tools for the legal regulation of relations in the crypto-currency market.  All this means that going to the ICO will become more difficult, and only professional teams will do it. And from this it follows that the total number of ICO start-ups will decrease, but the percentage of trustworthy and profitable projects will grow.  One of such successful project whose ICO is about to start soon is Export.Online. The platform is created to solve existing problems in the international trade. The main target audience of the project are companies that produce goods and services that want to enter a fundamentally new level of business and significantly expand the market for their products. The advantages of the platform can be used not only by manufacturers, but also by distributors, retailers, government agencies and organizers of international exhibitions. The list of potential users also includes service companies that provide their services in the fields of logistics, transfers, customs, legal support, tax issues, expert analytics in the areas of marketing, insurance, etc.  Overall, ICO will reach a new, more professional level. Both from the point of view of the development of the crypto-industry, and from the position of investment.",False

Issued tokens can have different functions. For example, if these are ICO cryptocurrencies, investors buy tokens, which in the future may grow in value.  Formally, a token is a gadget or an array of characters used to identify users.  Much more interesting is the functional description of tokens. They can simultaneously represent have such characteristics:  Have a purchasing ability -you can buy for them services and goods; Exercise the role of currency in a closed ecosystem; To be an indicator of a shareholder‚Äôs share in an ‚Äúenterprise‚Äù; A significant indicator of something (the number of available gigabytes to load); Form of remuneration for some actions.  That is, a token can simultaneously be used as a reward tool in a game, and also be a unit of account.  This is one of the principal differences between tokens and the coins. Cryptocurrency is designed for payments and transactions. Its main function is the purchasing power. Tokens have a wider range of applications, but smaller scales. In addition to being used to obtain services and purchase certain products, tokens can also be the basis of a loyalty program or a digital share.  In this case, cryptocurrency, if one may so express it, circulates in the external digital economy. Tokens, at least at the initial stage, support the operation of a closed ecosystem. They do not have a public purse and a Blockchain, like the main cryptocurrencies.  Most of tokens are issued on the Ethereum Blockchain, so-called ERC20 format.  Let‚Äôs take for example tokens of ICO Export.Online. The following platform is is created to solve the existing problems and difficulties of exporters associated with the start and conduct of activities in international trade. The token name is Exon. It is the ERC20 format. They can be purchased during pre-ICO or ICO. It serves as ‚Äò‚Äôfuel‚Äô‚Äô for transactions within the platform.  Overall, the ICO market is growing very fast.

However, this format is losing popularity. This year, ICO was the money-raising (initial coin offering) - a form of attracting investments in the form of selling to investors a fixed number of tokens received by a single or accelerated emission. For 2017 ICOs raised $ 2.7 billion.  To determine the reasons for the popularity of the ICO, it is enough to recall the modern phenomenon of crowdfunding, because with this method of attracting money for the development of the project, ICO has more in common with the classical investment tools. Actually, crowdfunding somewhat pressed the traditional IPO (the initial offer of shares), where the investor in exchange for money receives shares and the corporate rights that are conditioned by them. In turn, the ICO scheme has become an even more perfect mechanism for attracting investment, and in some cases is better suited for this purpose than crowdfunding.   For people behind the ICO, the initial monetary offer is a convenient option for implementing their own ideas. To run a cryptocurrency start-up, one does not need to conduct audits, take loans for a crazy percentage. And there is no need for any guarantees. Because of the complete lack of regulation and lack of accountability, ICO has become so popular.   The most famous case of a successful ICO is the creation of the Ethereum cryptocurrency (Ether). In 2014, the company released tokens, and after a while these tokens radically rose in price. Within this ICO, $ 18 million was raised, but now the capitalization of the currency has reached $ 4.6 billion. In total, for the year 2014, $ 31 million was collected for various projects, a record year was 2016 with $ 210 million.  Another successful  example is  Export.Online, the  platform, whose ICO is about to start soon. This is an innovative international trading platform, oriented initially to the needs of exporters. The main target audience of the project are companies that produce goods and services that want to enter a fundamentally new level of business and significantly expand the market for their products.

The main attention was focused on the problems of non-primary exports and the solutions offered by the platform. The absence of an automated tool that makes it easier to enter the international market is what the concept of the project pays attention to. ‚ÄúThe marketplace works wonderfully if we‚Äôre talking about imports, and if it comes to exports, there are a lot of nuances.‚Äù What steps does the exporter take and what questions does he ask before leaving his product for another market? ‚Äú‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe question was posed directly from the position of the company, which faces the need to overcome a large number of obstacles to the delivery of goods abroad. To optimize the process of entering the international market, B2B United Trade as a functional offers detailed export statistics for different countries (customs statistics). All the data is accumulated in one window, and the blockchain captures the change in the reputation of counterparties. Thus, the platform provides a detailed rating of service campaigns, significantly reducing the time spent searching for the necessary information by the supplier. ‚ÄúNow the process of export to a new country the company takes at least six months, taking into account the solution of all problems.‚Äù The question is speeding up processes, accumulating information, and literate translation, ‚Äú sums up Natalia. At the moment, the biggest risks are related to exports, so the project‚Äôs goal is to increase its security and provide more comfortable conditions for the actions of exporters.",False

There is no one-stop-shop system for a participant in foreign trade activities In the market there is no ""button"" or site, which would solve all the tasks facing the exporter. In order to start exporting goods abroad, the company needs to undergo many stages. Taking into account the disconnected sources of information and tools, the process of preparing for export now takes half a year for companies.
