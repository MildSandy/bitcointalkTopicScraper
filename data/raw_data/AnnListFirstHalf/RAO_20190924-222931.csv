Our ICO opened on March 1st and is running right now.  Our hard cap is $3.3M.  1 RAO = .10¢ USD.  We have 34 different tiers/packages.  The smallest number of tokens is 500 and the largest is 250,000 tokens.  Our ICO site is https://rao.radioyo.fm.  So, we're meeting the milestones we've set for ourselves.  Not sure what you mean by patent. Are you referring to patenting our technology?  There have been no changes to the initial plan.  Later this week we're going to announce a contest to design our wallet, stay tuned for details and what you can win, and we're also starting to use the IPFS protocol to add podcaster information to the blockchain.

Easy to use services and products also make up the decentralized Ecosystem allowing for a seamless experience for consumers, and access to RadioYo APIs via a developer marketplace gives developers entre to build AI, apps, bots, feeds, and algorithms on top of the platform.
