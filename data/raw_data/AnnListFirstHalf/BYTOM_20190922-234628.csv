Recently, Bytom blockchain launched a Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) platform Bystack, which serves to help enterprises establish and manage blockchain networks easily for commercial applications. The white paper of Bystack was also released.  The unique mainchain-sidechain BUTXO model platform Bystack is created by Bytom team, optimizing the consensus algorithm, smart contract, scalability, privacy and cross-chain interoperability of current Bytom blockchain. Customers can use Bystack to deploy and manage a blockchain network for different business scenarios with low costs and high efficiency. Bystack is a safe, scalable and user-friendly one-stop solution for developers and enterprises.  The mainchain is responsible for issuing and destroying assets with decentralization and security. The sidechains are responsible for running large-scale commercial applications, and the sidechains sacrifice part of the decentralization to greatly improve performance. An unlimited number of sidechains could co-exist to meet different commercial application needs.  The unique mainchain-sidechain BUTXO model, flexible and innovative consensus algorithm, enhanced security and privacy protection make Bytack applicable to various scenarios, such as Royalty Redemption, Copyright Confirmation, Product Traceability, Supply-chain Finance, Digital Government, Decentralized Trading, Distributed Identity System, Blockchain Games, Company Equity Management and so on. Currently, several projects about Royalty Redemption, Blockchain Contracts, and Digital Government are under test on Bystack and will be used on a large scale before long.  Bystack breaks the dilemma of blockchain impossible triangle  Many people agree that the blockchain system is now facing an impossible triangle: decentralization, security, and scalability/high performance. If security is indispensable for all Baas platforms, then it’s a binary paradox between decentralization and high performance.  In light of the stacking experience of the Internet TCP/IP protocol, a layered model may solve the blockchain binary paradox while building a complete commercial application architecture. Bytack breaks the dilemma and achieves both decentralization and scalability via a structure combining one mainchain and multiple sidechains. In Bystack, the mainchain Bytom blockchain is connected to the sidechain Vapor through a communication protocol called Federation, which is a cross-chain solution in essence. This solution realizes the transfer of digital assets across chains.  As Layer 1 and the mainchain in Bystack, Bytom blockchain provides a permissionless environment that guarantees decentralization. Assets’ issuance, transmission, and destruction are all initiated on the mainchain and then pegged into sidechains through Federation protocol. At the same time, digital fingerprint of all assets could be stored and certified on the mainchain. The PoW consensus algorithm of Bytom blockchain ensures transaction security and data immutability.  The sidechain and Layer 2 of Bystack adopts BFT consensus algorithm to improve efficiency of transactions and the TPS of sidechain can be as high as 100,000. The combination of a mainchain and sidechains brings both the decentralization of a public chain and the high performance of private chains or consortium chains. Bystack ’s mainchain needs to be secure and stable, so performance, scalability and more innovative attempts will be implemented on sidechains.  Meanwhile, Bytom team also created a unique consensus algorithm based on DPoS+BBFT for sidechains in Bystack. The community first vote for nodes utilizing DPoS and then selected nodes to reach a consensus utilizing BBFT. It takes only 0.5 seconds to generate a new block. BBFT is derived from Byzantine fault tolerant (PBFT) consensus and allows less than one-third nodes to misbehave. BBFT reaches a balance between network communication complexity and transaction completeness. The combination of DPoS and BBFT significantly improves the efficiency of sidechains.  In addition, enterprise or individual can use existing sidechain, or can generate their own sidechain and build their own application on the sidechain. Assets on mainchain is pegged to sidechain through Federation and then circulated within the sidechain. The sidechain supports pluggable consensus, database plugins, which can be better matched to meet actual business needs.  High performance is important but security and privacy also matter  Bystack deploys mainchain-sidechain isolation as well as sidechain-sidechain isolation. If one sidechain is attacked or affected, it will not affect the operation of mainchain and other sidechains, which enhances the entire network’s stability. In Federation protocol, through peg-in and peg-out between mainchain and sidechains, collectors, validators and other roles ensure that the asset transfer process is divided into multiple processes to prevent single validator from misbehaving.  Bystack Layer 2 uses the DPoS+BBFT consensus algorithm to provide high-availability Byzantine fault tolerance. Automatic recovery of consensus state, mutual recovery of blockchain data, automatic equalization of data storage, and automatic routing of node services, guarantee the security and stability of the network itself.  BUTXO model adopted by the mainchain Bytom blockchain is also innovation on security and privacy. BUTXO improves the Bitcoin UTXO model and supports multiple asset transactions. Each BUTXO is locked by an independent contract. Hacking a single contract can only get access to the assets locked by that contract, and other assets are not affected, thus protecting the assets on the mainchain. Due to the statelessness of BUTXO, the anonymity of users is enhanced to some extent.  Bystack offers a full range of privacy protection of transaction and contract with a combination of encryption algorithms. For example, for multi-sign transactions, the Schnorr signature and the MuSig algorithm are used to verify multiple signatures. Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP ) is used to encrypt the amount of transaction. MimbleWimble can be used to encrypt both the transaction address and the transaction amount. High configuration of Bystack ensures flexibility and makes it adapt to different user scenarios.",False

In the blockchain era, however, thousands of cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, BTM pop up, and the way of tradings has changed from  people-to-people to people-to-AI or AI-to-AI payments.  Therefore how can we stimulate the efficient and free circulation of multiple digital assets to  inject fresh vitality into the cryptocurrency market?  Duan Xinxing, CEO of Bytom delivered a speech at 2018 Bytom global dev conference which was held in Hangzhou on Nov. 11 and proposed solutions in terms of programming languages, side chain and cross-chain technologies and three-layer architecture. In his speech, he also detailed the progress of Bytom and the project’s  future development.  1542850161(1)     Here is a full transcript of Duan’s speech:  Blockchain and Digital Assets  For some, blockchain is seen as a software that has certain codes to crack some specific problems and needs periodic upgrades. Others think blockchain is a protocol which defines how participants on the blockchain interact with each other, just like TCP/IP.  Of course, blockchain is indeed a platform, especially true in public blockchains which allows developers to build various applications upon it as a network operating system does. To put it simply, “blockchain is an open source campaign powered by economic incentives”.  As some people are curious about the differences between Bytom and Ethereum or Bitcoin, the answer is quite simple: the vision of Bytom is create diverse assets and a programmable economy. During the development process of Bytom, we have made two expansions:  First, expand cash into diverse assets. Divers assets include native digital assets, the types of assets generated by the blockchainization of physical assets, and more complex interactive assets;  Second, expand the Bytom-based payment into various activities in a well-functioned economy such as registration, issuance, settlement, and transaction. Hence a simple payment system has turned into a programming economy with diverse assets.  1542850185(1)  Two Reasons Behind Using Diverse Assets  Duan points out two critical reasons: one is post-90s or even post-95s generation’s views on the world have radically changed. The renminbi and the banknote themselves are a kind of virtual asset.The paper money’s value is created based on the users’ consensus and public’s understanding of its role to play in various occasions.  It is natural that new generations fully embrace diversified digital assets just as we embraced paper money decades ago.Therefore, I think the arrival of Gen Z will promote the prosperity of diverse assets , a fact widely accepted by the public.  The second reason touches on the development of artificial intelligence(AI), the Internet of Things(IoT), and the Machine Economy. You can’t imagine a legal gateway sitting between two IoT devices, like the bank to clear and settle transactions.  In the future, the machine-to-machine interactions require different types of assets in a more efficient operating environment and intelligent environment. In fact, we’ve found that the automatic data purchase based on Bytom enables the encryption of both sides’ public keys to generate two types of assets so that the latter public key holder can interact with the original owner. The intermediate platform is unable to decrypt data in the process, thus ensuring the data safety.  Bytom to Support Diverse Assets and Technical Development  As of today, 1714 product statuses of Bytom has been submitted and 27 versions has been iterated since the first test Network beta version released . Bytom has 28 core developers and attracted the attention of roughly 1000 developers globally. Bytom full-node wallet latest version is 1.0.7 at the press time.  In terms of Bytom’s product design and architecture, we adopt a classic model —UTXO or an unspent transaction output— rather than the popular model endorsed by other public chains which requires users to set up an account first, and then to create a contract in the account to control asset flows. Bytom itself is a native asset public chain that is born for assets.  We continue to extend UTXO structure and give different tags to UTXO so that different types of assets will be generated.Assets on Bytom blockchain can be divided into small amounts, as well as UTXO. If the asset needs to be programmable, we can develop a programmable language on it, and use UTXO to do complex operations. Assets can also be destroyed. We still adopt a safer and more efficient model to build our asset system.  1542850222(1)  Bytom’s technology boasts two features:  Firstly, BUTXO supports more types of assets;  Secondly, different from Bitcoin’s temporary script of a transaction, Bytom develops our own high-level programming language, defines a certain type of asset and corresponding parameters and conduct intelligent operations with multi-signature. To this end, Bytom has put forward its own Equity language, which is a Turing complete and interpretive high-level language.  Many participants in the latest Bytom Dev Conference used the langue, which is beyond expectation. We have never thought about the anti-counterfeiting, traceability and registration solutions powered by Bytom blockchain for copyrighted work. But developers have implemented these features by calling the function.  Bytom’s tech stack adopts three-layer architecture due to the existence of a ‘Blockchain Trilemma’. The key issue for a blockchain is how to balance security and efficiency. In real life, the problem can be solved with a product and engineering perspective. The underlying protocol is  focused on security, while layer 2 and layer 3 for concurrency, scalability, and efficiency and programmability.  Currently, Bytom provides developers around the world with a development template and tools, as well as 8 contract templates, including single-signature contracts, multi-signature contracts,  crypto-to-crypto trading contracts, trusted third party custodian contract, loan contracts, call option contract and betting contracts. Many developers have made a lot of interesting things, for example, Greek developers have designed three types of assets for government environmental agencies and chemical companies with the use of the multi-signature contract and other features. Each type of asset can identify the amount of emissions and waste.  Moreover, scientific data extracted from the process can add indicators for Ethereum. Hence it is possible to program more and more social relations and production relations.  Besides, our own core developers are also conducting active explorations. Two sentences— ‘Information is Power. Computing is power.’— is written in the Genesis block of Bytom. But what is ‘Computing is power’? Does it mean we should blindly worship ‘power’?  Information can be considered as power and play a role in the social development because everyone can obtain information from the Internet and it brings benefit to the public. Yet traditional monopoly of computing power cannot benefit everyone.  1542850248(1)  Numerous entrepreneurs and research institutions flock in the artificial intelligence(AI) space, and a large number of NGOs are working on bioinformatics processing, speech recognition, image recognition and data processing, but they do not control computing power. What does computing mean to them? Can they use Bytom blockchain to do improvement? Our exploration has proved that it is a possible development direction.  The left image shows Bytom’s mining pool. This calculation method that supports inference learning has been included in Bytom’s consensus algorithm. When there is a certain task, we can identify the redundant and idle computational power as an asset in Bytom, and then leverage the  computational power to facilitate tradings so that AI companies which have data but lack of computational power or those that have creative and visionary ideas can get access to computing assets via Bytom, advancing the development of AI industry.  Dapp is not the Only Direction  Bytom is a fledgling blockchain. The white paper was published in June 2017;the mainnet was released on April 24, 2018; the virtual machine and programming language were unveiled in July 2018. In August, Bytom announced the launch of its Global Dev Competition, an event  committed to promoting the application of blockchain technology and strengthening the exchange and collision of technical peers in both China and abroad.  Dapp is not necessarily the only development direction in the future for Bytom, because the amount of daily activity and the usability of DApps on other public chains are very low.We  currently focus on supporting the developer community and Dapps. Bytom is not only a Dapp, but also serves as an accessory and a plug-in in the system.  Blockchain itself cannot solve all problems, but as a technology, it can work together with other technologies to generate a set of solutions to more problems.  Bytom faces two challenges in the future. For a start, it needs to achieve scalability based on the  Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus; the second challenge is how to develop more scalable applications with high usability on a higher level.  Bytom now is dedicated to building side chains on the network. For one thing, BUTXO offers better concurrency;for another, side chains and subchain models with the application layer can solve such problems. For example, we are able to develop subchains for national secret test scenarios, deploy nodes, and perform various debugging and configuration upon the blockchain to meet specific requirements.  Meanwhile, Bytom partners with many top universities and research institutions to develop Zero-Knowledge Proof technology. The next step for Bytom is to enhance school-enterprise and international cooperation. We plan to work with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Tongji University and Tsinghua University to improve our research teams of engineering, underlying protocols and patents.  It can be seen that developers from all over the world contribute to the launch of this Dev conference and the creation of Bytom ecosystem. At present, Bytom is among only a few public blockchains in China that enjoy a relatively complete community of blockchain developers . We have a community of about 600 active developers from China, the US, Japan and South Korea. Further we will expand cooperation with enterprises and institutions to develop more meaningful service products for the real economy and virtual economy in the future.  1542850271(1)  In the end, what does Bytom meaB? It connects bit world and atom world. Some say Bytom refers to a type of asset and value, while others think it represents liquidity and consistency, as well as information and matter. Here we want to emphasize that Bytom is a technology platform , a kind of technical means or a technology open source campaign. Further, Bytom also means technology and prosperity. We hope Bytom and blockchain technology can drive great social progress and the economic prosperity.",False

More and more elements of the physical world are getting transmitted into the digital world. With the rising relevance of big data, computing power plays a more central role in technological advancement. First came the tools that allowed us to work via digital platforms, such as email and software. Then came currencies that allowed peer-to-peer transfer of value over the digital world, such as Bitcoin. The next phase in consideration is a system where every valuable thing (that can be exchanged) is migrated to the digital world. Examples of things like that include equities, securitized assets, dividends, bonds, and so on. Bytom is a protocol and a blockchain for the exchange and interaction of real-world assets. Bytom is different from Ethereum, as it focuses on putting real-world assets on its blockchain. Specifically, Bytom focuses on avoiding the replication of real-world assets on the blockchain, resolving compliance issues as digital assets are linked to physical assets, and bridging the gap between the physical world and the digital world. What Does Bytom Do? Bytom is basically a digital asset layer protocol. It enables individuals and institutions to build financial and digital asset applications. Stocks, bonds, and any kind of secure data can also be exchanged on the blockchain. Bytom aims to map assets in the physical world to the digital world and create an ecosystem where there is interoperability between these 2 forms. There are 3 types of assets on the Bytom blockchain that can be exchanged: - Income assets, which include non-performing assets, fixed local government investments, home-stay properties, etc. - Equity assets, which include equity of non-listed companies, equity of private funds, etc. Transferring equity assets requires qualified investor verification. - Securitized assets, which includes debts, automobile loans, etc. Generally, these are assets that can generate predictable cash flows. These assets are tradable on-chain with the Bytom protocol. Bytom cuts out the middlemen in asset transfers and recordkeeping, which leads to faster transactions and lower costs. Also, the assets are more secure on a blockchain than with a third-party organization. Users can create their asset-backed security on the Bytom blockchain by registering and tokenizing their assets via smart contract. Bytom can also function as a platform for fundraising or ICOs. Bytom’s Consensus Model  Bytom uses a Proof-of-Work consensus model, the mechanism currently used by Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is important that the blockchain is not vulnerable to the Sybil attack and the 51% attack. This is because Bytom deals with assets. To be realistic with the demands of the blockchain system, it prioritizes decentralization and security over performance. Bytom’s consensus mechanism is designed to be “friendly to AI ASIC chips,” as described in the whitepaper. This means that the miners can be used for AI hardware acceleration services. Bytom implements cross-chain asset transactions and dividend distribution via side-chain. It also has a quasi SegWit design. History of Bytom Started in January 2017, Bytom was founded by Chang Jia (former sci-fi writer and creator of 8btc) and Duan Xinxing (former Vice President of OKCoin). The Bytom token sale took place from June 20 to July 20, 2017, and raised 8,400 Bitcoins. 30% of the total supply was distributed during ICO. 20% was reserved for the Bytom Foundation, 7% for private equity investors, 10% for business development, and 33% for mining. The Bytom Team The Bytom team is headed by its founders, Chang Jia, and Duan Xinxing. Duan functions as the CEO of Bytom. The CTO is Lang Yu (former senior systems engineer for Alipay). The COO is Qu Zhaoxiang and the CFO, Li Zongcheng. The team further consists of developers and managers committed to the mission of Bytom. The Bytom Foundation is based in Singapore, where the government favors blockchain developments and the environment enables growth in the ecosystem. Bytom Roadmap and Achievements The Bytom mainnet was officially launched on April 24, 2018. The token swap of the ERC-20 Bytom tokens for the native Bytom coins took place in June 2018 across several exchanges. As indicated on their roadmap, Bytom then released smart contract functionality on their platform on July 26, 2018. Their roadmap can be seen below. roadmap   Bytom is taking steps to bring its vision to life through partnerships. A notable partnership so far is with East Lake Big Data Asset Exchange, an organization committed to providing big data solutions for Chinese government agencies. The organization collaborates with Bytom in the area of blockchain innovation and data assets trading.   The Bytom Token (BTM)  The Bytom blockchain has a native token known as BTM. The main uses of BTM are as a transaction fee for asset trading, dividends for income assets, and deposits for asset issuance. The maximum number of Bytom tokens is 2.1 billion. Currently, over 1 billion BTM coins are already in circulation. The current price of Bytom is close to US$0.20. Bytom coins can be bought with other cryptocurrencies on several exchanges, such as RightBTC, Huobi, OKEx, KuCoin, and Bibox. BTM coins can be stored in Bytom’s official wallet. This wallet is available for download on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Conclusion Bytom creates the opportunity to move real-world assets into the digital world. This interoperability will open both blockchain and the tech world as a whole to more innovative ideas that will move civilization forward. One standout feature of Bytom is that the team has hit the milestones set out on their roadmap. The problem Bytom seeks to solve will be a necessity in a few years, if the world continues with this heavy trend of decentralization. However, it is still too early to determine how successful Bytom is going to be.",False

While being worth $30 at that time, Hanyecz pizzas would now cost more than $60mln at current bitcoin price. This thus kicks off cryptocurrency’s real-world use as a payment means.  Bytom (BTM), dedicated to bridging the atomic world and bit world with the aim of supporting the interaction of multiple assets, made its first real-world transaction yesterday, October 22 2018.  SeaRates, the world’s largest e-commerce shipping platform, takes the lead to adopt BTM as a payment and settlement tool. The company is the oldest resource dedicated to online logistics based in England, currently with over 600,000 registered users, 40,000 registered carriers and 250,000 shippers. Its site SeaRates.com and mobile apps offer users more than 8,980,000 varied shipping rates across 200 countries and regions around the world.  Comparing to other candidate cryptocurrencies, SeaRates finally seeks to adopt BTM to address such issues as exchange rate fluctuations and exchange costs in US dollar payment. It will also run transactions and check the operability and stability of smart contracts based on Bytom blockchain.  According to SeaRates, if users choose to make shipping payments by cryptocurrency, they are able to check balances and trade history, print and receive freight bills, and most importantly, payments would be completed in seconds. A two-week test of the Cryptocurrency Bytom and crypto wallet on SeaRates showed that Bytom digital payment takes only 0.3 seconds. In addition, there was no loss of value in the overall freight after several USD exchanges with BTM, as BTM will be closely connected with the exchange rates of US dollar, Japanese yen or euro. SeaRates said it would later work with banks in Malta and Swiss to set up built-in exchanges for real-time crypto-fiat exchange, which would effectively rule out any possible speculation operations.  As per logistics information, the bulk garment shipment, from China heading to Korea by sea, has been successfully delivered and received; the whole process cost only 74BTM ($0.23 per BTM as of press time) in total, roughly $17, far less than payment with US dollar under the same circumstance.  As SeaRates site shows, BTM has been the only cryptocurrency that it supports in its online shipping payment, which would enable instant payments for shipping anywhere in the world. In the future, the platform will push hard to implement cryptocurrency payment.  Apart from BTM adoption, SeaRates said it would have in-depth cooperation with Bytom in terms of smart contract. It also announced the first 10 transactions paid in BTM would have a 10% discount (no more than $10,000 per transaction) in an effort to encourage crypto payment in shipping. As of press time, the 2nd transaction using BTM payment is well in progress.  It marks BTM as a digital asset has started circulating in the real world. Currently global logistics of bulk commodity mainly depends on shipping by sea, of which the price is relatively low but it takes long time, during which shipping cost may increase along with the volatile exchange rate. A report in 2016 by a chief economist at Natixis shows, 10% reductions in railway, air and maritime costs would increase trade by 2%, 5.5% and 1.1%, respectively. Adopting BTM payment will effectively avoid the exchange cost arising from exchange rate fluctuations and might even be an effective force for the growth of international trade in the future.",False

But now, with the exponential growth of computing power and big data, the value of strictly digital assets has all but eclipsed the traditional physical assets that were long the cornerstone of personal wealth.  As such, there is a growing need for projects that can connect the worlds of traditional physical assets and cutting-edge digital ones, thus providing the best of both worlds.  A key player in this movement to move real-world assets into the digital world is a project known as Bytom. With an eye on rapid advancements taking place in the world of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence, this nearly 2-year-old project aspires to become the collision point between the old and new school.  Bytom is a blockchain protocol of multiple byte assets that serves as an engine for the exchange and interaction of real-world assets. Its target market includes blockchain industry insiders and enthusiasts, big data and AI industry stakeholders and institutions and individuals seeking to build financial and digital asset applications.  Launched in January 2017, Bytom was conceived by Chang Jia, creator of 8btc, and Duan Xinxing, former vice president of OKCoin. The Bytom Foundation is located in Singapore, a country ripe with favorable laws for blockchain development. This factor plays a key role in the accelerated growth of Bytom’s ecosystem.  Congruent with its broader aims, Bytom seeks to address a number of key compliance issues around linking digital assets with physical assets by aggressively improving and optimizing the underlying technology that drives this process.  The Bytom blockchain consists of three types of asset categories for exchange:  Income assets, including nonperforming assets, fixed local government investments and homestay properties  Equity assets, which encompass equity of nonlisted companies and equity of private funds  Securitized assets like debts and automobile loans  The Bytom protocol allows these assets to be tradable on-chain, while eliminating middlemen who are traditionally involved in asset transfers and recordkeeping. This has led to faster transactions and lower costs. Moreover, the blockchain allows for greater security for these assets than would be achieved if they were with a third-party organization.  Users have the ability to create asset-backed securities on the Bytom blockchain through the use of smart contracts, allowing them to register and tokenize their assets. The platform can also be utilized for fundraising or initial coin offering (ICO) campaigns.  The Bytom Blockchain and Token  The Bytom blockchain protocol is an interactive protocol of multiple byte assets. Its native token, known as “BTM,” is used as a transaction fee for asset trading, income asset dividends and for asset issuance deposits. These coins can be stored in Bytom’s official wallet, which is available for download on Windows, Linux and macOS.  With the maximum number of Bytom tokens set at 2.1 billion, over 1 billion BTM coins are already in circulation. These coins can be purchased with other cryptocurrencies on several exchanges, such as RightBTC, Huobi, OKEx, KuCoin and Bibox.  Bytom finished its token sale in June, 2017.  Thirty percent of the total supply was distributed during the ICO, with another 20 percent reserved for the Bytom Foundation.  Ten percent was set aside for business development, 7 percent for private equity investors and 33 percent for mining efforts.  Strategic Milestones and the Path Forward  The Bytom mainnet was officially launched on April 24, 2018. In June of 2018, a token swap of ERC-20 Bytom tokens for the native Bytom coins took place across several exchanges. Bytom then released its smart contract functionality in late June.  Amid this flurry of progress, a partnership was formed with East Lake Big Data Asset Exchange, an organization involved in delivering big data solutions for Chinese government agencies. East Lake is collaborating with Bytom to bring new innovations to blockchain platforms and data assets trading.  And, in a practical use case, Bytom facilitated the world’s first cargo shipment with BTM as online payment in conjunction with SeaRates, the oldest resource dedicated to online logistics. By way of this collaborative endeavor, a shipment from China to South Korea was successfully executed through the use of BTM.  SeaRates now utilizes Bytom to execute transactions with precision and efficiency. As a result, BTM has the distinction of being the only cryptocurrency supported by SeaRates for online payments tied to logistics and international trade.  “The launch of Bytom comes from a real need in the community,” said CEO Duan Xinxing. “8btc was one of the earliest cryptocurrency and blockchain communities and forums. Many early writers and audiences of 8btc have become pioneers and leaders in this industry now. But despite having developed various successful public chains, alliance chains and private chains, they encountered the same problem, that is, assets and interests can only be operated on separate chains and cannot interact with each other, let alone interact with traditional assets in the real world.”  Xinxing added that, in order to realize the interaction between different digital assets in the atomic byte worlds, Chang Jia and he decided to launch Bytom.  “First, we want to optimize the underlying technology, in order to ensure a more stable operation of Bytom’s mainnet,” he said. “Second, we’re aiming to create a better support mechanism for developers through a more convenient smart contract and programming language support. Finally, our hope is to expand the developer community and the business cooperation community.”  Note: Trading and investing in digital assets is speculative and can be high risk.

Orphan block management is to store the orphan blocks that are not formed into the main chain block. 2.Consensus layer：to confirm whether a block is legal.It can be diversed to block header verification and transaction verification.Bloch header verification needs to verify its parent blocks and timestamp，both need computing power to ensure accounting.Bytom particularly a BC layer for transaction verification，this layer will get better performance during transaction verification，transaction is related with smart contract and parameters will be verified whether it’s legal by virtual machine when the transaction being verified. 3.Blocktree management：Block Index，it can record blocks of all network and store a mirrorable image of all network’s blocks.Because of the existence of Orphan blocks，it’s not chain structure . 4.Data storage:Persistent storage of block data. There are two kinds of data. The first is the block data, which will be broadcast on the network. The second is UTXO data, which is stored for faster verification of whether a UTXO can be spent without having to verify all of the block information 5.Transaction pool:maintain all the transactions that have been sent but not confirmed yet.When mining module is going to create a new block，it will package some transactions from transaction pool and POW by Tensority consensus algorithm. https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*yeX9jrXmWo_0NP_LVYGT2A.png Wallet layer： Private key module：manage private key（generate。storage and backup of private key）and signature Account module：Bytom adopted account-address-key three layers system.Everyone can have more than one key and form account by different combination of private keys，every account can generate endless addresses and addresses are formed by a secondary private key derived from the account’s private key.

Heterogeneous byte-assets (indigenous digital currency, digital assets) that operate in different forms on the Bytom Blockchain and atomic assets (warrants, securities, dividends, bonds, intelligence information, forecasting information and other information that exist in the physical world) can be registered, exchanged, gambled and engaged in other more complicated and contract-based interoperations via Bytom.  -> The protocol connects the atomic world and the byteworld to promote the interaction and circulation of assets between the two worlds. Bytom adopts three-layer architecture: application layer, contract layer and data transmission layer. The application layer is friendly to mobile and other terminals and convenient for developers to develop asset management applications. The contract layer use genesis contract and control contracts for asset issuance and management, supporting scalable BUTXO of UTXO model at the bottom layer, optimizing EVM and using introspection mechanism to prevent deadlock in Turing complete. The data transmission layer adopts DLT technology to achieve asset issuance, spending, transfer and other operations.  ->  The consensus mechanism uses POW algorithm that are friendly to AI ASIC chips. Matrix and convolution calculation is introduced into the hashing process so that the miners can be used for AI hardware acceleration services, generating additional social benefits.

Inspired by a speech talking about bitcoin and blockchain are great social experiments, Duan Xinxing began to set his foot into the blockchain sphere. While engaging in project developing, he also co-wrote the book “Blockchain: Reshape the Economy and the World” (published by China CITIC in 2016).  The acquaintance with Chang Jia (founder of 8BTC News), and the consideration of his family in the South, led him to embark on something new with 8BTC, which later opened up the story of Bytom.  Accompanied by the fame and admiration, there are also unavoidable doubts about Antminer B3 Bytom (BTM) ASIC miners…  https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*_L-Tw73slfA2zRZlVl1bTQ.png   MANAGE TO CONNECT MULTI-ASSETS FROM THE SUBSTANTIAL WORLD VIA PUBLIC CHAIN  Duan first came into blockchain in a bitcoin-and –blockchain themed speech, in which bitcoin and blockchain are compared to a great social experiment.  Since then, Duan has been mulling about the possibilities of the blockchain sphere. Faced with the attraction and challenges of the new industry, he believed that questions are more significant than answers, and raised a series of questions for himself –  What are the shortcomings in the existing monetary and financial system and centralized system? Paper money can only be spent for once, while digital currency may have the double-spending problem, then how to address to this issue? How to solve the Byzantine failures? How to balance between security and high performance (TPS and scalability)? What’s the future of DApp (decentralized app)?   “Start with these questions, it’s easy to get to the essence and painpoints of this space,” wrote in his WeChat official account. Bearing these questions and thoughts in mind, Duan took the position of vice president and chief researcher in OKCoin, which marked his official foray into blockchain. During this period, he was also active in writing “Blockchain: Reshape the Economy and the World”, which is the first blockchain-themed book published by China CITIC Press (a state-run publisher) in 2016. In the same year, his baby came.  In the following year in 2017, Duan met Chang Jia — founder of 8BTC. In April of that year, he made the decision to come back to the South, and joined 8BTC in May, since then he has been in charge of technical projects.   What Duan values on 8BTC is its role as a “water seller” who connects the community together by serving as an information-and-source provider. Apart from information connection, he also visions to connect multiple assets.  This led Duan to make the decision of creating a public chain via which various assets including assets from the atomic world could get registered, circulated, exchanged and programmed. This is the foremost outline about Bytom chain.   USER NUMBER RANKED TOP THREE WITHIN CHINA ONCHAIN-AND-OFFCHAIN SYNCHRONIZATION IS LONG TERM  Bytom mainnet has been launched in late April. Considering the large user base, in a bid to avoid users from losses, Bytom adopts the approach of iteration in development instead of a one-time large version, which explains its relatively slow mapping process.  Currently the mapping of Bytom has been in the stage of negotiation with various large exchanges and wallets, the remaining ERC20 tokens will soon be switched into mainnet cryptocoin, as Duan said.  Still in an iteration, it is rather difficult for Bytom to have precise statistics of its user amount; Previous data shows that user number of bytom in China was ranked among top three after EOS, and its users out of China are concentrated in the U.S. and Korea, followed by Europe.  Up to now, bytom’s core team members have not changed, and there are many more great talents joining.  When it comes to the synchronization between onchain and offchain asset, Duan answered “As far as the current situation is concerned, the synchronization of onchain and offchain assets has not yet been reached. This is actually a long-term job, before that we have a lot to do on the development of underlying technology. In this context, the synchronization issue remains to be solved by individuals and enterprises that will be onchain in the future.”    “It is the similar case with Ethereum. Ethereum did a lot of work on the underlying protocols in early days, but it hasn’t focused on how to use ERC20 to issue various tokens at the very start.” “The synchronization of assets onchain and offchain will be a naturally spontaneous process.” “And the process also involves issues related to finance, law and compliance, rather than a duty limited within its development team. We are mainly focusing on the development of underlying interactive protocols, perfection of basic functions, as well as community operating, migrating asset onchain are not concerned yet for the time being.” “To accomplish this goal, we also need a recovery environment with prosperity and bubblish growth. Only in this way, would traditional enterprises embrace it and be in the ecosystem when they see great benefit from blockchainization.”   CONTROVERSIES ABOUT ANTMINER B3 Accompanying the glories are controversies.  According to Bytom Economic Whitepaper, 33 per cent of total BTM in supply is reserved for mining, and mining machines shall meet the hard condition to support the artificial intelligence ASIC, which causes controversies about B3 bytom (BTM) miner.  Complaints from the first batch of buyers alleged Antminer B3 about its exaggerated power capability in its marketing and quick price falling for the second batch.  About the criticisms, Duan said there were many misunderstandings.  When other public chains adopt POS, Bytom is the only domestic public chain to adopt POW algorithm, which is verified and adopted by both bitcoin and Ethereum. What Bytom centers on is asset, so security is always on top priority for Bytom.  Bytom wants to provide services for artificial intelligence projects via its computing platform. Against this backdrop, few domestic miner producers could meet our requirement to make such a miner, Bitmain — the largest and senior miner manufacturer — taking the initiative to roll out such a miner comes as no surprise.   “Miners work normally and are equipped with artificial intelligence service. It can also meet the dual mode switching service, but the cost performance may not be high. Users who come for investment purposes will find it not worth it.” “It is, after all, the first generation, and there is much room for improvement and growth. Competition is intense in a market spurred by strong profits, in this context, other miner makers, after Bitmain, can make better products if they are willing to devote more effort.” “Some misunderstandings go that we have interests with Bitmain. We did have some discussions over the verification of the security issues on Bytom’s underlying algorithm. Actually, Bytom’s consensus algorithm and code are open to all on the internet, miner makers and chip producers can all design mining machines for Bytom (BTM) mining according to that.”   BEARS ARE CAUSED BY THE STOP OF MARKET GROWTH The past two years witness the market go into the current bear from the ICO craze.  Going through the ups and downs, bulls and bears, Duan Xinxing made the judgement that the current bear is caused by the stop of market growth, and it is now in the inventory market.  In such a market, people no longer buy crypto asset with fiat, what’s worse, those “air coin” projects are trading worthless “air coins” for valuable assets, which leads to the reduction of the inventory in the market.  To bring momentum back into the market, Duan proposed three advices,  “THE INSTILLATION OF TALENTS AND CAPITAL. THE GROWTH IN THE CURRENT MARKET LIES IN THE MASSIVELY CRITICIZED CRYPTO EXCHANGES WHICH OFFERS A CHANNEL FOR FIAT-TO-TOKEN TRADING. POW CONSENSUS MECHANISM. IT HELPS TO TRANSFER POWER LIKE ELECTRICITY IN THE SUBSTANTIAL WORLD INTO ONCHAIN ASSET. MIGRATING PHYSICAL ASSETS WHICH ARE NOT EASY TO GET CIRCULATED AND PROGRAMMED IN THE ATOMIC WORLD ONTO BLOCKCHAIN. THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE START BYTOM.” “If everyone keeps consuming the inventory in the market, the bear will get worse.” Duan added.   THE CREATION OF A DECENTRALIZED PUBLIC CHAIN  After a plurality of identity switch, Duan said Bytom is the most devoted project.  Before that, his job is more like that in a traditional company, launching a project and then accomplishing it; while for Bytom, he has to promote it in the community apart from internal duties.  It is comforting that the community are making contributions to Bytom. The recently popular block browser of Bytom is in fact developed by fans. This is a practice of decentralization as the whole community is co-building it.  As his blogs show, Duan also has interest in Buddhist sutras, in which he said the cause-and-effect logic is a great enlightenment to his technical work.  When asked about the identity he most wants to be remembered ten years later, Duan said,  “In the society, it should be a distinctive entrepreneur and creator who has created something meaningful and valuable; and at home, it should be a good husband and a good father.”",False

Now the most popular algorithm are POW,POS,DPOS and so on,The POW consensus algorithm used by bitcoin for 9 years has been proven to be stable and reliable,However, it has been criticized for its huge hardware and energy waste,especial the ASIC.In order to avoid wasting resources, POS and DPOS discard the calculation directly,consensus through holding certificates and elections,but they reduce the decentralizatio.  Bytom blockchain solve the waste problem from another aspect.  Tensority introduction  Tensority based on these idea below  Computer is a power,It is necessary to consume some energy for maintaining system stability, POW has been proven to be reliable,and everyone can participate in consensus. ASIC can only do hash calculation is a truly waste, if the mining machine can be used elsewhere ,that will be a big boost. With the rapid development of AI accelerates market demand. So we design AI-friendly consensus algorithm Tensority.  Matrix multiplication and convolution are two commonly used algorithms in AI. Compared with the latter, the former has wider application scope.so we use matrix multiplication in Tensority.we will introduce the algorithm below.  Bitcoin POW consensus algorithm review  Before we introduce Tensority,let’s review Bitcoin POW consensus: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yVK-uHK9hwIlcaIa4r5_BQ.png We all know that the algorithm of Bitcoin is Iterative calculating the hash of block header,constantly modify the parameters,until the hash meet difficulty requirements.  Tensority summary  Take a look at the overview of Tensority https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9IsFLLKL2Hx3-o8qRFx3cA.png In Tensority,calcuating block header hash and comparing difficulty is the same as Bitcoin,but there are many matrix operation in Tensority,so the mining machine which support Tensority has ability to provide AI acceleration services.  Seed production  Tensority has two input,one is a block header hash,the other is seed,seed will be replaced every 256 block.it is aslo a block header hash(1–255 use 1 block header hash,256–511 use 256 block hash … …)  As the Tensority paper said:Seed is a byte array of 32 determined by a period of blockchain history. In other word,seed can be considered as a snapshot of historical network consensus.  Cache Calculation  In this step, we use seeds to obtain a matrix  First,in order to meet the requirements of Scrypt(Scrypt is used by Litecoin),we use hash to extend the seed length.  Then,we use Scrypt to generate a martix of 32x1024x128 https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RqSKITnpTo77PB9yD_pYMA.png Matrix Construction  In this step,we switch a matrix of 32x1024x128 to a matrix of 256x256x256,if you want to learn more about it, please see the paper. https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*26WLETm2qzkfRJItRmuDZg.png Matrix Operation  It is a complicated step,and also the interesting one.  We divided block header hash into 4 pieces,each piece contain 8 bytes,we hash each piece and generate a new hash.  Then we divided the new hash into 32 bytes,each byte as a index of matrix slice,cutting matrix into a rectangle.repeat the action untile all bytes used,then we take multiplication of matrix,switch 128 rectangle into 1 rectangle. https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Kf0GLEofnm9xDoGRiJ-AzQ.png Work Generation  In this step,we switch the rectangle into a hash,and compare to the difficulty. https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*kXUdXdMs1gmEkDardGdIww.png a round of Tensority is ended,if the hash don’t meet the difficulty,we turn to the next round.",False

Since units just began shipping, Bitmain will have been mining for at least 9 days before anybody else could. As of right now, that means they have the majority of the 2.5 million coins generated by mining (probably close to 3.7 million by the time anybody in the public gets a B3).

Additionally, speculation can be put to rest over how many B3s are being released. It is confirmed that there will be 5,000 B3s shipped out across the world (2,500 for China, 2,500 for elsewhere) for first batch. There are talks of a second batch in May. Given that there were around 2,000 B3s online during the first few days and that we're on block 5,424 now, we might be able to roughly assume that block rewards will be around 0.2712 blocks per B3 per day, or 112 BTM per B3 for the first few weeks.

The competition brought together some big figures of Tendermint in the judges’ seats: CEO Jae Kwon, Co-founder Ethan Bushman and CSO Jim Yang.  The Bytom team put forward a technical model Chainmint that is based on Tendermint consensus and combined with UTXO and CVM system, which serves as a cross-chain Cosmos Zone. In short:  Chainmint = UTXO + CVM + Tendermint  https://github.com/chainx-org/chainmint  The idea of Chainmint stood out from over 100 competitors and was highly-appreciated by judges.  “It’s amazing that they are trying to solve real-life problems.”  Though still in its infant stage, the blockchain technology has been gaining momentum to disrupt the world.

Quote from: Bossthirteen on September 06, 2017, 11:50:21 AM Hi Everyone,  In accordance with the recent notice from China PBoC and requests from various government offices, Binance will make the following adjustments:  Per requests from their respective core teams, we will suspend trading and deposit services of the following tokens: HCC, LLT, ELC, BTM, YOYO.  Withdrawal will continue to work.  Each team will announce the refund plan of their tokens. We will restrict all Chinese IP addresses from trading.  They will continue to be able to visit the user center and make withdrawals. Binance will perform a system upgrade from 2017/09/07 00:00 (Beijing Time).  The upgrade is expected to last 2-3 hours.  We will suspend registration, login, deposit, withdraw and trading during the upgrade.  We will try to shorten the downtime as much as possible.  The above 2 changes will be in effect after this upgrade. Going forward, Binance will refocus and redouble our efforts in servicing our international audience, which currently accounts for 82.5% of our user base (according to Alexa).  We will also speed up listing of popular western coins.  We want to thank the communities for supporting us, and will list 5 coins from the voting list.  Details will follow.  As always, thank you for your strong support!  Binance Team  2017/09/06  Biggest takeaway for me is who's not on this list, Neo/Gas (never worried about them for even a second), Qtum, WaltonChain (no product, but boy the power of govies on your team)   lol some of the people on reddit are just delusional.  Why would Bytom be getting listed on new/more exchanges when they are actively seeking to refund their whole coin supply???  At some pt you have to drop the bias and think rationally.",False

I bought about 1 ETH (1700) BTM on Aug 11 off Binance. My standard jump in.  Does anyone know if they have said they will refund the original purchase (of 1 ETH) or another preset amount or nothing?  Binance hasn't said much. BTM is completely shut down but I still haven't decided if I'm HODL or letting go. The second I move the coins it's HODL but it's difficult to make a decision without knowing the other option.    ,False

As long as Bytom wasn't partaking in that they should be good I'm thinking.  To me this doesn't really change much, because if Bytom was in to shady activities, investors stood to inevitably lose their money anyway, maybe just not as fast.

What the hell is bitcoin? And one thing led to another, the guy proudly showed me his bitcoin wallet and bragged that he could buy enough marijuana for him to smoke a month with just 5 or 6 bitcoin.

However, any modifications to the consensus layer, the critical part of any cryptocurrency, must be handled with caution. Compared to other internet protocols, this makes it harder for Bitcoin to adopt new features and meet new demands. This is why sidechain technology has been proposed: It allows for the transfer of digital assets, including bitcoin, across different blockchains.  While most cryptocurrencies are incompatible, assets are not interchangeable; “fusion” lets sidechains build the financial ecosystem of cryptocurrencies. Using sidechains, we can easily create smart contract-based stocks, futures and other derivatives; there could be thousands of sidechains pegged to Bitcoin, all serving different purposes and having different features. Meanwhile, all of these sidechains benefit from the robustness, and maintain the coin scarcity, of the main chain.  So far, some of the sidechain solutions on the market include BTC Relay by ConsenSys, Rootstock by RSK, Elements by Blockstream and non-Bitcoin sidechains like Lisk.   https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-value-sidechains-and-leveraging-their-potential/",False
