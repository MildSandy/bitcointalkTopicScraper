I am glad to stand on the stage of the Wanxiang Conference again and share with you the progress of the Qtum.  Why say standing here again? Because in fact, in 2016, Qtum participated in the Hackathon organized by Wanxiang, and presented in Demoday and won the “Best Creativity Award”. This is the seed for Qtum's later growth. Starting from 2016, Qtum has been supported by many and together achieved what we have.  As one of the projects with a majority of members from China, in this wave of blockchain technology, we have learned some deep lessons. I am excited to have the opportunity to recap and share our thoughts on the real-world use cases of blockchain, how to promote the adoption of blockchain as a startup, and as a tech team, and how will our tech facilitate the adoption step by step.  First, a recap of the industry.  I am very grateful that Wanxiang has taken the lead in launching the blockchain global summit in China in 2015. IBM launched Hyperledger in 2015, and Ethereum has just been launched. In 2015, I also participated in the Wanxiang Summit, when the theme was “Blockchain and Internet of Things”. Again here today the general manager of China Unicom's Internet of Things has mentioned the blockchain and the Internet of Things.  The evolution of technology often sees temporary setbacks. In 2012, I once imagined that one day Microsoft, IBM, Google, and Ali would join the blockchain battlefield, waited for three years and IBM entered, and to 2018 giants like Facebook and Google swamped in.  As a developer, in 2013 when I was still at school, I had the hunch that one-day big companies would come in.  2009 to 2019 is the first ten years for the takeoff of blockchain. The cryptocurrencies sparked massive discussions and experiments for real-world use cases of blockchain technology. The initial spark was the protocol that allowed peer to peer value transfer on the internet, spearhead by Bitcoin. Although we rarely discuss the basic protocols used by the Internet for data transfer, Bitcoin represents a new way of protocol exchange, such that spurred the later development in the industry.  There are many features that are trust-free. We are shifting from information asymmetry to information-symmetric business models, which poses a huge challenge to existing business models. Why so? Today's giant Internet companies, they essentially extract information and then provide value-added information on top of that. Whether it's Alibaba which provides matching based on information of buyers and sellers, or Tencent which connects people based on their information, they are all but “information traders” relying on technologies, platforms and their network effects. Of course, the connection of information has brought great convenience to the society, and such service providers have gained great profit along with it.  When the business information network is symmetric and peer-to-peer, how to build a new business model that suits it? We are still trying to find out.  Second, about cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin is the most typical representative of cryptocurrencies. Whether we are discussing the blockchain or just cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin as a technological innovation and conceptual innovation is still inspiring how we can better construct a new open-source software system, service system. And the design concept behind it is a software system with automatic evolution based on game theory. Before Bitcoin, it was difficult to find software that has thrived after the founder disappeared for 10 years. And so far it has not seen the end, and the border and network effects are still expanding. The incentive design and game theory behind it provides a good reference for us to design more systems.  As an alternative asset, Bitcoin has raised the attention in many countries, for example, some have close regulation on it. This must be a long-term path, rather than a short-term establishment, and it will inevitably face a long-term collision.  There are  many fascinating aspects in the development of the Bitcoin network. It's the design concept that has inspired the following ten years. It is precisely because of the peer-to-peer open network and the information-symmetric network, and in essence, the capitals are also managed very efficiently. I am not sure if you have noticed that a few days ago a sum of one billion dollars worth of Bitcoin transfer occurred on the Bitcoin network. The transaction fees was only a few hundred dollars and completed the transfer within 10 minutes. Such an open financial system can have disadvantages and benefits. It is technically guaranteed that everyone can trust that the network can carry a single transfer worth up to $1 billion. What a strong manifestation of the trust behind it! It's also the trust of the security of this network. Behind it, it is backed by highly efficient ways of managing capital. Multi-signature technology can guarantee that even $1 billion of Bitcoin can be safely kept. $1 billion of gold can hardly be safely kept by some regular individual. The $1 billion in USD is hard to be kept safe for many individuals and companies.  The stability of network security has always been the cornerstone of the industry and enabled its development. Based on the Bitcoin logic, various platform development ideas have emerged. Why distinguish between cryptocurrency and blockchain platforms? This is a very deep misunderstanding in the industry.  Third, from cryptocurrencies to trustless platfomrs  The demand for cryptocurrency is very different. For community-based cryptocurrency, it needs to be simple, secure, stable, and reliable. Of course, it must be decentralized enough. The most original idea in some sense is how to allow any one to join the network. However, the initial definition of the Ethereum did not originate from the concept of cryptocurrency, but rather how to build a blockchain platform that supports a large number of applications in the future. This has brought Ethereum a huge growth in the past few years, and today it has become a huge constraint.  Why? Think about the logic behind it. As a platform, it needs unlimited scalability, good privacy protection, resource isolation, a very good governance framework, and of course, a very good financing/funding model besides ICO . As a platform, this is a huge challenge.  Fourth, rethink the decentralized application.  As a platform, Ethereum has made tremendous innovations, but we must also reflect on the difficulties that the industry is facing, not only in technology, but also in mindsets and business models.  Why do we need to rethink distributed applications? Redesign distributed applications? I believe that everyone has the same feelings, whether it is startups or investors in the industry, we all find that many distributed applications do not have suitable use cases, and do not create great value for the society, but rather a tool for hype.  We need to jump out of the old framework of thinking, to re-imagine and work on how to find truly valuable distributed applications.  Why do today's Ethereum, EOS, and Qtum have such huge problems when it comes to application? Because they are all originated from the logic of the earliest cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency requires verification on the global chain, and any transaction on the Bitcoin network will be broadcasted to 8,000 nodes across the network, which is okay for a cryptocurrency because High-value things require a consensus across the network. However, if a small application needs to be broadcasted to 1000 or more than 8000 nodes on the network, this is a huge logic problem, which will impose huge constraints on the application platform.  Therefore, at the time, Ethereum expanded the Bitcoin scripting language and turned the limited processing power into a more flexible virtual machine processing capability. However, the idea of global verification of Bitcoin is still in use, which imposes huge constraints on development.  Ethereum is a world computer, but it is a single-threaded world computer, because all the lo  gic is executed by 8000 nodes together. Such parallelization will never happen on Ali Cloud. Ali Cloud has hundreds of thousands of servers around the world, and each server runs different tasks. But on the Ethereum, all the running logics are synchronized at any time. Its strong consistency constrains the development of all applications.  Therefore, it is necessary for us to jump out of the framework. Only this way can we expect more development from blockchain applications, because the infrastructure needs huge upgrades and iterations.  Of course, Ethereum is also aware of such problems. That's why it is doing sharding or off-chain computing. But if there is no fundamental change in its logic, it is difficult to make a major breakthrough.  Fifth, blockchain applications and platforms.  Why is DAPP a pseudo-concept? Perhaps DAPP should not be called DAPP, but should be called an application with blockchain features. What are the characteristics of the blockchain? Account, identity, address, and funds, all four in one. Unlike today's internet applications, you must first register with your mobile phone number, then provide your ID card, and then provide your bank card information. In fact, it is repetitive registrations, and our information is stored on each platform. However, the address on the blockchain network represents your account, your funds, your ID and your address, all in one.  A good token economy design would bring great value to the bootstrap of the project. The early development of Ethereum benefited from a good economic model. With more mature and clearer regulations, as a natural base layer micro-service clearing and settlement infrastructure, the blockchain will naturally provide the clearing and settlement tools. Although most of today's applications still use Alipay, UnionPay, WeChat to for clearing and settlement, but any public chain or consortium chain will naturally replace the clearing and settlement functions of Alipay and UnionPay. Still, whether we have the right regulatory guidance is something the regulators need to figure out. But technically the technology is ready.  In a sense, this is the “fundamental uses” of the blockchain, which can empower all existing Internet applications. In the future, new forms of applications will evolve out of it.  Sixth, the progress of today's Qtum.  Qtum integrated smart contracts to a bitcoin-based network in 2016, so Qtum is the only platform and project that follows up on major innovations in Bitcoin. In addition, there is a good synergy between Qtum and Bitcoin. One of our core developers has found major bugs in Bitcoin in 2018 which could allow attackers to print more Bitcoin, and we report it to Bitcoin core developers immediately. This is the merit of open-source software. We all have huge synergies, whether it is technology iteration or technology evolution.  There are a lot of thoughts and innovations in the Qtum 2.0 release, the main idea is how to better serve the developers of future blockchain applications. On Etheruem, in order to make a transaction, you need to possess a certain amount of Ether. Qtum allows the signing of the contract, which will allow contracts to be smarter, e.g. participation in on-chain governance. Just as Mr. Yao mentioned, each blockchain contract is a proxy for a virtual business. They are all logical and executable agents simulated by the computer network. The agent will execute based on data and logic. In this sense, a smart contract also represents virtual productivity. And if it is used well, it will bring great help to the commercial automation of the society.  Qtum 2.0 revolves around how to better serve the blockchain application developers, and build better infrastructure that serves the economy.  We will publish detailed technical documentation later on. If there are developers in the field, interested in the blockchain field, welcome to communicate with us after the meeting. There will be a Qtum 2.0 release on October 16th, please stay tuned.  Seventh, what are we still doing?  What are we working on in 20  19? As a practitioner who has been in the industry for more than 6 years, what are we thinking about the industry? In fact, the blockchain network has a huge distributed effect. The number of nodes in Qtum is second only to Bitcoin and Ethereum. There are nearly 6,000 Qtum nodes in the world. The geographical distribution is the same as that of many technologies. The most nodes are in the United States, which might be because a lof is using AWS or Google Cloud. And there are many nodes in China, Korea, and Japan as well.  I mentioned that Ethereum wants to do the sharding, but the result of unlimited sharding will be a stand-alone cloud service. When Ethereum 8000 nodes are sharded two times, it will be divided into 4,000 nodes, sharded 10 times then becomes1024 shards which is equivalent to 8 nodes. The result of infinite sharding will inevitably make it more like a traditional cloud service provider. When synchronicity weakens, the strong synchronicity of the network will become weak synchronicity, which will make it more application friendly. If the network always has strong synchronicity, it is difficult to integration with commercial uses.   An account system with inherent blockchain characteristics, public and private key encryption system, a token economy model, if there are cloud service vendors naturally support such blockchain characteristics, I think it will be huge promotion of the application. Therefore, we proposed the concept of “blockchain cloud ”. As a tool-kit embedded to all cloud services, the blockchain will bring great benefits to the so-called Dapp developers and distributed application developers, it will also help Web3.0 application development. It requires in-depth integration of blockchain and cloud services  Confidential computing, private asset, privacy data extraction, data mining value will also see a huge development. Whether it is with the popularity of the Internet of Things devices or 5G, the society will produce vast amounts of data. More attention will rise to how to extract the value of data and use it. The society will pay more attention to privacy. Leaving why Facebook proposes Libra aside, no one is willing to assume the responsibility of storing the data of the world. Because it is a huge responsibility and implies a huge legal risk.  How to integrate data privacy, data mining and privacy in the future? The blockchain has also done a lot of exploration in this area, especially the issuance of private assets. For example, the bank's bonds are unlikely to reveal all their positions, but everything is verifiable. We are optimistic about privacy assets, including privacy-centric data mining and data extraction.  Let the smart contract participate in the on-chain governance. The mechanism for the proof of equity is originally to vote for an agent, but the agent has the risk of a single node. Why can't we vote for a smart contract? The logic of the contract is written in advance and the rights are guaranteed. Therefore, it is based on the contract's equity certificate. Future contracts will play a more important role in the blockchain network. Including the preset of the contract parameters proposed by Director Yao, from the technical point of view, the evolution of the blockchain network can be observed and set, which is a path that commercialization must undergo.  The technical stack of the blockchain network is still not perfect. We are also inventing a new type of virtual machine that can be compatible with the X86 instruction level and will be officially released next year.  The future of blockchain industry is still embracing the real economy and embracing what really creates social value. Pure speculation is a tool for financial speculation. It is feasible in some sense before regulation is in place. Because it is an early stage of unregulated growth. The development of blockchain technology in the future still needs to create value for all real economies. In a sense, it provides efficiency and transparency for society. This is the only way for the large-scale commercialization  of the blockchain in the future.  As an infrastructure, Qtum2.0 hopes to have the opportunity to promote the development and progress of the technology field.  Thank you all!",False

No posting, advertising, shilling, or purchase is required. You do not need Qtum tokens to participate. You will have to leave your device online 24 hours / day. This can be a Laptop/PC/Raspberry Pi/VM/VPS/Potato, we don't care. If it compiles, you should be fine. Instructions are in this post, but you can find them at the event website as well: https://fullnodes.qtum.org/   If this event breaks any forum rules we're not aware of (we read the rules and believe this is fine) please delete this post.       We’re happy to announce another round of our Full Node Incentive Program. To maintain a healthy decentralized network, we are asking community members to lend some of their computing power and bandwidth to make this happen.  This is meant to be a fun community event where everyone can participate. It does not require participants to hold or purchase any Qtum tokens. Nothing is asked or required other than running a Qtum node. Last round there were less than 100 prizes, and after careful consideration, we have increased this to number to 822.  Prizes are awarded based on a random draw and online time, which means all you have to do is follow the instructions and leave your device online. Once you have verified that your node is correctly set up, no other action is required, and you may win a prize.        Point your browser to the program website: https://fullnodes.qtum.org/     Node Setup Tutorial   https://blog.qtum.org/qtum-full-node-incentive-program-round-2-tutorial-924d203bfd55   If you don’t find what you’re looking for in this tutorial, reach out to our team on the Qtum Telegram channel: https://t.me/qtumofficial  This tutorial will show you how to access the Qtum Full Nodes program. Please follow the steps presented here, if you have any issues/questions, please address our community support channels (Telegram, Discord, and Wechat).  Download the Qtum installer  Go to our GitHub! https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases  Select the appropriate Wallet version to download; or click on the link below to download the latest 64-bit Qtum Core Wallet for Windows.  Https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v0.17.5/qtum-0.17.5-win64-setup-unsigned.exe     Install the Qtum Core Wallet  Double-click the downloaded exe file, and then select “next”, follow the installer’s instructions and click finish at the end.     Select “the default data directory” in the welcome interface           Next, we need to Launch Qtum Core and modify the configuration file. Here’s how:      Go to the top menu -> settings ->options in the Qtum Core interface.     Click on “open configuration file” — you will see a disclaimer about the configuration file, click on “ok”.        Open the file with the name “qtum.conf” and paste the following:  uacomment=QgoaDTzvoR7NvXrDkofF1iHJL9GFWPwWXJ (replace this with your Qtum address)  addnode = qtum5.dynu.net  Save and close the file.  Note: Replace the example address with your own in case you win a prize, for example, QgoaDTzvoR7NvXrDkofF1iHJL9GFWPwWXJ   Ok, let’s verify this is working properly Check if it works!      Restart the Qtum Core Wallet     Wait 15 minutes for the network to broadcast your address, and for system to update, then head back to the Fullnodes program website.     Enter the Qtum address on the website to see if the address is online. If it is online, it means you have succeeded; if it is not online, check the previous steps.

We’re building a better blockchain, we’re helping enterprises reach new heights of security, and we’re making smart contracts simpler and more efficient than they’ve ever been. We’re proud of the progress we’ve made developing a stronger, faster, and more robust blockchain. We believe that blockchain and cryptocurrency will soon become accepted, even ubiquitous, in daily life, and so we’re thrilled to announce that Crypto.com has added QTUM to its pioneering Wallet & Card app for Android and iOS.   What does this mean for QTUM holders? It means that the bridge between fiat and Qtum has been built, and it’s ready to use. It means that you can use Qtum, at its real cost, to buy a trip around the world and enjoy every stop along the way!   The Wallet portion of Crypto.com’s app secures several denominations of cryptocurrency and fiat and allows the in-app purchase of cryptocurrency. Other wallets offer similar functionality, but Crypto.com’s Wallet has an incredible accompaniment: the MCO Visa Card, which allows purchases from over 40 million merchants worldwide. Together, the Wallet and Card bring crypto off of the exchanges and onto Main Street.   “ We’re delighted to welcome QTUM community to the Crypto.com platform. Today, you can buy & sell QTUM at true cost with bank transfer and credit card purchase both supported. We are committed to expanding QTUM coin in other Crypto.com products and allowing QTUM HODLers globally to maximize its utility,” said Kris Marszalek, Co-Founder, and CEO of Crypto.com.""   Crypto.com integration of Qtum also represents validation for our team, our product, and our vision. After all, the solution works with only the best cryptocurrencies. Other supported currencies include bitcoin, ether, TrueUSD, and Litecoin; we’re honored to join this exclusive club.  There’s still a way to go before we achieve mass adoption of cryptocurrency, but here at Qtum, we believe this is a great stride in the right direction. We continue to reach our goals, make our visions real, and bring our dreams to life; thank you for your help and support along the path.   “We are excited to see the community expanding use cases for Qtum, and we couldn’t be more thrilled that a reputable company like Crypto.com is taking charge,” said Patrick Dai, co-founder of Qtum.

TL;DR: Since Qtum block rewards are given in a random process, we used several approaches to answer the question “when block reward?” The wallet’s “Expected Time” is a probability term for the long-term average of a random process. Over many block rewards, 63% of the time a wallet will receive a block reward before the Expected Time, but the random process means that block rewards could come much sooner than the Expected Time, or much later.  The random spacing between block rewards will average out in the long run, but individual block rewards can have significant variation, and for longer spacings, this can be frustrating. On the long spacing side, users have reported spacings of 6 to 10 times the Expected Time, with one Reddit user reporting 13 times. Of course, no one complains when their block rewards come much sooner than the Expected Time, and this variation is all part of the random lottery process for block rewards.  To confirm your wallet is set up properly for staking, check these things:       Wallet updated to the latest version    Syncing to the latest block    Unlocked for staking only    Computer clock set correctly [Reference 1]   There is some math coming up below, but you can skip the math and just look at the charts and tables, which give the answers.      Probability 101     You intuitively know how probability works for dice. Probability lets us make calculations about random events like rolling dice (or Qtum block rewards). We will start considering a die (a single dice) and define success as rolling a “1”. You expect to get a “1” every 6 rolls (“Expected Time” = 6), but also know you are not guaranteed to get a “1” every 6 rolls because this is a random process.  The probability of an event occurring is given on a scale of 0 (will never happen) to 1.0 (definitely going to happen). The probability of getting a “1” in a single roll of the die is 1/6 or 0.167.  We can use this same approach to calculate the probability of winning a Qtum block reward for the next block. To make the math easier, let’s consider a wallet with 20,000 QTUM, and a Network Weight of 20,000,000. The wallet software makes the probability of winning a block reward 20,000 / 20,000,000 = 0.001. What does this mean, compared to the die?      Here we see the probability of success for a single trial, getting a “1” in a single roll of the die, or a block reward on the next block, and the Expected Time to the successful result.  This “Expected Time” is the same answer given by the Qtum wallet for a given wallet weight and network weight, which the wallet calculates based on the difficulty of minting a new block. For our example, the expected time is 1,000 blocks or about 40 hours.  Reference 2 shows a calculation for the probability of getting a “1” within 6 rolls of the die (33.5%) and for getting a block reward by the Expected Time (63.2%).   Blockchain Results   To test our understanding of block reward probability let’s look at some actual results on the Qtum blockchain (data sources and methodology given in Reference 3). We can compare the theoretical (calculated) probability with the experimental (observed) probability. An ideal candidate for this experiment would be a wallet that began staking soon after the launch of Mainnet and has had no additions or withdrawals. We won’t adjust for changes in network weight over time or the increase in wallet size due to block rewards and will assume the wallet stayed online the whole time. Also note the experimental wallet received fewer block rewards early on because they didn’t split their UTXOs into small amounts, like this.  To get enough block rewards to analyze we can look for a big wallet and find one that started with about 19,000 QTUM in mid-October 2017, and with block rewards have grown to the 20,500 range (in the mid-300’s on the rich list). To get a sense of how smaller or larger wallets would work, simply scale the results below up or down linearly. For example, a wallet staking 500 QTUM would see block reward spacings 40 times larger than our experimental wallet.  In 580+ days of staking this wallet won hundreds of block rewards. To see the variability in block reward spacing, here is a chart of 100 spacings of sequential block rewards for the wallet:   Block Reward Spacing Sequence^    How to read this chart? The horizontal axis is 100 sequential block rewards for our experimental wallet. The vertical access is spacings in hours. You can see some significant variation, for example, block 18 had a spacing of 7 hours and block 19 had a spacing of 333 hours (almost 14 days).  The average spacing for all the block rewards was 40 hours, the closest spacing between block rewards was 21 minutes, and the longest spacing was 13 days 21 hours.  For this wallet, the plot of sorted spacings between block rewards shows a linear section with a rising tail on the right side which leads to the long spacings:       How to read this chart: the vertical axis shows spacing in hours between block rewards and the horizontal axis shows the sorted sequence of the actual block reward spacings.  Why is there a long tail on the right side? This is due to the fundamental nature of determining “success” by selecting a small target range of the random numbers provided by the SHA256 hash algorithm. There is a real chance that the wallet can have a run of “bad luck” and not win a reward for many blocks. This long tail is similar to results rolling the die. For example, the Expected Time for rolling a “1” is 6 rolls, but 1% of the time, you won’t get a “1” for 25 rolls. That is the long tail from random numbers.    Network Weight  Because we have all the data in hand for this wallet, it is easy to calculate the long-term average Network Weight which looks like this:  Wallet Weight x (total blocks/block rewards for this wallet) = Network Weight  20,000 x 994 = 19.9 million  This would represent an average Network Weight from the mid-October 2017 starting date, and represents (without compounding) a 4.4% annual return.    Simulation   Manually analyzing blockchain data is tedious, so a Python script can be used to simulate block rewards and the spacing between them. The simulation uses the SHA256 hash algorithm as the random number generator (same as Qtum Proof of Stake consensus code) and can be run for many block rewards (GitHub link to simulator, data set, and charts). For a simulation similar to the experimental wallet above, we can use a wallet with 20,000 QTUM, a Network Weight of 20,000,000, and run for 2,000 block rewards which required approximately 2 million blocks (the equivalent of 9 years):      This simulation had an Expected Time of 1,000 blocks (40 hours). For a wallet this size, in 9 years there were 2 back-to-back block rewards and the longest spacing between block rewards was 12.4 days. The 5% quickest block rewards were less than 108 minutes and the 5% slowest block rewards were longer than 4.9 days. For probability geeks only, see reference 4.   Brain Teaser  Rolling the die or trying for a Qtum block reward are called “Independent Trails” in probability, which means each roll of the die or Qtum block reward is a new probability event with an identical chance of success. The previous results have no influence on the results for independent trials. Contrast this, for example, with double-deck Blackjack, and if you can count cards this is not a game with independent trials.  With charts for the experimental wallet and simulated wallet, we can definitively say when the next block reward will come: it is going to be one of the dots on these charts, which is not a useful answer.  Brain scan courtesy National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services    Let’s look at “Expected Time” more, with a brain teaser. For our experimental and simulated wallets, the Expected Time is 1000 blocks (about 40 hours). After half the Expected Time has elapsed from the last block reward, what is the Expected Time to the next block reward?  Answer: The Expected Time is still 40 hours!   This has to be true because of independent trials. The Qtum SHA256 hash random number generator lives in the moment, has no history, and can only tell who wins the next block reward. “Independent Trials” means each new block reward, like each roll of the die, is independent of any previous results.  To get a more useful answer for “when block reward?” let’s look at some more probability and the Pareto Line chart.   % Chance of Block Reward  What would be useful for “when block reward?” is something like a weather forecast that says there is a “50% chance of rain.” This doesn’t mean it is definitely going to rain, or definitely not rain, but you know that about half the time, you are going to get wet. How can we use probability to give a similar forecast for block rewards?  The answer is the Pareto Line, which gives the cumulative percentages of block reward wins, as referenced to the Expected Time. The chart below is based on the 9 years of simulated block rewards, but the experimental wallet and theoretical probably calculations give the same line:    % Chance of a Block Reward for a given multiple of the Expected Time    How to read this chart? The horizontal axis gives the multiple of Expected Time. The vertical axis gives the percent chance of a block reward. The red lines show that there is a 63% chance of receiving a block reward before the Expected Time. This means after your wallet receives 100 block rewards, about 63 of them will have arrived before the Expected Time.  Here is a handy table which gives the % chance of block rewards for various points along the Pareto Line.    Taking the bottom row, a wallet would see a block reward 95% of the time before 3 times the Expected Time (120 hours) and would not get a block reward 5% of the time over the same period.         References  1,   To see if your computer clock is set correctly the command “getnetworkinfo” should give a “timeoffset” value of 0 or a few positive seconds.  2,    We can’t use probability directly to calculate success over multiple trials. However, you can calculate the probability of failure over multiple trials which is the product (multiplication) of the individual failure probabilities.   The probability of not rolling a “1” with the die is:  1.0 minus (probability of “1”) which is 1.0-0.167. = 0.833  This makes sense because there are 5 ways out of 6 to roll a number other than “1”. Probability math says the probability of not getting a “1” for 6 rolls is 0.833 multiplied by itself 6 times:  0.833 x 0.833 x 0.833 x 0.833 x 0.833 x 0.833 = 0.335  This means for a large number of die rolls, we would not get a “1” in 6 rolls 33.5% of the time. Then to calculate the probability of getting a “1” within 6 rolls we can subtract 0.355 from 1.0:  Probability of getting a “1” within 6 rolls = 1.0–0.335 = 0.665  which means for a large number of rolls, we should get a “1” within in the first 6 rolls 66.5% of the time.  Using the same math for a wallet with 0.001 probability of winning a block reward gives the probability of not getting a block reward of 0.999. The probability of not getting a block reward in the 1000 blocks (Expected Time) is:  0.999 ** 1000 = 0.368  Here we multiply 0.999 by itself 1,000 times (0.999 is the base and 1,000 is the exponent).  The probability of getting a block reward by the Expected Time is then 1.0 minus the probability you don’t get a block reward:  1.0 - 0.368 = 0.632  Which means over many block rewards you will get the block reward within the Expected Time 63.2% of the time.   3, Data from the qtum.info API, using these URLs with screen scraping into Excel:   All the transactions for a given address:  https://qtum.info/api/address/<Qtum address>/utxo   Get transaction details including whether this transaction initiated a block reward:   https://qtum.info/api/tx/<transaction ID>   4, Some probability results for block reward spacings   Experimental Wallet  Average: 39.8 hours  Median: 23.6 hours  Variance (total population): 2289.9 hours squared  Standard Deviation (total population): 47.9 hours    Simulated Wallet  Average: 39.9 hours  Median: 28.6 hours  Variance (total population): 1636 hours squared  Standard Deviation (total population): 40.5 hours  5.

For all those who’ve just entered the crypto space, Qtum is a decentralized, public and open source blockchain application based on the consensus mechanism of proof-of-stake (PoS). While it combines the flexibility and convenience of the smart contracts, it also optimally utilizes the simplicity and security advantages found in the Bitcoin UTXO protocol. With Qtum, it is possible to run smart contracts on more than one virtual machines such as the EVM and x86 VM.  Qtum Wallet is available for users in the form of desktop, mobile, web or hardware wallet. Its mobile app is compatible with both Android and iOS while the desktop variant runs smoothly on Linux, Mac as well as Windows 32 and 64 machines.  Trust Wallet App, on the other hand, is a secure multi-cryptocurrency wallet that supports all the prominent cryptos and its protocols including ETH, POA, GO, ETC, VET, and many more. It lets users to hassle-freely send, receive, store as well as exchange their cryptos while enjoying complete control over their funds.  Trust Wallet only stores the private keys of the users locally and never accesses its users’ personal information which ultimately ensures that users get maximum data privacy and security. Additionally, the wallet is compatible with ERC223 and ERC20 tokens on the network of Ethereum. As it works seamlessly on the Binance DEX, users can carry out faster trading on the popular exchange.  Prior to this, the Trust Wallet App also declared its decision to integrate with WalletConnect on 11th May 2019.",False

Small enterprises and individuals have still not been able to utilize the benefits of digital tokens.  Despite the falling markets in 2018, crypto space at large continues to grow at a phenomenal rate of 122%. This shows that the demand for digital tokens is on the rise, which the players in the crypto space have recognized very well by launching innovative products. Crypto Wallets are one such product which is becoming popular day by day. Especially, with the majority share of Internet usage coming from smartphones, crypto wallets have become quite essential in expanding the reach of digital tokens.  SpendApp is one of the Crypto Wallets which allow users to convert fiat to crypto instantly and conveniently. The wallet facilitates the exchange of cryptocurrencies at more the 40 million locations by converting fiat to crypto with the Spend VISA Card. Further expanding the platform, SpendApp announced on Twitter that it had listed Qtum cryptocurrency on the platform, which will now allow users to exchange Qtum with all other supported assets on the platform.  QTUM Coin is the native digital token of the Qtum blockchain, an open-source, public platform, based on the Bitcoin’s UTXO transaction model. It is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS), a smart contract blockchain platform, and value transfer protocol. The cryptocurrency is known for merging Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities with Bitcoin’ security.  Introduction of cryptocurrencies like QTUM on mainstream adoption gives newer options for users; the general market has been mostly dominated by Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more recently, TRON. However, digital tokens like Ripple (XRP), Stellar (XLM), and SwiftCash (SWIFT) are revolutionizing crypto adoption across the globe. All of these coins are targeted towards mainstream adoption, for which crypto wallets are extremely essential.  Looking at the scope, traditional digital wallets like PayPal have started to invest in blockchain technology, which is an indication that in the near future, they could give the option to store and exchange digital tokens. SpendApp is a growing platform which has managed to cover significant ground within two years since inception. Looking at the trend shifting towards crypto wallets, more and more cryptocurrencies are now taking steps to enter the space.  Especially, the use of crypto wallets for global money transfers is expected to grow exponentially in the coming months. Studies have shown that international transactions are growing at a fast pace, which has also forced traditional payments companies like VISA to take steps to incorporate blockchain in its global operations. In fact, SpendApp also has a VISA card which allows instant conversions of fiat to crypto and vice versa.  QTUM currently holds the 30th position n among cryptocurrencies. The coin had come under the wrath of the bearish trends last year, when the digital coin dipped from over a $100 in January 2018, to a mere $2 in January 2019.""",False

The offering is simple: a $15 per month virtual machine that users can spin up and run instantly on the Cloud Platform. The software, available here, allows users to “develop and deploy [their] own smart contracts from [the] ready-to-use GCP VM featuring Qtum core, soldity, solar (smart contract deployment tool) and Qmix web IDE.”  The key, according of CIO Miguel Palencia, is simplicity.  “Where launching a node was once an intensive and complex process, Qtum’s new developer suite introduces helpful shortcuts and tools to make it faster and easier,” he said. “With a more accessible technology, we hope to open up and expand the Qtum community to include people with a broader range of experience — from experts to the everyday user.”  The code available on Google Cloud is a copy of the Qtum compute engine and offers a developer environment and full node on the Qtum blockchain. Users can also use it as a testbed for code forks, dapps, or staking.  This announcement in no way makes Qtum an official Google partner as anyone – from purveyors of the CMS WordPress to creators Ethereum dev kits – can launch a product on the Cloud Platform. It simply makes it easier to spin up a Qtum virtual machine for a few dollars per month.  The Qtum token has a market cap of $232,216,410 and is currently trading.

An offline cold wallet provides a high level of security similar to a hardware wallet; both isolate private keys offline and provide a way to approve and sign transactions without exposure to the internet. A cold wallet is “air-gapped” from the internet while a “hot wallet” is connected to the internet and the Qtum network, either directly through a full node (Qtum Core wallet) or a light wallet connecting through an API to a server node. Because hot wallets are online, they have a higher risk profile due to potential exposure to malware, hackers, etc.   Qtum Transactions  A basic Qtum transaction is built in three steps:  1. Compose the base transaction: from address, to address, amount, fee.  2. Sign the transaction using a private key.  3. Transmit the signed transaction to the network.  The Qtum web wallet “Safe Send” isolates these steps between two computers/wallets, where step two is performed with an offline wallet. “Safe Send” guides through these three steps to make a very safe transaction using the offline wallet. The full step-by-step procedure is given in the wallet documentation and this blog will give an overview of the steps and describe how and why they work.   Offline Wallet  We start by making the offline wallet (explained in the manual, also see below for a Chromebook idea) and then use the offline wallet to create a new Qtum address. The wallet picks a new random private key and creates a new Qtum address from this private key. Copy the Qtum address to an online wallet (a USB thumb drive works fine) and send some QTUM to this address.  You can send to an offline wallet because QTUM “coins” are stored as transactions on the blockchain. For example, if the Qtum address is “Qmycoldwalletaddress” we can send transactions to that address and the amount sent will be permanently written into the blockchain. Transactions never send coins for storage in a wallet, which would never work because the wallet is offline and can’t receive transactions or even see the blockchain. Paper wallets work the same way (paper is always offline).  Now we can use the three steps for a Safe Send.  1. Compose the base transaction with the online wallet.  On the online wallet Safe Send page fill in the transaction details: from address, to address, amount and fee:       The online wallet will compose a simple text file with this data:      A critical piece of data the online wallet provides is the transaction ID for the “From” address for a transaction which holds enough unspent QTUM. Since the online wallet can read the blockchain it can search out one (or more) previous transactions (sent to the “From” address). Copy this “raw” transaction file to the offline computer.  2. On the offline wallet, we use the “Safe Send” function for step 2 which is signing the transaction. This is where the cryptocurrency magic happens: because the offline wallet holds the private key for the “From” address, it can create a hash to validate the transaction.  The signed transaction is a long hexadecimal character string, which gives all the details for the transaction, including the script operation codes to verify and execute the transaction.  3. To finish the Safe Send, copy the signed transmission file back to the online wallet and send the signed transaction to the Qtum network.  The block reward winning node for the next block will execute the script for the transaction, and if everything checks out, will publish the transaction in that next block, completing the transaction.         A good offline computer is a Chromebook. These have the Chrome browser installed, so you just have to copy over the Web Wallet HTML file. A Chromebook is a less expensive way to have a dedicated offline computer:      Explorer — Send Raw Transaction  Another option for completing the Safe Send transaction is to use the Explorer for step 3 to send the signed raw transaction. Copy the signed raw transaction file to the online computer. On the Explorer qtum.info select MISC — SEND RAW TRANSACTION. Copy and paste the raw transaction hex string into the field, press the Submit button, and you will see a confirmation with the transaction ID and transaction details.      References  1.

Atomic swaps are a direct way to exchange value across two separate blockchains. In this case, our swap was configured for QTUM and BTC. There can be many advantages in doing atomic swaps. On a high level, being able to process a transaction between two different platforms without having to involve a third party makes things easier and faster than our current system of centralized exchanges. Atomic swaps allow parties to make transactions in a trustless manner. When implemented successfully there is no risk to either party involved in the transaction, no 3rd party to wait for confirmation, and if the transaction is canceled, assets return to their owners. Our atomic swap can be viewed from start to finish via block explorers. 1.2345 QTUM held by party #1 is exchanged with 0.005678 BTC from party #2 and then BTC is redeemed by party #1 and QTUM redeemed by party #2  INITIATE 1.2345 QTUM: http://HTTPS://QTUM.INFO/TX/FFD08F31CEFF36C39FA142B0507B1C71839F4684CCE42B2A74EC06917A71C4AE  PARTICIPATE 0.005678 BTC: http://HTTPS://WWW.BLOCKCHAIN.COM/BTC/TX/5984F23230715F7C20163356DCE62A4AFE0EE476B8567987432FA52758967F0F  REDEEM 0.005678 BTC: http://HTTPS://WWW.BLOCKCHAIN.COM/BTC/TX/1DFC072337D079847FB634EBF7D4A5D51874142DD3BBB958C3556AFA1B2FC29C (link will be fixed shortly)  REDEEM 1.2345 QTUM: https://qtum.info/TX/10008E0A43A56B19266BCC087785789EB4AF75C34F3501FB1CAED05B63B11A61       https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/qtum-completes-first-atomic-swap-bitcoin-mainnet/    For more information, visit our blog: https://blog.qtum.org/atomic-cross-chain-swap-on-qtum-7e756a890ed7 or check some of the news articles posted on Bitcoin Magazine.

Most of the issues involved the potential for attackers to run nodes out of memory or disk space when a specially crafted header was sent to them. This could have potentially lead to networks being attacked and having multiple nodes offline.     The original people who discovered this widespread bug, members of the Decentralized systems lab from the University of Illinois had contacted us with their findings back in October 2018 and our development team had taken steps to prevent this type of exploit against our network. Of the 25 main POS blockchains affected, Qtum had the vulnerability patched quickly after discussions with the Decentralized systems lab and had no reported issues prior to disclosure.    “Qtum version 0.17.1”    The major features implemented in Qtum Ignition include:  The Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows for compatibility with most existing Solidity based smart contracts.  The Smart Staking Protocol is complete, which is an optimized Proof of Stake implementation designed for a smart contract platform (however, smart contracts cannot participate in staking yet).  An improved smart contract GUI has been implemented that can be used for creating contracts, sending data and Qtum to them, and checking their status by executing them locally, The GUI also offers easy QRC20 tokens management.  Regtest mode, which is ideal for developers who wish to create their own private blockchain. It is tuned specifically to make development easier. It will stake blocks automatically every 30 seconds and can generate proof-of-work blocks instantly as needed.  The Decentralized Governance Protocol is completely implemented and functional, which allows certain network parameters to be modified without a fork.

Patrick Dai, who founded Qtum while he was an undergraduate at the San Mateo-based Draper University, graduated from winter 2016 class. The HEROthon sponsored by Qtum will bring product developers, business leaders, hackers, marketers and Draper University entrepreneurs together purposely to rebalance the future of decentralized entertainment and gaming.  Qtum as an open source public blockchain platform was designed to integrate the best parts of the Bitcoin and Ethereum into a blockchain that is business-friendly. The blockchain project is also PoS based and possesses a Decentralised Government Protocol (DGP) which allows the modification of specific blockchain settings by using smart contracts.  Qtum (QTUM)’s Patrick Dai Makes It To Forbes 30 Under 30  The co-founder of Qtum Foundation, Patrick Dai, made it to the Forbes “30 under 30” list of young leaders, entrepreneurs, and innovators in 2017. Also called Xuguang Dai, the founder of Qtum (QTUM), is one of the 300 under age 30 people who are making their impacts known all over the world. According to Forbes China, Dai was recognized for his successes in consumer technology category.  The co-founder of Qtum has been an active player in the blockchain industry since 2012. He became so fascinated with the encryption software technology that underlays Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. These coupled with other obvious qualities gave him early recognition globally.  Tim Draper’s Bitcoin (BTC) Prediction  According to Bitcoin prediction credited to Tim Draper a couple of months ago, he prophesied $250k Bitcoin price surge in the next four years and he solidly stands by the prediction.  The possible availability of amazing Bitcoin and blockchain-related products in the next four years prompted his prediction. In this wise, he advised the Bitcoin investors who are worried about the incessant price moves to stop checking Bitcoin price daily, but should rather wait patiently for the gradual building of required engineering and infrastructure.  During a Web Submit conference that was held around November 2018, Tim Draper was asked whether he’s still on his stance that Bitcoin (BTC) price will reach $250,000 in the next four years, he said:  “Yes. We are talking about five percent market share to get to $250,000…”  Disclaimer: this article is not a financial advice and should not be used as one. It is only written for informational purpose.

The new project, dubbed Unita, is a fully automated data storage and transfer protocol capable of handling over 10,000 transactions per second.  According to Qtum’s press release, the Unita protocol will utilize a scalable consensus algorithm (SCAR) to build atop Qtum’s existing solutions. In addition to ease and scalability, Qtum says that Unita’s SCAR will save considerable amounts of disk space, bandwidth and other network resources.  Furthermore, Qtum’s Unita will also feature simple, one-click deployment, with cross chain trading, data management, and additional features that will allow businesses to process millions of transactions per day. Users will also be able to safely store private data on a permissioned Unita chain, and then transfer necessary data to the Unita public network.  Qtum’s new protocol is specially tailored for targeting pain points, making it easier for existing businesses to adopt blockchain tech. Miguel Palencia, Chief Information Officer at Qtum Foundation said:  “Speed and customization are two of the main barriers for enterprises looking to adopt blockchain technology. By bridging a novel, scalable consensus algorithm with smart contract technology and tools familiar to developers, we strive to make blockchain accessible for enterprises to easily and effectively deploy.”Qtum Foundation CIO Miguel Palencia  As blockchain technology gains momentum, more businesses are looking to either tokenize their company equity, or apply blockchain directly into their network operations. Both implementations can be tricky, but projects like Qtum’s Unita could simplify that process and usher in a new era of blockchain-ready businesses.

To be clear, no funds were ever at risk. The attack illustrated by the team is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that can only be run against a single node at a time.  Nonetheless, we have been in touch with these researchers for several months through the team’s responsible disclosure of the bug. We appreciate the Decentralized System Lab’s research and the way they went about making us aware so we could fix the issue before it was made public over the past week.  The researchers presented two types of attacks:  “No Stake” — header spam attack “Spent stake” — full blocks spam (not possible on Qtum) As stated in the original article, only the “No Stake” vulnerability affected Qtum; however, we have already mitigated the risks of an attack from this vector in our 0.16.2 release.  The “No Stake” attack consisted of two similar but distinct attack vectors that could enable an attacker to cause a peer to run out of memory in the case of the first attack vector or disk space in the case of the second attack vector.  The first of these attack vectors was caused by insufficient validation before storing headers in memory. A potential attacker could, therefore, cause peers to run out of memory by flooding them with invalid headers. The reason why this was possible was that Qtum inherits Bitcoin’s headers-first feature that was introduced in version 0.10.0 of Bitcoin. In Bitcoin, the header’s proof-of-work (PoW) is validated before the header is stored in memory. However, there does not exist any PoW in Qtum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol and the PoS in Qtum can only be fully validated once the full block is received since the coinstake transaction is located in the block. Therefore a potential attack could have been able to create a large number of invalid headers and send them to peers to cause them to run out of memory.  The second of these attack vectors was related to how/when Qtum does full-block validation. In Qtum, full block validation and coinstake validation is performed when a new block is received that has more total chainwork than the previous tip’s chainwork. In effect, this means that full checking of the PoS is done only when a new block is appended to the current tip or when a fork’s tip is received that has more total chainwork than the current tip and therefore triggers a block reorganization. However, In previous versions of Qtum, new blocks were committed to disk if a node received a block with chainwork equal to or greater than the current tip’s chainwork. An attacker could, therefore, make peers commit blocks to disk without the peers fully validating the PoS and cause them to run out of disk space.   Qtum’s v0.16.2, which was a recommended update included improved network security and bug fixes in the form of:  Implement network spam protection Only request blocks from peers when their chainwork is strictly more significant than the current tip Add extra header checks for PoS timestamp, block indexes, signature type (LowS), synchronized and rolling checkpoints. Add recent checkpoints Update nMinimumChainWork, defaultAssumeValid and chainTxData Update BLOCK_CHAIN_SIZE Fix failing Qt tests in make check on OSX Mojave Fix getblocktemplate RPC for PoS blocks Fix help messages for walletpassphrase and getnetworkhashps RPC’s The block/disk attack required only a slight adjustment to when Qtum commits blocks to disk. Blocks are now committed to disk only if the block is part of a chain whose tip’s chainwork is greater than the active tip’s chainwork.  The header/memory attack was mitigated by implementing detection of potential header spam and disconnecting and banning any offending peer. Several checks that were previously only done when the full blocks were received were added to standalone header checking as well. Such as making sure that the signature contained in the header was in the correct format before committing the header to memory as large invalid signatures could be used to amplify header spam.  The network spam protection implemented in v0.16.2 detects peers who are trying to run such “No Stake” attacks and bans them. Now, nodes only request blocks from peers when their chainwork is strictly greater than the current tip. In addition to these countermeasures, we added extra header checks for PoS timestamps, block indexes, signature type (LowS), and synchronized and rolling checkpoints.

To be clear, no funds were ever at risk. The attack illustrated by the team is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that can only be run against a single node at a time.  Nonetheless, we have been in touch with these researchers for several months through the team’s responsible disclosure of the bug. We appreciate the Decentralized System Lab’s research and the way they went about making us aware so we could fix the issue before it was made public over the past week.  The researchers presented two types of attacks:  “No Stake” — header spam attack “Spent stake” — full blocks spam (not possible on Qtum) As stated in the original article, only the “No Stake” vulnerability affected Qtum; however, we have already mitigated the risks of an attack from this vector in our 0.16.2 release.  The “No Stake” attack consisted of two similar but distinct attack vectors that could enable an attacker to cause a peer to run out of memory in the case of the first attack vector or disk space in the case of the second attack vector.  The first of these attack vectors was caused by insufficient validation before storing headers in memory. A potential attacker could, therefore, cause peers to run out of memory by flooding them with invalid headers. The reason why this was possible was that Qtum inherits Bitcoin’s headers-first feature that was introduced in version 0.10.0 of Bitcoin. In Bitcoin, the header’s proof-of-work (PoW) is validated before the header is stored in memory. However, there does not exist any PoW in Qtum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol and the PoS in Qtum can only be fully validated once the full block is received since the coinstake transaction is located in the block. Therefore a potential attack could have been able to create a large number of invalid headers and send them to peers to cause them to run out of memory.  The second of these attack vectors was related to how/when Qtum does full-block validation. In Qtum, full block validation and coinstake validation is performed when a new block is received that has more total chainwork than the previous tip’s chainwork. In effect, this means that full checking of the PoS is done only when a new block is appended to the current tip or when a fork’s tip is received that has more total chainwork than the current tip and therefore triggers a block reorganization. However, In previous versions of Qtum, new blocks were committed to disk if a node received a block with chainwork equal to or greater than the current tip’s chainwork. An attacker could, therefore, make peers commit blocks to disk without the peers fully validating the PoS and cause them to run out of disk space.   Qtum’s v0.16.2, which was a recommended update included improved network security and bug fixes in the form of:  Implement network spam protection Only request blocks from peers when their chainwork is strictly more significant than the current tip Add extra header checks for PoS timestamp, block indexes, signature type (LowS), synchronized and rolling checkpoints. Add recent checkpoints Update nMinimumChainWork, defaultAssumeValid and chainTxData Update BLOCK_CHAIN_SIZE Fix failing Qt tests in make check on OSX Mojave Fix getblocktemplate RPC for PoS blocks Fix help messages for walletpassphrase and getnetworkhashps RPC’s The block/disk attack required only a slight adjustment to when Qtum commits blocks to disk. Blocks are now committed to disk only if the block is part of a chain whose tip’s chainwork is greater than the active tip’s chainwork.  The header/memory attack was mitigated by implementing detection of potential header spam and disconnecting and banning any offending peer. Several checks that were previously only done when the full blocks were received were added to standalone header checking as well. Such as making sure that the signature contained in the header was in the correct format before committing the header to memory as large invalid signatures could be used to amplify header spam.  The network spam protection implemented in v0.16.2 detects peers who are trying to run such “No Stake” attacks and bans them. Now, nodes only request blocks from peers when their chainwork is strictly greater than the current tip. In addition to these countermeasures, we added extra header checks for PoS timestamps, block indexes, signature type (LowS), and synchronized and rolling checkpoints.  We believe that these patches should render any attacks near impossible to execute because of the added complexity and security features implemented. Despite this, we are working on a more comprehensive fix that has passed our initial tests, but since it is a comparatively more substantial change to the protocol, we require more tests.",False

These vulnerabilities have affected 26+ Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies in total and would allow a network attacker with a very small amount of stake to crash any of the network nodes running the corresponding software. We began a coordinated disclosure in October 2018 to notify development teams of affected cryptocurrencies ahead of this public release. The majority of them (weighted by marketcap) have already deployed mitigations.........   Vulnerability #1: “I Can’t Believe it’s not Stake”  When we first investigated this problem, we found that five cryptocurrencies, Qtum, Particl, Navcoin, HTMLcoin, and Emercoin, exhibited a fairly trivial form of this vulnerability: namely, they fail to check any coinstake transaction at all before committing a block to RAM or disk. What these five cryptocurrencies have in common is that they have adopted Bitcoin’s “headers first” feature, in which block propagation was split into two separate messages, Block and Header. Nodes only ask for Block after Header passes the PoW checks AND it is a longest (or longer) chain. Since the coinstake transaction is present only in Block but not the Header, a node cannot validate the Header on its own.

Google ""hierarchical deterministic addresses"" for more info.  TO STOP USING CHANGE ADDRESSES: I don't use Qtum Core wallet, but on the Electrum wallet, click ""Tools"", ""Preferences"", then ""Transactions"" and make sure ""change addresses"" is UNchecked.

This brings our collection of crypto assets to 11, making Circle Invest one of the top apps for accessing a wide array of assets. These new assets can be bought individually, or as part of our “Buy the Market” feature which lets you buy a diversified crypto portfolio in a single tap.   These 4 assets were selected specifically based on their potential to contribute powerful infrastructure to the broader crypto ecosystem. As with all of our listings, we applied the Circle Asset Framework to make this determination.  As we introduce new crypto assets, we also recognize the need to educate our customers and bring clarity to this fascinating, yet complex asset class. We see an opportunity to shed light on the goals of each crypto project, the role of the crypto asset within the project and on what gives each crypto asset value. We are taking the first step in this direction through the introduction of “Explore”, a new feature in Circle Invest that will give contextual, relevant information on the various aspects of crypto. Accompanied with our simple user experience, this easy to understand content will serve to further our mission of bringing crypto mainstream.

Within the platform is a crypto asset, also called EOS, which is needed to use applications on the network. EOS was created to address some of the limitations that Ethereum currently has, specifically with the number of transactions it can handle. Where Ethereum currently handles 15 transactions per second, EOS has shown the ability to handle several thousands per second.      Stellar    Stellar is an open financial network focused on enabling low cost and near instant cross-border payments. Where sending money across borders can currently take days or weeks with multiple intermediaries charging up to 10% of the total, transactions on the Stellar network settle in 5 seconds and currently cost under a penny. Stellar’s goal is to create better financial services for developing countries and unbanked populations where both institutions and individuals alike can participate. The native crypto asset of the Stellar Network is the Stellar Lumen (XLM).    0x  0x is a protocol that allows people to trade crypto assets directly with one another over the Ethereum blockchain. Exchanges called “relayers” can be built on top of the 0x protocol that help match buyers with sellers. Relayers can collect trading fees in the form of the ZRX token. Additionally, owners of the ZRX token are given special voting rights that can influence future development of the 0x protocol.   Qtum  Qtum (pronounced “Quantum”), like Ethereum, is a blockchain platform that lets developers build applications using smart contracts. Within the platform is a crypto asset, also called Qtum, which is needed to use applications on the network. The Qtum blockchain is referred to as a hybrid of Bitcoin and Ethereum, because it was built using key elements from both projects.",False

With this launch, AWS users and developers will be able to develop and launch smart contracts using an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), made up of Qtum Core, Solidity and Qmix web IDE.  Qtum is a hybrid platform, developed by the Qtum Foundation, which uses the Account Attraction Layer, an interface layer, to merge the strength of Bitcoin’s blockchain with the Ethereum Virtual Machine to build decentralized applications. Designed as a toolkit, the platform uses the proof-of-stake model to reduce the network’s computational difficulty while mitigating and solving scalability.  Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Qtum Foundation CIO Miguel Palencia said, “Qtum’s launch in the AWS marketplace provides an easy-to-use and powerful cloud-based solution for end users and the Enterprise. Anyone who wants to develop/build DApps on the Qtum platform or use it as a staking node will benefit from this.”  Usage One of the benefits of using the new Qtum AMI on AWS is the ease of getting started on the blockchain without the “hassle of handling dependencies.” The platform makes it possible for anyone to run a Qtum node or use Qtum pre-installed to launch a server on its mainnet or testnet.  According to Palencia, this is what makes the Qtum technology attractive to both small and large businesses. Companies can launch the servers without “having to spend a large amount of resources on infrastructure.” The Qtum AMI is also free for AWS customers to deploy a Qtum instance (server). Users can deploy a test network on the instance to simulate a public blockchain without paying a fee.  Features Among some of the features of the Qtum AMI is a Qmix development IDE — the development libraries and tools created for the desktop QT wallet — which launches by default. Users will also get the Qtum and Solidity compiler needed for building and executing smart contracts.  Amazon Web Services has been quite active in the blockchain space since it opened its arms to blockchain startups in 2016. Earlier this year, ConsenSys partnered with AWS to launch Kaleido, a service similar to Qtum’s, which simplifies the adoption and implementation of blockchain technology.  The difference between Qtum’s offering and Kaleido, according to Palencia, is that Qtum is not strictly for enterprise, “but for end users, as well as anyone wanting to create and build something on the Qtum blockchain.”",False

The university's proposal is designed to expand the blockchain community's experience with how blockchain protocols perform in lower power and low bandwidth environments.  As a unique innovation, the project makes novel use of the Qtum protocol, implementing specially designed “smart contracts” to update a blockchain's individual parameters, thereby ensuring that the data that the sensor measures are accurately transmitted throughout the network.  Qtum, based in Singapore, is an open-sourced value transfer platform which focuses on mobile decentralized apps, or “dapps.”  The proposed project, which will begin immediately, will deploy a pan-European network to connect sensors that measure electrical power reliability and availability. The project will provide cutting-edge hardware prototypes connected to a bandwidth-constrained low power wide area network that will serve as a reference platform for protocol and network testing.  According to Patrick Dai, founder of Qtum, the growth of the Internet of Things will require fundamentally new methods of transmitting vast amounts of data over a global network. He added that the aim of this work is to provide the Qtum community with a better understanding of how current and future features of the Qtum protocol can be applied to the IoT.  Dr. Jonathan Rigelsford, principal investigator for the project on his part said the viability of any massively scaled solution such as the proposed network requires long service life, and long-range, high-reliability radio systems that consume very small amounts of power and utilize a very narrow portion of the increasing crowded radio spectrum.  Also, the project will investigate the practicality of using the IoT network to provide LoRaWAN (Low Range WAN) based data connectivity for power metering and monitoring systems.  Zaki Manian, Executive Director of the Trusted IoT Alliance add that as the IoT grows and demands maximum use of the RF spectrum, knowledge of the sources and causes of power quality disturbances is vital.  The knowledge gained from this project, both theoretical and practical, will be shared via the academic partnership with the Trusted IoT Alliance.",False

QTUM is considered to be one of the biggest “opponents” to Ethereum network, given the fact that this digital asset represents a smart combination of Proof-of-Stake, Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contract based on the principle behind the first original coin, Bitcoin. Thanks to this superb combination, the team is now presenting one of the greatest achievements of the QTUM team – Qtum X86 Virtual Machine.    Qtum makes up for one of the most prominent representatives of the blockchain technology. Designed into an incredible combination of Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contracts, Bitcoin’s principle, and Proof-of-Stake protocol, this crypto is considered to be a direct opponent to Ethereum platform.  Qtum additionally stirred up the market with the latest announcement they have made about the upcoming Virtual Machine that should be live presented tomorrow, on May 23rd.The country of choice where the project will be presented in is South Korea.   After its main net has been out and running for quite some time now, the next step was creating its own Virtual Machine. This project should further on revolutionize the way smart contracts are being operated with, meaning that it should change the way decentralized apps are being created and deployed.  What is Qtum X86 Virtual Machine?  Qtum X86 Virtual Machine is a smart contract operating software that is designed to enable easily deployable decentralized applications.  What makes this smart contract software superior in oppose to its peers is the fact that  X86 allows developers to work in numerous different programming languages, that way supporting more programming languages than any blockchain-based virtual machine by far.  The machine will allow developers to make contributions to the blockchain community in many different languages, which included Python, C++, Rust, Go and many other.  This way, Qtum is making the deployment and design of decentralized applications more available to developers, given the fact that it supports more programming languages, that way enabling a greater number of developers to make contributions by creating Dapps.  So, now, besides form having QTUM as a highly scalable platform which is able to make faster transactions in oppose to the majority of its peers, including Ethereum, Qtum has made Dapps and Dapps deployment easily available to a wide range of developers that would be soon able to use Qtum X86 Virtual Machine for creating all sorts of decentralized applications.  The initial project will be presented live in Seoul in South Korea, on Wednesday, May 23rd, and this event is planned to be an invite-only event where only a handful of chosen will get to see the Qtum Virtual Machine in action for the first time ever before it is officially launched for the public.  The presentation will be held as a part of a meetup scheduled for the mentioned date.  How is Qtum doing at the Current Moment?  Ranked as the 20th-best currency on the global coin ranking list Qtum makes up for one of the top coins both in the market according to its market cap, and by its technological capabilities.  Following the latest trend in the market, we can see that the majority of currencies trading down against the dollar while going down in the red zone, with QTUM making no exception.  For the past two days we could have seen the majority of coins dropping against the dollar, however, it seems that Qtum has gone down in the red in most of its charts, including 60-day, 40-day, and weekly charts.  That is how we can see QTUM going down against the dollar by -21% in the period of the last 60 days, while it can also be seen dropping against the dollar by -20% over the period of the last 30 days.  During the course of the last two weeks, QTUM has gone down by -28% while it traded in the red during the last week where it dropped by -14% against the dollar.  We can see QTUM dropping today as well, following the most recent market trend, while dropping against the dollar by -5.27%.  Following the latest change in the market, QTUM can now be traded at the price of 15.62$.  Qtum is currently way out of the range of its previous all-time high that was set back at the beginning of January when QTUM was traded at the price of around 103$ per one unit. It is pretty clear that Qtum is still pretty far from its all-time high, even though it is clearly moving forward from the technological point of view.",False

Qtum is a hybrid of Bitcoin and Ethereum that is based on proof-of-stake consensus instead of proof of work, and is compatible with existing Ethereum contracts as well as Bitcoin gateways. Supporting the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) wasn’t enough for Qtum co-founder Jordan Earls, who has been working on an x86 Virtual Machine for the Qtum system.  Earls comments that a great reason to build a x86 VM is to add more programming language support for smart contracts, his favorite being Rust. The overall list of objectives is much bigger though:  Programming Language Support Standard Library Optimized Gas Model Unlock the full power of the Account Abstraction Layer (AAL) New possibilities for smart contracts First-Class Oracles Blockchain Analysis Alternative Data Storage Explicit Dependency Trees Bitcoin Magazine spoke with Earls with some more in depth questions about some of those items:   Bitcoin Magazine: What proof of concept or scalability testing have you done for the VM?  Jordan Earls: We have a very rough proof of concept we completed a few months ago where we integrated a prototype x86 VM into the Qtum network. This success is what led us to pursue this plan. We are confident that the x86 VM will be more scalable than the EVM, but we are thus far unsure how much. We are designing the VM and all of its APIs and other aspects to be scalable. We are making a big shift in the smart contract world where we actually reward smart-contract developers (in the form of cheaper gas costs) for limiting the features their smart contract has access to, and we are confident it will be faster than current EVM technology.    Bitcoin Magazine: What are you doing to address the problem with x86 programming in general, where they assume near infinite memory and CPU time being available?  Jordan Earls: We think smart contract development crossed with this x86 paradigm will resemble something similar to real-time or embedded programming, where there are various constraints that developers must always be optimizing for.    We foresee the same kind of design optimizations happening in the smart contract world as happen in the embedded world, and, for the first time, Qtum's blockchain will allow for these small optimizations to be directly rewarded for all users of the smart contract.  We know these optimizations are not cheap for smart contract developers to spend their time on, so we need to reward developers for taking such steps to keep the Qtum blockchain running smoothly and efficiently.  Bitcoin Magazine: What are some of the advantages with the Standard Library that will help keep smart contract code tight?  Jordan Earls: Currently in Ethereum, if you want to do a simple operation, like testing if two pieces of text are equal, you need to write your own code to do it.  This is a problem for a number of reasons: Developers in a secure context should rely on existing code that's been tested and verified, if possible. A naive implementation of this function will be slow, but a more complex and optimized implementation could have security problems. Deploying this code with your contract means another 100 bytes or so of wasted code that every node in the ecosystem now has to worry about.  Qtum will provide a standard library of functions that contract developers can rely on to have reasonable gas costs, secure and validated implementation and an easy to use interface. This means less bloat on the blockchain, easier to write and understand smart contracts and even a faster blockchain (since these functions can be optimized with native code).  Bitcoin Magazine: What about executable size? These x86 programs tend to be quite large.  Jordan Earls: This is true but also misleading. If I write a C program that just prints ""hello world,"" about 8kB of that is going to just be the number ""0."" This is because x86 processors (as well as many others including ARM) benefit from a thing called ""alignment."" The important thing for Qtum is that the wasted bytes doing alignment can be discarded without performance impact. This immediately brings down that C program build to ~1-2kB.  We can reduce even more because we don't need all the baggage required by a standard program for Windows: We have our own ""operating system"" for smart contracts, so only a dozen or so bytes of actual setup code is wasted.  We have done some actual physical tests with these configurations to compare what an x86 smart contract might look like compared to an EVM smart contract. Our findings indicate that x86 programs are around 10–20 percent smaller than their EVM equivalent and, in many cases, significantly more so. And this was done without the standard library concept that was discussed above. We are not worried about getting usable executable sizes from x86 programs.  Bitcoin Magazine: So the language compiler has to be modified to support the VM? What kinds of modifications?  Jordan Earls: Only minor modifications need to be made. The language compilers do support our x86 VM already, but the Qtum smart contract environment is different from a traditional operating system like Windows or Linux. So, basically, the only big modification we have to make is to tell the language how to communicate with our smart-contract operating system.  Bitcoin Magazine: Is QTUM going to provide language packages or libraries to support the VM so people can just use those?  Jordan Earls: C and C++ will be the first languages we support ""out of the box"" because they tend to be the easiest due to the way they are designed. We also plan to support Rust. Go should easily be possible. For interpreted languages like Python and Perl, it becomes more complex and we must do research to ensure that they can be supported in an efficient and secure manner.  Bitcoin Magazine: Is this going to impact the development of your eSML smart contract language?  Jordan Earls: We are continuing to research the eSML approach and will decide at a later point if it is still a requirement to achieve our goals. We prefer to not do more work if it won't have a tangible benefit to our ecosystem.   Helping to support all this growth is the partnership announced on January 4, 2018, with Chinese video portal giant, Baofeng. With the help of Baofeng, the Qtum network will be boosted to 50,000 full network nodes, making it the most decentralized blockchain platform with the largest number of nodes with more than Bitcoin and Ethereum combined. The increased size of the Qtum system should provide for improved security, stability and speed, all of which will provide a solid base for the upcoming x86 VM later this year.  Earls projects that the x86 will be integrated into the Qtum main network in Q3 of 2018 but hopes to have a prototype to test with before Q2.",False

Jordan’s co-panelists, Nicolas Bacca, the CTO of Ledger, and Allison Clift-Jennings, CEO of Filament, discussed the use cases and security aspects of using cryptographic keys for identity, messaging signing, cryptocurrencies, and smart contracts.  Filament, which announced their new USB-compatible Blocklet device at Consensus, has enabled companies to rapidly test and deploy blockchain tools for business use cases.  Ledger, who makes the popular Ledger Nano S device for storing cryptocurrencies, has allowed hundreds of thousands of individuals to safely secure their crypto on a small device.  Jordan spoke about the unique complexities of storing and staking cryptocurrency on the Qtum blockchain since the token has to be in a hot wallet to take part in validating transactions and securing the network.        Meanwhile, at the booth, the Qtum team engaged many of the attendees, businesses, and fans of the project. We had much fun meeting everyone, and it helped us understand our audience better.  We’d also like to thank our dapps that came to Consensus and showed their support, like Bodhi, Vevue, Mossland, Vanywhere, and Qbao.     QTUM Tech Meetup at Columbia    QTUM, together with SpaceChain, Energo, and Bodhi, we hosted another tech meetup at Columbia University on May 12th.  Columbia students and a few faculty member and blockchain enthusiasts in NYC attended the meetup.  QTUM co-founder and lead developer Jordan Earls gave a brief introduction of QTUM’s upcoming X86 virtual machine and the soon to launch global developer tour and online hackathon. QTUM’s X86 virtual machine will enable programmers to write smart contracts with more mainstream programming languages such as Go, Rust, C++, and more. Jordan is leading the team in developing the said VM and currently, it is in the prototyping phase.         Jordan also revealed that QTUM is about to launch its first online hackathon which will last for three months and welcomes anyone who aspires to build on or for QTUM to join. The hackathon will accept online submission and promises handsome financial reward in addition to a spot to QTUM’s global dev con and other community support.  Zz, Founder and CEO of SpaceChain also gave a quick update of the project. SpaceChain OS is a universal space OS that can convert single-operator satellites into multi-tenant ones, thus users can develop different types of space-based applications on a single satellite. SpaceChain OS also enables compatibility between SpaceChain’s hardware and the various applications that the developers are developing/using, acting as a bridge that lets both participants in the space arena and SpaceChain “speak” to each other. Z also announced that their launch plan for its second low-orbit satellite later this year.  KK, co-founder of Energy also gave a great presentation about the recent progress of Energo Las. Energo Labs is committed to creating a dynamic ecosystem that is more resilient, equitable, and responsive to diverse community needs. KK shared her personal story with blockchain and showcased their project with a newly produced video with lego blocks and explained their project nicely and elegantly.  In the end, Sam from Bodhi presented the recent update of Bodhi, a QTUM based prediction market. Bodhi has been launched on QTUM main net and has other exciting news lined up.          Qtum Tech Meetup at Yale    On Wednesday, May 11th, the Qtum team and Bodhi hosted a local meetup at Yale’s campus.  The audience which include professors, students, technologists, and fans of Qtum got to ask David Jaenson, one of Qtum’s core developers, John Scianna, Qtum’s marketing director, and Samuel Suh, from Bodhi, questions about the industry and Qtum.  The meetup took a different approach than the one at Columbia, with a lot of audience engagement. Thanks to the students who came despite finals being over, we hope you are enjoying your summer now.     QTUM Sponsor Crypto Influencer Summit    On May 17th, QTUM sponsored and attended the first crypto influencer summit. Over 50 influencers in blockchain industry showed up, together with entrepreneurs, traders and surprisingly large sum of developers.  During the event, QTUM’s BD Director Natalie Deng moderated the first panel “YouTube in the Blockchain”. Together with four crypto influencers and one blockchain entrepreneur, they discussed the role YouTube played in today’s blockchain industry, the ethics of influencers and how can blockchain projects best utilize the power of social media.",False

Quote from: skycoin on March 16, 2017, 04:54:31 PM  https://qtum.org Qtum, will probably replace ethereum because it is simpler and has fewer problems. The UXTO model is much cleaner. They have a lot of previous developers and have already done two previous coins and are the best team I have seen so far.  Also how can you be so confident qtum is going to replace ETH based on it's tech when they haven't released code yet?  Ethereum is using an accounts model, like Ripple. Which is anti-blockchain and anti-privacy and very traceable. It is against the philosophy of Bitcoin.  All coins going forward will be on the UXTO model and it is best practice for blockchain. Moving turing complete smart contracts off of accounts model and onto UXTO is extremely important and that is what qtum appears to be doing.  We need to figure out how to do general computation on a UXTO model. Instead of being restrained to the Ripple/Ethereum accounts model.  I think they will get closer to the goal, but only get there part way  thin client for smart contracts (major limitation for existing system) moving smart contracts onto UXTO (major milestone) I do not know if qtum has succeeded, but they seem to be going in right direction. I talked to one of their technical leads and they were focused on ""Getting it working with something we can do now"" and then incremental improvement over time. So first implementing the Ethereum virtual machine on top of UXTO, then working out the research problems for a native turing complete UXTO language later.  I do not know if there is a way to full UXTO while still having ""gas"". I think you will need to get rid of the ""gas"". In the ethereum model to take full advantage. I do not know if qtum will be able to go far enough in doing that, but is heading in the correct direction.  Ethereum tries to be both a token and a computer.  we started with pure tokens (Bitcoin) then we added a computer to the tokens (Ethereum) now we just trying to figure out how to build pure computer on UXTO Then once we have the computer, the tokens or coins just become a program or entity running on this ""distributed computer"" Bitcoin, Ethereum, qtum, byteballs, etc are just stepping stones. Towards a final solution. None of these will exist or be relevant in ten years. We are in an age of transition and I am looking at the projects that are getting closer to the goal, in a pure mathematical sense.  Even Skycoin is being ripped up and its foundations constantly rewritten when it is advantageous to do so. Bitcoin is static and relatively unchanging, while Ethereum has been able to get the community to accept constant small changes.  Skycoin is on a punctuated equilibrium model, where we do bug fixes and polishing, then completely rip up and rebuild the foundation as needed, then go back to bug fixes and polishing.  Right now, we are exploring new networking primitives and the advantage of immutable data structures, but are still on blockchain. Putting EVM on UXTO is heading towards immutable data structures from the perspective of computation, while we are heading towards immutable data structures from the path of consensus, networking and simplifying object synchronization protocols.  One of the pilots that is being spun out of that project is the distibuted, peer-to-peer social media platform built upon immutable data structures and peer-to-peer object replication. For this Skycoin chose a public key, cryptographic publisher/subscriber model and DAG immutable object tree. While Ethereum's project chose a Kadmelia DHT block storage model.  Ignoring the individuals and the drama, I am just looking at the ""future direction"" and who is heading in that direction.  Also how can you be so confident qtum is going to replace ETH based on it's tech when they haven't released code yet?  I am not confident it will replace Ethereum. At the start, it will be equivalent to ethereum in terms of being able to run the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on top of qtum with UXTO. Then they will do a native language.  It will depend on the implementation. I do not know if qtum has succeeded, but they seem to be going in right direction.  Similarly, Byteballs may fail or may not exist in ten years, but they are pioneering the first experiments into replacing the Blockchain with a DAG. Which we have been considering for several years now.  Similarly, Bitcoin was the first but people are getting used to the idea that it will not be the final or best cryptocurrency. That it was just the first generation and that we can build better and improve it substantially.",False

At the event, Jeffrey gave a comprehensive overview of the blockchain ecosystem alluding to how bitcoin got its initial steam from the ideology it was attached to at its start. Jeffrey informed the audience of the ethos of bitcoin, and how blockchain can be used for a lot more than solving enterprises problems. The audience, who were mostly new to the space, saw this as enlightening and could feel Jeffrey’s passion for the technology.           During Jeffrey’s panel, which included Jennifer Jiang as the moderator and Manny Alicandro, ex-general counsel and head of regulatory technology at MANA Partners, Juno Lee, general partner at Kryptoconomy, as panelists. Jeffrey stood out in stark contrast to his co-panelists who both argued for regulators to “come save the consumer.” Jeffrey pointed out to the many faults and workarounds that regulations bring about that often benefit established players and do little to protect the average consumer. Jeffrey gave examples of how Enron and Bernie Madoff seemed to get easily passed the eyes of regulators. Instead, Jeffrey argued for a self-regulatory framework and how it would benefit the ecosystem and allow it grow.  John’s protocol panel included David Fragale, the chief product officer for Atonomi, Paul Liu, founder of the FAB foundation, David Cao, founder of OneLedger, and was moderated by Martin Chen of GDV capital.          On the protocols panel, John discussed the careful balance developers must make when creating a new protocol. Some protocols give up decentralization for efficiency and scalability but highlighted that you could sacrifice some of the network’s security. This is in part why the blocksize is artificially limited to 1mb in bitcoin. It encourages a fee market while also acting as a spam filter.  John also pointed out the benefits of forked protocols and how they contribute to the ecosystem as a whole in contrast to an opposing viewpoint shared by one of the other panel members. In reference, John mentioned how litecoin and other bitcoin fork derivatives implemented segregated witness before it was introduced to bitcoin’s network. This helped illustrate to the world that the code was tested on systems with billions of dollars at stake.",False

Shortly after, Ethereum saw some of the same issues during large ICO start times. To break down Qtum's scalability, you have to understand the underlying technology:  Qtum Core is based on Bitcoin Core 0.15 (we just upgraded from 0.14) Our consensus mechanism is Proof-of-Stake 3.0, borrowed from Blackcoin The Smart Contract layer currently uses the Ethereum Virtual Machine, and communicates with Qtum Core through the ""Account Abstraction Layer"", which is middleware. This software will allow multiple virtual machines to operate on Qtum at the same time.  Bitcoin Core supports only a few transactions per second, say 5. This is with a 1mb block size, and 10 minute block target. Qtum has a 2mb block size, and approximately 2 minute target. This means with nothing else added, we are a lot more scalable than Bitcoin, just by shifting some numbers around. Both Bitcoin Core and Qtum Core have Segregated Witness enabled, which allows each Blockchain to squeeze a bit more scalability out of their Blockchains. Through some stress testing that we did about a year ago, we were able to achieve about 70 TPS  Not satisfied with these results, Jordan Earls started working on way to modify certain parameters of the Qtum Blockchain without hardforking. This is known as the ""Decentralized Governance Protocol"". We had to make sure that the blockchain stayed decentralized, as we didn't want to become one of the projects that sacrifice the core ethos of Blockchain (immunity to censorship and centralization) for marketing hype. One of the parameters that can be democratically altered was the block size, allowing the community to adjust upwards/downwards 4mb, 8mb, 16mb as required. This makes it so Qtum will never have scalability issues, and we could theoretically reach 1000tps. The Blockchain would become massive, but the use of SPV light clients would make this a non-issue for end users. Exchanges and service providers would suffer.  We currently have a working prototype of Lightning Networks finished, we haven't tested it thoroughly, but if/when we do release it our TPS could THEORETICALLY reach astronomical numbers. There are sources claiming millions of TPS, and this solution would most likely be useful for IoT networks and so forth. One of the things that interests us is microtransactions, as in sending/receiving fractions of a penny very quickly.  In sum, the TPS of Qtum can scale to whatever it needs to be, and achieve this without becoming centralized. There might be an option to use Lightning Networks going forward, for use in IoT applications.",False

In other words, it is a hybrid blockchain. This blend results in extreme security–from the Bitcoin network–and extreme flexibility–derived from Ethereum-like smart contracts. Developers will be able to port projects from both Ethereum and Bitcoin onto Qtum’s platform with ease, keeping a level of compatibility with ongoing processes from derived both blockchains. This will save developers time and money, as key network components won’t have to be recreated from scratch.""   https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2018/03/29/blockchain-users-are-increasing-every-day-but-theres-a-problem/         Sponsored  According to data gathered by Blockchain.Info, the number of blockchain wallet users has been increasing exponentially since 2011. Last year ended with over 21 million wallet users, and if growth continues at a similar pace, the 2018 total could more than double. Along with a similar line, ICOs continue to grow at a blistering pace. Per CoinSchedule’s ICO tracker, there have already been seventy-plus ICOs raising over 2.8 billion dollars total, almost three-quarters the amount raised last year in about 20 percent of the time. Long story short, blockchain technology will enjoy another incredible year.  However, as blockchain users and blockchain startups increase in number, the industry as a whole still has some problems that need to be addressed. Despite tremendous growth, blockchain scalability, for example, is still a concern. As the number of users and businesses increases, existing blockchain systems will continue to crack under pressure. The Ethereum Network, for example, is used as the foundational infrastructure by hundreds of platform. And yet, despite attempts to scale and reduce blockchain bloat, the network is still overcrowded. Unless a solution is implemented relatively soon, things could get pretty ugly.  In response to these dire needs, several companies have stepped up and developed unique platforms that attempt to make blockchains more user-friendly. Qtum is one example of an advanced blockchain that addresses the problems with existing decentralized networks. It can not only scale, but also contains an amount of flexibility that will attract business and industry adoption. A huge part of Qtum’s potential is its hybrid blockchain structure. Many believe hybrid chains are the next step in blockchain development. How the Qtum Platform Solves Existing Blockchain Problems  One of the key features of Ethereum is that it lets users integrate smart contracts into their systems. These self-executing contracts actualize once the terms of the contract are reached, giving companies an incredible amount of customizability.  Unfortunately, Ethereum smart contracts use the Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocol. This protocol is relatively expensive and often results in blockchain bloat. As a growing number of companies use Ethereum smart contracts and dApps (decentralized applications), there is the possibility that the blockchain becomes too big to function efficiently, train wrecking business operations. The inability to scale and effectively handle bloating may very well be the Achilles heel of the emerging industry.  In contrast to Ethereum, Bitcoin, and other dozens of other blockchains, the Qtum platform the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol to implement its smart contracts. This means the platform will scale efficiently, minimizing the risk of blockchain bloat. What’s more, “[the] consensus mechanism of Proof-of-Stake is more suited for business applications”, per the company’s white paper, making it ideally suited to grapple with the steady influx of blockchain users and companies.  Ethereum’s Casper update, which will integrate a PoS protocol, is still facing delays that are stalling its rollout. Thus Qtum maintains a significant advantage because it has used PoS from the beginning. Control over the network will be truly decentralized, mitigating the risk of a 51 percent attack or a scenario where a few miners control the networl’s operations.  A unique aspect of the Qtum platform is its combination a Bitcoin Core fork and Ethereum’s Virtual Machine (EVM). In other words, it is a hybrid blockchain. This blend results in extreme security–from the Bitcoin network–and extreme flexibility–derived from Ethereum-like smart contracts. Developers will be able to port projects from both Ethereum and Bitcoin onto Qtum’s platform with ease, keeping a level of compatibility with ongoing processes from derived both blockchains. This will save developers time and money, as key network components won’t have to be recreated from scratch.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the hybrid blockchain technology is powered by an onchain governance mechanism that lets users easily adjust the parameters of the network. Block size, gas price, and gas limit will all be easily adjustable, preventing the need for network splits and hardforks. These important features make Qtum one of the most flexible infrastructure platforms available, which will be extremely helpful for businesses as they deal with the tremendous growth of blockchain technology.",False

Leading the charge is ""No Postage Necessary,"" a romantic indie comedy about a luckless hacker that is being distributed via peer-to-peer video network app Vevue, running on Qtum, the most advanced blockchain in the world.  Jeremy Culver (""An Evergreen Christmas"") wrote, directed and produced the release from US production house Two Roads Picture Co., shot on 35 mm film.  The movie gets its US theatrical release and worldwide blockchain debut in June and will also be available to buy online using cryptocurrency.  ""We are thrilled to provide movie lovers around the world a brand new way to experience their entertainment by turning the blockchain into a feature film distribution channel,"" Culver said in a statement.  ""Although this is a first for the industry, we hope it will signal a shift in the way content is shared and consumed.""  A blockchain is essentially a shared, encrypted ""ledger"" that cannot be manipulated, offering the promise of secure transactions that allow anyone to get an accurate accounting of money, property or other assets.  The technology publicly records the unique alphanumeric strings that identify buyers and sellers, allowing more transparent and secure peer-to-peer payment systems.  Blockchain debuted in 2009 as a ledger for the leading cryptocurrency bitcoin and is already used in food safety, finance and sea freight.  Its advantages, according to Culver, include immutable proof of intellectual property rights, transparent royalty payments, and, since all blockchain data is resistant to duplication, a future in which movies are ""no longer pirated.""  - 'Timely and relevant' -  ""No Postage Necessary"" tells the story of cynical, single computer hacker Sam -- played by ""Vikings"" and ""Black Mirror"" actor George Blagden -- who makes ends meet by stealing mail while disguised as a postal worker.  He happens upon a letter written by a heartsick Josie (Charleene Closshey) to her late husband and fallen marine, and the tender missive awakens something in Sam.  He conspires to meet the beautiful, young war widow and she warms to the idea of a new chance at love -- but not before Sam's past comes knocking in the form of an FBI agent looking for missing bitcoins.  Closshey, who composed the score and was part of the female-led production team, says she and her colleagues recognized the opportunities around the title the moment they read the ""timely and relevant"" script.  ""Although the film makes light of a misguided cyber genius who can hack a multi-billion dollar corporation within minutes, these types of technological advancements are becoming a normal part of everyday life for society as a whole,"" she said.  Culver is hoping blockchain can help ""No Postage Necessary"" go viral, as moviegoers who upload a review as soon as they leave the theater will be able to unlock Vevue tokens as rewards.  ""Up until now, the technology just hasn't been ready -- there wasn't a platform to support the vision,"" he added, noting the serendipity of a movie about bitcoin being the first to release on the blockchain.  ""But innovation creates its own timing.""  Following the movie into blockchain technology will be sci-fi anthology ""New Frontiers,"" effectively five sci-fi movies filmed around the world and stitched together into one feature film.  - 'Simply a database' -  Funded and distributed on the blockchain via a partnership between XYZ Films, Ground Control, and SingularDTV, production is already underway with a release expected before the end of the year.  ""Decentralized,"" a movie from the LiveTree ADEPT blockchain platform, is set for release in autumn, starring Amari Cheatom (""Django Unchained"") as a skeptical economics professor learning about the technology.  The feature from video shorts specialist Christopher Arcella will serve as a pilot to a television series covering many topics in the complex tech and computing sector.  ""The story is written to provide an educational narrative in a fictional setting to help people completely unfamiliar with the technology gain some initial footing,"" a spokesman for ADEPT said in a statement.  A number of issues need to be resolved before blockchain technology becomes mainstream, with the anonymity of transactions concerning regulators seeking to crack down on money laundering and financing of terrorism.  Pop culture writer Amy Roberts says Culver's statements are demonstrative of a widespread fallacy that the mere presence of a blockchain can guarantee the information in it is resistant to alteration.  ""Bitcoins, for example, cannot be copied as they are just entries on a ledger -- not digital files per se -- whose authenticity is incentivized and managed by thousands of individual peer operators worldwide,"" Roberts wrote in a commentary for the Film Daily online magazine.  ""But media or other data, even if referenced on a blockchain, can always be duplicated. A blockchain is simply a database.""",False

It is not surprising therefore to find its companies at the forefront of developments in the cryptocurrency sector. One of the rising stars of the industry is Qtum, based in Singapore.  Singapore is a Mandarin and English-speaking city state rooted in the commercial history of the region and as such has always offered opportunities for the entrepreneurial. It is developing fast as a hub for blockchain-focused companies, so Qtum is in the right place to prosper.  Locale and networks aside though, success in the red hot crypto sector is ultimately down to the product itself and Qtum’s cutting-edge blockchain tech could be considered best of breed.  Its unique selling point is that it has succeeded in leveraging the security of bitcoin and the smart contracts of Ethereum and putting that on a level that solves scalability issues and banishes the prohibitive costs associated with proof-of-work consensus mechanisms. Qtum has developed a business-ready blockchain that is hybrid in form, with interoperability at its core.  Despite its technological achievements and growing roster of projects using its blockchain, Qtum is somewhat in the shade in comparison to projects such as NEO and Cardano, two other Asian-based purveyors of blockchain platforms, although the latter’s is not finished yet.  OK, so maybe Qtum is not one to blow its own trumpet and prefers to let the evidence of its quality product speak for itself. That’s worth exploring because there is no better way of judging a blockchain’s worth than to assess who is using it or planning to do so. From that vantage it has to said the partnerships and customers Qtum is stacking up are impressive and do indeed speak to a company that looks like it’s gaining traction.  Qtum team  Partnerships across Asia  Let’s take a look at some of them.  In January it inked a partnership with Qihoo 360, one of China’s market leaders in cyber security, which saw the Qtum Foundation joining the 360 Blockchain Research Center. It is tasked with setting up a blockchain lab to develop solutions for 360’s products. Also participating in the center is the BTN Foundation of the BitMex exchange.  ALSO READ:  Chinese Investors See Big Opportunities with Bitcoin Although it is not as well known in the West as the likes of Alibaba and Tencent, in China it is a household name by virtue of the prevalence of its desktop security anti-virus software 360 Total Security, which is used by 500 million consumers.  Qtum will be helping to bring blockchain solutions to many of those products, so the deal puts it at the center of the Asian tech story.  The Opera browser has an innovative track-record and recently implemented software to detect and block crypto-jacking, a problem that is growing exponentially.  Patrick Dai, founder and chief executive of the Qtum Foundation, said at the time that he was “delighted” by the partnership, describing it as “a win-win-win partnership that can tap the shared strengths to promote the multi-lateral collaboration and the adoption of the blockchain technology in commercial contexts”.  Video content delivery on a 50,000-node blockchain  In January it also announced a “strategic collaboration” with Hong Kong-headquartered Baofeng, another Chinese company with a ubiquitous consumer-facing Baofeng Player software, this time in the field of video and audio players.  The publicly listed company plans to use the Qtum blockchain as the platform on which it aims to build a decentralised content delivery network, which will be the first of its kind. Baofeng envisages  its Bokocloud network running on 50,000 nodes, which would be a substantial achievement bearing in mind that bitcoin runs on 10,000 nodes and Ethereum on twice that number.  Baofeng is capitalized at $1.2 billion on the Shenzhen Stock Market, and its Baofeng Player delivers high-quality video to 200 million users. It is planned that Qtum and Baofeng will work together to run 50,000 full nodes on the Bokocloud network (Bitcoin runs on 10,000 nodes, Ethereum 20,000). The end game is to deliver decentralized solutions for video distribution, rights management and payment.  Another company jumping on board the Qtum blockchain is BINGO, a games company that is marrying the Pan Entertainment ecosystem with blockchain. By doing so they want to solve three key problems in the $170 billion gaming industry: fairness; data visibility between developers and publishers and improving gaming experience.  ALSO READ:  Live Games by Evolution Gaming Still Reigns Supreme Patrick Dai is one of its advisors to the project and so too is Tencent-backed Mob Arts Entertainment, the online games operator with seven years’ experience in the industry. Its House of Heroes was launched across Tencent platforms such as WeChat to rave reviews. BINGO is partnered with another Asia-based project in the Qtum orbit, BeeChat.   Cutting-edge messaging and social media  Maybe you’ve heard about Telegram’s plan to leverage blockchain but there is an app already out there doing just that. BeeChat is a messaging app serving the cryptocurrency community and the wider world with more than two million users and is built from the ground up on Qtum’s blockchain. The platform is moving forward with rolling out new features to include daily airdrops to reward users, verification services, credit reporting and transaction systems and plans for a developer platform in which HCASH, the cross-platform cryptocurrency, is also playing a role.  There’s a lot going on in Qtum’s world but before we finish Mithril, the social media blockchain project announced this month it would be developing its decentralised apps on Qtum. Mithril wants to turn social media upside down by rewarding users for the content they provide.  Taiwan-based Jeffrey Huang and founder of Mithril is well-known in the entertainment and technology arenas and is also the founder of 17 Media, a live-streaming platform that has been downloaded 27 million times. He was attracted to Qtum by the interoperability at the heart of the system and its business-ready attributes.  We have only touched on some of what Qtum has been up to in Asia, and from this brief survey alone it’s not unreasonable to see this company emerging as one of the darlings upstarts of Asia and the world beyond.",False

Rather than type it all out again, here is the information that I pm'd to @earlz on the QTUM discord: Hey, I got your invite - but I don't think I'm ever going to get around to submitting this security issue and I'm not after any reward. Basically what I found was this. When I installed the QTUM wallet app on my samsung SM-J105Y I was given a lengthy pass phrase (many words, I'm sure you know what I mean). This pass phrase can be used to recreate the wallet if, say, my phone is destroyed. That's all good. So, before putting any money into the wallet I wanted to see if the pass phrase worked. So, I uninstalled the app and then reinstalled it again. Instead of creating a new wallet address, I elected to recreate my old one with the pass phrase. This worked fine. The alarming thing, though, was that. After entering the first word of my pass phrase, my phone auto suggested every other word in the exact same order!! To me, this means that the intelligent predictive text feature of the keypad has, inadvertently, stored my wallet pass phrase. How did it get into the keypad log?? I think it must have been when I copied the originally produced version and then pasted it into my note pad. Of course, I have no idea how long it stays in the keypad log - obviously not for ever as I have restored the wallet a couple of times since and not had the auto suggest predict my pass phrase since. So, it must get overwritten in time. Still, I think this needs to be looked into. If someone else discovered this, it could be bad news for a few people out there. I will also post this in reddit, just to let the general public know.",False

The electricity required for cryptocurrency mining — or tallying cryptocurrency transactions in exchange for a small fee — has increased exponentially over the years. According to Digiconomist, Bitcoin mining power consumption had increased 56.2 percent over four months to hit 47.07 TWh, costing $2.3 billion per year and consuming 0.21 percent of the world’s electricity.   In Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithms, power consumption is necessary for transaction verification, which is done through PoW mining. By launching a satellite into space with a comparatively lighter proof-of-stake algorithm, Qtum intends to increase its reliability with a future satellite network expansion.  While most blockchain technologies use PoW for their mining operations, Qtum uses a form of Point of Sale (PoS) for its transaction verifications in the network. The satellite launch provides energy savings and a cheap hardware platform. Instead of buying expensive specialized mining equipment that cost thousands of dollars to purchase, setup, and maintain, Qtum wallet holders can mine for Qtum tokens on light devices, according to the foundation.  There are now more than 14,000 cryptocurrencies in the world aside from the major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. However, these cryptocurrencies are costly to maintain which increases the barrier for widespread industrial adaption, Qtum stated. With the satellite launch, Qtum hopes to lower the cost of industrial usage, which would set the stage for mass adaption of its blockchain and also future application advantages.",False

QTUM’s main net was launched in September 2017 and so far there are more than 20 companies building QTUM-based projects. Most of them are Eastern projects and many have been quite successful. These projects include: Vevue, Bodhi, INK, Spacechain, Medibloc, and Energo.  Many of my readers know that I have been bullish on QTUM for quite a while now. I think it is incredibly undervalued, partly because of a distinct lack of interest and awareness of QTUM in the West (QTUM is huge in the East), and partly because many people still do not understand its potential. Here’s a few reasons why I believe QTUM will be a top 5 cryptocurrency by the end of the year.  Ethereum ecosystem wins = QTUM ecosystem wins Because QTUM uses the EVM, any projects building on Ethereum can be easily ported to QTUM. A corollary to this is that any successful dApp or protocol on Ethereum can easily become a successful dApp or protocol on QTUM. QTUM doesn’t need to compete with Ethereum for its developer ecosystem, it shares Etheruem’s developer ecosystem. There are many amazing up-and-coming projects for Ethereum such as 0x and Augur and I can envision a world where QTUM has its own 0x’s and Augurs.  Some readers might be wondering: why would people use QTUM when Ethereum exists? First of all, I don’t believe that cryptocurrencies is a winner takes all market. Second, I believe that many will choose QTUM over Ethereum because of a number of advantages that QTUM has. I elaborate on some of them below.  Keep in mind that I do not believe QTUM can overtake Ethereum anytime soon. Ethereum is king and will remain king for a long time.  Bitcoin ecosystem wins = QTUM ecosystem wins Because QTUM uses a Bitcoin-based UTXO blockchain as its settlement layer, QTUM can take advantage of any upgrades to Bitcoin. Here’s a few examples: QTUM is already using SegWit and is primed to deploy its own version of Lightning. Once deployed, QTUM is essentially Ethereum with Lightning. How cool is that? It’d be even better for QTUM if Lightning turns out to be a massive success.  Of course, there are many more benefits for QTUM to use a UTXO blockchain besides being able to absorb Bitcoin upgrades. I outline them in a previous article: Is Qtum Overlooked And Undervalued? - A Detailed Analysis.     Bodhi and Qweb3.js It is one thing to have a few companies building dApps on your platform, it is another for these companies to start enriching your developer ecosystem by contributing powerful, open source developer tools.  Bodhi is one such company. The company is building a decentralized prediction market on QTUM and has also taken the lead to build QTUM’s version of web3.js, qweb3.js. Ethereum dApp developers will know how useful web3.js is for dApp development. I have recently been getting my hands dirty with developing dApps and can testify that it is indeed awesome. I believe that qweb3.js is crucial to jump-starting QTUM’s community dApp development and it is very good news that Bodhi has taken the initiative to do so.  By the way, for those interested in Bodhi, check out their website and whitepaper to learn more. Bodhi distinguishes itself from Augur and Gnosis by introducing a few novel market mechanics.  World’s Largest Pension Fund Invests in Ink   Ink is another company building on QTUM. The company recently received an investment from the operators of Russia’s largest pension fund, NPF Gazfond. Gazprom (Russia’s national oil and gas company) and Alor Invest manages NPF Gazfond. Other investors of Ink include Fenbushi Capital’s Bo Shen and Softbank SAIF’s Yan Yan. For such high profile investors to invest in a budding cryptocurrency project is a huge vote of confidence on it.  Ink aims to build a blockchain, interoperable with QTUM’s, that can manage IP rights and enable the free trade of cultural assets. Learn more about Ink on their website.  Good news for QTUM’s projects is good news for QTUM. I have only chosen to discuss Bodhi and Ink but many others are also gaining momentum and we should start hearing more about them later in the year. Check out the projects here.  x86 virtual machine One of the most anticipated upgrades to QTUM is the x86 virtual machine. QTUM merges the EVM with its UTXO blockchain through what’s known as the Account Abstraction Layer (AAL). The AAL enables the EVM to play nice with the UTXO blockchain. This layered architecture also allows QTUM to plug and play different smart contract virtual machines. QTUM is currently developing an x86 virtual machine that offers many benefits over the EVM. For one, any programming language with x86 compiler support today, which is almost all the languages that matter, can be easily ported to QTUM’s x86 virtual machine.  This blog post by QTUM’s cofounder and lead developer, Jordan Earls, outlines the myriad of advantages an x86 virtual machine has over the EVM much better than I can.  Growing influence in Asia, and specifically China Patrick Dai, a cofounder of QTUM, claimed that QTUM is one of the most influential cryptocurrencies in the East. Many indicators, such as trading volume, media coverage, projects building on QTUM, support this claim. It is a well known fact that the Chinese government dislikes cryptocurrency speculation but is favorable of the development and adoption of blockchain technology. A series of recent events from China strongly hints that QTUM has received tacit support from the government.  Patrick Dai was interviewed on Chinese state television   Patrick Dai was recently interviewed on China Global Television Network (CGTN). CGTN is the English channel of the China’s predominant state television broadcaster, China Central Television (CCTV). Patrick appeared on the show, The Point with Liu Xin, along with Henry Cao, Professor of Finance at the Cheung Keung Graduate School of Business. Topics covered include an overview of blockchain technology, how the financial industry can make use of blockchains, “blockchain fever”, and the challenges facing the technology. You can read about it here.  Overall, the interview was very bullish on the technology.  Qihoo 360 partnership Qihoo 360 is one of China’s largest internet security companies. It’s products have over a billion users and its annual revenue reached $1.4 billion in 2014 (couldn’t find any data past 2014). The company is known for its antivirus software, web browser, and mobile application store. Qihoo 360 recently partnered with the QTUM Foundation to establish China’s first ever blockchain research center. The goal of this research center is to commercialize blockchain technology such that it can be deployed into Qihoo 360’s products.  Baofeng partnership Baofeng is the company behind the Storm Player, one of the most popular online video players in China with hundreds of millions of users. Baofeng has a market cap of more than 8 billion CNY on the Shenzhen securities exchange. In December 2017, Baofeng announced that its Bokocloud division will help deploy up to 50,000 QTUM nodes. This strategic cooperation will make Baofeng Bokocloud the world’s first BCN (blockchain consensus network) service.  “We are very excited to sign the world’s first Blockchain Consensus Network (BCN) service agreement with Qtum,” said Reccon Cui, CEO of Baofeng Bokocloud. “Baofeng Group operates the world’s largest P2P network, so we are impressed by the security and superior flexibility of the Qtum’s blockchain architecture, and we found that the current ecosystem of Qtum is rapidly developing. We are very happy to cooperate with one of the best blockchain technical teams in this field.”  Strong Eastern awareness and interest A good indicator of awareness and interest for a cryptocurrency project is the number of people that show up to its community events. QTUM recently held a Taiwan meetup where more than 800 people attended. Not bad.",False

The UXTO model is much cleaner. They have a lot of previous developers and have already done two previous coins and are the best team I have seen so far.   I won't trust dev that promoting qtum-SCAM.....  I have not looked at qtum's code.  We know the qtum founder and he is one of the largest investors in Skycoin from four years ago, before qtum or any of this. Some of the people around him are legendary scammers, but he is not a scammer.  I think Patricks role in the bitbay situation is exaggerated. I read through the arguments and it just sounds like drama.  Many of the people in the Bitcoin community are sociopaths. They often steal things or cause drama, then immediately blame it or scapegoat it on someone else. They are not even done stealing the money, before they go on campaign of moral indignation against the fall person.  I think Patrick was blamed for Bitbay because his personality makes him an easy victim for sociopaths and the human predators in the bitcoin community. There are people walking around, sizing people up and trying to determine whether they can manipulate someone, setup a scam, steal things and who is going to be gullible or a fall person.  If you knew the people involved, you would understand what the social dynamic is.  >Also how can you be so confident qtum is going to replace ETH based on it's tech when they haven't released code yet?  Ethereum is using an accounts model, like Ripple. Which is anti-blockchain and anti-privacy and very traceable. It is against the philosophy of Bitcoin.  All coins going forward will be on the UXTO model and it is best practice for blockchain. Moving turing complete smart contracts off of accounts model and onto UXTO is extremely important and that is what qtum appears to be doing.  We need to figure out how to do general computation on a UXTO model. Instead of being restrained to the Ripple/Ethereum accounts model.  I think they will get closer to the goal, but only get there part way - thin client for smart contracts (major limitation for existing system) - moving smart contracts onto UXTO (major milestone)  I do not know if qtum has succeeded, but they seem to be going in right direction. I talked to one of their technical leads and they were focused on ""Getting it working with something we can do now"" and then incremental improvement over time. So first implementing the Ethereum virtual machine on top of UXTO, then working out the research problems for a native turing complete UXTO language later.  I do not know if there is a way to full UXTO while still having ""gas"". I think you will need to get rid of the ""gas"". In the ethereum model to take full advantage. I do not know if qtum will be able to go far enough in doing that, but is heading in the correct direction.  Ethereum tries to be both a token and a computer. - we started with pure tokens (Bitcoin) - then we added a computer to the tokens (Ethereum) - now we just trying to figure out how to build  pure computer on UXTO - Then once we have the computer, the tokens or coins just become a program or entity running on this ""distributed computer""  Bitcoin, Ethereum, qtum, byteballs, etc are just stepping stones. Towards a final solution. None of these will exist or be relevant in ten years. We are in an age of transition and I am looking at the projects that are getting closer to the goal, in a pure mathematical sense.  Even Skycoin is being ripped up and its foundations constantly rewritten when it is advantageous to do so. Bitcoin is static and relatively unchanging, while Ethereum has been able to get the community to accept constant small changes.  Skycoin is on a punctuated equilibrium model, where we do bug fixes and polishing, then completely rip up and rebuild the foundation as needed, then go back to bug fixes and polishing.  Right now, we are exploring new networking primitives and the advantage of immutable data structures, but are still on blockchain. Putting EVM on UXTO is heading towards immutable data structures from the perspective of computation, while we are heading towards immutable data structures from the path of consensus, networking and simplifying object synchronization protocols.  One of the pilots that is being spun out of that project is the distibuted, peer-to-peer social media platform built upon immutable data structures and peer-to-peer object replication. For this Skycoin chose a public key, cryptographic publisher/subscriber model and DAG immutable object tree. While Ethereum's project chose a Kadmelia DHT block storage model.  Ignoring the individuals and the drama, I am just looking at the ""future direction"" and who is heading in that direction.  >Also how can you be so confident qtum is going to replace ETH based on it's tech when they haven't released code yet?  I am not confident it will replace Ethereum. At the start, it will be equivalent to ethereum in terms of being able to run the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on top of qtum with UXTO. Then they will do a native language.  It will depend on the implementation. I do not know if qtum has succeeded, but they seem to be going in right direction.  Similarly, Byteballs may fail or may not exist in ten years, but they are pioneering the first experiments into replacing the Blockchain with a DAG.

With the help of Baofeng, Qtum will run 50,000 full network nodes and become the blockchain platform with the largest number of nodes. Currently the Bitcoin network has around 10,000 and Ethereum has roughly 20,000 full nodes. The introduction of such a large number of nodes will expand the security, stability and response speed of Qtum’s blockchain, providing underlying support for more enriching Dapps in the future and expanding the Qtum ecosystem. “We’re excited to have the support of Baofeng, and Storm’s massive user base is a treasure for us,” said Patrick Dai, CEO and Co-Founder of Qtum. “We look forward to their developers’ ideas and contributions to the Qtum platform, and to dedicating this collaboration to the advancement of blockchain technology.”   It is expected that, with this fresh blood injected into Qtum’s community, more users will become aware of blockchain technology and lots of developers will be attracted. As a result, Qtum will become one of the most reliable mainstream public blockchains. Baofeng will also work on Qtum’s platform to introduce new video distribution, copyright protection and payment system technologies. For Baofeng – which was listed in March 2015 by the Shenzhen Stock Market and is now valued at more than 8 billion CNY according to the data from the Shenzhen securities exchange – this partnership demonstrates the great potential of dynamic integration between blockchain technology and the traditional video industry.   “We are very excited to sign the world’s first Blockchain Consensus Network (BCN) service agreement with Qtum,” said Reccon Cui, CEO of Baofeng Bokocloud. “Baofeng Group operates the world’s largest P2P network, so we are impressed by the security and superior flexibility of the Qtum’s blockchain architecture, and we found that the current ecosystem of Qtum is rapidly developing. We are very happy to cooperate with one of the best blockchain technical teams in this field.” Qtum has caught the eye of many from the traditional business world because of its efficient underlying blockchain technology and precise roadmap. The partnership with Baofeng demonstrates how blockchain technology is becoming mature enough to be utilized across a variety of fields.   About Qtum  Qtum is a blockchain application platform. At its core, Qtum combines the advantages of the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model, an Account Abstraction Layer allowing for multiple virtual machines, and a proof-of-stake consensus protocol aimed at tackling industry use cases. The Qtum Foundation, headquartered in Singapore, is a decision making body charged with accelerating the development of this open network and protocol. Learn more at qtum.org.",False

According to the company, it will be the next-generation blockchain platform that will help any-size business to adopt AI technologies for its needs.    Essentially, ATN would create an environment that gives DApps (decentralized applications) developers a quick access to AI technologies, if they need them to be implemented into their DApps. On the other side, developers of AI technologies will be able to share their solutions and be compensated for their work. This will allow to build an ecosystem for rapid adoption and commercialization of AI technologies. Entry barriers for enterprises who want to use AI solutions will be significantly reduced.  According to whitepaper, ATN token will be used to pay fees for AI services access. The ATN team aims to implement DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) structure for its network, where ATN tokens will be used for the governance system.    ATN tokens are based on Ethereum blockchain. Also, ATN will collaborate with Qtum Foundation to create an intelligence layer on Qtum blockchain.  Qtum is a hybrid blockchain application platform. Qtum’s core technology combines a fork of bitcoin core, an Account Abstraction Layer, allowing for multiple Virtual Machines including the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Proof-of-Stake consensus aimed at tackling industry use cases.  Also, ATN recently announced a strategic partnership with Wanda Internet Technology Group. ATN and Wanda will jointly establish a “blockchain + AI” industrial alliance to support Wanda’s business entities to create smart products and services.  “Compared with traditional technologies, blockchain has big advantages. The appearance of blockchain technologies brought us great social value and those technologies could be widely used. At the same time, massive commercial entities of Wanda had great demands for the applications of AI. Through Wanda had done some researches in AI, it still needed to use various kinds of AI abilities and its related data provided by more AI manufactures. We found that such power and data coming from ATN could meet our demands,” said Cai Dong, vice-president of Wanda Internet Technology Group.    http://www.crypto-reporter.com/news/atn-blockchain-ai-751/",False

The company has officially announced its pre-sale for its token sale and plans to announce its token sale later this month.  PUT connects advertisers, publishers, creditors, companies and other consumers. In the Robin8 blockchain marketplace and ecosystem, when a buyer wants access to data, they will pay the data owner (consumer, influencer, content creator). Similarly, if an advertiser wants content or people to view their content, they will pay the content creator, or pay the people to view and share their content. The same rules will apply if the consumer wants access to premium content, the consumer will have to pay the content creator. On the supply side of the Robin8 marketplace, the recipient can be paid in token and keep for future appreciation or redeem for cash.  Robin8, the leading influencer search engine and marketplace in China, profiles, ranks and matches advertisers to influencers with the use of big data and AI. The company is the first platform in China that allows anyone to understand their social data from a wide range of social media sites. In addition to improving advertiser’s ROI, the company provides an automated system for tracking, transparency, third-party digital advertising verification, social media and e-commerce measurement, and data management.  Founded in 2015, Robin8 has an existing platform, growing global client base and growing revenue. To date, the company has profiled over 30 million users from across 13 social media platforms, has acquired over 250,000 users in its app and marketplace store and has completed over 5,000+ influencer campaigns with the likes of Macys, Unilever, among other brands. The company has raised over $3M USD from leading venture capitalists including VFortune, Triumph Capital, Linear VC, 365, MyTech Venture Capital, Pre-Angel and SOS Ventures. The company is founded by leading experts in big data, digital media, PR, marketing and AI. To get to know their management team please visit https://en.robin8.net/team.

We could build a lot of these ourselves, but there is a lot of talent within the Blockchain developer community we can utilize. All of the services listed will be third party, as in, they provide value to the end user. These will not affect the daily operation of the Qtum decentralized Blockchain in any way.  Any work submitted must be open sourced, public, and be open sourced. There must always be an emphasis on supporting Qtum Decentralized Applications, as in, each service should have an area for them to promote their brand. Participants in this bounty program may run 1 advertisement on their site (unless otherwise specified), anything above that will make them ineligible for payment.  This blog post will become a living document, as in, people who claim bounties will have their alias (or real identity)published here. Anyone wishing to claim a bounty must prove they are capable of doing so. Ownership of a Github/Bitbucket is good enough, but if that is not possible, please get in touch with us.  Bounty participants must prove they are competent system’s administrators. These services must be hosted on elastic servers, capable of 2000 daily visits minimum. If a service becomes very popular, and requires a server/VPS costing more than $20.00 per month, you may host 1 additional banner to cover these costs.  Incumbent Qtum service providers may claim bounties. This means if you have already developed a service for Qtum listed on this document, you must expand the functionality above and beyond what is listed here to be eligible for payment. For example, if you already host a block explorer, you must create custom functionality in addition to what you have already hosted to receive payment.  Payments will be made monthly, over a period of 5 months. Participants will receive 20% owed to them each month, provided the service maintains the requirements. Due dates will be 30 days after claiming the bounty, the Qtum nodes are required within 14 days. Payments are only made if the product is delivered, no exceptions allowed. Each month, the participant must coordinate with the bounty manager to receive payment.  To claim a bounty, please leave a comment on this Medium post.

ObEN just completed a round of financing of about $ 14 million A by Tencent, SoftBank, and Yamazaku in June 2017. A year ago, he started to study the application of blockchain technology to make PAI, and became the artificial intelligence common blockchain PAI Innovation partners in the chain.   Oben and Project PAI think the two hottest IP tech- nologies and blockchains in the tech world are a whole.   PAI chain contains three modules, authentication layer, intelligent network layer and data layer. Its core module is an intelligent network, which applies blockchain computing power to artificial intelligence parallel computing, reducing the cost of artificial intelligence computing, improving efficiency and turning computing power into productivity and more valuable. The PAI chain was co-sponsored by Adam Zheng, ObEN co-founder of Personal AI (PAI) leader.   ObEN itself will provide PAI chain a lot of artificial intelligence computing tasks. ObEN for example, builds an artificial intelligence image of the user through personal images and audio uploaded by the user on the PAI chain. The artificial intelligence computations required to generate an AI image are assigned to PAI chain miners via smart contracts on the PAI chain. The miners use the power to complete the task of artificial intelligence tasks like Bitcoin mining process.   ""The data on the blockchain needs to be learned and refined.If the application on the blockchain does not have an artificial intelligence algorithm to process and execute, it needs a large number of platform companies and middlemen to do it, so it can not achieve decentralization The same time, artificial intelligence requires a large amount of data to be able to progress.   The two are a fusion of the whole, the blockchain is the underlying structure, artificial intelligence is integrated in the underlying structure of the neural network.The blockchain allows users to trust themselves Of the artificial intelligence, the user is willing to contribute data, data fed artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence to give users a variety of artificial intelligence skills for the user services.   Therefore, PAI chain and blockchain is not the same.PAI chain is based on the assets Blockchain.Everyone's data is his own assets, the PAI trained by the data is also his own assets.PAI more, the more artificial intelligence PAI, the higher the PAI chain assets, the higher the value. "" Adam Zheng   The technical development of the PAI chain is led by Alex Waters.

We have witnessed as Utility Token projects like BAT (Basic Attention Token) sell out in seconds, leaving their community shaking their heads at not being able to participate.

If the ICO ends early and we collect all 400,000 Qtum, we'll begin staking immediately.

The cooperation is a major step in creating the largest open-source ecosystem that will enable enterprises to consume microservices at scale using blockchain at its core.""  Microservices are revolutionizing the delivery of software; they offer the ability to rapidly create APIs without having to manage the underlying hardware and software infrastructure. Wireline is building an ecosystem based on a microservices exchange; it is a marketplace for enterprises to discover, test and integrate open-source apps, enabling them to build bespoke IT systems.  Wireline is seeking to create the largest open-source developer fund, whereby developers building software critical for serverless architecture and the blockchain ecosystem are rewarded. The cooperation opens up new possibilities for both Qtum and Wireline developers for connecting distributed applications.  “Corporate IT is a huge market with global spend approaching $1.5 trillion, but until now there’s been little reward for developing open-source software because of stifling competition from industry giants,” says Lucas Geiger, CEO at Wireline. “With Qtum we want to change this. Through the combination of both our efforts through the Qtum Foundation and Wireline Developer Fund, we will create an opportunity to monetize existing apps as well as support the creation of new ones.” Qtum aims to establish a platform designed to bridge the still-existing gap between blockchains and the business world. Qtum’s strategy includes providing a toolset to standardize the workflow of businesses and a hub of tested and verified smart contract templates that address various specialized business-use cases.  “We’re excited to collaborate with Wireline as we have a shared mission — to decentralize the application market and create a platform to facilitate the use of blockchain in business,” says Patrick Dai, co-founder, and chairman of the Qtum Foundation. “We think this is beneficial to our developer community and will dramatically reduce the time to market for many of their apps.”",False

The reward schedule is 4 Qtum for a successfully staked block, which is paid out over 501 confirms. The current 'weight' of the network is 4.6 million, and there are approximately 700 blocks per day. This means if you would like to calculate how long it will take to stake a block, multiply your total amount of Qtum by 700. If your number is above 4.6 million, you should stake a block in a day or less (it could take longer or shorter)  Please keep in mind it takes 10 confirms for your Qtum to become 'spendable' in your wallet, but 500 confirms before they attempt to stake a block. Each confirmation lasts approximately 2 minutes. Also note that if your computer goes to sleep, or you turn it off, you will not stake. The wallet needs to be online at all times.",False

Any thoughts on these points?  ""However, the scripting language as implemented in Bitcoin has several important limitations:  Lack of Turing-completeness - that is to say, while there is a large subset of computation that the Bitcoin scripting language supports, it does not nearly support everything. The main category that is missing is loops. This is done to avoid infinite loops during transaction verification; theoretically it is a surmountable obstacle for script programmers, since any loop can be simulated by simply repeating the underlying code many times with an if statement, but it does lead to scripts that are very space-inefficient. For example, implementing an alternative elliptic curve signature algorithm would likely require 256 repeated multiplication rounds all individually included in the code.  Value-blindness - there is no way for a UTXO script to provide fine-grained control over the amount that can be withdrawn. For example, one powerful use case of an oracle contract would be a hedging contract, where A and B put in $1000 worth of BTC and after 30 days the script sends $1,000 worth of BTC to A and the rest to B. This would require an oracle to determine the value of 1 BTC in USD[Note 3], but even then it is a massive improvement in terms of trust and infrastructure requirement over the fully centralized solutions that are available now. However, because UTXO are all-or-nothing, the only way to achieve this is through the very inefficient hack of having many UTXO of varying denominations (eg. one UTXO of 2k for every k up to 30) and having O pick which UTXO to send to A and which to B.  Lack of state - UTXO can either be spent or unspent; there is no opportunity for multi-stage contracts or scripts which keep any other internal state beyond that. This makes it hard to make multi-stage options contracts, decentralized exchange offers or two-stage cryptographic commitment protocols (necessary for secure computational bounties). It also means that UTXO can only be used to build simple, one-off contracts and not more complex ""stateful"" contracts such as decentralized organizations, and makes meta-protocols difficult to implement. Binary state combined with value-blindness also mean that another important application, withdrawal limits, is impossible.  Blockchain-blindness - UTXO are blind to certain blockchain data such as the nonce and previous block hash. This severely limits applications in gambling, and several other categories, by depriving the scripting language of a potentially valuable source of randomness.""",False

Quite a lot of users seem focused on Neo, ICOs and the Chinese market.  But these are my thoughts about the corporate politics and regulation influencing blockchain adoption going forward..  Currently the Chinese government is financially over leveraged after overspending on various national infrastructure projects - like their new ""One China Belt Highway"" ( it's a several thousand mile, new 'Silkroad' motorway) and rail network projects. In my opinion, the current 'rushed' Bitcoin ban is primarily due to this over leveraging of their economy. The Chinese governments goal is to regain complete fiscal control, whilst cautiously roadmapping their blockchain policies going forward. Chinese authorities are also notoriously restrictive on international ownership of companies focused on their domestic market. Apple - McDonalds - KFC etc, they all need Chinese partners to enter the market. Their government doesn't appreciate money unnecessarily leaving their country. Also, the Chinese economy doesn't respect international law to the same extent as Europe / North America etc - for example, intellectual property rights - we've all seen the fake iPhones / clothing / electronics etc.. If any company based on Neo was being mismanaged, which lead to financial losses for international investors - I wouldn't fancy your chances..   ==================================================  Qtum is based in Singapore - one of the most technologically advanced, lawful and educated nations in the world.  Again - in my opinion - Singapore's ICO ban is focused on protecting investors - compared to China's ban, which focuses on protecting their governments finances. I personally expect the China Bitcoin ban to last longer than anything upheld by the more ""dynamic"" Singaporean authorities. Also, if any company was involved in a business practice which ""illegally or morally undermined Singapore's corporate integrity or trust to international investors"" - in my opinion, the individuals' consequences would be far greater.. Make no mistake - the potential Asian blockchain market is huge. But after the recent (and on-going) North Korean nuclear missile tests - Japan / South Korea / Taiwan etc based companies or Bitcoin exchanges would probably prefer working with Qtum ahead of Neo / China..  ==================================================  Plus - the technology is pretty darn good!  Personally, I appreciate the uber-stable Bitcoin core blockchain - with Ethereum VM functionality built on-top.. Sounds like the winning combination - we can sit back and relax whilst other communities continually keep forking    I think Qtum's future remains the brightest of all Altcoins!   Just my thoughts anyway - and would be interested to hear the opinions of other members.   PS - Have we got any info on Qtum POS rates yet..?",False

A year ago, Bitcoin had become, in many ways, a Chinese story. More than 90% of Bitcoin trading took place there, on exchanges that charged no-trading fees. The majority of Bitcoin miners were located there due to the cheap electricity. And the biggest Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer in the world, Bitmain, is a Chinese company.  While it’s still true that China is dominant in mining and manufacturing mining equipment, that no longer is the case with Bitcoin’s trading volume. Around New Year’s, when China banned no-fee trading and began enforcing other regulations on Chinese Bitcoin exchanges, trading of Bitcoin in China plummeted, and over the course of the year, Bitcoin trading shifted toward countries like Japan.  Still, it was a surprise to many when, a few weeks ago, China banned this year’s runaway crypto trend: initial coin offerings. Even more, authorities asked token issuers to refund participants’ money. Then, within two weeks, the Chinese central bank, the People’s Bank of China, told Bitcoin exchanges they had to close as well.   What happened?  “In the past few weeks, there were 10 ICOs every week, and a lot of people don’t understand Bitcoin. They don’t know what Bitcoin is. They’re just coming in and want to make big money. When the situation got worse, old ladies were investing their retirement savings, and the government stepped in,” said Da Hongfei, cofounder of NEO, a blockchain platform for digital assets and smart contracts, in the latest episode of my podcast, Unchained (Google Play, iTunes, iHeartRadio, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio).   Patrick Dai, the cofounder of Qtum, said that as ICOs took off in popularity, people seemed to forget their initial purpose. “The initial idea of the ICO is, okay, I have a good idea, I want to build an open source project, no business model. OK, I need the community to support me, to donate to me some money.” Instead, a lot of traditional businesses decided to do ICOs — like a mooncake company.  Then, there were the actual Ponzi schemes and other scams that were cropping up. That made people associate ICOs with fraudulent activity.  “ICO is just a method for you to raise money. ICOs itself is not a scam. Some ICO projects are a scam, but people in China cannot distinguish the difference. They do not understand what is an ICO or an ICO project. They think, oh, all ICOs are scams, or that an ICO itself is a scam,"" said Dai.  Plus, he said, it became too easy for people who didn’t know what they were doing to invest. He said the country had 65 ICO broker platforms that lowered barriers to entry.  As for the refund back to investors, well, Da says not a single NEO investor has yet requested one.  As much of a dampener the ICO ban was on the Chinese token market, the bitcoin exchanges closings had an even bigger impact in China. When discussing the bitcoin exchanges ban, Dai said, “People were even more surprised and scared. Some new people who just joined the industry this year, maybe a few months ago, and they all think the bitcoin price will always go up and they invested a lot into bitcoin, and after BTC China confirmed they will close the exchange, the price went down 25-30%, so you can see people scared bitcoin may become useless in the future.”  But despite fears that the price of bitcoin could crash and many newcomers may be selling, others have used the dip to buy more, said Da and Dai.  So, what are NEO’s and Qtum’s plans going forward? Qtum will be moving its focus to other countries, opening an office in Denver. NEO is working on a global legal framework for smart contracts on NEO so that people holding token sales on NEO can do it legally in most major countries. And both projects want it known that they are hiring.  Tune in to the full episode (Google Play, iTunes, iHeartRadio, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio, web) to hear how Chinese regulators seemed to be defining tokens vs. virtual currencies, what kind of crypto fundraising is still permitted, and whether or not these bans are permanent or temporary.

How do you mention QUA having the same name like it's some detriment to Qtum? That's like saying Bitcoin Plus exists so that's a negative towards Bitcoin.  You cannot fault a coin b/c another coin out and used a similar name.  The viability of a platform depends on it's ability to attract big projects.  So far no other platform had as many projects as Qtum launching except Eth.  There were 10x as many projects launching on Qtum as NEO.  Projects such as bohdi, hashrush, Vevue, and possibly even Tron are very polished projects with real teams.

However the team handled it 100% the right way.  They didn't debate and go back and forth and instead just kept moving ahead.  They never missed an update or a deadline.  Look at all the projects in Crypto that are constantly sidelined, delayed, or have devs that go ghost.  Qtum has hit every target so far on their timeline and are even releasing their mainnet ahead of schedule.  To be ahead of schedule in this space, is very very very RARE.  They've constantly provided updates at every turn and have in the end churned out a very promising project and potential real competitor to Ethereum.  I heard that there are 17 projects releasing on qtum, no project but ETH can boast these numbers.  Congrats to the team.",False

This will take place right before Wanxiang’s Blockchain Conference. Qtum’s Mainnet will be the follow up to our ‘Skynet’ release earlier in August. Qtum will feature the functionality found in Skynet, like the Decentralized Governance Protocol, EVM on UTXO, Proof-of-Stake Consensus, and mobile smart contract functionality.  This is a major milestone for the Qtum project, as this is a group of blockchain enthusiasts turning a dream into reality. Making this happen would not be possible without the 18 months of hard work that went into this from our 30+ team members. This is just the start of what we have coming. Qtum’s development plans requires many years to fulfill, so keep an eye on our road map in the months to come.  For those of you who have been following the project since early 2017, you know we fought a hard battle to get here, so thank you for the support. There will be a launch event in Shanghai on the 13th, seating is extremely limited, but we will do our best to live steam it around the world.

Probably 1% per year.   We may need to release a document about how staking works, we just assumed most people were familiar with it.  Proof-of-Stake is a consensus mechanism that secures the Qtum network. This was launched in 2012 by Peercoin, adopted by Novacoin, and improved by Blackcoin. There are countless other projects that have adopted a version similar to PPC's proof-of-stake.  For a detailed breakdown on the PoS 3.0 code that we are based on, please see: http://earlz.net/view/2017/07/27/1904/the-missing-explanation-of-proof-of-stake-version  We highly recommend reading this article.   Here is the breakdown of Qtum's stake agenda:  Block Target: 2 minutes (This means there should be a new block generated every 2 minutes) Block Reward: 4 Qtum (This will be reduced each year, until the reward is 1 Qtum) Min Age: 8 Hours (This means you must leave your tokens in your wallet for 8 hours before you can participate in staking) Max Age: NA  This should effectively peg inflation at 1% during the first year, and then it will be lowered. We figure with the amount of tokens lost or destroyed each year, Qtum may in fact become a deflationary platform.     Quote from: hope-crypto on August 19, 2017, 09:54:10 PM I have high hopes for this project  . New ICOs are coming and that will just boost that price to the moon .

Korea to meet with people interested in our project. Our co-founder, Patrick was joined by John, Stella, and Xiaolong, who presented for nearly 90 minutes. There were a lot of topics covered, so we want to give a summary of the highlights. The meetup was held at Seoul’s D.Camp, one of the largest startup ecosystems in Korea, and was attended by over 100 people from the local blockchain industry.       To see a recorded version of the presentation, please watch on Facebook:   https://www.facebook.com/pg/blockchainkoreameetup/videos/   Patrick’s speech was the longest, starting with his personal opinions on the state of the industry. He discussed how blockchain changes the way we think and cooperate, how it levels the playing field and creates an ecosystem where everyone can share the rewards, unlike the centralized systems we with. This comes with a large learning curve, which is difficult for many to understand. He goes on to mention 2 reasons for this; the technological barrier, with regards to cryptography and decentralization. The second reason is the social aspect, the fact that blockchain changes the reward structure of our entire economy. It is a very disruptive idea, but it should accelerate the efficiency of our society. He ends by saying: “ One of the reasons that Blockchain is growing so rapidly is because people realize the risk in the financial system we are using today, because it’s an inflationary system where the government can print money on a whim”.   The next section of the speech, Patrick goes on to introduce the Qtum project. He described that the idea started forming in early 2016, as a way to bring the stability of Bitcoin Core and the flexibility of the Ethereum Virtual Machine together, with the fairness of a Proof-of-Stake platform. He mentions the threat of centralization in the Proof-of-Work platforms, and how a lot of the hashing power resides in one province of China. His vision of the platform is to be compatible with the two biggest ecosystems (Bitcoin and Ethereum), this way people who are familiar with either will have no problem building on Qtum.   This was a huge undertaking, Bitcoin is built on the Unspent Transaction Output model. It’s very hard to port the Ethereum Virtual Machine to the Bitcoin network, no one did this before. It took a few months for us to figure this out, but one of the unique parts of the Qtum project is that everything in the White Paper that we discuss has already been built. This brought us to the first Test Network release, dubbed “Sparknet”, which proved that we could deploy Solidity Smart Contracts on a UTXO Blockchain, with a PoS consensus model.       Enter Skynet, Qtum’s second Test Network. Patrick explains that we enhanced the PoS security with Qtum’s Smart Stake technology, which forces participants who have staked a block to receive the rewards over 500 confirmations. This will make it a lot harder for malicious users to perform “replay attacks”. Patrick went on to explain that the technical attacks are not the only problems that require solving. When Bitcoin was launched, Satoshi later vanished, leaving no mechanism for formal governance in the event the blockchain required upgrades. This lead to the scaling debate over how to increase the amount of transactions that could be processed by solving a block. This debate lasted over two years and continues to go on. To avoid this on the Qtum platform, a Decentralized Governance Protocol is being tested on Skynet. This allows certain parameters of the network, like block size, to be changed without hard forking. Qtum holders can initiate a vote, and if it gains a large majority, the nodes will adjust without disrupting the network. Moving forward, Patrick highlighted what to expect over the next month. There will be an internal code audit and review, along with a public ‘bug bounty’. This will allow Blockchain developers to review our code, and earn Qtum tokens for submitting fixes. This will take us to the Main Network release, around mid-to-late September.        Beyond this date, there is a lot to look forward to. Patrick mentioned that we have Non-Disclosure Agreements signed with corporations in China that want to support the Qtum Blockchain. He went further to say that after we launch the Main Network, there will be an effort put into the “Qtum Enterprise Alliance”. Effectively, this will be a permissioned blockchain that acts as a sandbox for the network.  The next topic discussed was a new virtual machine. If we are successful, we will have a VM that is compatible with the x86 family of programming languages (C, C++, Rust, Haskell, and many others). This will open the floodgate to the masses who are familiar with these platforms. Patrick pointed out that with Solidity, there’s just not enough people that can code for it, making it harder to review for vulnerabilities like the “DAO hack” and “Parity multisig hack”.  The last topic discussed had a lot to do with the Enterprise Alliance, permissioned blockchains, and regulatory systems. There is a need for identity verification on blockchains, above and beyond signing a message. Currently, Qtum creates ‘addresses’ in Base58 starting with the letter “Q”, which can get converted to hex (for compatibility reasons with Solidity) that start with “0”. But moving forward, a permissioned Blockchain will have the functionality to issue addresses starting with “V” for entities that have verified. Ideally, this would be a feature on Qtum’s public network as well.    Office Visits        At Coinone, we met with Steve Sang Hyuck Lim, Coinone’s CIO. There was a lot of Qtum fans around the Coinone office and were happy to meet Patrick. Coinone is a rising Korean exchange that is a part of Korea’s Dayli Financial Group that has grown exponentially over the past year.        The Loop, who is also a member of the Dayli Financial Group, is building a way to connect blockchain ecosystems with their ICON platform. It was great to interact with some of the Korean projects, we can see how fast the community is growing here from how much interest there is in Qtum from Korea and how many new projects are starting here.       Qtum met with Medibloc, who aims to be the first healthcare platform built on top of Qtum’s blockchain. We first met Medibloc at Consensus in May, and have since met in Shanghai and now in Seoul. We are happy that they are able to build on Qtum and wish them the best.         Lastly, we finished up our tour of Seoul by meeting with several media outlets based Korea. They hoped to learn more about Qtum because the blockchain industry is growing so fast in Korea.",False

The Thai people were extremely open to finding out how blockchain technology could benefit them and their country. In Thailand, Energo Labs CEO, Ray Chu, and Energo angel backer Bo Song, along with Qtum met with several institutions to enlighten people about the opportunities at hand.

Currently, 7 companies are building a business on top of Qtum,”    http://technode.com/2017/08/01/qtum-shares-three-blockchain-trends-china/          In a country of centralized authority, a decentralized database is booming. In China, the trend is now building a new business model on top of the blockchain. Blockchain technology is a chain of blocks that each contains data, acting as a way to record what time the data was inserted into it. The cool thing about blockchain is that it’s decentralized, which allows for transactions to occur between parties without the need for a 3rd-party to establish trust.  In the global blockchain landscape, we are now seeing a Ukrainian blockchain-based Wifi router, energy projects in Eastern Europe, decentralized computing, storage, and VPN networks. In China, Qtum (pronounced Quantum) is now becoming a toolset and a platform for companies to build their business on top of the blockchain.  “Now you can build any business on top of the blockchain without intermediary costs and without friction.” Patrick Dai, co-founder and CEO of Qtum (量子链 in Chinese, meaning quantum chain) told TechNode.  The Shanghai-based blockchain company has their own cryptocurrency called Qtum, which now ranks in the top 20 on CryptoCurrencies Market Capitalization index and provides a blockchain application platform to execute “smart contracts” with a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This means that people can facilitate, execute and enforce the negotiation or performance of an agreement, such as a contract, using blockchain technology. The advantage of the Qtum is that it utilizes the core technology from both Bitcoin and Ethereum.  “Blockchain in China is hot these days. Currently, 7 companies are building a business on top of Qtum,” Patrick says.  These seven companies include a Singapore-based blockchain company that announced their first Initial Coin Offering (ICO) on top of Qtum. Energo, uses blockchain technology and smart meters to connect energy producers and consumers in microgrids with traditional electricity users to achieve point-to-point energy trading and energy supply. Other projects building on top of Qtum include Bodhi, a decentralized prediction market, and Vevue, a platform for monetizing digital content.  “Many of these blockchain companies are registered in Singapore, but they are focusing on the Chinese market,” John Scianna, Marketing Director at Qtum told TechNode.  Blockchain trends in China   The Chinese government is also showing positive reactions to this trend of blockchain development, pushing forward the development of blockchain in the coming three years, as blockchain is mentioned in China’s five-year plan (2016-2020) as one of the most promising technologies. The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) is doing research on blockchain technology and completed a successful trial run of self-developed digital currency that uses a limited implementation of blockchain technology.  Patrick also mentioned that authorities will seek to clarify regulations for blockchain projects this year and provide some guidance to help develop the industry.  “The regulation will come for sure and it’s good for the industry. Without regulation, it’s the wild west and it’s not good for the people and for their security,” Patrick said. “It’s a new way for people to collaborate and to build a reward structure to change the idea of VCs and crowdfunding.”  Qtum, as a platform provider for “smart contracts”, is at an early stage to get more adoption in the main society, and Patrick mentioned that the team will slowly build up trust on their blockchain platform.  “We are building trust, not by people, but by blockchain in a decentralized way,” Patrick remarked. “If the blockchain-based smart contracts become popular, the government will make smart contracts legally binding later on.”  Qtum from a consumer product perspective   Patrick Dai, CEO of Qtum was chosen as one of Forbes magazine’s “30 Under 30“, 300 people in Greater China under the age of 30. Forbes China recognized him for his accomplishments in the category of consumer technology. Is blockchain really considered to be a consumer technology? Patrick sees that a consumer product depends on the matter of trust.  “If you see P2P technology as a business model, you aren’t relying on the middleman. Using blockchain, you don’t need escrow, because blockchain is the escrow. The blockchain is offering trust on top of it,” Patrick explains.  An escrow service is someone that holds users’ money when users make a deal to assure their promise. So the blockchain technology can replace the people who do this service. For example, using blockchain, people can make a blockchain-powered application as a counterparty and automate this on blockchain through their computer.  “Each smart contract is a virtual escrow, and this lowers the cost for both parties. The blockchain smart contract program doesn’t sleep,” he said. “You can create 1,000 virtual small escrows this way. It’s like people because they perform the same service.”  Patrick gave an example: China’s biggest real estate company Lianjia has 10,000 people in charge of contract signature and approval, repeating the same process every day for apartment owners, renters, and buyers.  “You don’t need those people. All you need to do is to sign the contract directly, and it’s effective immediately. You can trust each other,” he says. “Blockchain will become the basic architecture and infrastructure like TC/IP protocol. Just like you have a browser as a gateway to the internet, you need a gateway to the blockchain. Qtum is this gateway. Blockchain is the value, like a piece of the house or like a dollar.”  Because of the blockchain, current business models will change, new business models will emerge, and some people will lose their jobs. Patrick says, in some ways, it improves the society.  “Those people who lost their jobs because of changing business models can do other stuff, and it could increase the efficiency of whole society. You don’t need to waste human capital on repetitive tasks,” Patrick said.",False

Currently we offer the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) as one of the Smart Contract platforms we will use. This means that existing Ethereum Smart Contracts can port their code with minimal effort to the Qtum Blockchain. This does not mean that Qtum and Ethereum Smart Contracts can communicate with each other, they are separate blockchains. Unless there is a bridge-style middleware application that can act as a third party.  Moving forward, we are looking at other Smart Contract languages to implement, and we are planning to create our own.

There will be need for a swap, right now Qtum is an ERC20 asset that will need to be converted to main network tokens in September. The official exchanges that we worked with during the crowdsale will swap any Qtum ERC20 tokens to main network if they are left on those platforms. We will have to create a provably 'burnable' swap contract that will exchange ERC20 tokens for Qtum Main Network, but this work hasn't started yet.",False

We finally got Qtum to compile through Gitian. Basically, this means a few things  1. Creating release quality builds (ie, statically linked etc) is now just a trivial set of 3 commands 2. Ordinary users can produce these builds and they will have the exact same bytes and sha256 hash as what we produce. This allows you to confirm that we aren't adding anything extra 3. We will be setup for producing Windows, Linux, and OSX builds for testnet-2, including some packages and installers. This should make things a lot easier for users to get started 4. We now have functioning aarch64 and ARM builds, meaning...   You can run a full-node for Qtum on a raspberry pi without having to compile it yourself, and it is capable of staking, block creation, transaction auditing, smart contract interaction, etc. No Qt wallet though, command-line only.",False

Those Bitcoin addresses that start with 3 instead of 1, we will have something similar.  If you look here:  https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#escrow-and-arbitration  You'll see that we can implement the exact same thing into Qtum, and not have to use a Smart Contract for multisig. This feature has been around for some time now, and we believe it to be secure.   2) For masternodes, I don't believe this will be a Qtum feature. We don't have an opinion on this topic yet.  3) The block size is limited to 2 megabytes, with Segregated Witness ready to go on Main Network launch in September. This should scale well, but if there are problems moving forward with slow transactions, we have a Decentralized Governance Protocol which will allow Qtum Blockchain users to change certain parameters within the network upon reaching a consensus. Basically, people will vote with their tokens, if they would like to raise the size from 2mb to 3mb, it would require a large proportion of the network to 'signal' this. We hope that this will create an environment where the project gets more and more decentralized as time goes on. What we are trying to avoid is a surprise hard fork. For transaction fees and gas costs, we will publish this shortly.  4) Qtum developers will be able to work on the core Blockchain for 4 years or more with the funds we raised in March. We are trying to become more transparent with our finances. Right now we are releasing our expenditures, but we are leading up to audited financials. We kept 12% of the total Qtum tokens for the development team, but we are thinking of maybe only keeping 6% for team members, to be paid monthly over 4 years. The other 6% might go to the Qtum Foundation. We haven't made a decision yet, but those coins are ours to do with as we see fit, so I don't think anyone will mind if we give half of them to our governing entity.",False

By creating a market for microfinancing generation of electricity we can crowdfund infrastructure to provide electricity for the 1.5 billion people in the world currently without.  User Groups:  Consumers:  Consumers are the people interacting with the electric generators to receive electricity. They spend Solar Tokens using their mobile client (or SMS codes) at generators to pay for electricity in kilowatt hour chunks. They can also create requests for solar generators in their region, detailing location, wattage usage, reason for electricty need, etc, which can be bid on by providers and funded by financiers.     Providers:  Providers bid on requests from consumers. They provide bids detailing type of solar energy unit, cost of installation, time for installation, their insurance, etc.  (FUTURE) Need to be verified or have some reputation modeling or have some sort of insurance.   Insurers:  Planned for the future Insure providers or financiers Provide derivatives of energy futures. Sell part ownership of many utilities for n time. Financiers: Can be large institutions (Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank, etc) or anyone with money. Can even be part or fully owned by the community itself. Get the emotional payout of helping bring electricity to the underprivileged as well as the financial incentive into micro financing infrastructure.     Specs:  Request:  {    “Location”: STRING,    “Creator”: STRING, //address of the owner who submitted the tx    “WATTAGE_REQ”: INT,    “REASON”: STRING }  Bid: {    “ProviderAddr”: STRING,    “Unit_type”: STRING,    “Cost_of_installation”: INT }  Process:  Consumers make a request for a new generator. They list the location, wattage requirements, reason for request, etc. Providers look through requests and bid on them. They include the type of generator, cost of installation, time for installation, insurance, etc. This bidding process is open for ONE WEEK. Consumers can then accept one of the bids, at which point... Financiers bid on consumer accepted requests. This process is open for ONE MONTH. If the request is successfully funded a generator contract is created to represent the pending device. The Financiers that own the the generator should all call the smart contract and submit their preferred cost for electricity the smart contract should charge. The price is the average of all submitted values weighted by the ownership stake each financier has. If no financier has submitted a price request, then the average is just 0 and the generator runs for free. If only some of the financiers have provided a price, it’s just the average of the ones provided. If you don’t vote, you don’t get a voice and must accept the price set by your co financiers.  The Provider that won the bid then installs the generator in the location specified. The Consumer that issued the request than approves the installation by instantiating the generator by sending an initial token to it. The first tx MUST be by the Consumer that issued the request. After initialization, the generator can be funded by anyone and used by anyone.  Consumers can then fund the generator get electricity. They pay in solar tokens which are then disbursed to financiers proportionate to their ownership stake in the generator. Consumers can buy these solar tokens from exchanges. Financiers make money by selling their solar tokens on exchanges to anyone who wants to buy. Solar tokens have a consumptive value on the platform, not just a speculative value, so there’s always a demand.    Tech:  Contracts:  Solar Tokens: ERC 20 token contract. ICO a limited supply of x million . MarketPlace (split into two sections): New Generators: Consumers make requests with the given metadata (location, wattage, reason for request, etc). Request is bid on and then awarded. Old Generators: Financiers can sell all or part of their ownership of their generators or even market futures and based on the generators ownerships they own.  Generators:  Each generator is it’s own smart contract. Issues 10,000 (100.00%) ownership tokens at inception based on proportionate financing. GetAvg(): read only function that returns the average price of what the generator should charge for electricity. Status pending until first tx which needs to be done by Consumer who created the initial request. (Future) Funds set aside for maintenance / some catch for it.    Stack:  Flask Microservice to interact with Qtum RPC React front end for UI     Interesting Points:  Very interesting use case for trusted execution environments. Only the solar generator should be able to make its transactions, someone shouldn’t be able to mess with it. Smart Contracts built with generic “Utility Model”. Crowdfunding electricity now, but could crowdfund any utility (Water Mill, Textile Machines, etc…) Providers can have radically different ways units and reputation.

Their critiques will be covered and posted later, as the projects are released.  The other prize is $10,000.00 worth of Qtum tokens, awarded to whichever project builds the best use case on the Qtum Blockchain (test network).

A fix for the remaining issue is coming soon * [EVM/Consensus] Fixed a bug where multiple gas refunds to the same address and of the same amount could be left out of a block and still be valid, allowing stakers to potentially still gas refunds  Work completed: * [Build/Documentation] Added instructions for building Qtum on OSX * [EVM/Consensus] Changed the EVM blockchain interface so that it behaves the exact same as in Ethereum, making Qtum smart contracts 100% compatible with Ethereum * [Consensus] Changed the ""VM version"" field within transactions to properly use our designed version format, and enforce that unknown versions are not allowed on the blockchain * [P2P] Added several rules for standard transactions, including sane ranges for allowed gas limits, gas price, and VM versions * [Consensus] Added a consensus rule that extremely low gas-limit transactions are now allowed on the blockchain. This only affects executions that were not provided enough gas to actually execute anything anyway  In-progress work and soon to be fixed bugs:  * [MPoS/Consensus] Final testing and bug fixing in MPoS is nearly complete * [DGP/Consensus] Final testing and bug fixing for DGP should be complete next week",False

Again, I am completely on-board the Qtum project and the amazing work that the devs have done, but I just don't see a way that Western users get over Dai's previous work in BitBay if it's not properly addressed and explained. So far, all I can find through research is the word of David Zimbeck, which certainly is biased in his favor.

Some people (primarily accounts created or which have suddenly become active in the past month or two here and on reddit) continue to bring this issue up. Read the Smith and Crown article if you want a fairly unbiased account of where it stands. Nothing has changed because it's he-said vs he-said. There is no consensus to come to regarding a ""solution"", or anything to ""clear up"". We've made our statement and he disagrees with it; there's nothing else to be done. Furthermore, all of the things that Smith and Crown have said would rectify this concern in their eyes have already been accomplished, such as financial transparency and our code being released with all of the things implemented we said we would. Additionally, Qtum has 3 co-founders, it's not just one person running the entire project. We manage ourselves in a way that it's impossible, even if 1 of us became corrupt, to just up and run away with the crowdfunded money. This is common sense in any blockchain project like this.

Qtum tokens will not swap automatically if withdrawn as an ERC20 token. There will either be a swap contract available, or they will need to be sent to an exchange after September 30th. More information will be available as we reach September.  What the ERC20 tokens do for you is allow you to take possession of your Qtum, if you do not want to leave them on an exchange. After September 30th, there will be methods available for a swap.  When you are withdrawing Qtum ERC20, please make sure to do a small test transaction first to make sure you have everything working.",False

Tim answered questions about Draper University and explaining why he plans to make ICO's and Cryptocurrencies a core module in the upcoming Fall program at Draper University. Tim Draper was an early supporter of bitcoin and its underlying blockchain financial ledger technology. Tim is also an early investor in companies such as Tesla, Hotmail, Skype, etc. and co-founded DFJ Venture Capital.  During the AMA, many of the participants focused their questions around Tim’s recent blockchain investments, what countries he thinks are the most forward thinking regarding the technology, and the future of ICOs.  Patrick Dai, one of Draper University's graduates and Founder of the Qtum Foundation co-hosted the livestream and detailed how attending Draper University enabled him to pursue a blockchain startup.  Patrick highlighted his experience during survival week as making him more resilient and agile, something that is especially needed being in the blockchain industry. Patrick also talked about how Qtum is different from other blockchain projects and his hopes to expand the industry by working with Draper University in the future.  For those interested in applying to Draper University, Qtum will be giving away 50 Qtum tokens to the first 100 applicants of Draper U for this upcoming semester. We hope you learn a lot while you're there, just as Patrick and John did!

Tim will explain the rationale behind why cryptocurrencies and ICO's are now a separate module in the Draper University Fall program. Learn more at Draperuniversity.com. We will have John Scianna, one of our Draper University graduates and a Marketing Director at the Qtum Foundation to co-host the livestream and detail how attending Draper Unviersity enabled him to pursue a blockchain startup. Qtum raised $15.6 million in March, making it the fourth largest blockchain crowdsale at the time and released its testnet, “Sparknet,” in June. Qtum is the first proof-of-stake blockchain platform with smart contract technology. Qtum has built-in a decentralized governance protocol that allows blockchain parameters to be changed by votes from different stakeholders. With this technology, the Qtum blockchain becomes self-regulating, self-modifying, and self-aware. Tim Draper was an early supporter of bitcoin and its underlying blockchain financial ledger technology. He participated in the Tezos slated ICO which raised $200M+ within four days. Tim is also an early investor in companies such as Tesla, Hotmail, Skype, etc. and co-founded DFJ Venture Capital",False

If you’ve had any exposure to the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, you’ve probably heard of the term “fork.” Not unlike the layman’s definition (and not the one that involves eating), a fork occurs when developers veer away to a new project using code based off of another already developed.  The topic of forks has received a lot of attention in recent past, when part of the ethereum community found it necessary to fork project due to a breach in an Ethereum-based contract known as “The DAO” and currently with the upcoming User Activated Soft Fork (UASF), which is set to occur August 1.   Forks come in different varieties, including soft, user-activated and hard forks.   A so-called soft fork is a backward-compatible shift in a blockchain, or decentralized network. Backwards compatibility means, in a decentralized framework, nodes are not required to upgrade in order to maintain consensus since all blocks with the new soft forked rules also follow the old rules; therefore, old clients accept them.  As such only miners are typically required to activate a soft fork as old nodes — the systems connected to the network — are able to accept blocks without upgrading.   Miners are inclined to eventually adopt the new version of the software or risk ending up on the losing end of the soft fork, essentially the minority group that decides to remain with either the old or new protocol, depending on how the pendulum of choice swings. To be a successful soft fork, more than half of the mining power must be running for a client to recognize the change.  Nevertheless, as the label suggests, a soft fork is a less significant turn of events than a hard fork, which requires buy-in or acceptance across all players on the network.     User Activated Soft Forks   A User Activated Soft Fork, or UASF is a more sophisticated soft fork that can be enacted, typically, by the economic majority within a peer-to-peer network. It usually requires substantial industry support and a cohesive effort to make it work. Nodes in a decentralized infrastructure, and the rest of the economic majority, which includes the networks ecosystem of wallets and exchanges, are typically the deciding cadre; however, this is not always the case, as with Bitcoin Improvement Protocol (BIP) 148.   BIP 148   In BIP 148, a UASF is initiated as a signal to move toward mandatory activation of Segregated Witness deployment. The window in which enactment of BIP to be initiative sits between midnight, Aug. 1, 2017 and midnight, Nov. 15, 2017. Segregated Witness, or ‘SegWit’, is the process by which the block size limit on a blockchain is increased by removing signature data from Bitcoin transactions. When certain parts of a transaction are removed, this frees up space to add more transactions to the chain thereby increasing the overall throughput of transactions on the network.   BIP 148 is not the typical modus operandi for a UASF which implement a soft fork that requires action from miners. Normally nodes would just begin enforcement on a given “flag day” as with BIP16, which was how the Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) soft fork was activated in 2012 — a flag day was signaled whereby nodes agreed to start enforcing the new protocol. P2SH was activated with relatively little friction.          But since four-fifths of the node network have already upgraded to SegWit capable software, it is up to the miners to shift and begin accepting blocks as according to the new protocol. Of course, a lot rides on where the rest of the economic majority — the wallets and exchanges — move to.   If the economic majority is signaling as of Aug. 1 for the adoption of BIP148, miners are incentivized to follow with the masses. However, nodes don’t represent a true reflection of the community since they can be rented on cloud services to skew the numbers. Nonetheless, not shifting to the new protocol that has an economic majority would be an unwise financial decision because it would make it difficult to sell coins mined after that date as the blocks would not be accepted by the majority. This would be tantamount to mining an alternative coin not recognized by users and exchanges, a poor business decision.    Why is including SegWit so contentious?    SegWit fixes one of the longest known issues in Bitcoin that has gone unfixed in part termed transaction malleability which is important to the long-term, global scalability of Bitcoin’s blockchain network. Transaction malleability allows more sophisticated users to change the ID of a transaction before it is confirmed in the blockchain.  The reason this has become so contentious is because fixing transaction malleability would allow layer two technologies to be implemented in a less nuanced approach. Layer two technologies, such as lightning networks, would allow bitcoin transactions to take place off-chain in a far more streamlined way.   Now when you combine that with the fact that SegWit allows the witness signature to be excluded from the transaction data, you can begin to understand why some miners are putting up a fight. Additionally, SegWit introduces script versioning, which would extend the bitcoin protocol by allowing rules to the witness to be changed by a soft fork. One innovation that is likely to be proposed are Schnoor signatures. Schnoor signatures would additionally help raise a blockchain network’s throughput because transactions would only need one signature which benefits are realized in the case of multisig transactions. Schnoor signatures also offer some privacy benefits too. Bitcoin users typically pay a per byte fee to have their transaction approved by the network. Excluding witness data, which grows with the more witnesses a transaction has, would mean that transaction fees would decrease on a per transaction basis. Coupled with the fact that with layer two technologies, where users can make transactions off-chain, miners stand to lose a significant portion of their revenue.       To put the range of profits in perspective, on June 7, miners on the Bitcoin network received over $1.78 million dollars in fees. On July 10, however, the total transaction fees decreased to $486,419.52, which correlated with less network activity. Thus preservation of the status quo has significant financial merit for miners. However, the loss in revenue if miners don’t move with the economic majority will be even more substantial and presents a strong claim to believe, with majority support for SegWit, miners must and will follow.  Another reason SegWit has been so contentious is that some claim, that miners are using ASICBoost, which give them an advantage when mining. SegWit would help level the playing field for miners if this were the case.       SegWit Support from Miners, SegWit is still far from the 95% activation threshold.        What is a blockchain hard fork?     With a hard fork, everyone — miners, merchants, and users — has to upgrade to the new client or code. Hard forks are not backward-compatible, which means old nodes will not, typically, accept blocks created by new nodes.       In this event, the blockchain becomes two blockchains as the network splits if there isn't unanimous consensus. In the context of Bitcoin Core’s scaling roadmap and the upcoming BIP 148 UASF on Aug. 1, and the New York Agreement (NYA), led by Digital Currency Group’s Barry Silbert, efforts to fork the network are momentous.    The New York Agreement    The New York Agreement is based on the “SegWit2x” proposal, that puts forth a proposal that couples activation of SegWit with an added block-size-increase hard fork at some later point. SegWit itself offers an increase equivalent of two to four megabytes, but the added hard fork would double this to a maximum equivalent to eight megabytes. According to DCG’s Medium post, the soft fork will be activated “at an 80% threshold,” (presumably) referring to hash power. And the hard fork will be activated “within six months.”     NYA Signaling   The percentage of blocks signaling for the NYA — by including the letters “NYA” in the blocks they mine — sat at 88% on July 11, which is above the threshold target needed for activation. Although, most of the core developers are against method off coupling SegWit with a hard fork later.     Bitcoin Developer Support for BIPs & Segwit2x      Can bitcoin remain as one chain is the central question because its value is based on the network. This becomes especially concerning when some propose to use their power to implement a User Activated Hard Fork. While some people believe forks are a natural part of software development, the Singapore-based Qtum Foundation and others like us are working to eliminate them as much as possible.    The Qtum Solution     The Qtum Foundation, the developer of the Qtum blockchain which recently put out its first public test of its innovative platform, Sparknet, aims to solve this problem in part. A blockchain community consists of more than solely developers, miners, and node operators. That’s why taking a vote from just one of the groups isn’t ideal.   Jordan Earls, lead core developer and co-founder of the Qtum Project, said Qtum’s blockchain architecture was constructed in such a way, and with features in mind, to avoid the entire divisive construct of forking within in a decentralized network.  With Qtum’s combination of the technological advantages of the UTXO model, the EVM and proof-of-stake consensus, tethered to a unique Decentralized Governance Protocol (DGP), it would, according to Earls, be a trivial matter to enact a blocksize upgrade. “Qtum’s blockchain won’t completely replace forks, but it can cut down on the number of forks needed,” Earls said.   “Basically the blockchain is designed so that the blockchain itself is aware of a governing system within it. Some of the parameters and roles can be changed using this governance system. Mainly designed to be used for reactionary purposes.” Earls continued. Qtum wants to keep the network whole, while still innovating and taking as much input from community stakeholders. With Qtum’s Decentralized Governance Protocol, nodes, wallets, the core developers, and other industry stakeholders can coordinate more effectively allowing for seamless network upgrades.   The DGP is powerful enough that its governance structure can be completely replaced. So, the governing parties might later vote on a “meta-proposal” to replace the controllers of the DGP. This would allow for the governance to changed to a multi-tier setup, such as requiring a certain number of board members, as well as a certain number of core developers to vote on a proposal before it can be approved. However, the end goal is much more ambitious than a traditional governance system. Because a smart contract can also be a governing party of the DGP, it is possible to create significantly more complicated structures. In the future, we could also require a certain number of community votes or votes from stakers.   Beyond even that though, it is also possible to create a smart contract which monitors the blockchain’s status and health. And this monitoring smart contract could be made capable of creating and approving its proposals. With this technology, it is possible to make the blockchain self-regulating, self-modifying, and self-aware.   We believe this technology is a significant step forward and will be instrumental in Qtum being the first self-aware blockchain that can quickly adapt to a rapidly changing ecosystem and community without requiring constant interruption of the ecosystem to fix unforeseen problems.   With over two years of heated debates on scaling, only time will tell if Bitcoin can push blocks further. One thing is for sure; it will be an interesting summer with the UASF, Segwit2x, and the release of DGP in August.",False

An authentic scam accusation is one thing, but what gleb is doing here and a handful of other threads is not a scam accusation. Its a strategic tactic from 2012, the year he is stuck in. As the grassroots of crypto really got rooted, competitors thought of this tactic to combat competition. See to really understand Bruno and his stronghold on Bruno you must first understand he was and still is one of the paid trolls from 2010 till now. He made most of his money around 2011 and 2012 where he subsequently had his small fortune stolen from him, most likely by a disgruntled victim of his.  The bottom line about Gleb Gamopw is this, he has a criminal record, he has stolen from people in the past, and then had a chance to even give the man his money back but opted to use someone elses money he stole to go to a bitcoin conference and make himself look good in front of others. HE is also quoted in my thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1012713.0 that he will lie to get any advantage over his competition. IS this really a man you want to listen to? or entrust funds to?  He can say all he wants about me, but I started a service a few years ago, it is still in existance, we naturally had the same risk any crypto venture does. No matter what it is in crypto, there is ALWAYS some kind of risk of loss. However, we still make weekly payouts to the members, we have never been late on one payment, EVER, we are still here, and still doing our best we can for our members. I have not stolen anything from anyone still to this day, and no matter how he feels about any advertising techniques used, its advertisement. Pure and simple, but rest assured everything he gripes or has griped about me he has utilized in his own venture.  He still refuses to answer the simple question, why didnt you just give the guy his money back instead of using it for your own personal benefit.  The real funny thing about Bruno, he has no programming experience so he has no control over his own coin, he has no coding experience so he uses a cheap 1990 blog template for hsi website, he is known to break the law, and steal money from unsuspecting new people. But has the odacity to not only try and create an ICO which is primarily based on truth, but to attack anyone else he deems may be a competitor of his.  As far as QTUM is concerned anything we do in crypto is a risk. I personally like POS coins, becasue they are more efficient, they less costly to mine, and the equipment needed to mine in POS may lose value over time, but you can always sell the coins after you have generated profits,  where as with any POW you are stuck with an over-priced miner that will most likely be useless in 6 months to a year.  Check the wallet make sure there are no viruses, that si the most important. if there is more than the one false negative that wo0uld be cloned form the Peercoin code base do not use it. anything else was added after the clone. My personal opinion about POS coins is wait till the launch hype has died down and see about getting in. I do not do ICOs ever, but I am very interested in good POS coins. As a matter of fact the service I run is solely based on POS coins. We are not accepting new members at the present moment tho so there is no need to try. We are reworking the pool for better returns for the members and do not want to get new members until we have finished that. My POS Pool was the first of its kind and with it came obstacles and situations we did not expect including the implosion of Cryptsy. We have had to make a lot of changes that even i did not want to make. But the pool is still there, members continue to get paid and we are reworking it for the best of the members we have now.",False

Our developers worked a lot in the past on VM's, and the DGP still has to be implemented in a test environment. The first Testnet is a working proof-of-concept, but all of the functionality has not yet been implemented.    We will be updating the development roadmap, adding new features, but with software releases it is very hard to promise release dates. What we have right now is what we know we can deliver with the resources available. As we hire more developers, and make public the new features we can reasonably fit into the codebase, there might be multiple versions of the Testnet.  Let's go over a few points:      16, Qtum Mining     The miners are tools for pushing blocks to the network automatically. We need them to avoid using generate to push new blocks and for the network being up.  The PoW mining have a lot of options due to the use of Bitcoin miners. •   Internal Miner •   CPU miners •   Graphic card miners  PoW mining will be used only for the initial blocks for establishing the stake holders. Any miner will be sufficient for PoW. PoS miner is needed after the mining of the initial PoS blocks for staking. The PoS miner is the one used in Blackcoin. Parameters are needed for activating and deactivating the miners when Quantum is started. The parameter ""gen"" was used to start the ""Internal Miner"" for PoW, the parameter ""staking"" to start the staking miner. For Quantum that could be different.    17, Update The Maximum Amount of Coins    File amount.h contain the code for the maximum coins: static const CAmount MAX_MONEY = 21000000 * COIN; PoS doesn't have halving interval, so the sum will diverge (infinity). The MAX_MONEY needs to be updated to the maximum supported number.      18, Add 'Coinbase' and 'Coinstake' checks in Transaction    This check will determine the type of transaction.  Coinbase check if the input coins have no previous output that generate them. Those are the new coins created as reward for mining a PoW block.  Coinstake check if the input coins have previous output that generate them and the first output of the transaction is empty, the second or the third is the reward. The first output is empty to prevent it being mistaken for normal transaction. If the input is small then the output coins are contained in the second output, otherwise they are splitted between the second and the third output.  We can add additional check called IsNormal (or other more suitable name) that will be used to define normal transaction, not a generated one like the PoW and PoS transactions.  Also insure that no OP_CREATE nor OP_CALL transactions can be used for staking     19 , Add Timestamps for Stake Transactions    The time-stamp is the time that the transaction has been created. It is used for PoS to avoid including transactions in the block that have time bigger then the block time. Transaction with bigger time will eventually be include in the chain when the value for the time become less then the one from the block time.  The other uses for the parameter is to determine the staking time for the block (the time of the PoS transaction).   20 , Signing Staked Blocks    The creator of new PoS block need to sign the block so the other miners can verify that the block is created from the miner and check its validity. According to PoS 3, the first transaction is empty in case of PoS. The second transaction is the PoS transaction in the block.

Because of this, many of the decentralized applications presented were built on Ethereum as well as deployed to the Qtum testnet.""    https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/moscows-blockchain-hackathon-reflects-booming-blockchain-industry-russia/              Since Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed interest in Ethereum at his meeting with Vitalik Buterin at the World Economic Forum held in St. Petersburg, the blockchain industry in Russia has been quick to heat up. The Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference in Saint Petersburg was held in June, followed immediately by a blockchain-focused hackathon called BlockchainHack in Moscow, with 150 people in attendance competing for $100,000 worth of cryptocurrency.       The hackathon took place at the Paveletsky Art Center, a massive building in downtown Moscow that has become the de facto hub for blockchain technology in Russia, with an increasing number of blockchain developers and enthusiasts who work out of it. The event was jointly organized by BTC Media, Qtum, Zerion, Waves, the Token Fund and Blockchain School, with additional support from the community in Russia.    The teams presented ambitious demos with winning topics including a mobile application to track and invest into ICOs; an arbitration service based on smart contracts and a reputation system; facial recognition software to determine what ICOs and blockchain projects a blockchain developer has been involved in and is currently active with; among others.    The winning team, Wafer, presented a demo and vision of creating a distributed Wi-Fi network using blockchain technology. They effectively allow routers to sell traffic without being tied to a particular software on the device. It uses smart contracts to ensure that users all pay for their traffic and that a user is guaranteed to get access to the internet after payment.    Qtum was the largest sponsor of the hackathon, and with members of the Qtum Foundation in attendance, many of the developers deployed their applications to Ethereum as well as Qtum. Qtum is a hybrid blockchain that merges the UTXO transaction model of Bitcoin with the EVM on Ethereum. It began as a fork of Bitcoin and the team added in an abstraction layer to integrate the EVM, ultimately allowing any developer tool built for Ethereum to also be available on Qtum, including Solidity smart contracts and Web3. Because of this, many of the decentralized applications presented were built on Ethereum as well as deployed to the Qtum testnet.    Prize money was awarded in Qtum tokens, Waves tokens and ether (ETH): as the grand prize winner, Wafer took home 5,000 Qtum tokens, valued at over $50,000. Qtum also awarded two other teams with 2,500 and 1,000 tokens for second and third prize.    Waves awarded their top three picks with 500 Waves, 300 Waves and 100 Waves, respectively. The winning Waves team developed a platform that uses facial recognition software for investors to quickly determine which ICO projects a person has been involved in.    The winning project in the Ethereum category, as selected by Zerion, created an interface for investors to quickly invest in multiple ICOs, and was awarded 10 ETH.    Patrick Dai, the cofounder of the Qtum project, said to Bitcoin Magazine, “We can see why this was the largest blockchain hackathon in Russia. Lots of developers brought new ideas to the table. We want to promote these projects that can bring the world closer together and spur innovation. We think that’s the purpose of blockchain technology, and it’s our purpose at Qtum.”    Alex Bash, one of the cofounders of Zerion, told Bitcoin Magazine, “I personally was really inspired by the idea of Wafer, a team that implemented a protocol that allows users and routers to share internet [access]. Their idea is based on smart contracts that guarantee the fair prices and conditions for both parties. Also the Lapti team who developed a product that processes various cryptocurrencies, generates a hot wallet for each user and aggregates their payments to a single wallet after collection of statistics and analytics.”    Every one of the 25 teams that participated presented a demo of the software they had created over the weekend.    “Overall, I think it’s a good result for the hackathon, that most of the teams not only came up with interesting ideas, but developed real products and solutions during the weekend,” said Bash.    Rodion Mikhalev, the director of the Blockchain Education Network in Russia, attended both the conference in Saint Petersburg and the hackathon in Moscow. He said that he expects the community in Russia will continue to grow very quickly.    “The Russian Government approved the entire concept of cryptocurrencies a few weeks ago, and a new industry in Russia has been unleashed surrounding blockchain technology,” Mikhalev told Bitcoin Magazine. “At the hackathon, we witnessed something new and extraordinary: a combination of smarts and digital innovation and a sense that through the evolution of blockchain technology, we will see Russia quickly rise as a powerhouse in the tech world. There will be a lot of positive products and services adapted to blockchain technology at a rapid pace.”    What happens next in regard to blockchain development in Russia remains to be seen, as there are still few blockchain companies that operate in the country. One thing we can be certain of though is that the technology is now high on their radar.",False

If you receive a Qtum related message, please report them immediately. The team does not endorse this kind of activity)      Qtum Sparknet Launched      The Qtum testnet, Sparknet, went live as scheduled on June 28th. If you're a developer, you can get started creating applications on top of Qtum and prepare to launch them once we release Qtum's mainnet in September.  To download the necessary software go to: https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/tag/testnet-sparknet  For Qtum Testnet Tokens, visit our faucet: http://qtum.me/  For the Qtum Blockchain Explorer, visit: https://qtum.info/  We encourage you to ask questions on our forum: https://forum.qtum.org/         Testnet Launch   The Test Network launch event held in Shanghai was a great success. Roughly 250 Qtum supporters attended the event to see what we had been working hard on over the past year and get an introduction to the dapps.           BlockchainHack - Moscow   BlockchainHack, which took place this past weekend at the Pavletsky Art Center in Moscow, was the largest blockchain in Russia to date. Over one hundred developers participated in the event and even more came to learn about blockchain technology. The weekend started off with 45 groups which were narrowed down to 25. Developers stayed up all night to win part of $100,000 in prizes. BlockchainHack was made possible by the almost 20 partners that helped organize, fund, and promote the hackathon.            The third place Qtum prize for 1,000 Qtum tokens went to BlockJudge. BlockJudge is an arbitration service based on smart contracts and a reputation system. In the case of conflicts, customers can open a dispute in our arbitration system. The arbitrators/judges stake their reputation and arbitrators reward distribution depending on it so, they are motivated to resolve a dispute fairly. Check out the team’s project on  https://github.com/BlockJudge/BlockJudge          The second place Qtum prize for 2,500 Qtum tokens went to Jufy. Jufy is an app that lets people see upcoming ICOs and participate in them through the app. The team of two plans to follow through with the app they built and make it available to everyone in the future. We hope that these two students have enough time over summer to get this out, we can’t wait.          The first place Qtum prize for 5,000 Qtum tokens went to Wafer. This is a decentralized router sharing service. The platform offers this functionality: To distribute the Internet for rent through a router or to lease traffic from an Internet router that distributes it. With the advent of the platform, people no longer have to do without the Internet when it is necessary - at any time the user can find the nearest distributing router and rent traffic. Here’s their  https://github.com/playertwo/wafer        We would like to thank all the developers and people who made BlockchainHack such a success. We realize that it’s always a little difficult to try new things and get them working in just one weekend. So, for the developers who were building on Qtum, our hats are off to you. We hope we can come back soon to host another hackathon in Russia, but until then, keep building.        Qtum's State of Expenditures   As promised, we are releasing how we are using the Foundations funds in order to be the most transparent blockchain project. Keep in mind that these expenses are priced in BTC which has gone up over the months and makes the expenses appear like they are decreasing. The real costs in dollar terms should go up as we expand our team and gear up for the mainnet release in September. Please note, some of the expenses weren't amortized over the period of their use, which is why some months have more expenses. We will be releasing the amount of funds we hold in BTC, ETH, and USD later this month.            In the news     The Qtum Press Release was picked up by two news sites:      http://www.econotimes.com/Qtum-Foundation-launches-Sparknet--first-public-test-of-blockchain-platform-779101       http://www.coinspeaker.com/2017/06/28/qtum-unveils-worlds-first-proof-stake-smart-contracts-platform/         SOURCE: QTUM PLACE/DATE: SINGAPORE - JUNE 28TH, 2017 Leading-edge technology brings best of blockchain together     The Qtum Foundation is pleased to announce the launch of Sparknet, the first public test of its innovative blockchain platform, which combines crucial advantages of Bitcoin, Ethereum’s Virtual Machine and proof-of-stake consensus.  The Qtum (pronounced Quantum) blockchain model was inspired by the rivalry between proponent developers of the world’s most active blockchain communities, said Qtum co-founder Patrick Dai.  “We want to illustrate efficient scalability and compatibility between blockchain technologies,” said Dai. Qtum raised $15.6 million in a crowdsale in March.  The Qtum blockchain operates according to the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model, which ensures consistency in transactions and the traceability of tokens. At the same time, a virtual machine for smart contracts is layered on top of Qtum’s blockchain, which presents to developers a best-of-both-worlds architecture for the construction of decentralized mobile applications and other blockchain-based ventures.  Co-founder Jordan Earls, who leads Qtum’s team of almost two-dozen developers, said the testnet would feature an Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contract implementation along with Qtum’s proof-of-stake protocol.  “I’m ready to get this in the hands of the community and see what everyone’s response to it will be, in particular, what features other developers can come up with,” said Earls.  “The Qtum team continues to execute and build what can be one of the most exciting and innovative railroads in the blockchain ecosystem,” said Matthew Roszak, Qtum Angel investor and co-founder of Bloq.  Six decentralized applications are already being built for the blockchain, Dai said. Among the applications are a peer-to-peer mobile streaming platform and a prediction market.  While these applications are geared to the Chinese market, the Qtum blockchain will appeal to a global audience, accessible to all developers.  “Like many others around the world, I’m eagerly awaiting the launch,” said Roger Ver, a Qtum Angel investor who has been investing in bitcoin startups since the beginning.  To get developers familiar with Qtum, the Foundation is sponsoring a hackathon in Moscow on July 1-2. For more information, visit blockchainhack.ru.  Visit Qtum’s Github page to view the project’s code repository, which will be accessible to the public on the day of the testnet launch.  About Qtum  Qtum is a blockchain application platform. At its core, Qtum combines the advantages of Bitcoin Core, an Account Abstraction Layer that allows for multiple virtual machines, such as the Ethereum Virtual Machine and a proof-of-stake consensus protocol aimed at tackling industry use cases. The Qtum Foundation, headquartered in Singapore, is the decision-making body that drives the project’s development.      Another project builds on the Qtum Blockchain:    https://www.bodhi.network/         Powered by Qtum Smart Contract Engine With UTXO and POS   Bodhi prediction market will be built on top of the Qtum blockchain. Qtum combines Bitcoin Core infrastructure with Ethereum Virtual Machine to provide stability, modularity and interoperability for dApp built on its platform. Bodhi aims to be one of the earliest and largest dApps run on Qtum.  Disrupt China Prediction Market The world's largest emerging market   With the largest internet users in this world, China potentially will become the largest prediction market. Bodhi focuses on brining China prediction market to the world. And unlock crowded wisdom with real decentralized application.  Augur + Gnosis A perfect combination of Augur and Gnosis   Bodhi platform enables both centralized third party Oracle and decentralized voting-based Oracle by bringing a Oracle abstraction layer. Meanwhile, Bodhi brings a replaceable Oracle mechanism so that to make our platform efficient and self-governed.",False

This seems to happen each time we post an update on this thread. These messages started going out a few hours before a DDoS attack happened on our website. Please disregard any Qtum related spam messages from any senders on this forum, and report them immediately.   BlockchainHack Russia  07-03-2017  BlockchainHack, which took place this past weekend at the Pavletsky Art Center in Moscow, was the largest blockchain in Russia to date. Over one hundred developers participated in the event and even more came to learn about blockchain technology. The weekend started off with 45 groups which were narrowed down to 25. Developers stayed up all night to win part of $100,000 in prizes. BlockchainHack was made possible by the almost 20 partners that helped organize, fund, and promote the hackathon.       The third place Qtum prize for 1,000 Qtum tokens went to BlockJudge. BlockJudge is an arbitration service based on smart contracts and a reputation system. In the case of conflicts, customers can open a dispute in our arbitration system. The arbitrators/judges stake their reputation and arbitrators reward distribution depending on it so, they are motivated to resolve a dispute fairly. Check out the team’s project on https://github.com/BlockJudge/BlockJudge       The second place Qtum prize for 2,500 Qtum tokens went to Jufy. Jufy is an app that lets people see upcoming ICOs and participate in them through the app. The team of two plans to follow through with the app they built and make it available to everyone in the future. We hope that these two students have enough time over summer to get this out, we can’t wait.       The first place Qtum prize for 5,000 Qtum tokens went to Wafer. Wafer is a decentralized router sharing service. The platform supports two options: to distribute the Internet for rent through a router or to lease traffic from an Internet router that distributes it. With the advent of the platform, people no longer have to do without the Internet when it is necessary - at any time the user can find the nearest distributing router and rent traffic. Here’s there Github: https://github.com/playertwo/wafer       We would like to thank all the developers and people who made BlockchainHack such a success. We realize that it’s always a little difficult to try new things and get them working in just one weekend. So, for the developers who were building on Qtum, our hats are off to you. We hope we can come back soon to host another hackathon in Russia, but until then, keep building.      https://qtum.org/en/blog/blockchainhack-russia",False

Our block target is about 2 minutes, about 5 times faster than Bitcoin Core, but not so short that we have blocks with no (or very few transactions) being processed.  If this isn't enough, our Decentralized Governance Protocol allows Qtum Token holders to change certain variables on the network, including the block size. This means if we run into issues in the future, instead of arguing about what to do, users can just fix the issue by voting. The nodes will accept the changes, and there will be no need to fork.

It functions as a basic faucet. It doesn't help if you don't already have some coins because gas is required to use it. However, if you need more coins you can use this faucet to retrieve 100 coins at a time. You can also use it to send coins to other addresses not owned by you.  Here is the contract code, it's very simple:  pragma solidity ^0.4.11;  contract QtumFaucet {     uint constant COIN = 100000000;     function deposit() public payable{     }     function withdraw() public{         uint amount = 100 * COIN;         if(this.balance < 100 * COIN){             amount = this.balance;         }         if(!msg.sender.send(amount)){             throw;         }     }     function send(address a) public{         uint amount = 100 * COIN;         if(this.balance < 100 * COIN){             amount = this.balance;         }         if(!a.send(amount)){             throw;         }    }     function() payable{} } This contract generates this ABI JSON file:  [{""constant"":false,""inputs"":[],""name"":""withdraw"",""outputs"":[],""payable"":false,""type"":""function""},{""constant"":false,""inputs"":[{""name"":""a"",""type"":""address""}],""name"":""send"",""outputs"":[],""payable"":false,""type"":""function""},{""constant"":false,""inputs"":[],""name"":""deposit"",""outputs"":[],""payable"":true,""type"":""function""},{""payable"":true,""type"":""fallback""}] This contract is deployed to the sparknet at address f28aa77dd07ee8a1288ab6f41b23ebf6d605dc3e.  To initially fill this contract I will use ""ethabi"" like so:  ethabi encode function ~/faucet.json deposit d0e30db0 I deposit 1000 tokens to the faucet now using sendtocontract:  ./qtum-cli sendtocontract f28aa77dd07ee8a1288ab6f41b23ebf6d605dc3e d0e30db0 1000 After this transaction has confirmed we can actually withdraw some funds from the faucet contract. So, lets get an address:  ./qtum-cli getaccountaddress x QUvMQdxMxUuCQ7zLHvAcfmhFWyP9kkjr8C So, we now use that to construct our ABI data using ethabi again:  ethabi encode function ~/faucet.json send -p QUvMQdxMxUuCQ7zLHvAcfmhFWyP9kkjr8C error: Tokenizer(FromHex(Invalid character 'Q' at position 0)) Now we face a problem. Solidity doesn't actually use base58 addresses, it uses hex addresses like in Ethereum. This includes the ABI data as well. We must first convert our base58 address QUvMQdxMxUuCQ7zLHvAcfmhFWyP9kkjr8C to a hex address. A recent update to Qtum has added two RPC calls for this purpose: gethexaddress and fromhexaddress.  ./qtum-cli gethexaddress QUvMQdxMxUuCQ7zLHvAcfmhFWyP9kkjr8C 5b3a45e69dbbd7b3a9db31a8c855040f35793929 What this does is actually takes the data encoded in the base58 address, validates that it is not corrupted and is the right size, and then will return that data as a hex string. This hex string is the address format that Solidity and thus the ABI uses. So, now we fix our mistake:  ethabi encode function ~/faucet.json send -p 5b3a45e69dbbd7b3a9db31a8c855040f35793929 3e58c58c0000000000000000000000005b3a45e69dbbd7b3a9db31a8c855040f35793929 Now we can use callcontract so that we know how much gas we need to send (or you can skip this if you're confident the default is enough)  ./qtum-cli callcontract $FAUCET 3e58c58c0000000000000000000000005b3a45e69dbbd7b3a9db31a8c855040f35793929 {   ""address"": ""f28aa77dd07ee8a1288ab6f41b23ebf6d605dc3e"",   ""executionResult"": {     ""gasUsed"": 55978,     ""excepted"": ""None"",     ""newAddress"": ""f28aa77dd07ee8a1288ab6f41b23ebf6d605dc3e"",     ""output"": """",     ""codeDeposit"": 0,     ""gasRefunded"": 0,     ""depositSize"": 0,     ""gasForDeposit"": 0   },   ""transactionReceipt"": {     ""stateRoot"": ""4118b6d0685de70ef82c7905e7ab2d691470285b7c56506ffca9b1db21bcb278"",     ""gasUsed"": 55978,     ""bloom"": ""00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"",     ""log"": [     ]   } } Under execution result, the gasUsed field is what we are interested in. It's always safer to send a little more gas than is needed to avoid out of gas exceptions. So, we will use 60,000 for the gas limit.  ./qtum-cli sendtocontract $FAUCET 3e58c58c0000000000000000000000005b3a45e69dbbd7b3a9db31a8c855040f35793929 0 60000 {   ""txid"": ""cb7e8ef370a05665d5dd43d1134b8d0833d1c746d2d618162727c54e0f5a6ef5"",   ""sender"": ""QWqFJB4EUhbBJpGnnnjaeR1mdUJdr6fWkV"",   ""hash160"": ""703357de0cad939a528035cd319f849067fce2c7"" } You can look at the results on the block explorer. Here is the contract execution. If we look at the block this transaction was included in, we see immediately after the execution transaction we have the Account Abstraction Layer generated transaction which actually sends 100 Qtum to our intended address, QUvMQdxMxUuCQ7zLHvAcfmhFWyP9kkjr8C. Further more, if we look at the coinstake transaction we can see our gas refund as the last output, an output of 0.0004022 Qtum sent to address QWqFJB4EUhbBJpGnnnjaeR1mdUJdr6fWkV.  And finally, in my wallet I also see the 100 tokens that were sent.  This contract is still alive and I'll monitor it and put more coins into it. So join in on the fun and deposit some coins and withdraw them. It's a pretty cool little contract that I made in about 10 minutes.",False

The Qtum (pronounced Quantum) blockchain model was inspired by the rivalry between proponent developers of the world’s most active blockchain communities, said Qtum co-founder Patrick Dai.  “We want to illustrate efficient scalability and compatibility between blockchain technologies,” said Dai. Qtum raised $15.6 million in a crowdsale in March.  The Qtum blockchain operates according to the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model, which ensures consistency in transactions and the traceability of tokens. At the same time, a virtual machine for smart contracts is layered on top of Qtum’s blockchain, which presents to developers a best-of-both-worlds architecture for the construction of decentralized mobile applications and other blockchain-based ventures.  Co-founder Jordan Earls, who leads Qtum’s team of almost two-dozen developers, said the testnet would feature an Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contract implementation along with Qtum’s proof-of-stake protocol.  “I’m ready to get this in the hands of the community and see what everyone’s response to it will be, in particular, what features other developers can come up with,” said Earls.  “The Qtum team continues to execute and build what can be one of the most exciting and innovative railroads in the blockchain ecosystem,” said Matthew Roszak, Qtum Angel investor and co-founder of Bloq.  Six decentralized applications are already being built for the blockchain, Dai said. Among the applications are a peer-to-peer mobile streaming platform and a prediction market.  While these applications are geared to the Chinese market, the Qtum blockchain will appeal to a global audience, accessible to all developers.  “Like many others around the world, I’m eagerly awaiting the launch,” said Roger Ver, a Qtum Angel investor who has been investing in bitcoin startups since the beginning.  To get developers familiar with Qtum, the Foundation is sponsoring a hackathon in Moscow on July 1-2. For more information, visit blockchainhack.ru.  Visit Qtum’s Github page to view the project’s code repository, which will be accessible to the public on the day of the testnet launch.",False

It achieves this through the revolutionary Account Abstraction Layer. For more general information about Qtum as well as links to join our community, go to https://qtum.org    Welcome to Qtum Sparknet, the first public testnet for the Qtum blockchain. Sparknet is designed primarily for developers, and as such documentation at this point will be technical and suited more for developers. The mainnet is expected to be released in September and will be suited for the general public. Testnet tokens do not hold any value and should not be traded for any monetary instruments. The testnet can be reset or forked at anytime as deemed necessary for development. Sparknet does not include support for Mutualized Proof Of Stake, or for the Decentralized Governance Protocol. Both of these features are implemented, and their code is available on alternative branches (check the pull requests), but have not been tested and proven stable enough to include in this testnet. They will be implemented in the 2nd public testnet for Qtum.     Using Smart Contracts with Qtum      The smart contract interface in Qtum still requires some technical knowledge. The GUI is not completed yet, so all smart contract interation must happen either using qtum-cli at the command line, or in the debug window of qtum-qt.  To demonstrate how to deploy and interact with a simple we will use this contract:   Code: pragma solidity ^0.4.0;  contract QtumTest {    uint storedNumber;    function QtumTest() {        storedNumber=1;    }    function setNumber(uint number) public{        storedNumber = number;    }    function logNumber() constant public{         log1(""storedNumber"", uintToBytes(storedNumber));    }    function returnNumber() constant public returns (uint){        return storedNumber;    }    function deposit() public payable{    }    function withdraw() public{        if(!msg.sender.send(this.balance)){            throw;        }    }    //utility function    function uintToBytes(uint v) constant returns (bytes32 ret) {        if (v == 0) {            ret = '0';        }        else {            while (v > 0) {                ret = bytes32(uint(ret) / (2 ** 8));                ret |= bytes32(((v % 10) + 48) * 2 ** (8 * 31));                v /= 10;            }        }        return ret;    } }    It compiles to the following EVM bytecode    Code: 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 And finally, has the following JSON interface file:  [{""constant"":true,""inputs"":[],""name"":""returnNumber"",""outputs"":[{""name"":"""",""type"":""uint256""}],""payable"":false,""type"":""function""},{""constant"":false,""inputs"":[],""name"":""withdraw"",""outputs"":[],""payable"":false,""type"":""function""},{""constant"":false,""inputs"":[{""name"":""number"",""type"":""uint256""}],""name"":""setNumber"",""outputs"":[],""payable"":false,""type"":""function""},{""constant"":true,""inputs"":[{""name"":""v"",""type"":""uint256""}],""name"":""uintToBytes"",""outputs"":[{""name"":""ret"",""type"":""bytes32""}],""payable"":false,""type"":""function""},{""constant"":true,""inputs"":[],""name"":""logNumber"",""outputs"":[],""payable"":false,""type"":""function""},{""constant"":false,""inputs"":[],""name"":""deposit"",""outputs"":[],""payable"":true,""type"":""function""},{""inputs"":[],""payable"":false,""type"":""constructor""}]      This info can easily be retrieved for any contract by using Browser Solidity, inputing your contract's source code, and then on the right hand side clicking ""contract details""[/size]   (note, if using the debug window in the Qtum Qt application, don't include ./qtum-cli in the commands)  First, we need to deploy the contract:    Code: ./qtum-cli createcontract 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 300000 Note that the last number is the gas limit for this transaction. The default value is not large enough for this contract, so we increase it to 300,000 gas.  This should result in something like so:  {   ""txid"": ""72b0e0576d289c1e4e6c777431e4845f77d0884d3b3cff0387a5f4a1a3a874ea"",   ""sender"": ""qZbjaE8N18ZU1m7851G7QGhvxKL74SRBTt"",   ""hash160"": ""aff3e34ab836edb8d214a993d9da105915e4a6e9"",   ""address"": ""5bde092dbecb84ea1a229b4c5b25dfc9cdc674d9"" }    Now, you should store the address in a variable so it's easy to track:  export CONTRACT=5bde092dbecb84ea1a229b4c5b25dfc9cdc674d9 Now wait for your contract to be included in a block. You should be able to confirm it made it into a block by using:  ./qtum-cli getaccountinfo $CONTRACT If you get a message saying ""Address does not exist"", then either your transaction has not yet been included in a block (you can confirm this with getrawtransaction and your txid), or you did not provide enough gas for the contract to be executed and persisted into the blockchain. If the contract was successfully executed and persisted in the blockchain, you should see something like this:   Code:  {   ""address"": ""5bde092dbecb84ea1a229b4c5b25dfc9cdc674d9"",   ""balance"": 0,   ""storage"": {     ""290decd9548b62a8d60345a988386fc84ba6bc95484008f6362f93160ef3e563"": {       ""0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"": ""0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001""     }   },   ""code"": ""..."" }    In order to interact with the contract, you must create raw ABI data from the interface JSON file. The easiest tool to assist in this is ethabi, https://github.com/paritytech/ethabi  Make sure the JSON file is saved somewhere, we will call it interface.json.  In order to get the storedNumber variable we use the returnNumber() function. We can construct the ABI values by using ethabi:  ethabi encode function ~/interface.json returnNumber The result of this is:  3450bd6a  Now, because we are not changing state, we use callcontract:  ./qtum-cli callcontract $CONTRACT 3450bd6a This results in a lot of data that can be useful in different contexts (including gas estimates), but we are only concerned about the output field, which is the value of storedNumber   Code: {   ""address"": ""5bde092dbecb84ea1a229b4c5b25dfc9cdc674d9"",   ""executionResult"": {     ""gasUsed"": 21664,     ""excepted"": ""None"",     ""newAddress"": ""5bde092dbecb84ea1a229b4c5b25dfc9cdc674d9"",     ""output"": ""0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001"",     ""codeDeposit"": 0,     ""gasRefunded"": 0,     ""depositSize"": 0,     ""gasForDeposit"": 0   },   ""transactionReceipt"": {     ""stateRoot"": ""ffbeb0377d43c6ed443a2840259ff5ead5158016ab54d55ef21b7b11aa71947f"",     ""gasUsed"": 21664,     ""bloom"": ""00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"",     ""log"": [     ]   } }    To change the storedNumber we can do an on-chain execution using sendtocontract. First, we need the ABI data:  ethabi encode function ~/interface.json setNumber -p 123456 --lenient 3fb5c1cb000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001e240 Note we use --lenient so that we do not need to provide a full 256bit value as a parameter. Now, we can execute the contract directly:  ./qtum-cli sendtocontract $CONTRACT 3fb5c1cb000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001e240 Afterwards, we can call returnNumber() again and check the output field:  ""output"": ""000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001e240"", This is 123456 encoded as hex.  You can also use the logNumber() function in order to generate logs. If your node was started with -record-log-opcodes, then the file vmExecLogs.json will contain any log operations that occur on the blockchain. This is what is used for events on the Ethereum blockchain, and eventually it is our intention to bring similar functionality to Qtum.  You can also deposit and withdraw coins from this test contract using the deposit() and withdraw() functions.  The ABI value for deposit is d0e30db0 and the ABI value for withdraw is 3ccfd60b  This will send 10 tokens to the contract:  ./qtum-cli sendtocontract $CONTRACT d0e30db0 10  And then, to withdraw them it's also very simple:  ./qtum-cli sendtocontract $CONTRACT 3ccfd60b  If you want to control the exact address that the contract sends coins to, you can also explicitly specify the sender. Note that you must be capable of sending coins from that address (you can't use someone elses address). One of my wallet addresses is qZbjaE8N18ZU1m7851G7QGhvxKL74SRBTt, so I'll use that:  ./qtum-cli sendtocontract $CONTRACT 3ccfd60b 0 190000 0.0000001 qZbjaE8N18ZU1m7851G7QGhvxKL74SRBTt  Note that if you get the error ""Sender address does not have any unspent outputs"", then you should send some coins to that address (they must be spent in order to prove that you own that address). This can be accomplished with any amount of coins:  ./qtum-cli sendtoaddress qZbjaE8N18ZU1m7851G7QGhvxKL74SRBTt 0.001  There is no need to wait for this transaction to confirm, it can be followed immediately by the sendtocontract command:  ./qtum-cli sendtocontract $CONTRACT 3ccfd60b 0 190000 0.0000001 qZbjaE8N18ZU1m7851G7QGhvxKL74SRBTt  When creating this contract transaction, nothing will immediately happen, when the transaction is put into a block though a new transaction will appear in a block which will send any coins owned by the contract to the pubkeyhash address qZbjaE8N18ZU1m7851G7QGhvxKL74SRBTt  FAQ  Q: ""I used createcontract, but can't call my contract and it's not in listcontract"" A: You probably did not provide enough gas for the contract's constructor to be executed and it's code persisted in the blockchain. The vm.log file should confirm this by saying how much gas was needed  Q: ""I sent a large amount of gas but I never got a refund"" A: Refunds are generated from the coinstake transaction, so you must wait 500 blocks for the gas refund to mature before it can be spent again  Q: ""I used -reindex and now my node is taking forever to resync"" A: Currently when doing a reindex, all contracts are reprocessed, so in a chain with many contract executions this can add up to a significant amount of time. This will be made faster in the future, as well as the initial syncing speed of nodes  Q: ""I think I found a bug in Qtum"" A: Please report any bugs at https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/issues New Qtum RPC Commands  Qtum supports all of the RPC commands supported by Bitcoin Core, but also includes the following commands unique to Qtum:  createcontract - This will create and deploy a new smart contract to the Qtum blockchain. This requires gas. callcontract - This will interact with an already deployed smart contract on the Qtum blockchain, with all computation taking place off-chain and no persistence to the blockchain. This does not require gas sendtocontract - This will interact with an already deployed smart contract on the Qtum blockchain. All computation takes place on-chain and any state changes will be persisted to the blockchain. This allows tokens to be sent to a smart contract. This requires gas. getaccountinfo - This will show some low level information about a contract, including the contract's bytecode, stored data, and balance on the blockchain. listcontracts - This will output a list of currently deployed contract addresses with their respective balance. This RPC call may change or be removed in the future. reservebalance - This will reserve a set amount of coins so that they do not participate in staking. If you reserve as many or more coins than are in your wallet, then you will not participate at all in staking and block creation for the network. getstakinginfo - This will show some info about the current node's staking status, including network difficulty and expected time (in seconds) until staking a new block. New Qtum Command Line Arguments  Qtum supports all of the usual command line arguments that Bitcoin Core supports. In addition it adds the following new command line arguments:  -record-log-opcodes - This will create a new log file in the Qtum data directory (usually ~/.qtum) named vmExecLogs.json, where any EVM LOG opcode is logged along with topics and data that the contract requested be logged. Untested features  Some features included in Bitcoin Core have not been tested in it's porting to Qtum. This includes:  Pruning  EVM Smart Contract Changes and Limitations  Because of Qtum's underlying technical differences, there are a few operations that can have different results or limitations when executed in Qtum than when compared to Ethereum.  These include the following, though there may be others introduced in the future:  The gas schedule for Qtum is different from Ethereum. Certain operations are more or less expensive. As such, gas cost estimators designed for Ethereum will not give accurate results for Qtum. We will develop our own gas estimating tools as well as fully documenting these differences at a later date.  block.coinbase or the COINBASE opcode currently is not supported and will only return 0. When MPoS is released in the 2nd testnet this should be functioning as expected block.number will return the previous block height before this block containing the contract's execution block.difficulty will return the previous block's difficulty `block.timestamp will return the previous block's timestamp block.blockhash(n) will return 0 when n is the current block height (block.number+1), similar to Ethereum sender will return 0 when the coins spent (vin[0].prevout) are from a non-standard transaction. It will return the pubkeyhash 160bit address when spent from a pubkey or pubkeyhash transaction Coins can be sent to either contracts or pubkeyhash addresses. When coins are sent to a non-existent contract address, the coins will automatically be sent to a pubkeyhash address instead. Only 1000 vouts can be generated from a single contract execution. Sending coins to the same contract multiple times results in a single vout being created, so the limitation is effectively that coins can only be sent to up to 1000 unique contract or pubkeyhash addresses, including balance changes between contracts. If this limit is exceeded, an Out Of Gas exception is generated and all state changes are reverted. Contract executions can not happen within coinbase or coinstake transactions Additional documents for the overall design and expected results of various operations is available at the ITD repository here: https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum-itds        If you would like to receive Test Network tokens, please PM this account with your address and we will get them sent ASAP.  These test tokens will have no value, so you are free to share them with others for testing. We will have a faucet set up shortly, along with a Win64 QT shortly  Staff members in our Slack channel will have Qtum Test Tokens to distribute. Remember, these are free and have no value.   Right now the team is preparing for our launch event in Shanghai, so it may be a touch busy on our side for the next day.",False

I like the part where fairly new Chinese exchanges whose principals are directly associated with Team Qtum are the only exchanges currently trading the Qtum token, and even have the pre-launch token represented on coinmarketcap.com. How the fuck did they pull that ruse outta their yellow asses?  My other favorite concern is when it was disclosed that Patrick Dai was Steven Dai, but all of Team Qtum stuck it up our asses, adamantly proclaiming that such was a lie, then Patrick came forward and stated that it was in fact true, further expressing that EVERYBODY in his camp, including angel investors, were well aware of such, and further proclaiming that it's common practice for not only a Chinese person to maintain an English name, but change it to another English name when the wind blows.  But none of the above matters because Qtum in a non-profit entity and IS NOT an investment vehicle as they've stated myriad times, hence being chartered in Singapore where Qtum is forbidden to garner more than 5M SGD (less than U$5M) in its coffer during the lifetime as a Singaporean non-profit.",False

Qtum has the second most volume on Chinese exchanges after BTC, more than even ethereum and it's not even on a testnet release yet.  It's a pity there was so much fud posted here, all it served to do  was to prevent most Westerners from getting a piece of the pie.  There are a lot of technical improvements on Ethereum that Qtum is doing and the team working on the code is top notch.  Anyways, I love the ridiculous conspiracy theories about how the exchanges are being rigged by the Qtum team.  What is the conspiracy, that they're spending $40 million a day in BTC generating volume at 35x the ICO price?  How nice of them to pay 35x what people paid in the ICO then.  The reality is that the scam criers are too shortsighted and too lazy to learn Chinese to actually see all the work they've done with the Chinese community to get Qtum ahead of other cryptos. So just keep sitting there posting gibberish.  I like how at first it's basically libelous posts about the creator being a thief (if you really have evidence of them stealing millions why not call the police?!  I'm sure interpol would be interested in an international theft of millions), but since that didn't pan out now every exchange that has literally tens of millions in volume per day must be part of some bizarre conspiracy to pay people dozens of times what they spent in the ICO. Is that the story you tell yourself to feel better about completely missing out on what will be THE top crypto in China?!  Great post! testerx ... but don't worry. This is envy of those who usually have little brains and does a great working of hand. We stay on qtum project that will a big revolution.",False

Yesterday we went over the 5 more points, and today we focus a lot on the Proof-of-Stake portion of the Test Network.      11, Change all output strings Bitcoin -> Qtum, BTC -> QTUM     Replace all instances of bitcoin and BTC with qtum and QTUM (Just the output strings, not the actual class/variable names and not the code comments)     12, Increase Script limits to suitable values   There are a number of limits in vanilla Bitcoin that restrict our usage of smart contracts. These limits should be relaxed:  maximum data push size: 1Mb  maximum stack size: 1Mb  Test for other limits that we run into with large scripts caused by contracts.     13, Consensus/Chain parameters for PoS   Consensus/chain parameters for PoS  The consensus provide parameters that will affect the creation of new blocks in the network.  The PoS limit need to be added in order to determine the initial difficulty for PoS.  The halving interval is 4 years (target) and there will be 7 halving intervals.  Block target is set to 128 seconds.  4 tokens per Block (Approximately 1% inflation per year for 4 years) 2 tokens (Slightly more than .5% inflation per year for 4 years based on 100 million original tokens .5% of 104~ million after 4 years) 1 token .5 tokens .25 tokens .125 tokens .0625 tokens  The last PoW block need to be defined and set to 5000 for the main net. The reward for PoW block is 20000 coins, the reward for PoS block is 4 coins. The Proof-of-Work blocks will be mined by the Qtum development team.     14 , Update of block/block-header parameters for PoS   The general rule for the header is to keep it as small as possible.  Four parameters are needed for PoS in order to work:  1) Block signature, that is the signature of the whole block, signed by the block creator  2) Block type (Proof Of Work or Proof Of Stake)  3) Previous stake location, need in order to confirm the block validity, mandatory for PoS  4) Staking time, the time when the staking transaction was created, mandatory for PoS   Block signature must be a parameter. The parameter need to be in the header due to the segregated witness which split the block delivery into header and transactions that can be required from any user. The other parameters can be extracted from the PoS transaction. Whether or not to include those 3 parameters in the header too can be discussed. The block header is downloaded before the whole block, not including those parameters in the header will prevent doing PoS checks to the header before downloading the whole block. Blackcoin download the whole block before the checks and put those parameters into the Block.   15 ,Proof of Work/Stake Kernel Update    The source code for PoW and PoS kernel is kept into the files:  pos.h pos.cpp pow.h pow.cpp  The location of the files is according to master-pos, in Blackcoin the location is kernel.h and kernel.cpp.  We need to decide if we will keep it or use different structure for organization of the code for PoW and PoS kernel. The version of the stake modifier that will be used is the second version. Block difficulty, masks, modifiers, time-stamps are all used here, so this is important parts for PoS.        Please see the Roadmap below for more information:         Please remember that we have an event in Shanghai on the 28th so please RSVP if you plan on attending:           Qtum will also be sponsoring a Hackathon in Russia, with 8500 QTUM tokens.

These will be technical in nature, but explains the work going into Qtum Core.  We'll start with the first few portions:      1, Qtum Core Branding   Basic Qtum Branding  Basic renaming of the Bitcoin code to make it into Qtum. This shouldn't be too extensive, but should cover the following:  1. Use ~/.qtum instead of ~/.bitcoin for data directory by default 2. Build system should output qtumd instead of bitcoind/cli etc   2, The Basic Qtum Network   Create basic Qtum network  Change the parameters so that the Qtum network is different from Bitcoin.   1. Change genesis seed  2. Change P2P/RPC ports  3. Change ""magic"" P2P network bytes.  4. Add whatever changes are needed so that a new mainnet network can be mined and synced.  5. Remove bitcoin checkpoints and node lists  6. Make sure that all 3 networks work: mainnet, testnet, and regtest. With mainnet and testnet being distinctly different and incompatible with Bitcoin Make sure to remove irrelevant tests that only affect Bitcoin, and to change tests which rely on network parameters  specific params: Block time: 128 seconds Block size: 2Mb P2P port: 3888 (chosen arbitrarily, shouldn't have conflicts, but can be changed if needed) RPC port: 3889 testnet P2P port: 13888 testnet RPC port: 13889 Qtum pubkeyhash address: 58 (Q) Qtum p2sh address: 50 (M) Qtum testnet p2pkh: 120 (q) Qtum testnet p2sh: 110 (m)    3, Add EVM and OP_CREATE for Contract Execution   After this, the EVM should be integrated and a very basic contract should be executable.  There will be a new opcode, OP_CREATE (formerly OP_EXEC), which takes 4 arguments, in push order: 1. VM version (currently 1 is EVM) 2. Gas price (not yet used, anything is valid) 3. Gas limit (not yet used, assume very high limit) 4. bytecode   For now it is OK that this script format be forced and mandatory for OP_CREATE transactions on the blockchain. (ie, only ""standard"" allowed on the blockchain) When OP_CREATE is encountered, it should execute the EVM and persist the contract to a database (triedb)   Note: Make sure to follow policy for external code (commit vanilla unmodified code first, and then change it as needed) Make the EVM test suite functional as well (someone else can setup continuous integration changes for it though)   QTUM Address for new contracts   QTUmCORE-3. Test that qtum address is generated after contract creation. Before running the test make sure that:  Node started в –regtest Bitcoin tests passed Test Steps   1. Create transaction TX_DEPLOYMENT in bitcoinlib-js, run decoderawtransaction. 2. Create transaction TX_ASSIGN_SC in bitcoinlib-js, run decoderawtransaction. 3. Create transaction TX_DEPLOYMENT in bitcoinlib-js, run sendrawtransaction. 3. Create transaction TX_ASSIGN_SC in bitcoinlib-js, run sendrawtransaction.   Expected Result 1. Transaction marked as deployment. 2. Transaction marked as assign. 3. Contract created (address and balance are displayed on the console). 4. Contract state changed (address and balance are displayed on the console).     4, Add PoS block verification and mining       After this, the Qtum blockchain should be capable of verifying basic PoS v3 blocks, and the wallet should be able to mine these blocks similar to PoW blocks.  There is not a network rule as of yet for only allowing PoS blocks at this point, so the chain will accept either PoW and PoS blocks as valid. Both block types should use the same default bitcoin standard difficulty.   Thing to ensure:   1, stake modifier changes every block    2, Coinage does not change PoS values  3, No decentralized checkpoints (still in design)  4, Make sure that these statements remain true:  5, don't enforce tx fee as consensus rule  6, static pos reward (make it just 1 token for now, will change later)  7, stake modifier v2 - The purpose of stake modifier is to prevent a txout (coin) owner from computing future proof-of-stake generated by txout at the time of transaction confirmation. Verification of the block was changed, now you need only previous block, so all other blocks can be deleted and space saved  (you need last 500 blocks to stake) pruning capabilities should be in future major release  8, compatibility with BIP66  9, only last 500 blocks are needed to verify proof of stake  10, No coin age, instead just a coin confirmation requirement (500 blocks is fine for now)    5, Add ability for contracts to call other deployed contracts     Contracts should be capable of calling other contracts using a new opcode, OP_CALL.  Arguments in push order: version (32 bit integer) gas price (64 bit integer) gas limit (64 bit integer) contract address (160 bits) data (any length) OP_CALL should ways return false for now.   OP_CALL only results in contract execution when used in a vout; Similar to OP_CREATE, it uses the special rule to process the script during vout processing (rather than when spent as is normal in Bitcoin). Contract execution should only be triggered when the transaction script is in this standard format and has no extra opcodes.  If OP_CALL is created that uses an invalid contract address, then no contract execution should take place. The transaction should still be valid in the blockchain however. If money was sent with OP_CALL, then that money (minus the gas fees) should result in a refund transaction to send the funds back to vin[0]'s vout script.  The ""sender"" exposed to EVM should be the pubkeyhash spent by vin[0]. If the vout spent by vin[0] is not a pubkeyhash, then the sender should be 0.  Funds can be sent to the contract using an OP_CALL vout. These funds will be handled by the account abstraciton layer in a different story, to expose this to the EVM. Multiple OP_CALLS can be used in a single transaction. However, before contract execution, the gas price and gas limit of each OP_CALL vout should be checked to ensure that the transaction provides enough transaction fees to cover the gas. Additionally, this should be verified even when the contract is not executed, such as when it is accepted in the mempool.      These updates should give you an idea of what we are working on leading up to the June 28th release of the Test Network. Please see the Roadmap below for more information:         Please remember that we have an event in Shanghai on the 28th so please RSVP if you plan on attending:",False

Yesterday we went over the first 5 points, and today we delve deeper into the technical aspects.      6, Add ""sendtocontract"" RPC call     An rpc call should be adding for sending data and (optionally) money to a contract that has been deployed on the blockchain.  The format should be: sendtocontract contract-address data (value gaslimit gasprice sender broadcast)  This should create a contract call transaction using OP_CALL. Value defaults to 0.  sender-address is optional. If no address is specified, then it should be picked randomly from the wallet. If no outputs exist to spend using that sender-address, then an error should be shown and no transaction created. broadcast should default to true. If broadcast is false, then the transaction is created and signed, and then printed to the screen in hex rather than broadcast to the network.  If the sender-address does have an output, but it is not enough to cover the gas costs, tx fees, and value, then any UTXO owned by the wallet should be used by the transaction to cover the remainder. (not all funds must come from sender-address, but the sender-address must be vin[0])  After execution, if broadcast is true, it should print the txid and the new contract address.   7, Add ""callcontract"" RPC call for off-chain computations   Add ""callcontract"" RPC call for off-chain computations  There should be an RPC call that executes a contract without requiring interaction with the blockchain network, and thus without gas or other fees.  callcontract contract-address data (sender) This should execute the contract locally, and if the contract function returns data, it should be returned/printed by the RPC call. Sender is optional and does not require an owned vout (it can be any valid address)       8, Change mainnet to only allow PoS after a certain blockheight   This tells the Blockchain that Proof-of-Work blocks can no longer be accepted. The Qtum Nodes will reject this work, and accept only Proof-of-Stake.     9 , Put EVM ""LOG"" opcode outputs into an accessible log file    There should be a file that holds all of the data from EVM LOG opcodes, so that it can be used for testing and debugging.

Which scam? Here's what I found he appeared to accurately spot from a cursory scan: Cryptsy, everything concerning that Leroy guy, GAW/Butterfly Labs, maybe 5-10 other tiny ICOs I'd never heard of and never seemed to gain much steam  Things he spewed vitrol about but is still undetermined: Legends Room (although he's calmed down on them now that they seem close to potentially proving they aren't a scam), Bitland  And things he predicted wrong: Bitgold/Goldmoney (he attacked them similar to us, and they're still kicking and seem legit 2 years after all of his trolling), AMT(oh wait, he apologized for that one after a few months of trolling)  I personally wonder where he was when I was still in the scam spotting business. I don't recall ever seeing or hearing about him or his primary alter-ego (though I don't keep track of his 20+ sock puppet accounts). He has actually ""spotted scams"" very few times, because he mostly sticks to only a few different projects (Leroy was his favorite) and off-topic posts. Seems all he does is try to dox whoever he somehow finds out about (seriously Gleb, who tells you about these projects? Why only these projects and not the many other obvious scams on BCT that you've failed to warn the community about?), cherry pick anything he can find on the internet supporting his case, makes ridiculous assumptions, then posts it all in his humorous ranting style with lots of memes, and finally alerts his friends/sock puppets that he posted so that they can back him up and legitimize his assumptions. I guess the upside to his trolling here is at least he's been fairly clean in this thread and not talking about raping people like in his Leroy and (pre-apology) AMT threads.    First off, I think you forgot about my Phinneaus Gage account busting scammers. Secondly, theymos has my permission to delete all 76 accounts of mine on this forum if he finds evidence of me ever alerting a user so to post after I post. The ONLY two/three exceptions that I can think of over the years is that I have (2/3 times) PM a user(s) to make him aware of a recent post of mine, but they were already active in the respective scam threads.  earlz, your post above is virtually identical to what previous scammers have penned about my scammy ass, all of which are no longer part of this space (hopefully).  In re The Legends Room, I attended a Vegas meetup over the weekend, and all of the ~30 attendees know damn well to stay away from that outfit, with voices larger than mine leading the pack in the convos, I mostly sharing my findings, thus the discontent didn't stem from me.  The Legends Room thread is deleting ALL posts proving that it's a scam.  Please inform your base that you're not sticking up for Leroy Fodor, else that would truly be Qtum's demise. The raping you've alluded to stemmed from a lie that Leroy Fodor posted, all documented.  Surely you don't think that Marshall Long is a good guy, do you? I nailed his cupped balls to a tree long time ago. NOT A SINGLE person I've met in person has anything good to say about Marshall, not even Brock Pierce.  Did you forget about Black Arrow? Read all my posts in that thread proving beyond a shadow of doubt that they were a scam. Several others concurred in the same thread. FUCK ME! I just remembered that ALL them posts were deleted by Black Arrow.  Here's your contribution to the Cryptsy scam: http://earlz.net/view/2016/01/16/0717/analyzing-the-56-million-exploit-and-cryptsys-security  Quote from: earlz on June 14, 2017, 08:51:15 PM Well, good to know Gleb is an expert in China and all modern Chinese culture and social media practices. Remind me again, how many weeks have you spent in China to get all this knowledge?  Anyway, for those not in the know (including myself to some extent), WeChat is pretty unbelievably big. WeChat accounts for 30% of all mobile internet time spent in China, and Chinese people spend on average 90 minutes per day on WeChat. It has ~800M daily users (most of which are Chinese)... For a western comparison, Facebook has 1.2B monthly users (couldn't find a good daily number). Everyone here talks about how Facebook wants to become the portal to the internet, but WeChat has already successfully done that in China. WeChat has mini-apps and such, as well as handling money etc. If you have a phone with only WeChat installed in China, you're prepared for about 95% of what life throws at you. Most people in China don't bother with laptops, it's all about phones and mobile access. I've tried learning some Chinese (both speaking and typing), and it blew my mind how easy Chinese is to type out on a phone. To me the Android and iOS Chinese keyboards are a lot easier than a traditional PC keyboard (with Window's built in pinyin thing). Anyway, all this to say that trying to understand the culture from outside without having seen how people there interact and without having learned any of the language is difficult. I know when I visited there for the first time it was an absolute culture shock, even with all the reading and such I did beforehand.  Our plans to integrate smart contracts with WeChat is also driven by how large it is, and we think this will ultimately propel us into mainstream usage in China, allowing app developers to integrate blockchain technology into the readily accessible WeChat mini-app market  Okay, I concede that you got me on that one, for I haven't spend one nanosecond in China like you have to amass such knowledge on WeChat in comparison to Facebook. I, sadly, have to admit that I, as old man sans a job living in a van with four flat tires down by the Colorado River, has to resort to Wikipedia to perhaps come as close to you in knowledge of said subjects, earlz.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat  Quote WeChat had over 889 million Monthly Active Users in 2016 90% of whom were Chinese. For comparison, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp (two other competitive international messaging services better-known in the West) had about 1,000 million Monthly Active Users in 2016 but did not offer most of the other services available on WeChat. In 2017 it was reported that more than half of WeChat's users spend over 90 minutes a day on the app.  That's odd! Wikipedia didn't depicted a good daily number either, else I'm sure you would've gleaned that as well, also adjusting that number somewhat so to further cloak your newfound knowledge, alluding to your experience of residing in China for a spell.  See how easy it is read through you lyin' pieces of shit? It took me longer to pen this post so to inform the readers than it did to uncover your bullshit.  Please try harder next time, for you're makin' my non-job too fuckin easy.  Bruno",False

For comparison, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp (two other competitive international messaging services better-known in the West) had about 1,000 million Monthly Active Users in 2016 but did not offer most of the other services available on WeChat. In 2017 it was reported that more than half of WeChat's users spend over 90 minutes a day on the app.  That's odd!

Sometimes ambitiously referring to itself as “China’s Ethereum,” the project recently raised $15 million in three days through a successful crowdsale or “Initial Coin Offering” (ICO).  On a technical level, the Qtum blockchain will resemble Bitcoin, but will integrate an Ethereum-like Virtual Machine on top for smart contracting purposes. Additionally, Qtum is in the process of implementing a “Decentralized Governance Protocol” (DGP). This DGP will have smart contracts determine the blockchain’s parameter selection, like its block size limit.  Jordan Earls, also known as “earlz” online, is the co-founder and lead developer of Qtum.  “We believe this will allow for Qtum to be the first self-modifiable, self-regulating and ultimately self-aware blockchain,” he told Bitcoin Magazine.   The Concept Any blockchain has a number of parameters. In Bitcoin, this of course includes the 1 megabyte block size limit. But it also includes the block reward (currently 12.5), the block interval time (ten minutes) and more. These and three other parameters apply to Qtum as well.  But there are two basic problems with needing to have these parameters. First, they are very hard to get “right,” in so far as that’s even possible, since different parameters benefit different use cases. And second, in a decentralized system, these parameters can be very hard to change.  “The core rationale and problem we had when designing this is that we will release Qtum with some initial parameters that we try to make perfect,” Earls told Bitcoin Magazine. “But we don't know what the ecosystem will look like one month after release, much less one year. So, we designed DGP. That way, we can tune the blockchain to be as usable and secure as possible without needing to fork, just to change a simple number from 1 to 2.”  Qtum plans to realize this way of “tuning the blockchain” by doing what it does best: The DGP will consist of relatively straightforward smart contracts made up of blockchain-readable pieces of executable code.  “We have open-source smart contracts which implement the rules for changing the parameters, which will then be accepted by all nodes. It implements a fairly simple governance system of ‘user keys’ and ‘admin keys.’ There is a modifiable parameter in the contract which determines how many keys of each type must vote in order to approve a change to, say, the block size limit.”  Importantly, through the use of smart contracts, these keys can actually represent more than just a regular user per key: Each key can represent a defined group.  “Perhaps one key represents a majority of hash power; or a key represents coin votes by coin holders; or a key acts according to a dynamic limit based on how full blocks are. Or even oracles: a key can effectively be controlled by people or servers that act based on input not directly readable by the blockchain itself, like USD market price for transaction fees. It’s extremely flexible.”  Qtum will almost certainly include smart contracts for the block size limit, the gas schedule to determine the price of different smart contract operations (for which Ethereum hard forked several times) and the minimum gas price. Additionally, it might deploy smart contracts for block interval times, block rewards, maximum gas per block and maximum script size or signature operations per transaction or block.  Changing the Rules Embedding the parameter selection in smart contracts is clever and having all node software adjust accordingly even more so. However, an arguably even harder problem is not so much what parameter is decided on, but who gets to decide in the first place and how.  In Qtum, the initial parameters will be set by the developers based on their testing and measurements.  “For instance, we've already determined that a block size of 2 megabytes should be reasonable,” Earls said.  After that, the initial set of rules to define the parameters can be changed themselves within the rules of the system, too.  A smart contract could, for example, start out relatively simple: It requires a majority of core developers to change the rules of the contract. Then, if a majority of core developers decides that instead of just developers, it should also include a majority of coin holders, the contract can be changed to a two-of-two multisig contract. From that moment on, one key would represent the developers, while the other key would represent the majority of coin holders. Next, if both developers and coin holders agree, hash power can have a seat at the table, too, and so forth.  As such, Qtum smart contracts can change not only the parameters of the system, but also how the parameters themselves can be changed.  That said, as Earls acknowledged, the Decentralized Governance Protocol can’t actually solve all governance problems. It’s specifically designed to make certain predefined parameters more easily adjustable, and it can indeed even change how these parameters can be adjusted to some extent.  But the Decentralized Governance Protocol does not and cannot apply to network rules that aren’t among these predefined parameters. Protocol changes outside of these specific parameters would still require a typical upgrade mechanism, like a hard fork or a soft fork.  “I believe if Bitcoin had DGP technology, then we would still see all this fighting about SegWit vs Bitcoin Unlimited, etcetera,” Earls acknowledged. “But, DGP would have been used in the meantime to increase the block size to something conservative but reasonable like 2 megabytes or 4 megabytes, to avoid all the transaction speed problems. Meanwhile, the developers and community could figure out a more permanent solution.”",False

本次邀请到量子链发起人——帅初，跟大家交流区块链（包括Qtum）过去，现在和未来发展和ICO的相关情况。该团队发起的Qtum项目目前总市值达80亿，热度空前。  （1）区块链引领了财富理念的巨大变革，Qtum就是在兼容以太坊和比特币生态和技术的基础上打造出的一个更好的平台。  （2）比特币等电子货币是一种值得配置的优质资产，区块链作为引发变革的新兴行业已被写入十三五规划。  （3）ICO本质上和IPO没有不同，但ICO通过变革财富分配方式使知识变现，同时节约了众筹活动的时间和经济成本。  （4）在判断ICO是否值得投资时主要需要注意四点：团队背景、项目理念（公有链更有机会）、流动性保证和宣传路演效果。  交流最后是有关行业的自由问答。  宋嘉吉：今年是数字货币的大牛市，这个行业慢慢从一个大家觉得陌生的行业到开始普及，再到现在各方参与者开始拥抱监管。那么在这么多的项目里，大家都在谈比特币，说已经翻了一倍了，但是比特币确实是今年数字货币中涨幅最小的一种。  有很多新型的数字货币在慢慢上线，在我们看来，具有基础平台价值的项目并不多，ETH以太坊，比特币以及现在的QTUM。QTUM按照ICO的售价现在已经有三十几倍的收益了。  今天我有幸请到了量子链发起人帅初来交流，一个是介绍一下什么是Qtum，另外一个跟大家交流一下ICO。因为就传统金融行业来说，ICO对于风投模式会有一个非常大的冲击，因为IPO也好，风投的PE、VC也好，其成本都相当高。Qtum刚开始还没那么火，ICO持续了五天时间；而最近的BAT项目一出来就是一分钟秒掉4000万美金，因此ICO也是值得介绍的。下面有请帅初。  帅初：我今天讲两点，一个是区块链这个产业的过去现在和未来，以技术为索引看整个产业的发展。第二个就是ICO这个现象我们应该怎么认识它。  第一个就是区块链的过去现在和未来，区块链的过去可能我更多是以量子链为例，因为量子链其实融合了很多区块链技术过去的一些发展和创新。为什么开发这个区块链，或者说为什么要投身区块链这个行业，因为当时我博士辍学之后，在区块链这个行业做了大半年，当时是行业低谷，后面去阿里巴巴做了大半年，从阿里出来后又投身这个行业，但是在读博士期间，基本上所有的精力都花在区块链这个行业里面，当时还没有区块链这个名字。举个最简单的例子，为什么区块链的价值今天受到这么多人的追捧？我觉得都是一个逐渐认知的过程，新技术的出现都是由一少部分人先提出说要做这个东西去颠覆老的东西，然后人类再进行不断认知的过程。  我觉得区块链也是这样一个概念，当时我们看互联网是基于这些协议栈去开发应用，有了TCPIP的协议才有了BAT这样的公司，上面才有了Facebook和Google，但是我们回过来想一个问题，在互联网上有两层意思，互联网是传输信息的，它的价值点对点转移还是很受限制的，比特币是第一个被我们称之为价值传输协议的，在互联网上不通过任何中间人，借助这个网络本身的信任我们就可以把一笔资金从A传输到B，它背后的意义是非常具有颠覆性的。  还有一点就涉及到ICO这个问题，当时发明互联网协议的两个教授自己也没有成为亿万富翁，但是基于这个协议开发Facebook、Google的这些人其实成为了社会上财富的拥有者，为什么ICO会逐渐流行，因为它给了工程师一个把自己知识变现的路径，把协议的东西直接变现卖掉了，我觉得这是对财富分配机制的一种变革和调整。  至于为什么开发区块链是因为我看到了它巨大的意义和价值，整个互联网协议上面大家基于信息搭建服务，因此产生了BAT这种体量的公司，说白了他们就是做信息的生意。百度就是做信息的聚合，然后二次分发；阿里也是一个信息的匹配服务，买卖双方和线上线下，再加上支付宝系统担保的服务；腾讯其实也是信息点对点的传输。  基于信息的服务就可以产生BAT这样的公司，但是你想一想如果有一天世界上所有有形的无形的资产全部可以点对点的自由流动之后，未来基于此的商业模式会产生巨大的商业体量，它的体量将远远超过十个BAT，从这个角度来说，这些未来的可能性就建立在区块链网络的协议和基础上，所以从某种意义上来说，我并不觉得这个行业是个泡沫，这个行业才刚刚开始，因为它要改造的它所创造的新价值是远远超过我们现在所看到的价值的。  关于比特币是什么东西，这是个非常复杂的概念，因为整个比特币网络背后是没有公司的，它是一个分布式网络，比特币年初的估值也就几十亿美金，现在有500亿美金，财富增长了十倍，那这十倍收益并不是被股东拿走的，因为背后没有股东，财务增长的收益最终分配给了所有持有比特币的人。我为什么说这种变革更彻底，因为它改变的是一种机制。  因为在互联网行业中，行业蓬勃发展，但你不会享受到行业红利，除非你持有腾讯、百度的股票，但比特币行业不一样，它背后没有公司，把中间的利益削弱，利益分配给了所有参与者。所以这就是说在信息的高速公路上诞生了BAT，但是在价值的高速公路上会产生十倍于BAT的公司和平台。我看到了巨大的商业机会，所以投身于这个领域里。  区块链的本质有很多因素，但是我觉得最大的因素影响并不在于技术革新，而是理念上的变革。这是对于人的财富观念的变革，为什么这么说呢，因为区块链技术有可能成为下一个时代的底层协议，这是关于财富分配的一种变革和创造。某种意义上来说为什么这么火，其实它是释放了人类的创造力。因为比如说一个程序员在百度打工可能一年也就拿到50万的收入，这是由社会的生产关系决定的，社会的财富分配机制就决定了每个人能拿到多少钱，但是在ICO上，几个程序员做了一个项目，此时生产分配关系并不受社会制度的约束，所以整个以太坊的估值现在是1400亿人民币，再努力一下就超过百度了，而且它只用了两年的时间，我觉得这是它流行的根源。  所以区块链更多是理念上的变革，变革了人们对财富的认知、对货币的认知、对协作的认知、对背后技术的认知，它是一个巨大的跳跃。很多人是接受不了的，比如你的父母，因为对他们来说这东西没什么价值，就是一串符号而已，但是某种意义上来说，所有的纸币背后也就是一张纸，意义上其实可以类似。所以会有监管的挑战，但是现在监管者也很聪明，他们会和行业有一些沟通和交流，在美国甚至有专门的游说机构，不断和政府交流，说明行业现在在做什么。  第二个从技术上来说，整个区块链是一个分布式系统，最初的根源确实来自于一群自由主义者，甚至还有一些极客搞了比特币这样一套系统出来，最开始的目标是分布式的绝对安全的抗审查的系统，他们有根深蒂固的观念就是货币是不能无限通货膨胀的，所以比特币是一个通缩的货币，就2100万个，它的分发是靠矿工去挖矿的，你为这个网络做贡献你就会有收益，通过巨大的利益绑定将所有人绑定在这个网络里。  每个人的利益是得到精确的记录的，某种意义上来说它是一个全世界共有的账本，但是账本的本质就是一笔财富，如果谁能记清楚一笔账其实就是一笔财富。因为其实社会的发展趋势就是利益的划分越来越精细，原来计划经济时代为什么大家没有动力，主要是因为账本是不透明的。但是比特币创造了一个理想的虚拟世界，它有严格的工作量证明，所以它有一个全世界最清晰透明的账本，我觉得这是一个很大的价值，因为这个事情以前是做不到的，比特币是第一次在世界范围内实现了这个东西。从技术上来说它是一个分布式网络，背后有很多技术要素要解决，这个产业远远没有成熟，一切只是刚刚开始。  第三个是法律上的意义。因为人是生活在现实世界里的但是比特币创造的是平行世界的财富和对数字资产的所有权，这和现实世界是脱钩的，但是两个世界在不断交融，一旦交融就涉及到监管法律的问题。因为从政府的角度，政府可能不太愿意看到平行世界的一组数字产生购买力，这会抢占法币市场。  但是各国政府对比特币态度不一，比如我出差到法国开会，在那里可以用比特币购买咖啡面包，日本更是所有便利店都支持比特币付款，日本政府也承认比特币是货币。虽然每个国家以及监管者的认知不同，但是（接受）趋势已经在发生了，从法律意义上来说肯定需要监管，但这一切都是需要时间的。  本质上区块链就是在分布式网络上记账，而且要让这笔账在记录上的一致性达到让所有人都满意。财富要有稀缺性而且不能重复使用，数字货币也是一样的。所以某种意义上它具备货币的属性，但是货币是什么很难定义。从这种意义上说，各个国家有争议，但是区块链带来的是技术和理念的变革，涉及到各种新理念的碰撞。至于法律上的问题就像网约车一样，网约车一开始被出租车公司认为是非法运营，但是网约车现在也在逐渐合法化。  但是每一次新的理念提出后都需要有一个被接受的过程。整个行业无论从技术还是产业上来说都是刚刚开始，当一切刚开始的时候在市场没形成垄断之前，占有地域性优势是有机会的。而且我觉得比特币和以太坊本身有很多值得迭代的东西，所以我们希望做一个更好的技术性平台。  比特币网络是一个分布式网络，单就网络本身不涉及经济利益来说，它有很多角色。比如说比特币网络需要有矿工不断挖矿，后来挖矿越来越难，需要合作挖矿。还有很多人提供服务，一个全节点提供100G数据，普通用户认为太多了，所以有人接入比特币网络提供钱包服务。  整个区块链行业还面临很多问题。最大的问题比如说是行业落地慢，大家一直只是在炒概念，还比如说是缺乏新型的智能合约平台，以太坊是靠矿工维护，但是现实世界很难用到，因为你不可能卖服务给银行的时候还卖几台矿机给它。  第二个是它的兼容性很差，以太坊和比特币生态不兼容，一个人只能在一个平台上开发不能跨平台。还有一个是共识机制不够成熟，比特币网络现在每秒只能处理5-7笔交易，一天30多万笔，在现实世界这是远远不够的，相较而言支付宝每秒可以处理10万笔交易。所以如果想要成为未来金融技术架构，从行业角度还有很多问题待解决。  谈到Qtum的技术设计理念，当时我的设计想法是要兼容现有两个生态的技术流派，在兼容的基础上创新，这样对于企业运用和开发者来说门槛会低很多。不知道大家有没有关注去年的DAO事件，DAO（分布式自治组织）是一个非常先进的理念，当时以太坊面向全球在不到一个月内融了1.3亿美金，背后不是由人而是由一段程序管理这笔钱，当时DAO的理念就是人人为我的分布式基金投钱，投钱的人都可以提项目，然后基金根据一定决策条件自动投资，一切都是靠程序进行。  但是当时众筹资金被盗了，事件发生后社区里就分为两派，一派认为既然认可Code is Law（程序即法律），那么就要接受程序会出现bug的事实，接受资金被盗的结果；而另一派人认为我们还是生活在现实世界里，所以我们要把钱追回来。于是这个网络当时就分叉了，这也反映了以太坊的一个问题，当智能合约不成熟的时候，现实世界如何在发生如上事件的时候干预这个网络。  因为从某种意义上来说，这种分布式网络是很难关闭的，以比特币为例，它现在在100多个国家有上万个节点，每个节点都在一个独立的个体手上，所以很难关闭这个网络。这是区块链一个很大的问题，因为区块链实际上是一个软件系统，按道理说软件出现bug很正常，可以通过升级解决，但是区块链网络这种协议的变化其实是非常艰难的，像比特币一样，为了从一兆到两兆区块链扩容已经炒了好几年了，所以我认为网络能够有兼容性和可升级性也是我们当初的设计理念。  我觉得区块链还有一个最大的问题，就是为什么行业应用和C端应用一直没做起来，原因是体验和交互做得太差了。公钥私钥这种概念对于大多数人来说还是难以理解。我觉得这个行业缺少一个类似乔布斯这样的人物能够把行业体验做到极致，这样这个行业才能最终流行起来，现在行业是没有产品化的能力的，只有做协议的能力。但是有产品化的能力才能把这个应用技术推到C端，现在缺乏这方面的人才。  当时我们的想法是，中国有这么大的移动互联网市场，而且这个市场环境是全球最好的，你去美国都不能通过类似微信的应用扫码付款的，还是要通过刷卡，所以从这个角度说我认为中国在区块链这个领域未来会大有作为，因为所有C端用户的用户习惯已经被教育得非常非常好。当时我们设计的时候想，我们要找最好的设计师做UI设计，把技术隐藏在产品的背后，对用户来说，只要看到可以触碰到的东西就可以了。  另一个就是整个平台的安全性对区块链网络也是非常重要的，这就非常细节了。比如说一个平台要发布需要经过各方面的测试，α、β、peer review这些自动化测试，还包括你的技术选型，你所选择的技术来源是不是经过了充分测试。当时以太坊为什么出现被盗问题而比特币不会呢，因为比特币这些核心代码是全世界将近上千个开发者研究八年研究出来的，所有的bug和漏洞都修修补补好多次了。一套大型的软件系统没有bug是不可能的。  以太坊当时出现DAO的问题还是因为自己写的程序是早晚会被人发现有bug的。所以从我们设计的角度来说，完全搞一套新东西是有一定的风险，包括安全的风险、用户教育成本的风险，所以我们当时是站在成熟的技术上融合。所以就技术选型而言，我们选了成熟的技术，现有的技术然后做融合，做创新，这能够极大地降低安全性方面的风险。  应用性的测量我觉得是整个区块链行业非常欠缺的。虽然大家在聊比特币，聊以太坊，其实真正手上有这些代币的人很少。因为你下载一个钱包就很麻烦，你还要知道怎么去管理就更麻烦了。那从我们的角度上来说，我们要做应用性。比如说钱包的应用性我们就做完善的API的服务，因为钱包是一个分布式的网络，有API的服务，还有DApp的支持。  另外一个很有意思的概念就是DApp。从某种意义上来说，我觉得未来区块链能够走到C端的两个机会，一个是DApp，一个就是智能合约。这两个方向如果做好了之后，我觉得能够对现在的互联网产生颠覆性的影响。有个DApp的拼车服务叫“车来了”，对用户来说用“车来了”的打车体验和用滴滴打车没有变化，但是背后是有本质的变化。  现在滴滴打车从一个共享经济的发起人变成了一个网络的中心，变成了匹配用户和乘客的中心，并且靠收取两边的手续费来维持自己的商业模式。在海外其实已经有公司在做一个去中心化的Uber，它把这种撮合的服务放在以太坊的网络上，所有的交易行为是在以太坊的网络上进行交易。然后这个匹配需求的服务也是在以太坊的网络上做到的。以太坊网络为什么可以做这个事情，因为以太坊网络上有个很厉害的功能叫智能合约。智能合约就是提供担保服务的，就是一个虚拟的代理员。所以刚才那个DAO分布式基金其实也是一个虚拟的代理员。  我举一个简单的例子，中国最好的房产中介公司应该是链家，它可能有一万到两万的中介，每天做的事情都是重复性的劳动。就是说有人要租房有人要出租，其实每天就是签合同。但是在区块链网络上你可以在几秒钟内创建有相同功能的角色，就是一个smart contract，它起到的作用其实跟链家的中介一模一样。我们这个合同可以在block chain的网络上直接签署。但是有一点非常不一样的就是，计算机是非常善于做重复劳动的。所以说链家的三万个中介在计算机网络上可能一天里就能创造出三万个智能合约。  区块链最大的意义就是提供了一个trust service，但是整个社会运营的根基其实就是trust。比如说大家相信银行，相信支付宝，相信微信，因为它已经做到很大的体量，你不会觉得支付宝有一天会跑。但是整个社会的产业链里面，其实很多行业是没有trust的。他们的trust是建立在人际关系上面的。  区块链最大的挑战就是说它通过数学的算法，通过分布式的网络，建立了一个强有力的信任。然后每一个智能合约的角色就是现实世界里面的一个虚拟的代理人或者是一个虚拟的机构，这些虚拟的机构和虚拟的代理人是可编程的，而人的逻辑其实大部分是可以通过程序去实现的，所以其实这也就意味着它可以取代现实世界里的很多角色。这是分布式网络最大的一个价值。  那为什么token 是有价值的，这些币为什么要涨，因为它背后没有股份。既然大家认为有一天比特币的网络、以太坊的网络会干掉BAT，会干掉链家，会占据银行的部分份额，那站在这个角度上来估值，我觉得这个行业估一千亿美金还太小了。  为什么称比特币为数字黄金？它不单是一个货币，它还提供了一个trust service。单就货币的角色它的表现属性已经远远超越黄金了。黄金就是一个元素，黄金的价值是来自于人们赋予它的价值。从价值交换的角度上来说，比特币价值来自于使用的便利性和背后大家对它的信任程度。黄金也是因为有人相信黄金有价值才有价值的。  比特币现在在清结算的网络上每天处理四十亿美金的资金流转，那它的价值应该是它能处理的交易额的几十倍、上百倍吧。而且它还不单单是个清结算的网络。如果单单是个swift的这种网络，可能它的价值也就类似于swift了。它不单是分布式的清结算的网络，它还有自己的货币体系。所以这个网络价值的意义就是巨大的。最大的挑战当然是来自于监管，但是从目前来看，在很多国家合法化之后它也没有什么监管的挑战了。  刚才提到了比特币是一种通缩型的货币，数字资产总量有限的，而法币是无限印的。站在全球资产配置的角度上来说，我觉得今年没有任何一个行业的利润率超过了数字货币。因为今年整个数字货币的产值扩大了十倍。无论是股票、金融市场，我觉得没有任何一个行业达到这个收益。那这个其实是倒逼现在所有的行业，某种意义上来说，持有比特币是为了对冲现实世界里的风险。  DApp它是有巨大意义的，它能变革互联网的运行模式。因为互联网在有了BAT有了垄断之后，它的商业利益的划分也就意味着巨大的垄断。  ICO 和IPO我觉得本质上没有区别，都是公开上市。当一个项目ICO之后它其实就变成了公开交易的市场。我觉得ICO其实本质就是说从第一天起它就是一个公开上市可交易的东西。对DApp来说，它这个项目没有股权，又公开上市流通了，这些拿到钱的开发团队，只要他持续在做这个项目，它就会有价值的回馈，就会有人才进入这个行业。那这个行业就会一直往前发展。  DApp变革了商业组织的模式，把原来利益的划分现在全部拿出来分给所有的参与者。最简单的就是Qtum，当时我们发行这个网络时大概全球有二十多个国家的七千人次参与。其实后面上涨的时候应该是造就了至少五百个千万富翁。从各种意义上来说，这是大家认可的一个行业发展，认同Qtum作为未来中国的一个基础服务、区块的一个trust service供应商，或者这个平台的供应商，未来能达到这些价值，所以它里面的这些代币可能就值这么多钱。  这个代币在某种意义上来说就代表股份，代表着这个系统未来的分红权，代表着这个分布式系统里面的一个本位货币。我觉得DApp未来是一个很好的方向。在美国有家公司叫做Consensus，一直围绕以太坊做DApp的服务，它通过扶植未来去中心化应用领域的巨头，从这个行业里赚了很多钱。因为互联网的巨头基本没有机会扶植了，流量牢牢控制在几家公司手中，通过抢流量的方式没法赢过BAT。但是通过另外的维度和分配机制是有可能颠覆BAT的。  我觉得DApp是个很好的方向，因为确实有些应用是可以落地的，比如分布式存储，分布式域名服务，而且能让大家意识到这是一个更公平更好的机制，进而释放大家的创造性。  这是我们当时设计的一个系统架构，这个就比较复杂，但是可以帮助大家了解区块链行业都包括哪些层次。最底层是数学模型，包括共识算法，时延，网络的原理，可靠性，可拓展性，底层是靠数学驱动的；第二层就是系统的角度，比如说要有算法、网络模型，还有密码学的基础，还比如网络安全，还涉及做硬件生产矿机的产业。  第二，站在软件的角度，比如说我们有核心，有DApp，有合约，有Identity，因为最后需要和现实世界接轨，在分布式网络上还是要有身份，所以做ID认证识别也是一个很好的方向，未来不论是物联网还是区块链上都会有ID的需求。还有提供数据的公司，手上有各种数据，比如说有些数据需要审计公司审计，还比如银行间的交易不希望被无关方看到，所以做隐私这方面的也需要。  再往上肯定就是应用层了，应用包括to B的应用和to C的应用，一旦涉及到应用就会涉及到人，所以就会涉及法律上的监管，财务上的风险管理。  再往上才是和用户的交互，目前区块链用户可以感受到的一个是钱包，一个是浏览器，开发者能感受到的是集成的开发网页。还有就是smart contract，这就是我们想做的，我们要建一个智能合约的App store，这上面不做程序只做合约，每个合约有个功能。比如第一个功能就是你可以发自己的代币，就比如一个咖啡店的老板发个优惠券，原来做这种事情需要自己开发App。但是在区块链上你会发现，开发App的这种需求全部会被削弱，所以以后大家不需要开发App服务了，可能在网络上点点键盘，想要的功能就实现了。  为什么ICO这么火，比如说原来我要",False

本次邀请到量子链发起人——帅初，跟大家交流区块链（包括Qtum）过去，现在和未来发展和ICO的相关情况。该团队发起的Qtum项目目前总市值达80亿，热度空前。  （1）区块链引领了财富理念的巨大变革，Qtum就是在兼容以太坊和比特币生态和技术的基础上打造出的一个更好的平台。  （2）比特币等电子货币是一种值得配置的优质资产，区块链作为引发变革的新兴行业已被写入十三五规划。  （3）ICO本质上和IPO没有不同，但ICO通过变革财富分配方式使知识变现，同时节约了众筹活动的时间和经济成本。  （4）在判断ICO是否值得投资时主要需要注意四点：团队背景、项目理念（公有链更有机会）、流动性保证和宣传路演效果。  交流最后是有关行业的自由问答。  宋嘉吉：今年是数字货币的大牛市，这个行业慢慢从一个大家觉得陌生的行业到开始普及，再到现在各方参与者开始拥抱监管。那么在这么多的项目里，大家都在谈比特币，说已经翻了一倍了，但是比特币确实是今年数字货币中涨幅最小的一种。  有很多新型的数字货币在慢慢上线，在我们看来，具有基础平台价值的项目并不多，ETH以太坊，比特币以及现在的QTUM。QTUM按照ICO的售价现在已经有三十几倍的收益了。  今天我有幸请到了量子链发起人帅初来交流，一个是介绍一下什么是Qtum，另外一个跟大家交流一下ICO。因为就传统金融行业来说，ICO对于风投模式会有一个非常大的冲击，因为IPO也好，风投的PE、VC也好，其成本都相当高。Qtum刚开始还没那么火，ICO持续了五天时间；而最近的BAT项目一出来就是一分钟秒掉4000万美金，因此ICO也是值得介绍的。下面有请帅初。  帅初：我今天讲两点，一个是区块链这个产业的过去现在和未来，以技术为索引看整个产业的发展。第二个就是ICO这个现象我们应该怎么认识它。  第一个就是区块链的过去现在和未来，区块链的过去可能我更多是以量子链为例，因为量子链其实融合了很多区块链技术过去的一些发展和创新。为什么开发这个区块链，或者说为什么要投身区块链这个行业，因为当时我博士辍学之后，在区块链这个行业做了大半年，当时是行业低谷，后面去阿里巴巴做了大半年，从阿里出来后又投身这个行业，但是在读博士期间，基本上所有的精力都花在区块链这个行业里面，当时还没有区块链这个名字。举个最简单的例子，为什么区块链的价值今天受到这么多人的追捧？我觉得都是一个逐渐认知的过程，新技术的出现都是由一少部分人先提出说要做这个东西去颠覆老的东西，然后人类再进行不断认知的过程。  我觉得区块链也是这样一个概念，当时我们看互联网是基于这些协议栈去开发应用，有了TCPIP的协议才有了BAT这样的公司，上面才有了Facebook和Google，但是我们回过来想一个问题，在互联网上有两层意思，互联网是传输信息的，它的价值点对点转移还是很受限制的，比特币是第一个被我们称之为价值传输协议的，在互联网上不通过任何中间人，借助这个网络本身的信任我们就可以把一笔资金从A传输到B，它背后的意义是非常具有颠覆性的。  还有一点就涉及到ICO这个问题，当时发明互联网协议的两个教授自己也没有成为亿万富翁，但是基于这个协议开发Facebook、Google的这些人其实成为了社会上财富的拥有者，为什么ICO会逐渐流行，因为它给了工程师一个把自己知识变现的路径，把协议的东西直接变现卖掉了，我觉得这是对财富分配机制的一种变革和调整。  至于为什么开发区块链是因为我看到了它巨大的意义和价值，整个互联网协议上面大家基于信息搭建服务，因此产生了BAT这种体量的公司，说白了他们就是做信息的生意。百度就是做信息的聚合，然后二次分发；阿里也是一个信息的匹配服务，买卖双方和线上线下，再加上支付宝系统担保的服务；腾讯其实也是信息点对点的传输。  基于信息的服务就可以产生BAT这样的公司，但是你想一想如果有一天世界上所有有形的无形的资产全部可以点对点的自由流动之后，未来基于此的商业模式会产生巨大的商业体量，它的体量将远远超过十个BAT，从这个角度来说，这些未来的可能性就建立在区块链网络的协议和基础上，所以从某种意义上来说，我并不觉得这个行业是个泡沫，这个行业才刚刚开始，因为它要改造的它所创造的新价值是远远超过我们现在所看到的价值的。  关于比特币是什么东西，这是个非常复杂的概念，因为整个比特币网络背后是没有公司的，它是一个分布式网络，比特币年初的估值也就几十亿美金，现在有500亿美金，财富增长了十倍，那这十倍收益并不是被股东拿走的，因为背后没有股东，财务增长的收益最终分配给了所有持有比特币的人。我为什么说这种变革更彻底，因为它改变的是一种机制。  因为在互联网行业中，行业蓬勃发展，但你不会享受到行业红利，除非你持有腾讯、百度的股票，但比特币行业不一样，它背后没有公司，把中间的利益削弱，利益分配给了所有参与者。所以这就是说在信息的高速公路上诞生了BAT，但是在价值的高速公路上会产生十倍于BAT的公司和平台。我看到了巨大的商业机会，所以投身于这个领域里。  区块链的本质有很多因素，但是我觉得最大的因素影响并不在于技术革新，而是理念上的变革。这是对于人的财富观念的变革，为什么这么说呢，因为区块链技术有可能成为下一个时代的底层协议，这是关于财富分配的一种变革和创造。某种意义上来说为什么这么火，其实它是释放了人类的创造力。因为比如说一个程序员在百度打工可能一年也就拿到50万的收入，这是由社会的生产关系决定的，社会的财富分配机制就决定了每个人能拿到多少钱，但是在ICO上，几个程序员做了一个项目，此时生产分配关系并不受社会制度的约束，所以整个以太坊的估值现在是1400亿人民币，再努力一下就超过百度了，而且它只用了两年的时间，我觉得这是它流行的根源。  所以区块链更多是理念上的变革，变革了人们对财富的认知、对货币的认知、对协作的认知、对背后技术的认知，它是一个巨大的跳跃。很多人是接受不了的，比如你的父母，因为对他们来说这东西没什么价值，就是一串符号而已，但是某种意义上来说，所有的纸币背后也就是一张纸，意义上其实可以类似。所以会有监管的挑战，但是现在监管者也很聪明，他们会和行业有一些沟通和交流，在美国甚至有专门的游说机构，不断和政府交流，说明行业现在在做什么。  第二个从技术上来说，整个区块链是一个分布式系统，最初的根源确实来自于一群自由主义者，甚至还有一些极客搞了比特币这样一套系统出来，最开始的目标是分布式的绝对安全的抗审查的系统，他们有根深蒂固的观念就是货币是不能无限通货膨胀的，所以比特币是一个通缩的货币，就2100万个，它的分发是靠矿工去挖矿的，你为这个网络做贡献你就会有收益，通过巨大的利益绑定将所有人绑定在这个网络里。  每个人的利益是得到精确的记录的，某种意义上来说它是一个全世界共有的账本，但是账本的本质就是一笔财富，如果谁能记清楚一笔账其实就是一笔财富。因为其实社会的发展趋势就是利益的划分越来越精细，原来计划经济时代为什么大家没有动力，主要是因为账本是不透明的。但是比特币创造了一个理想的虚拟世界，它有严格的工作量证明，所以它有一个全世界最清晰透明的账本，我觉得这是一个很大的价值，因为这个事情以前是做不到的，比特币是第一次在世界范围内实现了这个东西。从技术上来说它是一个分布式网络，背后有很多技术要素要解决，这个产业远远没有成熟，一切只是刚刚开始。  第三个是法律上的意义。因为人是生活在现实世界里的但是比特币创造的是平行世界的财富和对数字资产的所有权，这和现实世界是脱钩的，但是两个世界在不断交融，一旦交融就涉及到监管法律的问题。因为从政府的角度，政府可能不太愿意看到平行世界的一组数字产生购买力，这会抢占法币市场。  但是各国政府对比特币态度不一，比如我出差到法国开会，在那里可以用比特币购买咖啡面包，日本更是所有便利店都支持比特币付款，日本政府也承认比特币是货币。虽然每个国家以及监管者的认知不同，但是（接受）趋势已经在发生了，从法律意义上来说肯定需要监管，但这一切都是需要时间的。  本质上区块链就是在分布式网络上记账，而且要让这笔账在记录上的一致性达到让所有人都满意。财富要有稀缺性而且不能重复使用，数字货币也是一样的。所以某种意义上它具备货币的属性，但是货币是什么很难定义。从这种意义上说，各个国家有争议，但是区块链带来的是技术和理念的变革，涉及到各种新理念的碰撞。至于法律上的问题就像网约车一样，网约车一开始被出租车公司认为是非法运营，但是网约车现在也在逐渐合法化。  但是每一次新的理念提出后都需要有一个被接受的过程。整个行业无论从技术还是产业上来说都是刚刚开始，当一切刚开始的时候在市场没形成垄断之前，占有地域性优势是有机会的。而且我觉得比特币和以太坊本身有很多值得迭代的东西，所以我们希望做一个更好的技术性平台。  比特币网络是一个分布式网络，单就网络本身不涉及经济利益来说，它有很多角色。比如说比特币网络需要有矿工不断挖矿，后来挖矿越来越难，需要合作挖矿。还有很多人提供服务，一个全节点提供100G数据，普通用户认为太多了，所以有人接入比特币网络提供钱包服务。  整个区块链行业还面临很多问题。最大的问题比如说是行业落地慢，大家一直只是在炒概念，还比如说是缺乏新型的智能合约平台，以太坊是靠矿工维护，但是现实世界很难用到，因为你不可能卖服务给银行的时候还卖几台矿机给它。  第二个是它的兼容性很差，以太坊和比特币生态不兼容，一个人只能在一个平台上开发不能跨平台。还有一个是共识机制不够成熟，比特币网络现在每秒只能处理5-7笔交易，一天30多万笔，在现实世界这是远远不够的，相较而言支付宝每秒可以处理10万笔交易。所以如果想要成为未来金融技术架构，从行业角度还有很多问题待解决。  谈到Qtum的技术设计理念，当时我的设计想法是要兼容现有两个生态的技术流派，在兼容的基础上创新，这样对于企业运用和开发者来说门槛会低很多。不知道大家有没有关注去年的DAO事件，DAO（分布式自治组织）是一个非常先进的理念，当时以太坊面向全球在不到一个月内融了1.3亿美金，背后不是由人而是由一段程序管理这笔钱，当时DAO的理念就是人人为我的分布式基金投钱，投钱的人都可以提项目，然后基金根据一定决策条件自动投资，一切都是靠程序进行。  但是当时众筹资金被盗了，事件发生后社区里就分为两派，一派认为既然认可Code is Law（程序即法律），那么就要接受程序会出现bug的事实，接受资金被盗的结果；而另一派人认为我们还是生活在现实世界里，所以我们要把钱追回来。于是这个网络当时就分叉了，这也反映了以太坊的一个问题，当智能合约不成熟的时候，现实世界如何在发生如上事件的时候干预这个网络。  因为从某种意义上来说，这种分布式网络是很难关闭的，以比特币为例，它现在在100多个国家有上万个节点，每个节点都在一个独立的个体手上，所以很难关闭这个网络。这是区块链一个很大的问题，因为区块链实际上是一个软件系统，按道理说软件出现bug很正常，可以通过升级解决，但是区块链网络这种协议的变化其实是非常艰难的，像比特币一样，为了从一兆到两兆区块链扩容已经炒了好几年了，所以我认为网络能够有兼容性和可升级性也是我们当初的设计理念。  我觉得区块链还有一个最大的问题，就是为什么行业应用和C端应用一直没做起来，原因是体验和交互做得太差了。公钥私钥这种概念对于大多数人来说还是难以理解。我觉得这个行业缺少一个类似乔布斯这样的人物能够把行业体验做到极致，这样这个行业才能最终流行起来，现在行业是没有产品化的能力的，只有做协议的能力。但是有产品化的能力才能把这个应用技术推到C端，现在缺乏这方面的人才。  当时我们的想法是，中国有这么大的移动互联网市场，而且这个市场环境是全球最好的，你去美国都不能通过类似微信的应用扫码付款的，还是要通过刷卡，所以从这个角度说我认为中国在区块链这个领域未来会大有作为，因为所有C端用户的用户习惯已经被教育得非常非常好。当时我们设计的时候想，我们要找最好的设计师做UI设计，把技术隐藏在产品的背后，对用户来说，只要看到可以触碰到的东西就可以了。  另一个就是整个平台的安全性对区块链网络也是非常重要的，这就非常细节了。比如说一个平台要发布需要经过各方面的测试，α、β、peer review这些自动化测试，还包括你的技术选型，你所选择的技术来源是不是经过了充分测试。当时以太坊为什么出现被盗问题而比特币不会呢，因为比特币这些核心代码是全世界将近上千个开发者研究八年研究出来的，所有的bug和漏洞都修修补补好多次了。一套大型的软件系统没有bug是不可能的。  以太坊当时出现DAO的问题还是因为自己写的程序是早晚会被人发现有bug的。所以从我们设计的角度来说，完全搞一套新东西是有一定的风险，包括安全的风险、用户教育成本的风险，所以我们当时是站在成熟的技术上融合。所以就技术选型而言，我们选了成熟的技术，现有的技术然后做融合，做创新，这能够极大地降低安全性方面的风险。  应用性的测量我觉得是整个区块链行业非常欠缺的。虽然大家在聊比特币，聊以太坊，其实真正手上有这些代币的人很少。因为你下载一个钱包就很麻烦，你还要知道怎么去管理就更麻烦了。那从我们的角度上来说，我们要做应用性。比如说钱包的应用性我们就做完善的API的服务，因为钱包是一个分布式的网络，有API的服务，还有DApp的支持。  另外一个很有意思的概念就是DApp。从某种意义上来说，我觉得未来区块链能够走到C端的两个机会，一个是DApp，一个就是智能合约。这两个方向如果做好了之后，我觉得能够对现在的互联网产生颠覆性的影响。有个DApp的拼车服务叫“车来了”，对用户来说用“车来了”的打车体验和用滴滴打车没有变化，但是背后是有本质的变化。  现在滴滴打车从一个共享经济的发起人变成了一个网络的中心，变成了匹配用户和乘客的中心，并且靠收取两边的手续费来维持自己的商业模式。在海外其实已经有公司在做一个去中心化的Uber，它把这种撮合的服务放在以太坊的网络上，所有的交易行为是在以太坊的网络上进行交易。然后这个匹配需求的服务也是在以太坊的网络上做到的。以太坊网络为什么可以做这个事情，因为以太坊网络上有个很厉害的功能叫智能合约。智能合约就是提供担保服务的，就是一个虚拟的代理员。所以刚才那个DAO分布式基金其实也是一个虚拟的代理员。  我举一个简单的例子，中国最好的房产中介公司应该是链家，它可能有一万到两万的中介，每天做的事情都是重复性的劳动。就是说有人要租房有人要出租，其实每天就是签合同。但是在区块链网络上你可以在几秒钟内创建有相同功能的角色，就是一个smart contract，它起到的作用其实跟链家的中介一模一样。我们这个合同可以在block chain的网络上直接签署。但是有一点非常不一样的就是，计算机是非常善于做重复劳动的。所以说链家的三万个中介在计算机网络上可能一天里就能创造出三万个智能合约。  区块链最大的意义就是提供了一个trust service，但是整个社会运营的根基其实就是trust。比如说大家相信银行，相信支付宝，相信微信，因为它已经做到很大的体量，你不会觉得支付宝有一天会跑。但是整个社会的产业链里面，其实很多行业是没有trust的。他们的trust是建立在人际关系上面的。  区块链最大的挑战就是说它通过数学的算法，通过分布式的网络，建立了一个强有力的信任。然后每一个智能合约的角色就是现实世界里面的一个虚拟的代理人或者是一个虚拟的机构，这些虚拟的机构和虚拟的代理人是可编程的，而人的逻辑其实大部分是可以通过程序去实现的，所以其实这也就意味着它可以取代现实世界里的很多角色。这是分布式网络最大的一个价值。  那为什么token 是有价值的，这些币为什么要涨，因为它背后没有股份。既然大家认为有一天比特币的网络、以太坊的网络会干掉BAT，会干掉链家，会占据银行的部分份额，那站在这个角度上来估值，我觉得这个行业估一千亿美金还太小了。  为什么称比特币为数字黄金？它不单是一个货币，它还提供了一个trust service。单就货币的角色它的表现属性已经远远超越黄金了。黄金就是一个元素，黄金的价值是来自于人们赋予它的价值。从价值交换的角度上来说，比特币价值来自于使用的便利性和背后大家对它的信任程度。黄金也是因为有人相信黄金有价值才有价值的。  比特币现在在清结算的网络上每天处理四十亿美金的资金流转，那它的价值应该是它能处理的交易额的几十倍、上百倍吧。而且它还不单单是个清结算的网络。如果单单是个swift的这种网络，可能它的价值也就类似于swift了。它不单是分布式的清结算的网络，它还有自己的货币体系。所以这个网络价值的意义就是巨大的。最大的挑战当然是来自于监管，但是从目前来看，在很多国家合法化之后它也没有什么监管的挑战了。  刚才提到了比特币是一种通缩型的货币，数字资产总量有限的，而法币是无限印的。站在全球资产配置的角度上来说，我觉得今年没有任何一个行业的利润率超过了数字货币。因为今年整个数字货币的产值扩大了十倍。无论是股票、金融市场，我觉得没有任何一个行业达到这个收益。那这个其实是倒逼现在所有的行业，某种意义上来说，持有比特币是为了对冲现实世界里的风险。  DApp它是有巨大意义的，它能变革互联网的运行模式。因为互联网在有了BAT有了垄断之后，它的商业利益的划分也就意味着巨大的垄断。  ICO 和IPO我觉得本质上没有区别，都是公开上市。当一个项目ICO之后它其实就变成了公开交易的市场。我觉得ICO其实本质就是说从第一天起它就是一个公开上市可交易的东西。对DApp来说，它这个项目没有股权，又公开上市流通了，这些拿到钱的开发团队，只要他持续在做这个项目，它就会有价值的回馈，就会有人才进入这个行业。那这个行业就会一直往前发展。  DApp变革了商业组织的模式，把原来利益的划分现在全部拿出来分给所有的参与者。最简单的就是Qtum，当时我们发行这个网络时大概全球有二十多个国家的七千人次参与。其实后面上涨的时候应该是造就了至少五百个千万富翁。从各种意义上来说，这是大家认可的一个行业发展，认同Qtum作为未来中国的一个基础服务、区块的一个trust service供应商，或者这个平台的供应商，未来能达到这些价值，所以它里面的这些代币可能就值这么多钱。  这个代币在某种意义上来说就代表股份，代表着这个系统未来的分红权，代表着这个分布式系统里面的一个本位货币。我觉得DApp未来是一个很好的方向。在美国有家公司叫做Consensus，一直围绕以太坊做DApp的服务，它通过扶植未来去中心化应用领域的巨头，从这个行业里赚了很多钱。因为互联网的巨头基本没有机会扶植了，流量牢牢控制在几家公司手中，通过抢流量的方式没法赢过BAT。但是通过另外的维度和分配机制是有可能颠覆BAT的。  我觉得DApp是个很好的方向，因为确实有些应用是可以落地的，比如分布式存储，分布式域名服务，而且能让大家意识到这是一个更公平更好的机制，进而释放大家的创造性。  这是我们当时设计的一个系统架构，这个就比较复杂，但是可以帮助大家了解区块链行业都包括哪",False

This means that no new software has to be downloaded and no actions need to be taken from network stakeholders and node operators when DGP network upgrades occur.""   https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/innovation/qtum-blockchain-becomes-self-aware-avoid-bitcoin-style-governance-problems/       The Qtum Project has introduced a Decentralized Governance Protocol (DGP) that allows blockchain parameters to be modified seamlessly without ecosystem disruption. This means that no new software has to be downloaded and no actions need to be taken from network stakeholders and node operators when DGP network upgrades occur.  The London Summit 2017 is coming, get involved!  Qtum explains that the DGP is built using smart contract technology. It implements a decentralized and democratic governance system which can be replaced and upgraded as needed. The protocol also allows for automated smart contracts to be a voting party. A smart contract can thus monitor the status of the blockchain and automatically propose and vote upon changes to fix problems that are detected.  “The same way blockchain technology modernized smart contract applications, we are using smart contracts to transform the way blockchain software is maintained,” Jordan Earls, co-founder of the Qtum Project, remarked. “This technology is instrumental in Qtum being the first self-aware blockchain that can quickly adapt to a rapidly changing world.”  The Qtum team believes that this is a major step for the blockchain industry to help remove some of the ideological politics out of development, which has impeded the implementation of significant innovations, like in the case of the Bitcoin block-size debate.  Although the decentralized governance protocol can support many changes to the network, Qtum will limit the protocol’s power to the more basic blockchain parameters such as the network’s block size limit and gas prices for operational code running on the network.   Patrick Dai “Qtum’s Decentralized Governance Protocol will significantly reduce the effort it takes to coordinate a hard fork for these basic blockchain parameters so that the community can focus on important issues,” said Patrick Dai, co-founder of the Qtum Project. “We don’t see this as being a panacea for every issue that may arise,” Dai acknowledged.  Qtum plans to debut a beta version of the Decentralized Governance Protocol in the first testnet of Qtum in June, as well as making its complete source code open-source at that time.",False

Look at my previous post for clear advantages it will have vs LTC, ETC, and even ETH (although ETH definitely has a hype advantage). If you want to make the argument that all cryptos are extremely overvalued right now, then okay, that might work out. Your argument that Qtum alone is overvalued falls flat when compared to other cryptos.  Working off of the presumption that you agree with me that Qtum has an edge over ETC and LTC to say the least, let's compare market caps of Qtum with other cryptos.  ETC: $1,655,097,996  (92,371,204 ETC circulating at $17.92)  LTC: $1,528,475,334  (51,449,957 LTC circulating at $29.71)  Qtum: $1,137,000,000 (100,000,000 Qtum TOTAL at $11.37). Keep in mind, valuation is actually higher here than it should be considering the circulating supply is low.  Gnosis/GNO (for shits and giggles because this is overvalued): $2,666,500,000 (10,000,000 GNO TOTAL at $266.65)  You could make the argument that Qtum is overvalued because all cryptos are overvalued. Relatively speaking, however, Qtum is undervalued when you truly look into what the dev team is doing. Yes, I'm aware that Testnet hasn't launched yet, which is what I would say is the reason for the lower market cap than ETC or LTC. Obviously Mainnet is months away, but what will Qtum have in September? A better product than Ethereum has put out, minus the big support (at least so far).",False

Its objective is to enable rapid modification of blockchain parameters without ecosystem disruption. Qtum will debut a beta version of the DGP later June. This will include complete source code which will be made open source.  “The same way blockchain technology modernized smart contract applications, we are using smart contracts to transform the way blockchain software is maintained,” Jordan Earls, co-founder of the Qtum Project, remarked. “This technology is instrumental in Qtum being the first self-aware blockchain that can quickly adapt to a rapidly changing world,” Earls continued.  “Qtum’s Decentralized Governance Protocol will significantly reduce the effort it takes to coordinate a hard fork for these basic blockchain parameters so that the community can focus on important issues,” said Patrick Dai, co-founder of the Qtum Project. “(Nevertheless) we don’t see this as being a panacea for every issue that may arise.”  Do we need a DGP?  Since the inception of cryptocurrencies, there have been problems in almost all implementations. No project is immune. For example, Bitcoin has had many soft-forks to fix various security concerns. One of the worst was a fork which disabled exploitable script opcodes in very early versions of Bitcoin. Ethereum has also had several forks to fix security issues. The most impactful were ones to fix an exploit in the DAO smart contract, and another which changed the gas price for some opcodes.  A fork should always be treated as an unconventional approach. However, due to the theoretically infinite lifespan of a cryptocurrency, Qtum argues it is extremely improbable that a problem will not arise that necessitates a fork. The Qtum Project embraces the notion that a fork, though not desirable, will be necessary at some point.  What is the Decentralised Governance Protocol for blockchains?  DGP is built using smart contract technology. It implements a decentralized and democratic governance system. This can be replaced and upgraded as needed.  The protocol allows for automated smart contracts to be a voting party. A smart contract can monitor the status of the blockchain and automatically propose and vote upon changes to fix detected problems. With this, the Qtum blockchain becomes self-regulating, self-modifying, and self-aware.  The way DGP works is relatively straightforward. First, a governing party for the DGP makes a proposal to change a parameter. Afterward, all the governing parties for the DGP vote on the proposal. If it receives enough approval votes, the parameter change proposal becomes active. The proposal data is then placed in a standardized format and a particular storage space so that the blockchain software can easily access it without needing to execute the DGP contract directly.  What is Qtum?  The Qtum Foundation has its headquarters in Singapore. It is the decision-making body that drives the Qtum Project’s development, which include the Qtum platform.  In essence, Qtum is a blockchain application platform which combines:  the advantages of bitcoin core an Account Abstraction Layer allowing for multiple virtual machines, including the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) a Proof-of-stake Consensus protocol, aimed at tackling industry use cases and providing strong support for decentralized mobile applications.    What’s it mean?  For the users of Qtum, this means no new software would need downloading, and no actions need to be taken from network stakeholders and node operators when DGP network upgrades occur. Although the DGP can support many changes to the network, Qtum will limit the protocols power to the more basic blockchain parameters, such as the network’s block size limit and gas prices for operational code running on the network. The Qtum team believes this is a major step for the blockchain industry to help remove some of the ideological politics out of development, which has impeded the implementation of significant innovations.  The ‘fork problem’ is a recurrent software challenge. Cryptocurrencies and blockchains are, if anything, the nightmare occurrence, because these incorporate value. Whether the DGP will prove useful is unclear. Nevertheless, its progress will be worth active monitoring.

It's a guarantee that this will be on all the major exchanges once it's in mainnet.  As for China, the reality is that most cryptos just don't appropriately market towards the Chinese market's needs and Qtum has chosen to actually work on that.  It's an underserved niche, because Chinese folks can't access the same social networks as the rest of the world, so if you're not talking to them on Wechat then you're not there.  You don't understand that because you clearly don't know anything about the Chinese market, which is precisely the problem-most newer cryptos haven't actually worked to penetrate the Chinese market, which gives a huge opportunity for Qtum to take Ethereum's place in China.  This doesn't mean that people who buy Qtum don't believe in a borderless cryptocurrency, it means that you see an opportunity for an underserved market to be better targeted by people who actually understand that market instead of people who sit on forums posting garbage.  Either way, if you don't like Qtum that's great, nobody's asking you to put money into it and it's not even in testnet yet.  It's going to make it to testnet and mainnet long before Ethereum ever did but you're here posting gibberish about how Ethereum would never have done it like this, lol.  Ethereum took forever to make it into production, so if Qtum manages to get mainnet up by September they'll have done it well under half the time.",False

There's no actual blockchain, i.e., no actual Qtum coins being traded. The only exchanges that can offer prelaunch trading are the five exchanges that participated in hosting Qtum's ICO.  You could make the argument that Bter and Allcoin are unpopular, but Yunbi seems to have decent volume (Qtum had >$30MM USD/24 hr volume just the other day on this exchange).  Is it possible that the price is inflated? Maybe. I doubt it, however. It's unarguably worth more than ETC because it is ETC w/ PoS 3.0, UTXO model-based, and a more ambitious dev. team. Admittedly, the circulating volume of ETC is 92,000,000 compared with Qtum's total volume of 100 million.  LTC? Well Qtum has adopted Segwit as well. Major difference then lies in PoS 3.0 vs PoW. Perhaps is the reason why the current market cap between LTC and Qtum isn't that far apart, and likely will be higher for Qtum at launch given public support seeming to favor PoS over PoW, at least certainly in the Ethereum community. Then there's smart contracts/Dapps, which LTC currently lacks. This combined with the lack of dev. team for LTC, albeit a single dev. was recently hired.  Qtum is Chinese Ethereum 2.0 with a seemingly faster, more innovative dev. team. While it's certainly possible for price manipulation, I highly doubt that is what's going on. I think people are coming to the realization that Qtum has the potential to be a real contender with Ethereum for blockchain technology, and we are still very early in the game.  If Qtum, or more specifically the Enterprise Qtum Alliance, is able to gather support from big companies, there will no doubt be a trend like that seen with the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance Announcements (a jump from ~$12-->~$50, then from ~$90-->~$230).

Some of the project's high-profile supporters include co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Jaxx Blockchain Interface, Anthony Di Iorio; co-founder of Augur and EIR at Blockchain Capital, Jeremy Gardner; OkCoin CEO, Star Xu; blockchain technology advocate Bo Shen; billionaire Kuaidi Dache founder, Chen Weixing; and Chinese angel investor Xiaolai Li, among others.  The Qtum Project began in March of 2016 as a proof-of-concept, led by Patrick Dai. So far the team has completed the design of the Qtum model, the world's first digital currency that can execute smart contracts with a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism based on an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model.  Dai, a PhD candidate in Computer Science, previously worked at Alibaba. He began his research and development of blockchain technology in 2013.   In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine , Dai noted a lack of ""innovation in blockchain technology coming out of China."" Dai hopes to build a new ecosystem that can attract a large number of developers in China and around the world.  Dai added, ""Qtum is a global project that aims to connect the existing Bitcoin and Ethereum communities with businesses. The Qtum Foundation, the Singapore-based entity driving development and overseeing the project, has brought together talented Bitcoin and Ethereum developers and also gifted individuals from top global companies including Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and Nasdaq.""  ""The team and leadership were the greatest factors,"" said Di Iorio of his decision to invest in Qtum. ""They have a history of execution and are very business oriented. Many consider them to be the best team in China.""  Blockchain technology has attracted the attention of many industries. However, commercial use cases have faced challenges. ""The Qtum project is for real business needs,"" said Dai.  Bo Shen, a partner at Shanghai-based Fenbushi Capital and blockchain technology advocate, noted: ""For the past couple of years the [Suspicious link removed]munity and business world have been running alongside each other in parallel, and I think Qtum is where they meet.""  At present, two of the most prominent blockchain ecosystems, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have incompatible platforms. Qtum aims to pool the development resources of Bitcoin with decentralized application (DAPP) developers from Ethereum.  The financial industry has been one of the most active explorers of blockchain technology, though finance is highly regulated, especially in China. This industry is the largest holder of blockchain-related patents. Qtum also allows users to authenticate their identity through smart contracts, which will enable them to use more decentralized applications, such as those provided by the financial industry.  According to Dai, blockchain technology is not yet mainstream. However, through Qtum's ""Go Mobile"" strategy, Qtum will push DAPPs to the masses.  The Qtum community has already launched two community projects: SpringEmail and Qloha. SpringEmail hopes to combine blockchain technology with the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), allowing users to use the mailbox to send and receive small amounts of digital currency.  Qloha, which utilizes WeChat's new ""mini programs"" platform, enables users to send Qtum tokens and chat with bots to order products or services via WeChat. Qloha hopes to extend this feature to other messaging platforms such as iMessage, Telegram and Facebook Messenger to improve the usability of blockchain technology.

Blockchain application platform Qtum introduced today a Decentralized Governance Protocol (DGP) that allows blockchain parameters to be modified quickly and seamlessly without ecosystem disruption. For the users of Qtum, this means no new software would have to be downloaded, and no actions need to be taken from network stakeholders and node operators when DGP network upgrades occur.  DGP is built using smart contract technology. It implements a decentralized and democratic governance system that can be replaced and upgraded as needed. The protocol also allows for automated smart contracts to be a voting party. A smart contract can thus monitor the status of the blockchain and automatically propose and vote upon changes to fix problems that are detected. With this technology, the Qtum blockchain becomes self-regulating, self-modifying, and self-aware.  The same way blockchain technology modernized smart contract applications, we are using smart contracts to transform the way blockchain software is maintained. This technology is instrumental in Qtum being the first self-aware blockchain that can quickly adapt to a rapidly changing world. Jordan Earls, co-founder of the Qtum Project The Qtum team believes this is a major step for the blockchain industry to help remove some of the ideological politics out of development, which has impeded the implementation of significant innovations.  Although the decentralized governance protocol can support many changes to the network, Qtum will limit the protocols power to the more basic blockchain parameters, such as the network’s block size limit and gas prices for operational code running on the network.  Qtum’s Decentralized Governance Protocol will significantly reduce the effort it takes to coordinate a hard fork for these basic blockchain parameters so that the community can focus on important issues. We don’t see this as being a panacea for every issue that may arise. Patrick Dai, co-founder of the Qtum Project Qtum plans to debut a beta version of the Decentralized Governance Protocol in the first testnet of Qtum in June; as well, its complete source code is being made open source at that time.",False

It’s by far the biggest conference in the fledgling blockchain industry but it’s still tiny by tech industry standards. Mega-conferences like the Salesforce Dreamforce Summit, which pulled in 171,000 attendees and another 15 million online, dwarf it by comparison.  But the intimate nature of Consensus brings lots of advantages.  It means you’re likely to run into the CEO or lead programmer of any given company instead of the low-man-on-the-totem-pole flunky they send to hand out t-shirts at bigger industry events. It’s super easy to walk right up to a major investor or blockchain thought-leader and strike up a conversation.  As with any tech conference there’s lots of noise.  Flashy projects dominate, as do ones that copy already well understood ideas.  It’s much simpler to sell an idea to people looking to cash in on the crypto gold rush if they already have a mental framework for the concept. New ideas are harder to pitch because you’ve got a lot of explaining to do just to level set.  It’s easy for projects delivering real technological innovation to slip through the cracks.  The good news is there’s lots of innovation to be found if you know where to look.  The Good and The Bad   Let’s face it, Blockchain is still at the infrastructure development stage.  Consensus was jam packed with people hawking infrastructure. It’s as if they’re selling the Internet before Netscape. “Hey, buy some TCP/IP and some HTTPS. Get your DNS right here!” In the real world nobody gives a crap about infrastructure. It’s plumbing to them. What the world needs is a killer app, but we’re not there yet.  We haven’t hit our Netscape moment. Some folks will tell you Bitcoin is that moment, but it’s not. The Block.One CFO really nailed the reason why:  “We want to enable…decentralized applications that are indistinguishable…from the centralized alternatives.”  In other words, until apps look like any other app in the App store, nobody in the real world cares.  Few people seem to get that yet. The Block.One people, with founders who came from the BitShares and Steemit platforms, get it. It’s also a key focus for us at the Cicada project and Fermat’s Internet of People. Think of it like hybrid cars before the Prius. Up until then hybrid cars looked ugly as hell. They had weird looking frames and covers over the back wheels. Nobody wanted them. But as soon as they started making vehicles that looked like regular cars sales took off. The average person doesn’t care about the cause. They don’t care about privacy or security as John Oliver’s infamous “dick pics” interview with Snowden proved. It’s sad, but true. But if we deliver killer apps, they’ll adopt them in droves and the industry will take off.  The Block.One EOS team also hit on another point that’s killing early projects:  Nobody in the real world will pay microtransactions for everything. It’s insane. They said it best in their talk: “Imagine if you went to Amazon and it costs three cents to load the page. Nobody would do it.”  Exactly.  We need a free tier of transactions in the DecNets of the future. Microtransactions are awesome for things that have actual value. I’ve written and talked about this concept extensively, so it’s awesome to hear others who finally get it!  Speaking of the “decentralized Internet”, which is officially a mainstream term now that it’s the subject of this season’s Silicon Valley, and BlockStack came out of stealth mode with a super-secret decentralized Internet project they’ve been working on for three years. This term is poised to become so overused that it makes eyes roll in the coming years, which is a real shame, because it’s probably the right term.  I read the BlockStack paper with relish. It’s essential to read widely in this field if you want to make an impact in the early days.  The fact is no project will come up with all the ideas to build the internet of tomorrow so I eat up everything that comes out.  There’s zero doubt in my mind that the DecNet will end up as a mashup of multiple projects’ ideas, each of who end up delivering unique pieces of this complicated puzzle. Nobody can think of everything.  The best part of the BlockStack system is storage. It uses any cloud or distributed storage as a dumb backend. It simply encrypts a bunch of files and dumps it into EC2 or Google Compute as a giant blob that the cloud companies can’t decrypt. That’s a brilliant and much needed idea. It returns control of data to users and companies, hides it from the prying eyes of spies and hackers and utilizes robust infrastructure that’s already in place.  Other projects that caught my eye on the infrastructure front were Tezos, QTUM and EOS. EOS sports super high performance, on the level of Visa scale transactions, a la Ripple, free transactions and it has industry heavy hitters behind it.  QTUM sports fantastic branding, a sleek corporate website, and they managed to rack up 11,000 bitcoins in their ICO. That’s a lot of money, 15 million USD at the time, and upwards of 30 million with the continual rocketing rise of Bitcoin (hovering at $2300+ at the time of writing after a huge consortium of Bitcoin power players promised to support SegWit and a 2MB hard fork within six months).  It didn’t hurt that QTUM focused on building bridges between the two largest blockchain communities, Ethereum and Bitcoin. Their pitch is “we support the Ethereum Virtual Machine on the Bitcoin blockchain.” That tag line brought the bitcoins pouring into their hot wallets, shattering previous ICO records. In fact, if you’re looking to raise an eye-popping amount of cash for your project, it doesn’t hurt to fork any of the major projects and bridge them together with a bunch of glue code.  But their project is not all hype.  At the conference they announced a new whitepaper (that I got a sneak peak at ahead of time and that should release soon) as well as code for a governance system to fix the problems that led to the need for a Bitcoin scaling agreement in the first place. The system uses Proof of Stake and allows people to vote on changes which it enforces in the code with smart contracts and a kind of decentralized business rules system. It even has the ability to auto-generate votes so that when the 2MB block they started out with gets saturated it will call a vote to go to 3 or 4MB. That’s awesome.  Tezos is one of those projects that everyone knows about because it has big money behind it. I actually had one conference goer tell me “everyone hates Tezos because it was started by a snooty French mathematician.” Personally, I can’t stand that kind of thinking. I judge each project atomically on its merits. It lives or dies by its ideas for me.  On the down side, they failed to ICO on May 22nd because of a legal snafu. That worked for me though because I was stuck at Consensus and would have missed it anyway. It’s pushed back to June.  This write up of the current state of their code and ideas is a terrific must-read. They’re thinking about things that people are missing right now, like serious security for Proof of Stake. When I was working with the team to design the Cicada Decentralized App Platform concept in the early days of 2015, I hit upon many of the ideas that have come to pass with the modern Proof of Stake 3.0 systems powering coins like PIVX and a myriad of other alt-coins. I didn’t have the proper words for them like signer and witness, but the ideas were very close to what we are seeing in live code today. I ended up disregarding PoS because of the high probability of collusion and because it’s overly complex. I now feel the threats are mitigate-able but I’m worried that too many people have rushed to PoS with understanding the threats.  Tezos gets it.  That’s why they build an “attacker node” that acts like Netflix’s “Chaos Monkey” to constantly try to trick the network, making it stronger. This is an idea that’s taken off in AI as well, called Generative Adversarial Networks. Other projects will rapidly adopt these concepts and that’s a good thing.  Identity Without Authority  The conference also featured some big news on identity. Identity is foundational to the nets of tomorrow.  We need an ID that uniquely identifies everyone and yet paradoxically provides absolute privacy when necessary.  I’ve written a lot on this topic, so it’s one that’s near and dear to my heart. It’s the foundation of the Cicada project. It allows for a novel proof of work that limits everyone to a single miner and drafts them into random pools to secure the network.  Lots of other folks are now working this idea and they’ve united under the Decentralized Identity Foundation. I’m ecstatic to see this come to pass. It brings some serious players to the table and we’re exploring joining the foundation.  Of course, one man’s “decentralized” is another man’s “centralized.” I’ve looked at some of the ideas behind the members of the DIF and a few of them have me very concerned that they don’t really deliver a robust decentralized ecosystem, just a centralized system in sheep’s clothing.  More on that later.  But this is still very early days, so at this point they get the benefit of the doubt and we’ll see what develops.  I think this foundation can do a lot of good in the world because at least 1.5 billion people can’t get an ID. It’s a catch-22. You need an ID to get an ID. In other words you need a piece of paper that says you exist to get another piece of paper that says you exist. That’s literally insane.  The DIF has the opportunity to change all that but they need to be very, very careful that they don’t build a digital tracking system that gives totalitarian regimes the ability to hunt down and discover every single thing their many “enemies of the people” are doing. It’s a tempting for people in power to want to add centralized backdoors and choke points to everything, but when it comes to ID that’s a humanitarian disaster waiting to happen.  Do this wrong and we just built a system to enslave mankind.  Coins, Coins, Everywhere  On to the bit everyone cares about:  What coin will make me the most mulah!?!?  I have no idea. Good luck picking the winners. I have no special insight there.  What I do know is that it seems every single project needs to have a coin these days. This is absurd and needs to stop.  Even projects building a niche part of the Internet of the future are launching their own coins. These coins are useless and won’t generate a cent of value down the line. The industry needs a better way to fund these smaller projects like a decentralized Kickstarter.  For now though, coins are king. ICO fever gripped the conference, as Bitcoin continued to blow gold out of the water. A few other coins generated tremendous bursts, in particular ZCash which doubled from $100 to $200 overnight after JP Morgan announced they’re incorporating the ZCash privacy features into their enterprise blockchain.  I love Zcash but looking under the hood of this announcement tells me that this is not all it’s cracked up to be. I’m highly suspicious of JP Morgan’s motivations here. It seems to me that they and the other banks are already secretly building their own coins.  That is the exact opposite of what we need.  The cryptocoin industry represents an opportunity to break away from banks, or create decentralized banks, but if the banks develop this technology and beat other decentralized coins to building a sound economy around them, then we’re right back where we started, with banks as centralized choke points controlling everything.  Even worse, the Zcash protocol can dial security up or down. It’s like a slider. That means Zcash itself is fine but anything developed by banks will likely include backdoors for spies and regulators. Some will argue this is good because we need regulators but I think it’s a trojan horse to allow the equivalent of web hooks for the spy agencies of the world to track all transactions.  We don’t need a software version of the clipper chip for cash.  Overall, while I expect to see coins continue to proliferate, I’m not sure we need that many more unless they deliver real value.  I see coins as a baked technology.  We have coins to simulate every type of real currency in the world, from gold simulators like Bitcoin, to fast moving anonymous cash simulator currencies like PIVX, ZCash and DASH to everything in between.  What we need now is the digital economy to spend them in.  The Ugly  One thing at the conference had me burning with rage:  Patents.  Companies are trying to snap up patents on ideas that will underpin the basic functionality of the next-gen Internet. Imagine if the founders of the Internet patented TCP/IP and DNS before the net ever got off the ground?  That’s what’s happening right now.  In particular, one of the companies in the Decentralized Identity Foundation seems to have taken the patent everything approach. That company is Civic. Initially I was super excited to meet them when I picked up their flier. I spent about fifteen minutes talking to their team and I came away slightly horrified.  They’re looking to patent an utterly obvious idea that I wrote about and GPLed in Nov of 2016, which is flagging a compromised ID on the blockchain as dead. I wrote that the system could re-enroll a person who’s ID was stolen or compromised or lost and “flag any bit that labels previous biometric data as obsolete/defunct.”  Also, there’s this:  “We must prevent against Identity theft. The simplest way is with a legal system that allows a person to show up at a court and scan their iris and to verify their ownership of a HUID (human unique identifier) in the case of a dispute. If not, the ownership is transferred back to the correct owner through a flag...”  To me, patenting that is the equivalent of patenting SSL.  It’s so clearly necessary as a basic concept to decentralized identity that nobody should try to get exclusive rights to it or they risk destroying the ability to create any system that actually works without paying them a royalty which means the DecNet is screwed.  To be clear, I don’t know their intentions. They could be absolutely altruistic. They could simply be trying to get defensive patents that they would donate to a GPL licensed trust in the DIF but I don’t think that’s their goal. I will follow up to clarify with them.  But make no mistake, patents are the enemy of the next-gen of the net. The infrastructure has to be open source, patent free and agnostic. It’s as simple as that. Sadly I’m not sure we live in that world anymore. The Internet was created in a simpler time.  I’m not against patents in general. They’re absolutely necessary for people who create ideas that matter but in this case I see them as a highly destructive whirlwind gathering out to sea that can obliterate any number of projects in the works.  Worst of all, I talked to a number of folks out there piling up patents.  That breaks my heart because it could wind up absolutely killing this industry before it ever gets off the ground.  Imagine if every open source project starts getting a knock on their door asking for money every time someone conducts a transaction on the blockchain or connects a phone peer to peer?  Again that’s not a world any of us should want to see come to pass.  Conclusion  Consensus 2017 delivered a lot of innovation and a lot of noise. Sifting the two requires patience and an open mind. I have no doubt that I missed countless gold nugget technologies at the conference. There’s just too much to see and do for any one person.  If you spotted a killer technology in the crowd, post about it in the comments. Please try to keep it civil though. You never know which project is going to break out and deliver the system that we so desperately need even if it’s in an imperfect state now.  These are still early days. Coins are baked but the economy to spend them in is still developing and it will take years to come to fruition.  A lawyer from Australia who specializes in blockchain law said it best:  “I want to see something that’s done and working, not a prototype.”  I get it.  We’re just not there yet.  That’s because nobody has fully developed a working, production ready version of the decentralized Internet. There are lots of contenders but nobody ready to take the title and get their names enshrined forever in the hallowed pages of Wikipedia as the founders of Internet 2.0.  But that day is coming soon.  And maybe, just maybe, someone at that conference is already working on it.""",False

The China Information and Communication Research Institute and the People's Government of Guiyang signed a cooperation agreement, Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethernet, signed a memorandum of cooperation with the China Information and Communication Research Institute.  It is understood that, in order to build a platform for the development of global chain-chain technology development, focusing on the key technical issues in the development of block chain, China Information and Communication Research Institute organized the ""Global Chain Chain Technology Development Forum"" project, International influence of the block chain technology exchange platform.  The forum uphold the professional, international, practical principles, will focus on the development of technology, so that more of the chain of chain technology companies to actively participate in the background. At the same time, the organizers of the early and from China, Britain, the United States and other domestic and foreign experts and scholars, and related institutions to conduct in-depth communication and coordination, and promote the international development of the forum.  In addition, the forum will actively promote the practice, to attract more young and outstanding entrepreneurs, engineers, etc. to promote the development of block chain. At present, the forum has been the quantum chain foundation and other 50 global block chain enterprise support, the next step will launch the operating mechanism as soon as possible to promote the global block chain technology exchange integration and development.    2017 Global Chain Chain Technology Development Forum -  Establishment of open source eco - ring power block technology development  ""Block chain technology is open, credible, transparent, can not be tampered with, block chain will change our lives. There must be some relevant support mechanism, the establishment of an open source ecological environment, so that everyone involved ""On May 27th, at 2017, the global chain of chain technology development forum, from the domestic and international chain of experts and experts in the field of industry, the industry chain, On the global block chain technology status, the development trend of the chain chain, such as a warm discussion and dialogue, and reached the above agreement.  Quantum chain senior engineer Xu Xiaolong that the block chain from the birth is a technology with open source gene. Block chain is a trusted to the center of the technology, ""trusted"" ""to the center"" of these two keywords are actually dependent on the way open source. ""If the code is open source, we can work together to maintain the project."" If the code belongs to a company, the company can control the software, but if it is open source, we can work together to maintain the project. Is a way to retreat, it seems that you put their own technology are open to others, but in fact you may gain more. ""Xu Xiaolong said.  Consensys director Brent Xu suggested that open source is the right model for developing block chains. He used the ether square for example, there are many different categories are using tokens technology, individuals can participate in this environment, access to different forms of block chain. This platform brings more opportunities to achieve decentralization. All coders are no longer limited to one vendor, and they participate in development and access in different ways. ""This new infrastructure is the way we run the etherflies, and we want everyone to work together to create a different dynamic and achieve better economic growth,"" says Brent Xu.  Julian Gordon, vice president of Asia Pacific, said Superbook itself is an open source community, an open source project that advances block technology across banking, retail, supply chain, healthcare and manufacturing industries. ""Superbook is a leader in the global chain of chain communities, and we hope that more developers will join our community and continue to grow in open source communities, and that real development should come from the common wisdom of global developers Collection, ""Julian Gordon said.  China Information and Communication Research Institute of Technology and Standards Institute He Baohao, deputy director of the proposed open source has now become the driving force of innovation in the industry, block chain technology open source to provide a win-win situation. ""This is the industry to maximize the benefits of the win-win situation, the need to establish standards as soon as possible, to speed up the standardization of the construction of a reliable chain, reduce costs and help the healthy development of block chain."" He Baohong said.  PricewaterhouseCoopers risk and control services partner Ji Ruihua that the core of the chain chain, including distributed database, encryption algorithm, which is essentially a technology integration, a business model of refining and upgrading. In the open source environment, the block chain technology to develop more. ""For example, a codec, the technical contribution to open to everyone, we put this technology development, mutual learning, communication, in order to truly share the benefits of the block chain."" Ji Ruihua said, to build an open source ecosphere, the value Is not in the sale of software and so on, but on the basis of the basic core to increase the value of the chain to protect the chain to ensure that it really generate more value for the enterprise.  IBM's standards and open source technology director Cheng Haixu also said that if the Internet has changed the way to exchange information, the block chain will change the exchange value. Block chains should not be invested and controlled by an investment, but should be open, so that the whole community to participate, benefit, open source to give more choices. From the ecological point of view, the block chain technology after the open source, everyone together to the ""cake"" bigger, and then share the results together.",False

We have never been about bashing or replacing any cryptocurrency and believe there is room for more than 1 top coin. I personally believe that in the future there will be a few different cryptocurrencies that common people will use, and they will use whichever one is optimized for their use case. So, we might see Byteball being used for microtransactions and timing sensitive use cases, and then Bitcoin used as the standard for international money transfer, and then Qtum used behind the scenes of some mobile apps that use smart contracts on the blockchain without the user even needing to be aware of it.  I think you're right, Turing Completeness for the sake of Turing Completeness is nearly useless for practical smart contracts. The difference for Qtum is that this is a feature from which we build many more features. DGP for instance would not be nearly so powerful of a concept if not for allowing it to be controlled by Turing Complete AI smart contracts. And there are a few other things. We support SPV for smart contract interaction. That doesn't really mean anything by itself, but we are using this to build mobile APIs that will allow developers to easily interact with smart contracts, and suddenly this starts to mean something to consumers and businesses. Features on the blockchain tend to be very abstract and not by itself mean much. It's all about what we do to allow people to easily use and integrate with these features, and how extensible it makes the blockchain",False

And sure, the creators can dump a lot of coins except they'll make a lot more money actually putting out a real product because the Chinese market is that hungry for their own Ethereum.  Either way, all the crap posters dumping on the ICO honestly cost a lot of bitcointalk members a huge opportunity here.  If you sold your ICO Qtums the other day you would have had a 28,000% return, and even with the drop to ~$4.50 we're looking at 15,000% gains.  You can sell a tiny fraction of your holdings and have all the money you put into the ICO back and a free ride to wherever. Luckily I didn't let you guys talk me out of investing in the ICO entirely, but I probably would have invested double what I did if it weren't for all the FUD here.  Of all the ICOs this year this was probably the best investment out of any of them but you guys just want to believe your own FUD, lol.  Keep posting nonsense though, we'll see who's right once the testnet and mainnet go live.  With the huge returns from my Qtum buy it's skyrocketed up to being almost 15% of my crypto holdings even though I put maybe 2% of my holdings into the ICO (the other holdings went up as well so the ratio did not grow by 15x).  But hey, without all the FUD here the ICO might have sold out before I could get in.",False

The UXTO model is much cleaner. They have a lot of previous developers and have already done two previous coins and are the best team I have seen so far.   I won't trust dev that promoting qtum-SCAM.....  I have not looked at qtum's code.  We know the qtum founder and he is one of the largest investors in Skycoin from four years ago, before qtum or any of this. Some of the people around him are legendary scammers, but he is not a scammer.  I think Patricks role in the bitbay situation is exaggerated. I read through the arguments and it just sounds like drama.  Many of the people in the Bitcoin community are sociopaths. They often steal things or cause drama, then immediately blame it or scapegoat it on someone else. They are not even done stealing the money, before they go on campaign of moral indignation against the fall person.  I think Patrick was blamed for Bitbay because his personality makes him an easy victim for sociopaths and the human predators in the bitcoin community. There are people walking around, sizing people up and trying to determine whether they can manipulate someone, setup a scam, steal things and who is going to be gullible or a fall person.  If you knew the people involved, you would understand what the social dynamic is.  >Also how can you be so confident qtum is going to replace ETH based on it's tech when they haven't released code yet?  Ethereum is using an accounts model, like Ripple. Which is anti-blockchain and anti-privacy and very traceable. It is against the philosophy of Bitcoin.  All coins going forward will be on the UXTO model and it is best practice for blockchain. Moving turing complete smart contracts off of accounts model and onto UXTO is extremely important and that is what qtum appears to be doing.  We need to figure out how to do general computation on a UXTO model. Instead of being restrained to the Ripple/Ethereum accounts model.  I think they will get closer to the goal, but only get there part way - thin client for smart contracts (major limitation for existing system) - moving smart contracts onto UXTO (major milestone)  I do not know if qtum has succeeded, but they seem to be going in right direction. I talked to one of their technical leads and they were focused on ""Getting it working with something we can do now"" and then incremental improvement over time. So first implementing the Ethereum virtual machine on top of UXTO, then working out the research problems for a native turing complete UXTO language later.  I do not know if there is a way to full UXTO while still having ""gas"". I think you will need to get rid of the ""gas"". In the ethereum model to take full advantage. I do not know if qtum will be able to go far enough in doing that, but is heading in the correct direction.  Ethereum tries to be both a token and a computer. - we started with pure tokens (Bitcoin) - then we added a computer to the tokens (Ethereum) - now we just trying to figure out how to build  pure computer on UXTO - Then once we have the computer, the tokens or coins just become a program or entity running on this ""distributed computer""  Bitcoin, Ethereum, qtum, byteballs, etc are just stepping stones. Towards a final solution. None of these will exist or be relevant in ten years. We are in an age of transition and I am looking at the projects that are getting closer to the goal, in a pure mathematical sense.  Even Skycoin is being ripped up and its foundations constantly rewritten when it is advantageous to do so. Bitcoin is static and relatively unchanging, while Ethereum has been able to get the community to accept constant small changes.  Skycoin is on a punctuated equilibrium model, where we do bug fixes and polishing, then completely rip up and rebuild the foundation as needed, then go back to bug fixes and polishing.  Right now, we are exploring new networking primitives and the advantage of immutable data structures, but are still on blockchain. Putting EVM on UXTO is heading towards immutable data structures from the perspective of computation, while we are heading towards immutable data structures from the path of consensus, networking and simplifying object synchronization protocols.  One of the pilots that is being spun out of that project is the distibuted, peer-to-peer social media platform built upon immutable data structures and peer-to-peer object replication. For this Skycoin chose a public key, cryptographic publisher/subscriber model and DAG immutable object tree. While Ethereum's project chose a Kadmelia DHT block storage model.  Ignoring the individuals and the drama, I am just looking at the ""future direction"" and who is heading in that direction.  >Also how can you be so confident qtum is going to replace ETH based on it's tech when they haven't released code yet?  I am not confident it will replace Ethereum. At the start, it will be equivalent to ethereum in terms of being able to run the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on top of qtum with UXTO. Then they will do a native language.  It will depend on the implementation. I do not know if qtum has succeeded, but they seem to be going in right direction.  Similarly, Byteballs may fail or may not exist in ten years, but they are pioneering the first experiments into replacing the Blockchain with a DAG. Which we have been considering for several years now.  Similarly, Bitcoin was the first but people are getting used to the idea that it will not be the final or best cryptocurrency. That it was just the first generation and that we can build better and improve it substantially.    thank you skycoin dev, because of you, i brought into qtum and made some money.",False

The UXTO model is much cleaner. They have a lot of previous developers and have already done two previous coins and are the best team I have seen so far.   I won't trust dev that promoting qtum-SCAM.....  I have not looked at qtum's code.  We know the qtum founder and he is one of the largest investors in Skycoin from four years ago, before qtum or any of this. Some of the people around him are legendary scammers, but he is not a scammer.  I think Patricks role in the bitbay situation is exaggerated. I read through the arguments and it just sounds like drama.  Many of the people in the Bitcoin community are sociopaths. They often steal things or cause drama, then immediately blame it or scapegoat it on someone else. They are not even done stealing the money, before they go on campaign of moral indignation against the fall person.  I think Patrick was blamed for Bitbay because his personality makes him an easy victim for sociopaths and the human predators in the bitcoin community. There are people walking around, sizing people up and trying to determine whether they can manipulate someone, setup a scam, steal things and who is going to be gullible or a fall person.  If you knew the people involved, you would understand what the social dynamic is.  >Also how can you be so confident qtum is going to replace ETH based on it's tech when they haven't released code yet?  Ethereum is using an accounts model, like Ripple. Which is anti-blockchain and anti-privacy and very traceable. It is against the philosophy of Bitcoin.  All coins going forward will be on the UXTO model and it is best practice for blockchain. Moving turing complete smart contracts off of accounts model and onto UXTO is extremely important and that is what qtum appears to be doing.  We need to figure out how to do general computation on a UXTO model. Instead of being restrained to the Ripple/Ethereum accounts model.  I think they will get closer to the goal, but only get there part way - thin client for smart contracts (major limitation for existing system) - moving smart contracts onto UXTO (major milestone)  I do not know if qtum has succeeded, but they seem to be going in right direction. I talked to one of their technical leads and they were focused on ""Getting it working with something we can do now"" and then incremental improvement over time. So first implementing the Ethereum virtual machine on top of UXTO, then working out the research problems for a native turing complete UXTO language later.  I do not know if there is a way to full UXTO while still having ""gas"". I think you will need to get rid of the ""gas"". In the ethereum model to take full advantage. I do not know if qtum will be able to go far enough in doing that, but is heading in the correct direction.  Ethereum tries to be both a token and a computer. - we started with pure tokens (Bitcoin) - then we added a computer to the tokens (Ethereum) - now we just trying to figure out how to build  pure computer on UXTO - Then once we have the computer, the tokens or coins just become a program or entity running on this ""distributed computer""  Bitcoin, Ethereum, qtum, byteballs, etc are just stepping stones. Towards a final solution. None of these will exist or be relevant in ten years. We are in an age of transition and I am looking at the projects that are getting closer to the goal, in a pure mathematical sense.  Even Skycoin is being ripped up and its foundations constantly rewritten when it is advantageous to do so. Bitcoin is static and relatively unchanging, while Ethereum has been able to get the community to accept constant small changes.  Skycoin is on a punctuated equilibrium model, where we do bug fixes and polishing, then completely rip up and rebuild the foundation as needed, then go back to bug fixes and polishing.  Right now, we are exploring new networking primitives and the advantage of immutable data structures, but are still on blockchain. Putting EVM on UXTO is heading towards immutable data structures from the perspective of computation, while we are heading towards immutable data structures from the path of consensus, networking and simplifying object synchronization protocols.  One of the pilots that is being spun out of that project is the distibuted, peer-to-peer social media platform built upon immutable data structures and peer-to-peer object replication. For this Skycoin chose a public key, cryptographic publisher/subscriber model and DAG immutable object tree. While Ethereum's project chose a Kadmelia DHT block storage model.  Ignoring the individuals and the drama, I am just looking at the ""future direction"" and who is heading in that direction.  >Also how can you be so confident qtum is going to replace ETH based on it's tech when they haven't released code yet?  I am not confident it will replace Ethereum. At the start, it will be equivalent to ethereum in terms of being able to run the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on top of qtum with UXTO. Then they will do a native language.  It will depend on the implementation. I do not know if qtum has succeeded, but they seem to be going in right direction.  Similarly, Byteballs may fail or may not exist in ten years, but they are pioneering the first experiments into replacing the Blockchain with a DAG. Which we have been considering for several years now.  Similarly, Bitcoin was the first but people are getting used to the idea that it will not be the final or best cryptocurrency. That it was just the first generation and that we can build better and improve it substantially.    thank you skycoin dev, because of you, i brought into qtum and made some money.",False

Sometimes ambitiously referring to itself as ""China's Ethereum,"" the project recently raised $15 million in three days through a successful crowdsale or ""Initial Coin Offering"" (ICO). On a technical level, the Qtum blockchain will resemble Bitcoin, but will integrate an Ethereum-like Virtual Machine on top for smart contracting purposes. Additionally, Qtum is in the process of implementing a ""Decentralized Governance Protocol"" ( DGP ). This DGP will have smart contracts determine the blockchain's parameter selection, like its block size limit.  Jordan Earls, also known as ""earlz"" online, is the co-founder and lead developer of Qtum.   ""We believe this will allow for Qtum to be the first self-modifiable, self-regulating and ultimately self-aware blockchain,"" he told Bitcoin Magazine .   The Concept Any blockchain has a number of parameters. In Bitcoin, this of course includes the 1 megabyte block size limit. But it also includes the block reward (currently 12.5), the block interval time (ten minutes) and more. These and three other parameters apply to Qtum as well.  But there are two basic problems with needing to have these parameters. First, they are very hard to get ""right,"" in so far as that's even possible, since different parameters benefit different use cases. And second, in a decentralized system, these parameters can be very hard to change.  ""The core rationale and problem we had when designing this is that we will release Qtum with some initial parameters that we try to make perfect,"" Earls told Bitcoin Magazine . ""But we don't know what the ecosystem will look like one month after release, much less one year. So, we designed DGP. That way, we can tune the blockchain to be as usable and secure as possible without needing to fork, just to change a simple number from 1 to 2.""  Qtum plans to realize this way of ""tuning the blockchain"" by doing what it does best: The DGP will consist of relatively straightforward smart contracts made up of blockchain-readable pieces of executable code.  ""We have open-source smart contracts which implement the rules for changing the parameters, which will then be accepted by all nodes. It implements a fairly simple governance system of 'user keys' and 'admin keys.' There is a modifiable parameter in the contract which determines how many keys of each type must vote in order to approve a change to, say, the block size limit.""  Importantly, through the use of smart contracts, these keys can actually represent more than just a regular user per key: Each key can represent a defined group.  ""Perhaps one key represents a majority of hash power; or a key represents coin votes by coin holders; or a key acts according to a dynamic limit based on how full blocks are. Or even oracles: a key can effectively be controlled by people or servers that act based on input not directly readable by the blockchain itself, like USD market price for transaction fees. It's extremely flexible.""  Qtum will almost certainly include smart contracts for the block size limit, the gas schedule to determine the price of different smart contract operations (for which Ethereum hard forked several times) and the minimum gas price. Additionally, it might deploy smart contracts for block interval times, block rewards, maximum gas per block and maximum script size or signature operations per transaction or block.  Changing the Rules Embedding the parameter selection in smart contracts is clever and having all node software adjust accordingly even more so. However, an arguably even harder problem is not so much what parameter is decided on, but who gets to decide in the first place and how.  In Qtum, the initial parameters will be set by the developers based on their testing and measurements.  ""For instance, we've already determined that a block size of 2 megabytes should be reasonable,"" Earls said.  After that, the initial set of rules to define the parameters can be changed themselves within the rules of the system, too.  A smart contract could, for example, start out relatively simple: It requires a majority of core developers to change the rules of the contract. Then, if a majority of core developers decides that instead of just developers, it should also include a majority of coin holders, the contract can be changed to a two-of-two multisig contract. From that moment on, one key would represent the developers, while the other key would represent the majority of coin holders. Next, if both developers and coin holders agree, hash power can have a seat at the table, too, and so forth.  As such, Qtum smart contracts can change not only the parameters of the system, but also how the parameters themselves can be changed.  That said, as Earls acknowledged, the Decentralized Governance Protocol can't actually solve all governance problems. It's specifically designed to make certain predefined parameters more easily adjustable, and it can indeed even change how these parameters can be adjusted to some extent.  But the Decentralized Governance Protocol does not and cannot apply to network rules that aren't among these predefined parameters. Protocol changes outside of these specific parameters would still require a typical upgrade mechanism, like a hard fork or a soft fork.  ""I believe if Bitcoin had DGP technology, then we would still see all this fighting about SegWit vs Bitcoin Unlimited, etcetera,"" Earls acknowledged. ""But, DGP would have been used in the meantime to increase the block size to something conservative but reasonable like 2 megabytes or 4 megabytes, to avoid all the transaction speed problems. Meanwhile, the developers and community could figure out a more permanent solution.""

Sometimes ambitiously referring to itself as “China’s Ethereum,” the project recently raised $15 million in three days through a successful crowdsale or “Initial Coin Offering” (ICO).  On a technical level, the Qtum blockchain will resemble Bitcoin, but will integrate an Ethereum-like Virtual Machine on top for smart contracting purposes. Additionally, Qtum is in the process of implementing a “Decentralized Governance Protocol” (DGP). This DGP will have smart contracts determine the blockchain’s parameter selection, like its block size limit.  Jordan Earls, also known as “earlz” online, is the co-founder and lead developer of Qtum.  “We believe this will allow for Qtum to be the first self-modifiable, self-regulating and ultimately self-aware blockchain,” he told Bitcoin Magazine.  The Concept  Any blockchain has a number of parameters. In Bitcoin, this of course includes the 1 megabyte block size limit. But it also includes the block reward (currently 12.5), the block interval time (ten minutes) and more. These and three other parameters apply to Qtum as well.  But there are two basic problems with needing to have these parameters. First, they are very hard to get “right,” in so far as that’s even possible, since different parameters benefit different use cases. And second, in a decentralized system, these parameters can be very hard to change.  “The core rationale and problem we had when designing this is that we will release Qtum with some initial parameters that we try to make perfect,” Earls told Bitcoin Magazine. “But we don't know what the ecosystem will look like one month after release, much less one year. So, we designed DGP. That way, we can tune the blockchain to be as usable and secure as possible without needing to fork, just to change a simple number from 1 to 2.”  Qtum plans to realize this way of “tuning the blockchain” by doing what it does best: The DGP will consist of relatively straightforward smart contracts made up of blockchain-readable pieces of executable code.  “We have open-source smart contracts which implement the rules for changing the parameters, which will then be accepted by all nodes. It implements a fairly simple governance system of ‘user keys’ and ‘admin keys.’ There is a modifiable parameter in the contract which determines how many keys of each type must vote in order to approve a change to, say, the block size limit.”  Importantly, through the use of smart contracts, these keys can actually represent more than just a regular user per key: Each key can represent a defined group.  “Perhaps one key represents a majority of hash power; or a key represents coin votes by coin holders; or a key acts according to a dynamic limit based on how full blocks are. Or even oracles: a key can effectively be controlled by people or servers that act based on input not directly readable by the blockchain itself, like USD market price for transaction fees. It’s extremely flexible.”  Qtum will almost certainly include smart contracts for the block size limit, the gas schedule to determine the price of different smart contract operations (for which Ethereum hard forked several times) and the minimum gas price. Additionally, it might deploy smart contracts for block interval times, block rewards, maximum gas per block and maximum script size or signature operations per transaction or block. Changing the Rules  Embedding the parameter selection in smart contracts is clever and having all node software adjust accordingly even more so. However, an arguably even harder problem is not so much what parameter is decided on, but who gets to decide in the first place and how.  In Qtum, the initial parameters will be set by the developers based on their testing and measurements.  “For instance, we've already determined that a block size of 2 megabytes should be reasonable,” Earls said.  After that, the initial set of rules to define the parameters can be changed themselves within the rules of the system, too.  A smart contract could, for example, start out relatively simple: It requires a majority of core developers to change the rules of the contract. Then, if a majority of core developers decides that instead of just developers, it should also include a majority of coin holders, the contract can be changed to a two-of-two multisig contract. From that moment on, one key would represent the developers, while the other key would represent the majority of coin holders. Next, if both developers and coin holders agree, hash power can have a seat at the table, too, and so forth.  As such, Qtum smart contracts can change not only the parameters of the system, but also how the parameters themselves can be changed.  That said, as Earls acknowledged, the Decentralized Governance Protocol can’t actually solve all governance problems. It’s specifically designed to make certain predefined parameters more easily adjustable, and it can indeed even change how these parameters can be adjusted to some extent.  But the Decentralized Governance Protocol does not and cannot apply to network rules that aren’t among these predefined parameters. Protocol changes outside of these specific parameters would still require a typical upgrade mechanism, like a hard fork or a soft fork.  “I believe if Bitcoin had DGP technology, then we would still see all this fighting about SegWit vs Bitcoin Unlimited, etcetera,” Earls acknowledged. “But, DGP would have been used in the meantime to increase the block size to something conservative but reasonable like 2 megabytes or 4 megabytes, to avoid all the transaction speed problems. Meanwhile, the developers and community could figure out a more permanent solution.”",False

I got sent pdfs in secret(they had a mole in the group), was shown fake profiles that got hacked by some people proving the propaganda campaign. It was seriously a rabbit hole. To this day, it still kind of humbles me. Their modus operandi was similar to JTRIG. Man, to be honest I don't mean to bring up the past but its true(I don't live in the past, every once in a while I'm candid). I don't think buying into your ICO is illegal per se but the website they set up was wrong because they lied about the funds release schedule and mocked me knowing that when I said something the project would crash. So that would constitute as fraud but extremely hard to prosecute. To add insult to injury, Bob would come by every few months to make fun of the investors he stole from. So Dai is lower than dirt to me. I tried to pursuade him to help and he was very blahzay and eventually just ignored me even when I tried to be NICE when it was eating me inside. I'm certain Qtum was pumped. Knowing that last time Dai partnered with Chinese exchanges like BTER who stole funds from users on so many occasions(millions they still owe me almost 3 btc). Qtum funded in ""90 minutes"" what does that tell you? Lol... and that was while Gleb was bombarding this thread. No way they funded what they claimed unless his rich chinese friends wanted free coins or something. Same Modus Operandi with just bigger numbers.  We all think Dai sold his Bitbay because he admitted it on the slack when I confronted him saying it ""wasn't worth anything"". But it was worth something to investors who didn't want to be dumped on. It shows how much contempt this dude had for us(he certainly didn't tell me while he was dumping). If you ask Dai directly I doubt he will give you a straight answer that is cogent.   Ironically, I'm not saying Qtum won't be a success. They very well may put contracts in UTXO which is in fact a better way to do it. I've often chastised Ethereum for bloating up the blockchain and it is true in fact, I think I might have even talked to Dai about this idea in the past that it is cleaner to do it that way. You just pay a hash, send a payload and sandbox it. It's not actually that hard. Ethereum is over-engineered in my opinion and will have 10x the scaling issue as Bitcoin or even Qtum and to be honest Ethereum is much more greedy and potentially have back door deals that would shock us.  I'm not here to take away from anyone's efforts, I've got better things to do like CODE. But let investors never forget this guy did leave with investors funds that he didn't work for, dumped his coins etc. There is NO FREE LUNCH in life. God knows how many times some CEO bankrupts his own business keeps investors funds and never sees bars (possibly Trump for example? haha). White collar crime isn't taken seriously which is why everyone wants to destroy wall street. Sadly, if investors don't get smarter, the process will repeat itself. So take this text for what its worth. BitBay has made tremendous progress and of course the peg will finish.  But maybe the guy is right, investors don't care who this guy is, they just want to make money. Still, I would never invest regardless even if they crapped gold bars. But thats my personal opinion perhaps many investors simply don't care. The ones that do, will listen carefully.",False

In general, Denial of Service (DoS) and Sybil attacks against these approaches (performed at the network and/or consensus protocol levels) are possible. A DoS attack is an explicit attempt to disrupt the normal operation of the blockchain network by sending lots of data to its nodes (for example, by sending many transactions of low value so the system cannot process normal transactions). In a Sybil attack the normal operation of the network is subverted by a malicious adversary that creates and controls a many misbehaving nodes (which could appear as belonging to different participants).  Miners' default behaviour in PoW consensus is to immediately announce to the network each new found block. In selfish mining attacks, a misbehaving miner attempts to waste computational resources of other miners, as follows. When the malicious miner finds a valid block he temporarily withholds it and continues mining on top of it, trying to find more blocks before the other miners even find one; and when another miner finds a valid block, the attacker announces the blocks he was withholding. Even if for some researches , this attack vector could be in practice very unlikely, as mentioned in section IV.D, there are cases where miners could be motivated to carry out a slight variant of this attack, where valid blocks are selectively discarded in order to modify the result of a stochastic procedure in which there is much at stake.  In a short-range attack the attacker, controlling certain percentage of the resources used to secure the system (e.g., computational resources or cryptocurrency stake) performs a transaction (e.g., to spend coins or to execute a step of a contract) and then tries to reverse it (e.g., to make a double-spending, that is, successfully spending some of the cryptocurrency coins more than once) as follows. After the attacker submits to the network the transaction he aims to revert, he starts mining a blockchain fork (from the previous block) in which that transaction is not included, without publishing it until that transaction has at least a certain number n of confirmations. If by then the attacker achieved to mine (mint) more than n blocks in his blockchain fork, he publishes it, and being this the longest chain it is accepted as the new valid blockchain by the network; therefore, the transaction in question is reversed.  In a long-range attack the attacker (controlling a certain percentage of the resources used to secure the system) starts mining a blockchain fork from many blocks back or even from the very first (genesis) block; aiming to obtain block rewards and/or to reverse a transaction. This attack would be possible in systems based on PoS consensus, given that although the attacker may only own a small percentage of all coins (at the point of the fork), in his blockchain fork he is able to move his coins freely, which allows him to solve the computational puzzle to mint blocks much more easily, and therefore, to rapidly build a longer blockchain.  A coin-age accumulation attack could be possible in approaches based on PoS where the coin-age is used to compute a measure of nodes' stakes, the total consumed coin-age determines the valid blockchain, and the coin-age of an unspent transaction output (UTXO) is computed as its value multiplied by the number of blocks elapsed since it was created (e.g., Peercoin as will be seen later in this section). In this case, the attacker would split the coins he owns (a high enough percentage of all coins) into multiple UTXOs and wait until his stake becomes several times the average. Then, after that, the attacker would be able to mint several blocks in a row with a high probability, allowing him to fork the blockchain and reverse transactions (e.g., to make a double-spending).  In PoS consensus the solution to the puzzle necessary to mint a given block depends on the previous block's hash. Then, an attacker (with enough computation resources and stake) minting at height h of the blockchain could try to influence the hash of the current block (by selectively modifying its set of transactions) in a trial and error process until he is able to mint the block at height h+1. This is known as a pre-computation-attack and it could be done recursively in order to build several blocks in a row, to obtain the corresponding block rewards and/or perform a double-spend attack.

Thinking about anonymous Bitcoin hero, Satoshi Nakamoto and his colorfully diverse followership, the People’s Republic’s central planners are not the first to come to one's mind. In light of this, Beijing’s decision from earlier this year to include Blockchain technologies in the Communist Government’s upcoming 5 year plan, might have struck many as surreal.  On the ground however, the numbers tell a much less ambiguous story. With $10 Billion flooding the country’s fintech sector alone, China moved in 2016 to the third place globally in Blockchain investments. The PBC, China’s Central Bank, is actively endorsing this tendency and is investing ""significant resources"" in the technology while encouraging the Republic’s financial sector to investigate blockchains with the goal of increasing transparency and countering fraud.  Better known for their tendency towards pragmatism and efficiency than for their love for decentralization and libertarian ideals, China’s economic stewardship has reasons of its own to pursue a leading role in the crypto industry. Namely, China simply believes that blockchains are a reasonable method to digitize trade. This cautious and down-to-earth attitude of the country’s leadership seems to have its impact on the local entrepreneurial scene. Leading Chinese blockchain projects put much less emphasis on the somewhat revolutionary rhetoric we are used to from their Western colleagues, and don’t shy away from making their platforms suitable for a world in which government regulations and know-your-customer rules are a given fact.  One company, Metaverse, has made this Zeitgeist into its official mission statement. Proposing a blockchain environment in which people, organizations, and governments can transact with each other, using digital identities and verifying agents, Metaverse chooses a tone very different from most projects of its kind.  In an interview from late 2016, the company’s CEO and founder, Eric GU, stated that ""at Metaverse, we don’t believe that the blockchain will get rid of middlemen. [...] Ultimately, we should respect them. Many blockchain projects want to get rid of middlemen. Metaverse celebrates them, governments, organizations, people, professionals. They have a critical role to play in identity and reputation.""  While western projects struggle to make peace between their adherence to absolute decentralization and anonymity and the need to interface with a global economy, requiring regulatory checks and balances, their Chinese competitors are much more interested in making the blockchain business ready as soon as possible. This attitude, albeit less trendy among the community followership, has recently generated a great deal of interest among global institutional investors and very often dictates the problems these teams try to solve.  The Antshares project’s goal, for example, is to allow for the digitalization of real-world financial assets, such as shares and securities. The idea behind Antshares is not to create yet another crypto market for tokens, essentially devoid of any real-world backing, but rather to create a cryptographic platform on which shares, bonds and other highly regulated securities, backed by corporate profits and liabilities, can be traded.  This, very often, also has technological implications. Antshares chose the dBFT consensus mechanism for its blockchain, making it so that the system is secured against potential forking events and allows for transaction volumes comparable to those of centralized clearing systems such as Visa and the like - A choice until now made only by highly institutionalized western projects such as hyperledger.  Another example of China’s unique take on the blockchain resulting in interesting technological vectors is the Qtum project. Qtum, pronounced ""Quantum"", is a turing-complete smart contract blockchain, combining its own version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine with a Bitcoin blockchain. The result is a blockchain stack, able to execute ethereum-like smart contracts in mobile environments such as Smartphones, Tablets and IoT devices, which the company’s leadership recognized as the most necessary feature for corporate and government blockchain adoption.  Furthermore, Qtum plans to incorporate a smart contract template hub in its service, which will make it easy to write financial applications which adhere to commercial rules and regulations and which utilize digital identities.  In the light of this, the People’s Bank of China Vice Governor Fan Yifei’s statement, urging central banks across the globe to ""lead on digital currency development"", should come as no surprise. ""The conditions are ripe for digital currencies"" Fan wrote in a guest article for Bloomberg, claiming that cryptocurrencies ""can reduce operating costs, increase efficiency and enable a wide range of new applications.""  In his article, Fan also claimed that government regulation can remedy many of the current shortcomings of cryptocurrencies, such as unstable value, weak credibility and lack of acceptance. A cryptographic legal tender, argues Fan, holds the potential of combining the advantages of current and alternative currency systems.

It's obvious to anyone with a brain that you're more knowledgeable in this space than he will ever be.  I bought some tokens in the qtum ICO on a whim, without looking too deep in the Bitbay thing.  Had I known, I probably would have reconsidered.   Would you say that Dai created the Bitpay project originally with the intention to scam though? It seems to me that this was a case of an arrangement gone bad, and Dai grabbing whatever he could get his hands on (regardless of whether he was entitled to it) and running for the door when he realized that the building was on fire.  Pumping the ICO reimbursing himself is shady as hell, but with the lack of regulation in the crypto market was it legally wrong?  Technically ICO funds are supposed to be at the disposal of the founding team, and he is apart of that team.  In any case i'm not sure that Qtum was even pumped.  The speed at which they raised the funds looked shady at first, but when you consider that TKN ICOd after and raised the same amount of money in under 30 minutes, then they could have easily reached 15m without any pump.  I think it's more of a sign that we're entering a bubble and people are eager to throw $ around.  I feel for what happened to you man.  You got put in a crappy situation by some shitty individuals who took advantage of your good nature and talent.  It looks like you've put in an incredible amount of work as the solo developer and I hope your project pans out to be a great success.  It sucks though if Dai still holds 10% of all bay like you say then him profiting off your blood & sweat is definitely a double edge sword. ",False

I'll take that price for sure, in fact I'm gonna offer a deal good for all bitcointalk members right now, you can buy out my rights to my Qtum that I bought in the ICO for 1.5ETH per token.  Act fast before it goes up!  Anyways, in all seriousness it could be worth more than ETH someday but for that to occur they need to actually start with baby steps and release working software first.  I think if it really does work and people start to see the advantages of the UXTO model and SPV as well as truly mobile dapps that don't require an intermediary then Qtum may become very valuable.  Of course the pump that's going to go on if the altcoin bubble is still ongoing when mainnet goes live will be crazy too, but that's not really a long term kind of thing.

The UXTO model is a safe difference, I assume. Qtum has an early advantage over ETH on these development... I hope they keep them and continue to push further.

Qtum support segregate witness by default and very easily to support lighting network and more BIPs in the future （like Zcash protocol integration）  also not like Ethereum, all Ethereum transactions go through EVM, it's very inefficient.  in Qtum, since based on UTXO model, only contact transactions go through EVM, normal transactions will like BTC transactions.  that's a big advantage of stateless UTXO model, more secure and more scalable in the long term.  but do not hope people understand the design and meaning of Qtum, until they see price is more than 10$ in 1 year.  this post will help to understand the meaning of Qtum too.  Quote from: onetwo12 on April 15, 2017, 03:37:01 PM From skycoin dev: Why Qtum may become a big success https://forum.qtum.org/topic/64/from-skycoin-dev-why-qtum-may-become-a-big-success https://qtum.org Qtum, will probably replace ethereum because it is simpler and has fewer problems. The UXTO model is much cleaner. They have a lot of previous developers and have already done two previous coins and are the best team I have seen so far.   I have not looked at qtum's code.  We know the qtum founder and he is one of the largest investors in Skycoin from four years ago, before qtum or any of this. Some of the people around him are legendary scammers, but he is not a scammer.  I think Patricks role in the bitbay situation is exaggerated. I read through the arguments and it just sounds like drama.  Many of the people in the Bitcoin community are sociopaths. They often steal things or cause drama, then immediately blame it or scapegoat it on someone else. They are not even done stealing the money, before they go on campaign of moral indignation against the fall person.  I think Patrick was blamed for Bitbay because his personality makes him an easy victim for sociopaths and the human predators in the bitcoin community. There are people walking around, sizing people up and trying to determine whether they can manipulate someone, setup a scam, steal things and who is going to be gullible or a fall person.  If you knew the people involved, you would understand what the social dynamic is.  Also how can you be so confident qtum is going to replace ETH based on it's tech when they haven't released code yet? Ethereum is using an accounts model, like Ripple. Which is anti-blockchain and anti-privacy and very traceable. It is against the philosophy of Bitcoin.  All coins going forward will be on the UXTO model and it is best practice for blockchain. Moving turing complete smart contracts off of accounts model and onto UXTO is extremely important and that is what qtum appears to be doing.  We need to figure out how to do general computation on a UXTO model. Instead of being restrained to the Ripple/Ethereum accounts model.  I think they will get closer to the goal, but only get there part way  thin client for smart contracts (major limitation for existing system) moving smart contracts onto UXTO (major milestone) I do not know if qtum has succeeded, but they seem to be going in right direction. I talked to one of their technical leads and they were focused on ""Getting it working with something we can do now"" and then incremental improvement over time. So first implementing the Ethereum virtual machine on top of UXTO, then working out the research problems for a native turing complete UXTO language later.  I do not know if there is a way to full UXTO while still having ""gas"". I think you will need to get rid of the ""gas"". In the ethereum model to take full advantage. I do not know if qtum will be able to go far enough in doing that, but is heading in the correct direction.  Ethereum tries to be both a token and a computer.  we started with pure tokens (Bitcoin) then we added a computer to the tokens (Ethereum) now we just trying to figure out how to build pure computer on UXTO Then once we have the computer, the tokens or coins just become a program or entity running on this ""distributed computer"" Bitcoin, Ethereum, qtum, byteballs, etc are just stepping stones. Towards a final solution. None of these will exist or be relevant in ten years. We are in an age of transition and I am looking at the projects that are getting closer to the goal, in a pure mathematical sense.  Even Skycoin is being ripped up and its foundations constantly rewritten when it is advantageous to do so. Bitcoin is static and relatively unchanging, while Ethereum has been able to get the community to accept constant small changes.  Skycoin is on a punctuated equilibrium model, where we do bug fixes and polishing, then completely rip up and rebuild the foundation as needed, then go back to bug fixes and polishing.  Right now, we are exploring new networking primitives and the advantage of immutable data structures, but are still on blockchain. Putting EVM on UXTO is heading towards immutable data structures from the perspective of computation, while we are heading towards immutable data structures from the path of consensus, networking and simplifying object synchronization protocols.  One of the pilots that is being spun out of that project is the distibuted, peer-to-peer social media platform built upon immutable data structures and peer-to-peer object replication. For this Skycoin chose a public key, cryptographic publisher/subscriber model and DAG immutable object tree. While Ethereum's project chose a Kadmelia DHT block storage model.  Ignoring the individuals and the drama, I am just looking at the ""future direction"" and who is heading in that direction.  Also how can you be so confident qtum is going to replace ETH based on it's tech when they haven't released code yet? I am not confident it will replace Ethereum. At the start, it will be equivalent to ethereum in terms of being able to run the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on top of qtum with UXTO. Then they will do a native language.  It will depend on the implementation. I do not know if qtum has succeeded, but they seem to be going in right direction.  Similarly, Byteballs may fail or may not exist in ten years, but they are pioneering the first experiments into replacing the Blockchain with a DAG. Which we have been considering for several years now.  Similarly, Bitcoin was the first but people are getting used to the idea that it will not be the final or best cryptocurrency. That it was just the first generation and that we can build better and improve it substantially.",False

The script signature cache has been reimplemented as a “cuckoo cache”, allowing for more signatures to be cached and faster lookups. Assumed-valid blocks have been introduced which allows script validation to be skipped for ancestors of known-good blocks, without changing the security model. In some cases, compact blocks are now relayed before being fully validated as per BIP152. P2P networking has been refactored with a focus on concurrency and throughput. Network operations are no longer bottlenecked by validation. As a result, block fetching is several times faster than previous releases in many cases. The UTXO cache now claims unused mempool memory. This speeds up initial block download as UTXO lookups are a major bottleneck there, and there is no use for the mempool at that stage.    Because the target block time will be 120 seconds with Qtum Core, we won't have all those blocks that have no transactions in them, but it will be fast enough to avoid the issue that Bitcoin is currently having. Bundle SegWit into the equation, and yes, Qtum will be very efficient.",False

Agrello announced that it is going to use the Qtum’s blockchain platform as a base for its AI powered smart contract interface. The company unveiled the decision at the Qtum meetup in Shanghai.  Agrello’s interface lets users without any legal or coding to manage and automate smart agreements, which are stored as smart contracts on the Qtum blockchain, as well as translated into legally biding documents in natural English. The interface corresponds with Qtum’s Smart Contract Lifecycle Management solution which offers a workflow to derive smart contract code from human-readable contracts and manage them in real time.  The company’s platform will enable businesses and individuals to substitute standard paper agreements with smart contracts, which was considered impossible until now because of the complexity of smart contract technology.  In March, the Qtum project raised $15.6 million in a first five days of its token crowdsale, thus joining the list of top 10 blockchain-token crowdsale campaigns. Moreover, the startup received support of PwC, which has a wide expertise across different sectors. The professional services provider not only helped Qtum to prepare its white paper, but provided help in setting up the project’s governance model, project management, and risk management. The startup plans to make its platform available for public use in Q3 this year.  “We’ve been searching for over a year to find a blockchain platform that would fit our needs. Qtum allows us to build a mobile-compatible and scalable smart contract solution, and hence is our technology of choice,” said Hando Rand, co-founder and CEO of Agrello.  Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, co-founder and CEO of Qtum, Patrick Das, encouraged more companies to develop their solutions using the startup’s blockchain technology. “Qtum aims to build the first POS smart contract platform that is mobile supported; we welcome more and more startups to build applications on Qtum platform in the future,” he said.  Over the last year, some states in the US have passed regulations defining the status of blockchain-based smart contracts. Last year, Vermont passed a law which states that a blockchain digital record is considered a business record under the Vermont Rules of Evidence.  Earlier this year, Arizona representative Jeff Weninger proposed a bill to make smart agreements built on blockchain legal. The state’s law defines smart contracts as an “event driven program, with state, that runs on a distributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger that can take custody over and instruct transfer of assets on that ledger.”  https://www.agrello.org/",False

Initially, I was really suspicious of its ability to influence our real life – why would anyone accept a currency without backing? But due to my curiosity about new technology, I decided to purchase some bitcoins and play around the bitcoin wallet on my cellphone. At the first glance, it may look similar to normal payment apps we use like Alipay or Paypal. However, as I spent more time reading and researching about bitcoin and its underlying technology, the blockchain, I found that the way Bitcoin network works was nothing like any payment platform or Internet service we had been using.  In our current online payment system, the transaction you make needs to be processed by the service provider and then settled by banks in order to prevent the double-spending risk. Therefore, you are just transferring instructions or information to the service provider to initiate the transaction. However, in the bitcoin network, you are able to directly transfer value without the involvement of any central authorities (e.g. banks) or intermediaries (e.g. payment service providers), which was made realized by the blockchain technology’s cryptography and the consensus mechanism. The only other scenario people are able to do this is that you physically hand over cash to another person. In addition, you maintain 100% ownership of bitcoins in your wallet as long as you hold on to the private key, and if you lose the private key your bitcoins will be gone forever (sounds familiar? it works exactly same as the physical wallet we use every day).  In 2016, the discussion about blockchain's enormous potential to revolutionize business practices as we know them came to the peak hype. And I realize that it might be a good fit for me to do a deep dive with my experiences in cybersecurity and PKI security.  Working in the Startup  When I returned Shanghai from my two years international assignment, I was lucky that I got the opportunity to work with a blockchain startup - Qtum Foundation. I was excited and uncertain because I had never worked with a startup company. My role in Qtum Foundation is to assist the founder with project management, bring industry experiences into the project vision and use cases and advise the project to be professional and organized. At first, I didn't feel very comfortable about the way how startups work. Here you don't have orderly calendar schedule, strict meeting agenda, clear segregation of duties, and the plan can be changed in the next minute. So I tried to adapt myself to the new environment and step out of my comfort zone. Through this process, I noticed that the entrepreneurship was growing in me. Here you do not have predefined protocols to follow and you need to do whatever it takes to keep moving things forward and make things happen, let alone working in such an immature industry. The team is passionate about the value that the blockchain technology can bring to the business world. When working with them you can feel the cohesiveness brought by the passion for the technology. In achieving a key project milestone recently, I worked with various external parties such as investors, business partners, lawyers, and PR firms. As a result, I learned that in such an emerging industry you had to be open-minded, creative and constantly brainstorming to explore opportunities to work together. That also allows me to build the network in this community, and I had the chance to know blockchain pioneers in the fields of blockchain project founders, developers, marketing, legal and cryptocurrency exchange. One thing I found common in them is that everyone strives to contribute and find his or her value proposition in this cause. The experience will definitely benefit me in my future career, giving me the courage and confidence to be innovative and keep exploring new opportunities.  Qtum Blockchain  Blockchain technology is much broader than just bitcoin. The sustained levels of robust security achieved by public cryptocurrencies have demonstrated to the world that this new wave of blockchain technologies can provide efficiencies and intangible technological benefits very similar to what the Internet has done. But it was not until smart contracts got associated with blockchain people started realizing how powerful this technology could be. The smart contract is a term used to describe computer program code that is capable of facilitating, executing, and enforcing the negotiation or performance of an agreement (i.e. contract) using blockchain technology. Ethereum, the de-facto leading smart-contract system, has attracted lots of developers and organizations to create distributed applications (dApps) for business use on its platform. But why it has not yet achieved broad industry adoption? Qtum team thinks they found the root cause and decided to build a new public blockchain platform (Qtum blockchain) with features designed for business adoption. Based on Qtum’s project vision, Qtum is aiming to build a Proof of Stake (PoS) based smart contract platform that is executable on mobile devices.  Proof of Stake (PoS) Smart Contract Platform The Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism used in public blockchains requires huge energy consumption. The PoW transaction validation diminishes scalability to the point where existing smart contract platforms are considered to not be feasible for massive industry applications. Organizations would not risk running their applications on a platform of which the mining power might be controlled by limited groups of people, and also maintaining significant mining power is not cost effective. On the other hand, PoS consensus mechanism which determines the creator of the next block based on the stake and coinage, which motivates organizations to be a part of the blockchain without energy waste. Therefore, building a smart contract blockchain platform with a business-friendly consensus mechanism is an essential step in achieving business adoption. Having said that, so far there was no PoS consensus standard that is proven to be as secure and stable as the PoW consensus.  Go Mobile Existing smart contract platforms require users to run a full node and hold a full blockchain copy to run dApps (the current size of Ethereum blockchain is around 30G), an untenable prospect for smaller devices in a storage sensitive or low bandwidth environment (e.g. mobile devices, IoT devices). Qtum blockchain was built with Go Mobile strategy in mind, it enables users to run smart contracts on their mobile devices without the need to download the full blockchain. This strategy will significantly improve the ease of use of the blockchain technology and let the general public appreciate the benefits brought by it. Let’s put it into context, today half of the Internet traffics is generated by mobile devices and the projected number of IoT devices by 2020 would be 24 billion. So in order to achieve massive adoption, the blockchain technology has to be tuned for a mobile strategy.  The Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and Go Mobile strategy resonate with my vision for the blockchain implementation in business and individual markets. So I look forward to seeing Qtum team deliver their platform with these features later this year as stated in the project roadmap.  Based on PwC’s 2017 Global Fintech Survey, the blockchain technology is moving out of the lab and 77% of the respondents expect to adopt blockchain as part of an in-production system or process by 2020. People have seen its potential to change the way human interact and collaborate today across various industries such as financial services, supply chain, IP and copyrights, IoT, gaming, social network, and charity. That’s why there are so many activities and innovation going on every day. From the firm's perspective, we have seen rapidly increasing inquiries and requests from our clients asking how they can leverage this technology and stay ahead of the game. I will continue sharing my thoughts as I progress on this journey.",False

This requires us to modify some Bitcoin Script opcodes, and make adjustments so the Ethereum Accounts model can communicate with UTXO's.   Here's a quick diagram:        There's more information about this on our website: https://qtum.org/en/account-abstraction-layer-overview     ""Account Abstraction Layer Overview  Building on bitcoins reliable and proven-to-deliver blockchain, Qtum stacks its Account Abstraction Layer, allowing the Bitcoin Core 0.13 blockchain to seamlessly interact with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). With this innovation it is now possible to execute smart contracts and run decentralized applications, simply and securely, in environments that were previously out of reach for Ethereum, combining the endless possibilities provided by smart contracts with the stability and maturity of the bitcoin ecosystem.  Until now, attempts to implement smart contract solutions on top of the bitcoin blockchain have had issues, been lackluster, or failed to break into the mainstream business market. This is primarily due to the fact that the bitcoin blockchain employs an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) scheme to associate coins with addresses, rather than the easier to understand, but otherwise problematic, account-based model used by Ethereum.  An account based model works pretty much the way one would imagine:  if Alice has 10 tokens, and sends 5 of them to Bob, who has zero tokens; 5 tokens are simply subtracted from Alice’s balance and added to Bob’s, who now owns 5 coins.  On a UTXO blockchain, however, Alice does not directly hold 10 tokens, but a series of outputs, which are collections of coins resulting from previous transactions.  In such a model, instead of owning 10 tokens, Alice would, for example, hold 3 outputs: (a) consisting of 6 coins, (b) consisting of 2 coins, and (c) consisting of another 2 coins. In this scenario Alice couldn’t simply send 5 coins to Bob, but instead she (or her wallet, for that matter) would have to pick the best-suited output and receive “change” in return (a process called coin picking). In our example this means that Alice would transfer output (a), consisting of 6 coins, and receive 1 coin back as “change”. This “change” is what is called the Unspent Transaction Output, or UTXO. After the transaction Alice would still hold 3 outputs, this time (a) consisting of 1, while (b) and (c) remain 2.  Employing such a seemingly complex bookkeeping scheme allows the Bitcoin blockchain to support Simple Payment Verifications or SPVs. The SPV protocol enables the support of light wallets, which are wallets that can interact with the Bitcoin network in a decentralized and trustless manner, without having to download the entire Bitcoin blockchain. This property is immensely useful for mobile applications or in any low bandwidth/storage environment.  Until now, Ethereum smart contracts couldn't execute in such environments exactly because Ethereum’s account based blockchain does not provide a SPV analog. To solve this, Qtum builds its decentralized application platform on the proven-to-deliver Bitcoin blockchain and introduces the Qtum Account Abstract Layer, which serves as a communication layer between the Bitcoin Core 0.13 protocol and the EVM.  To achieve this, Qtum has extended the Bitcoin 'Script' language, adding 3 ‘opcodes’ so that it functions as a vehicle to transport code to the EVM, while adding special processing conditions, executing these EVM-using transactions immediately when added to the blockchain - allowing the EVM to operate within a UTXO environment.  In order to relieve Qtum smart contracts from the need to perform coin picking for every transaction, Qtum comes coded with an automated, generic coin picking algorithm which allows contracts to ignore the UTXO mode of operation, while functioning normally, as if deployed in an account-based environment. This method is what enables Qtum to be compatible with pre-existing Ethereum smart contracts, allowing them to be executed on Qtum with little to no change to their code.

In 2016 the state of Vermont passed a law providing that a blockchain-based digital record will be considered a business record under the Vermont Rules of Evidence; just this April the state of Arizona passed a law confirming that smart contracts managed on the blockchain are considered electronic records. The Arizona law defines smart contracts as an “event driven program, with state, that runs on a distributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger that can take custody over and instruct transfer of assets on that ledger.”  Agrello’s AI smart contract interface corresponds with Qtum’s Smart Contract Lifecycle Management solution, detailed in Qtum’s whitepaper, which proposes a workflow to derive smart contract code from human-readable agreements and manage them in real time.The Qtum project, with management support from PWC, raised $15.6 million this March, and plans for its platform to be ready for public use in Q3 of this year.",False

We use the a slightly extended version of the SPV protocol to accomplish this.  2 does that means do you already have the swift/java version solidity compiler and EVM?  There are two approaches. The first approach is the most simple, but also carries some limitations. In this approach there is no need for an EVM implementation. However, it is not possible to execute contracts off-chain (without spending gas). The second approach is powerful, but does require an EVM implementation. In this method you can do almost anything a full node can do except for fully validate all blocks (which a mobile wallet has no need for). You can execute contracts off-chain on the mobile device.  Although the second approach will require an EVM implementation, it is not necessarily something you will have to compile into your app yourself. We are working on an IPC interface for iOS and Android that will allow third party apps to make use of the Qtum SPV wallet through an API and thus not require storing private keys and managing signatures, and can also be used for executing EVM contract code, instead of every app needing to include their own version of the EVM  3 what's the real advantage spv protocol can bring in Qtum's so called mobile smart contract platform?  The big advantage is that it's trustless and decentralized. Using SPV a mobile wallet can interact with the Qtum network directly. In order to take down a mobile wallet's connectivity, one would have to DDoS or attack the entire Qtum network, which is extremely difficult if not impossible. This is a major advantage over a centralized wallet, which can be shut down by shutting down a single company's set of servers. Additionally in a centralized wallet it's possible for the server to report invalid transaction data if a hacker gets access to the server due to a security vulnerability",False

The UXTO model is much cleaner. They have a lot of previous developers and have already done two previous coins and are the best team I have seen so far.   I have not looked at qtum's code.  We know the qtum founder and he is one of the largest investors in Skycoin from four years ago, before qtum or any of this. Some of the people around him are legendary scammers, but he is not a scammer.  I think Patricks role in the bitbay situation is exaggerated. I read through the arguments and it just sounds like drama.  Many of the people in the Bitcoin community are sociopaths. They often steal things or cause drama, then immediately blame it or scapegoat it on someone else. They are not even done stealing the money, before they go on campaign of moral indignation against the fall person.  I think Patrick was blamed for Bitbay because his personality makes him an easy victim for sociopaths and the human predators in the bitcoin community. There are people walking around, sizing people up and trying to determine whether they can manipulate someone, setup a scam, steal things and who is going to be gullible or a fall person.  If you knew the people involved, you would understand what the social dynamic is.  Also how can you be so confident qtum is going to replace ETH based on it's tech when they haven't released code yet? Ethereum is using an accounts model, like Ripple. Which is anti-blockchain and anti-privacy and very traceable. It is against the philosophy of Bitcoin.  All coins going forward will be on the UXTO model and it is best practice for blockchain. Moving turing complete smart contracts off of accounts model and onto UXTO is extremely important and that is what qtum appears to be doing.  We need to figure out how to do general computation on a UXTO model. Instead of being restrained to the Ripple/Ethereum accounts model.  I think they will get closer to the goal, but only get there part way  thin client for smart contracts (major limitation for existing system) moving smart contracts onto UXTO (major milestone) I do not know if qtum has succeeded, but they seem to be going in right direction. I talked to one of their technical leads and they were focused on ""Getting it working with something we can do now"" and then incremental improvement over time. So first implementing the Ethereum virtual machine on top of UXTO, then working out the research problems for a native turing complete UXTO language later.  I do not know if there is a way to full UXTO while still having ""gas"". I think you will need to get rid of the ""gas"". In the ethereum model to take full advantage. I do not know if qtum will be able to go far enough in doing that, but is heading in the correct direction.  Ethereum tries to be both a token and a computer.  we started with pure tokens (Bitcoin) then we added a computer to the tokens (Ethereum) now we just trying to figure out how to build pure computer on UXTO Then once we have the computer, the tokens or coins just become a program or entity running on this ""distributed computer"" Bitcoin, Ethereum, qtum, byteballs, etc are just stepping stones. Towards a final solution. None of these will exist or be relevant in ten years. We are in an age of transition and I am looking at the projects that are getting closer to the goal, in a pure mathematical sense.  Even Skycoin is being ripped up and its foundations constantly rewritten when it is advantageous to do so. Bitcoin is static and relatively unchanging, while Ethereum has been able to get the community to accept constant small changes.  Skycoin is on a punctuated equilibrium model, where we do bug fixes and polishing, then completely rip up and rebuild the foundation as needed, then go back to bug fixes and polishing.  Right now, we are exploring new networking primitives and the advantage of immutable data structures, but are still on blockchain. Putting EVM on UXTO is heading towards immutable data structures from the perspective of computation, while we are heading towards immutable data structures from the path of consensus, networking and simplifying object synchronization protocols.  One of the pilots that is being spun out of that project is the distibuted, peer-to-peer social media platform built upon immutable data structures and peer-to-peer object replication. For this Skycoin chose a public key, cryptographic publisher/subscriber model and DAG immutable object tree. While Ethereum's project chose a Kadmelia DHT block storage model.  Ignoring the individuals and the drama, I am just looking at the ""future direction"" and who is heading in that direction.  Also how can you be so confident qtum is going to replace ETH based on it's tech when they haven't released code yet? I am not confident it will replace Ethereum. At the start, it will be equivalent to ethereum in terms of being able to run the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on top of qtum with UXTO. Then they will do a native language.  It will depend on the implementation. I do not know if qtum has succeeded, but they seem to be going in right direction.  Similarly, Byteballs may fail or may not exist in ten years, but they are pioneering the first experiments into replacing the Blockchain with a DAG. Which we have been considering for several years now.  Similarly, Bitcoin was the first but people are getting used to the idea that it will not be the final or best cryptocurrency. That it was just the first generation and that we can build better and improve it substantially.",False

When bundled with existing Blockchain technologies, it is very powerful. Instead of reinventing the wheel and creating a costly and untested new platform, it is possible to combine proven solutions to provide the ultimate Smart Contract solution. We believe that the parallel proofs provided by the UTXO model, along with Proof-of-Stake 3.0 (POS3), the Simple Payment Verification protocol, and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the perfect fusion.  Recently, we were asked some good questions about our solution.  Our Lead Developer, Jordan Earls took the time to respond, see below:                                      Question:  How do you design “Making Smart Contracts work on smartphones and tablets” happen?  Earls:   We will extend the SPV protocol for this purpose. We will extend it to allow validating contract state without needing to validate the entire blockchain, nor downloading the entire blockchain. We also will be extending the P2P network implemented by Bitcoin’s code to also include functionality specific to smart contracts and the management of their state. And finally, we will be releasing several mobile APIs specifically built for easy integration of Qtum and smart contract’s into new and existing Android and iOS applications.                                                Question: Does that mean you already have the Swift / Java version solidity compiler and EVM?  Earls: No, but this is for a reason. There are two primary approaches for integrating smart contract’s into your application, depending on your exact needs. The first method is easiest but includes some limitations. The first method involves using IPC interfaces to allow for an application to use the mobile wallet’s EVM and SPV blockchain implementations. This method is also the safest because the wallet will manage private keys instead of the application. However, this may be more complicated and carry some limitations. So, application developers may choose the second approach. This involves compiling an EVM and SPV implementation directly into your application, and thus your application will directly interact with the blockchain, but is responsible for managing its own security profile and for tracking funds if needed.   Question:  what's the real advantage the SPV protocol can bring to Qtum’s so-called “Mobile Smart Contract”?  Earls: The fact that we can provide Mobile Smart Contracts in a trustless and decentralized environment is the major advantage. Using SPV, a mobile wallet can interact with the Qtum network directly. In order to take down a mobile wallet’s connectivity, one would have to attack the entire Qtum network, which is extremely difficult because of the POSv3 consensus model. This puts our solution leaps and bounds ahead of a centralized wallet solution, which can be attacked by simply attacking the provider’s servers. The other issue with centralization is if those servers are compromised, they can report invalid transaction data, leading to businesses and consumers alike potentially trusting false data. In some models of wallet centralization, it can also result in funds being outright stolen because the private keys are stored on the server.",False

A Daemon is essentially a ‘service’ that runs on a server, it’s usually shortened to “D” meaning that Qtum Server or Quantum “Daemon” would be shortened to simply “QtumD”. The GUI is a wrapper that contains a compiled binary of the Qtum source code. This is usually done using the QT framework, allowing users of various operating systems to complete tasks, such as: transfer tokens, control smart contracts, create new accounts, etc. Some operations will not have graphical functions, these are usually RPC commands that require a console view, and will be operated using command line interfaces, such as viewing the network difficulty.   When the Qtum source code is compiled and permissions are assigned, the Daemon process can be started. This allows the entity running this to call on RPC commands, which are defined as “Remote Procedure Calls”. Many people who use Bitcoin wallets may not realize they already use these calls frequently, when they send and receive coins in their QT wallet. The purpose of a GUI wallet is to eliminate having to compile source code and having to learn the various RPC functions. The nature of UTXO blockchains allows Qtum to be very familiar to users who have experience with Bitcoin and other projects that fall into its family, like Litecoin.    This section of the Roadmap states that the Qtum testnet will be ready to compile, with full RPC methods for interraction with Smart Contracts that interract with the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine).",False

Qtum puts the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on top of the Bitcoin UTXO model and joins the two with something called an Account Abstraction Layer. This enables execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications, comparable to the Ethereum blockchain, but in contrast to Ethereum, Qtum is built upon Bitcoin’s well-established UTXO transaction model and employs a Proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.  The Qtum model increases security, allows compatibility with both Bitcoin and Ethereum applications, and is able to utilize the SPV protocol. Qtum will launch in September with a 120 second block time, 2MB block size, and 100 million total coins. BTCManager recently interviewed Qtum’s Patrick Dai to find out more about the project.  What do you think will be the most attractive feature that Qtum will offer to Users? Which feature will be most attractive to Enterprises?   We think our mobile functionality, thanks to the Simple Payment Verification (SPV) protocol, will be one of the most attractive features of Qtum. The SPV protocol allows for lite clients to operate in a more decentralized manner that way users can trust a community of nodes instead of they a company to be notified of transactions.  We think this feature will also be attractive to enterprise users as well because they can have mobile devices that operate based on this protocol. This would give businesses more control over their operations and enable the to use Qtum in a broader range of applications.    Can you explain why you chose to launch with PoS 3.0 and what are the particular benefits of this consensus method over others?    We chose to launch with PoS 3.0 because it is the most tested PoS implementation for UTXO blockchains. We want to continue building upon Sunny King’s classic version of PoS and make it even better.   What is the time frame for distributing Qtum tokens to the purchasers in the ICO, and how will this be done?   The Qtum tokens will be released when the mainnet is live, which is planned for September. The Qtum tokens will be distributed via the platforms that took part in the crowdsale.   Have any Dapps currently running on Ethereum shown interest in porting over to Qtum? Would Dapps have to choose one chain, either Ethereum or Qtum, or is it possible for a Dapp to run on both chains at the same time with some method for syncing the Dapp between chains?   Some decentralized application developers have approached Qtum to build using our platform. Some are in the works to launch on both platforms while others want to launch on Qtum exclusively. Depending on the application, syncing may not even be necessary. Although, we imagine that blockchain systems will be more interoperable in the future which could help overcome these challenges.    Can you tell us about the Mobile feature that allows Qtum iPhone user to send Qtum tokens via SMS text message easily? Will there be an Android version?   Rather recently, Apply made iMessage more of a platform similar to other messaging apps that allows users to send Qtum tokens via text messages, although it still does require data. That being said, Qloha, one Qtum project that is already underway, aims to allow WeChat users to send Qtum tokens to their friends. The plan is for Qloha to operate on multiple messaging platforms.    Do you foresee any problem scaling smart contracts on a UTXO based blockchain with a 2MB block size limit? Can you talk about how the EVM and the UTXO chain communicate with each other?   Scaling is always one of the problems that any growing platform, business or application faces. Since we are launching with Segregated Witness, transaction malleability will not limit possible layer two technologies like Lightning networks that will allow Qtum to scale more easily.

The company claims they have the world’s first digital currency that can execute smart contracts with a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, and are now working on a project called Qhola to circulate its currency on top of WeChat mini program.  Some of the project backers include Kuaidi founder Chen Weixing, OkCoin CEO Star Xu, founder of Ethereum and Jaxx Blockchain Interface Anthony Di Iorio, blockchain technology advocate Bo Shen, and Chinese angel investor, Xiaolai Li.  Qtum (pronounced “quantum”) is an open-source value transfer protocol and decentralized application platform that aims to pool the development resources of Bitcoin with decentralized application developers from Ethereum. Ethereum is a platform and a programming language that makes it possible for any developer to build and publish next-generation decentralized applications.  “Bitcoin is primarily a value transferring network while Ethereum is predominantly a smart contracts platform. Qtum utilizes the core technology from both of these platforms; it merges the value transfer technology of Bitcoin with smart contract execution technology of Ethereum,” John Scianna, PR manager at Qtum told TechNode.  The funding will allow the Qtum Foundation to develop a working beta of the project. Until now, the team has managed to get the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) running on a fork of Bitcoin Core 0.13, which allows the company to use many of the decentralized applications that were already built on Ethereum.  Leveraging WeChat mini-apps  WechatIMG5 “Light wallet” protocol supporting Qtum Qtum is aiming to leverage WeChat’s new mini-apps platform to circulate its tokens on WeChat. Qhola takes advantage of WeChat’s mini programs to allow users to send and receive Qtum tokens as well as pay for products and services within WeChat. Qhola also aims to take this technology to other mobile messaging platforms such as Facebook Messenger and Telegram.  “Current tokenized applications require users to download the whole blockchain. When you think about a user trying to store over ten gigabytes of data on their phone just to run a few apps, it’s not realistic,” John remarked. “Qtum can run tokenized applications without having to download the blockchain.”  Qtum is currently compatible with the existing Simple Payment Verification “light wallet” protocol and will support mobile device use cases.  Uniting Bitcoin and Ethereum  “The support we received from public figures in both the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities illustrates that we are uniting these two groups,” said Patrick Dai, Founder of the Qtum project and previous employee at Alibaba. An alumnus of Draper University, Partick has been part of the Bitcoin community since 2012.  Many current blockchain projects were built with the ideology that technology should disintermediate corporations, and have programs run by themselves with no central governing body. Most businesses, however, will continue to rely on people for most operations, but there are still many use cases where blockchain technology can reduce waste and inefficiencies for businesses.  Qtum aims to be the bridge between the two so that users can have autonomous applications and businesses can have their blockchain applications without having to create their own technology from scratch.",False

Basically it is just another bitcoin fork with extension to the bitcoin scripting language to support solidity contracts?   First of all, Qtum is far from being “just another bitcoin fork”. We have a vision for the Qtum project and one of the biggest and most professional teams ever seen in crypto with support from real world companies and investors. Our goals for Qtum go far beyond the crypto scene and it will be a top project, not just another fork. Our choice of bitcoin core as a main base for Qtum is based on the fact that bitcoin is the most mature, stable and secure blockchain available, in comparison to ethereum, bitshares or others, which are still considered unstable with the numerous problems and security issues they had since they launched. In addition to bitcoin having the biggest support from the community which offers a large collection of tools and software related to bitcoin which can be used by quantum as well, in contrast to the other blockchains which sometimes lack even the simplest software (mobile wallets, stable desktop wallets …). Also we use bitcoin script as a bridge between the EVM and regular transaction, the Qtum model was very well designed, and is much more complicated than you make it sound.  1. There is no compelling reason to choose UTXO over smart contract via balance.  It is like comparing a general journal vs a general ledger, which is better? The answer is it depends. I guess it is only UTXO because it is using a bitcoin fork and calling it UTXO as a feature is just a gimmick. In fact I suspect scalability becomes bigger problem since you need to maintain SPV to manage UTXO for multiple different states? Will be interesting to see how to implement wallets. Does that make hyperledger better since they supports both utxo and balance? Our choice of UTXO is simply choosing the best technology, there have been some efforts made through some articles to make the account model seem as performant and secure as the UTXO model, however, it’s not. Without going into much details, the account model is too naïve and simplistic and offers no parallelism, it always reminds me of the cup telephone transaction model.  For us, a hybrid model as the one used by Hyperledger was the wrong choice since it will cause us to be incompatible with neither bitcoin nor ethereum. In Qtum we have a priority to keep full compatibility with bitcoin which will allow us to implement future bitcoin BIPs to Qtum thus taking advantage of the developments done by the bitcoin core team and community. For more details,please refer below：  1) If we wanted just a simple smart contract platform to build on top of, it would’ve been significantly easier for us to just fork Ethereum.  2) The UTXO allows for the SPV protocol to work. Ethereum currently does not have anything like SPV. There’s no way to run a simple wallet on Ethereum without downloading the entire blockchain, or trusting a centralized 3rd party.  3) The UTXO model is overall much more simple, and because it’s been used by Bitcoin, it has been thoroughly tested and proven to be secure. Although Ethereum’s account model is conceptually easy to understand, it requires more complexities and edge cases in order to secure it from replay and double spend attacks.  4) Scalibility should not be a problem for Qtum. Although contracts can create state changes etc, these state changes are not directly stored on the blockchain. Rather, state is considered the accumulation of all actions and differences created by executing each smart contract. This could admittingly make syncing the blockchain slower (because block processing will be slower than Bitcoin), but the other benefits provided are worth this performance hit. Furthermore, the only additional thing stored in the UTXO set right now is contract code, and contract-owned outputs (though their data becomes unimportant after the output is initially processed). There may be plans proposed later which prune the UTXO set’s stored data as well, to reduce the UTXO set size further.  5) SPV will work almost identically to how SPV wallets work today. For a quick summary, a light wallet downloads block headers, and then sends P2P nodes requests (using bloom filters) to get all transactions for each block matching the keys that this wallet own. Because the contract system creates normal transactions, this already works. IF you a contract sends funds to a SPV wallet, the SPV wallet will see these funds and can spend them, today. Our next step with SPV wallets would be to implement a workflow so that people can send money to a contract, while also picking which function and what data to send. We do not need to extend the SPV model to work for Qtum, it already works because of our focus on compatibility.  6) Regarding Hyperledger. I’m no expert on it, so I could be wrong. But I think that their support could end up being worst of both worlds. Now, anything wanting to interact with Hyperledger must be capable of dealing with the quirks of both models. From my understanding also, they only support either UTXO or Accounts on one ledger at a time also (though there is much functionality for messaging and sending things between these ledgers). So I do not think it makes Hyperledger’s model better, but rather more complex. Perhaps this complexity provides more power to Hyperledger’s model, but it also introduces more security concerns and increases the implementation cost of Hyperledger itself, and any application that uses it (due to to having to deal with both models)  2) It extended bitcoin script to accept solidity string but another company called CounterParty have already done it on the Bitcoin public blockchain without having to use a new public blockchain. So where is the need? Furthermore, will qtum have to constantly keep in sync with “solc” the solidity compiler to maintain compatibility?   — Qtum is very different from XCP, XCP uses bitcoin blockchain to store data, and the user have to run XCP software on top of that. Some major drawbacks are the cost of XCP transactions which increased so much that it threatens the whole project now and the complexity to build external software on top of XCP. Qtum aims to offer an all-in-one solution, not based on any external possible points of failure. For solc support, we made Qtum with that in mind, Qtum uses the exact same ethereum VM, so it will run any solidity compiled code, in the case of EVM updates, and we will be easily able to update it in Qtum as well.  3.Qtum is a new altcoin platform but there are enough ethereum, ripple and bitcoin out there. Why another one?  It is not a bridge as I was led to understand. It is another bitcoin fork.  — In addition to my previous reply about Qtum not being “just another bitcoin fork”, I would like to add that quantum is not the average altcoin, it will be one of the best, if not “the best” we have all the means for that, and we will do it. You say it is not a bridge, but really it is. It is bridging the technology. We are taking what makes Bitcoin great, and what makes Ethereum great, and bringing them together as one. We expect to bridge not the actual monetary value (ie, the market cap) held in each coin, but rather the communities and separate interest. Right now there is a real divide between serious Ethereum users and developers, and Bitcoin users and developers. By aiming to be compatible with the technology involved with both, we hope to merge these communities and be an answer both for 1) Those who want Ethereum smart contracts, but are uncomfortable with the stability of the Ethereum account model and lack of protocol support such as SPV; and 2) Those who like Bitcoin, but are unhappy with it’s limitations for implementing smart contracts and more powerful types of transactions. We as a team are also tired of these copy-paste coins that people constantly make to try to get a quick buck, and we would not have chosen to make this it’s own altcoin if we had not weighed the cost and benefits very carefully.  4. What is the block confirmation time? Bitcoin is 10 minutes and Ethereum is 18 seconds?  — Ethereumblocktime of 18 seconds is a bit exaggerated and causes a lot of empty blocks and uncles thus bloating the blockchain with useless data (which resulted in the currently atrophied ethereumblockchain), and bitcoin block time of 10 minutes is a bit too long for a smart contracts platform. We aim to have a blocktime of 1 to 3 minutes for Qtum.   5.) I did not go too deep into the details of the POS but the protocol is similar to Peercoin’s DPOS and it maybe susceptible to coin age accumulation attack if the intention is to incentive to miners that leave their stake longer on the chain. In fact it should be the opposite to prevent long range attack, Bitfury and Vitalik has written good articles on the types of attacks it is susceptible to.   —- Qtum uses BCPoSv3.0 which has removed all major attack vectors, including coin age accumulation.In conclusion, Qtum will be the first standalone UTXO and PoS based smart contracts platform thus making use of the best available technologies to deliver an outstanding blockchain solution.

There's definitely a lot of potential.  I think it's a great idea now they need to really execute well on it and beat competitors to market.  They raised a lot of money and sure they can be comfortable now but if they really grow Qtum they can be truly insanely wealthy.  This has a lot of potential, I mean theoretically the tokens could be worth MORE than ETH if they really got people to move the apps they were building for Ethereum over to Qtum to take advantage of the SPV/mobile capabilities.  Of course there are competitors working on making Ethereum more portable but so far they all seem to have some big flaws.  I'm actually regretting not investing more during this ICO, but I invested around what the average was which should be good enough for now until they actually build a working platform.  I think this is actually a much bigger ICO even though it sold more slowly than Cosmos because while Cosmos is very innovative and has a very impressive team behind it as well it's also much more prone to competitors-there's no reason why multiple people can't just straight clone Cosmos and provide a cheaper bridge between the blockchains by offering cheaper alternatives to atoms.

Ethereum is using an accounts model, like Ripple. Which is anti-blockchain and anti-privacy and very traceable. It is against the philosophy of Bitcoin.  All coins going forward will be on the UXTO model and it is best practice for blockchain. Moving turing complete smart contracts off of accounts model and onto UXTO is extremely important and that is what qtum appears to be doing.  We need to figure out how to do general computation on a UXTO model. Instead of being restrained to the Ripple/Ethereum accounts model.  I think they will get closer to the goal, but only get there part way - thin client for smart contracts (major limitation for existing system) - moving smart contracts onto UXTO (major milestone)  I do not know if qtum has succeeded, but they seem to be going in right direction. I talked to one of their technical leads and they were focused on ""Getting it working with something we can do now"" and then incremental improvement over time. So first implementing the Ethereum virtual machine on top of UXTO, then working out the research problems for a native turing complete UXTO language later.  I do not know if there is a way to full UXTO while still having ""gas"". I think you will need to get rid of the ""gas"". In the ethereum model to take full advantage. I do not know if qtum will be able to go far enough in doing that, but is heading in the correct direction.  Ethereum tries to be both a token and a computer. - we started with pure tokens (Bitcoin) - then we added a computer to the tokens (Ethereum) - now we just trying to figure out how to build  pure computer on UXTO - Then once we have the computer, the tokens or coins just become a program or entity running on this ""distributed computer""  Bitcoin, Ethereum, qtum, byteballs, etc are just stepping stones. Towards a final solution. None of these will exist or be relevant in ten years. We are in an age of transition and I am looking at the projects that are getting closer to the goal, in a pure mathematical sense.  Even Skycoin is being ripped up and its foundations constantly rewritten when it is advantageous to do so. Bitcoin is static and relatively unchanging, while Ethereum has been able to get the community to accept constant small changes.  Skycoin is on a punctuated equilibrium model, where we do bug fixes and polishing, then completely rip up and rebuild the foundation as needed, then go back to bug fixes and polishing.  Right now, we are exploring new networking primitives and the advantage of immutable data structures, but are still on blockchain. Putting EVM on UXTO is heading towards immutable data structures from the perspective of computation, while we are heading towards immutable data structures from the path of consensus, networking and simplifying object synchronization protocols.  One of the pilots that is being spun out of that project is the distibuted, peer-to-peer social media platform built upon immutable data structures and peer-to-peer object replication. For this Skycoin chose a public key, cryptographic publisher/subscriber model and DAG immutable object tree. While Ethereum's project chose a Kadmelia DHT block storage model.  Ignoring the individuals and the drama, I am just looking at the ""future direction"" and who is heading in that direction.  >Also how can you be so confident qtum is going to replace ETH based on it's tech when they haven't released code yet?  I am not confident it will replace Ethereum. At the start, it will be equivalent to ethereum in terms of being able to run the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on top of qtum with UXTO. Then they will do a native language.  It will depend on the implementation. I do not know if qtum has succeeded, but they seem to be going in right direction.  Similarly, Byteballs may fail or may not exist in ten years, but they are pioneering the first experiments into replacing the Blockchain with a DAG.

Funds raised will finance the Qtum Foundation’s operation for the next four years, including financial/legal consulting, administration, marketing and development.  Qtum (pronounced “Quantum”) sold $10 million worth of its tokens (QTUMs) in a mere 90 minutes on the first day. By comparison, Ethereum, which is now the #2 cryptocurrency by market capitalization with a valuation of $3.6 billion, took 42 days to raise $18 million.  Qtum is a hybrid blockchain application platform. Its core technology combines a fork of bitcoin core, an Account Abstraction Layer allowing for multiple virtual machines, including the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and a Proof-of-stake Consensus protocol, aimed at tackling industry use cases. Details on the Qtum concept can be found in the Foundation’s white papers.  At the end of the crowdsale, which was scheduled to last 30 days or until all QTUMs were sold, the project raised 11,000 bitcoins and 75,000 ethers (ETHs) in exchange for the 51 million QTUMs.  Rather than sending QTUMs to a single crowdsale address, Qtum designated six digital currency crowdfunding websites/exchanges to carry out the sale in a harmonized manner. The participating websites included BTC9, Yunbi, Bizhongchou, Allcoin, ICOAGE and ICO365.  “We are confident that we can finish what we originally started a year ago. We hope our supporters can work with us to build the greatest blockchain platform for enterprise and consumer use cases. There are so many possibilities for the blockchain industry, with Qtum, we are just at the beginning of a long journey,” said Patrick Dai, co-founder of the Qtum Project.  There are three main ways the total QTUM supply will be allocated. 51 percent of QTUMs (51 million) will be distributed through the now-completed crowdsale. Of the rest of the 49 percent, 29 percent of QTUMs (29 million) will be assigned to community initiatives regarding research, education, business development and market expansion. 20 percent of QTUMs (20 million) will be distributed among the development team, early backers and founders. More details are outlined in the Foundation’s governance white paper.  “Since we began this project, I have been excited about its premise. Now, this excitement has been validated and shared by thousands of backers. Qtum will bring about a new blockchain and smart contract revolution and will bring together the many disparate communities into one common goal of action,” commented Jordan Earls, co-founder of the Qtum Project.  Qtum has previously raised $1 million from investors including Chen Weixing (Founder of Kuaidi), Star Xu (CEO of OkCoin), Anthony Di Iorio (Founder of Ethereum & Jaxx Blockchain Interface), Jeremy Gardner (co-founder of Augur), Bo Shen (Fenbushi Capital’s Managing Partner), Roger Ver (First Investor in Bitcoin Companies), and Xiaolai Li (blockchain angel investor).

Ethereum is using an accounts model, like Ripple. Which is anti-blockchain and anti-privacy and very traceable. It is against the philosophy of Bitcoin.  All coins going forward will be on the UXTO model and it is best practice for blockchain. Moving turing complete smart contracts off of accounts model and onto UXTO is extremely important and that is what qtum appears to be doing.  We need to figure out how to do general computation on a UXTO model. Instead of being restrained to the Ripple/Ethereum accounts model.  I think they will get closer to the goal, but only get there part way - thin client for smart contracts (major limitation for existing system) - moving smart contracts onto UXTO (major milestone)  I do not know if qtum has succeeded, but they seem to be going in right direction. I talked to one of their technical leads and they were focused on ""Getting it working with something we can do now"" and then incremental improvement over time. So first implementing the Ethereum virtual machine on top of UXTO, then working out the research problems for a native turing complete UXTO language later.  I do not know if there is a way to full UXTO while still having ""gas"". I think you will need to get rid of the ""gas"". In the ethereum model to take full advantage. I do not know if qtum will be able to go far enough in doing that, but is heading in the correct direction.  Ethereum tries to be both a token and a computer. - we started with pure tokens (Bitcoin) - then we added a computer to the tokens (Ethereum) - now we just trying to figure out how to build  pure computer on UXTO - Then once we have the computer, the tokens or coins just become a program or entity running on this ""distributed computer""  Bitcoin, Ethereum, qtum, byteballs, etc are just stepping stones. Towards a final solution. None of these will exist or be relevant in ten years. We are in an age of transition and I am looking at the projects that are getting closer to the goal, in a pure mathematical sense.  Even Skycoin is being ripped up and its foundations constantly rewritten when it is advantageous to do so. Bitcoin is static and relatively unchanging, while Ethereum has been able to get the community to accept constant small changes.  Skycoin is on a punctuated equilibrium model, where we do bug fixes and polishing, then completely rip up and rebuild the foundation as needed, then go back to bug fixes and polishing.  Right now, we are exploring new networking primitives and the advantage of immutable data structures, but are still on blockchain. Putting EVM on UXTO is heading towards immutable data structures from the perspective of computation, while we are heading towards immutable data structures from the path of consensus, networking and simplifying object synchronization protocols.  One of the pilots that is being spun out of that project is the distibuted, peer-to-peer social media platform built upon immutable data structures and peer-to-peer object replication. For this Skycoin chose a public key, cryptographic publisher/subscriber model and DAG immutable object tree. While Ethereum's project chose a Kadmelia DHT block storage model.  Ignoring the individuals and the drama, I am just looking at the ""future direction"" and who is heading in that direction.  >2  Also how can you be so confident qtum is going to replace ETH based on it's tech when they haven't released code yet?  I am not confident it will replace Ethereum. At the start, it will be equivalent to ethereum in terms of being able to run the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on top of qtum with UXTO. Then they will do a native language.  It will depend on the implementation. I do not know if qtum has succeeded, but they seem to be going in right direction.  Similarly, Byteballs may fail or may not exist in ten years, but they are pioneering the first experiments into replacing the Blockchain with a DAG. Which we have been considering for several years now.  Similarly, Bitcoin was the first but people are getting used to the idea that it will not be the final or best cryptocurrency. That it was just the first generation and that we can build better and improve it substantially.  the link:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=380441.msg18426200#msg18426200",False

But it would be nice if he clarified what he's talking about.  Anyways, I don't know why you guys spend all day posting here about how it's a scam-the ICO is long over. Even if it was actually a scam what good does wasting your time posting here do?  I think this is going to be a legitimately great altcoin and invested my own funds and didn't get any cashback or whatever and to be honest I would like to have invested more so I'm hoping there'll be another chance to buy the tokens cheap on an exchange once it's released.  The merging the best parts of bitcoin and ethereum and having an edge on the Chinese market is a big deal, only a moron would run this as a scam when they have the opportunity to genuinely make crazy amounts of money by making this succeed.  The only real risks here are the same that apply to any crypto in China-if it gets big enough the Chinese government will likely go crazy regarding KYC/AML, but hopefully being a Chinese project will help them smooth things over.  As for posting the addresses for funds raised I'm pretty sure the reason they don't want to do that is that the exchanges got a pretty decent cut for helping to run the ICO and they don't want to show that.  Pretty sure that the exchanges got at least a 5% cut of BTC received, if not more like 10%.  But that's ok, they distributed the risk of any one exchange screwing up over a few.  Anyways, I'm going to be just blocking the people who just constantly sit here posting scam over and over, it's meaningless garbage and serves no purpose now that the ICO is over.  If you wanted to warn people before the ICO so be it, but what's the point now that it's over?  You' just wasting your time and other people's time reading this garbage.

Having people sync a huge blockchain to run DAPPs is completely impractical even if you prune the Ethereum blockchain, nobody wants to download a 4GB of blockchain data just to use a DAPP and the fact that the blockchain would keep eating up more and more space on devices is a huge problem.

Our ambitions are very high. For starters, we want Opair to have a fair distribution, focusing on a mass market, developing progressive and real goals in a new platform coded from scratch inspired on Bitcoin and Ethereum to offer the best of both worlds with new developments to go a step forward into the future.   For now we are small group (three people working full-time, one external advisor and two freelancer developers) in charge of the project. Given the time we have been working on this and after looking for different ways to optimize and make more efficient the project we were able to put up a team which will help us to achieve our goals in the short term. We look forward to become the number one alternative for those who want to deviate from centralized systems by offering a platform that is focused on design and being user-friendly on one hand, and on the other that it allows to follow an upward learning curve. We are really excited with this project and the challenge that it presents itself.  We decided that Opair will also be our name, as it stands for Open and Fair which are the two key elements that we seek to fulfill:  Open Project: The code and our new language will be documented, open source and it will be found at Github.  Fair Distribution: We have been analyzing the last ICO´s and we realized that the distribution is not as fair as it should be. Most developers don´t distribute 100% of the coins and they keep a portion (%) in their hands as background/developer and bounty funds, so we want to highlight that 0% will be retained by us.

East matters Despite its promotion in the West where the knowledge of Blockchain technology and ICOs is higher and cryptocurrency-based platforms abound, most of the sites that participated in the crowdsale campaign are located in the East. Among them Bizhongchou, Yunbi, ICOAGE, Allcoin, ICO365 and BTC9.  The tactics have worked for Qtum, making it to the list of the all-time top 10 Blockchain-token crowdsale campaigns. It started its first day with $10 mln sales of its tokens in about two hours to cut down on the crowdsale’s scheduled 30 days, or until all tokens were sold, in which over 11,000 Bitcoins and 75,000 Ether (ETH) were raised in exchange for the available 51 mln Qtum tokens.  Another key issue that is also imperative to the ICO’s success is the application of these tactics’ overall purpose on beaming light on Qtum’s ability to integrate both Ethereum and Bitcoin.  Ethereum factor Ethereum has been gaining greater interest in Asian countries of late. Its recent price rise seemingly shows it is being seen differently from how it used to be especially after last year’s DAO attack.  In a way, Qtum’s promise of facilitating the integration of Ethereum with Bitcoin (for its known backbone role for all cryptocurrencies) will contribute to the further breaking of the misconception that both are competitors.  Qtum will execute smart contracts and decentralized applications like the Ethereum Blockchain but is built on Bitcoin’s unspent transaction output UTXO transaction model and employs a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism.  Aside from extending smart contract possibilities to environments that were previously out of reach for Ethereum, the new platform also aims to establish an array of services that include tools and methods to standardize the workflow of business smart contract development, and a hub of tested and verified smart contract templates, addressing various specialized business use cases.",False

Quote from: BTCspace on March 29, 2017, 03:43:03 AM https://qtum.org/en/blog/crowdsale-statistics  This past week the Qtum crowdsale successfully ended after 117 hours. Qtum raised 11,156 bitcoins and 77,081 ether to fund the project. The sum of the ether and bitcoins came out to be roughly $15,664,829 when the sale ended.

This is crypto we are talking about, there is objective evidence on the blockchain and that is the only thing that can be trusted. Why should we trust exchanges controlled by the team themselves when we could rely on a trustless system to obtain our proof? It's so simple to do, and the fact you and the team are still fighting this is a gigantic red flag. This struggle you guys are putting up is equivalent to admittance. There is no reason for it except that you need to hide something.  My theory: The ICO did not raise anywhere near 15 mil, but you are going to pretend it did until release, because although you didn't raise 15 mil you have control of the vast majority of the coins because you ""purchased"" them from the exchanges under your own control. All you need to do is maintain some confidence in the coin until release, and then you can dump to make up for all the money you didn't raise in the ICO.  You could prove that wrong in an instant, but you don't because apparently you can't. And let me make one thing clear, until objective evidence of the ICO funds (the addresses) are shared with the community I will be in here alllllllll the way up until and past the launch making sure nobody who comes here forgets or is unaware that the team has failed to bear their burden of proof and provide this simple and standard degree of transparency that they themselves alluded to before the ICO.

That is all I am asking for at this point. Can you think of one good reason they would hide the funds aside from needing to hide something about them? Every other legit project has revealed this info on their own accord immediately following the conclusion of their ICO.  And to be an advisor does not mean much by itself, Peter Todd was an advisor to the scam coin Viacoin. They paid him and that was enough to convince him it was legit and to work for them and as a result his name was unknowingly used to pump up and legitimize a scam. We already knew there are big names (Roger Ver, etc) ""associated"" with qtum, but I'm not so foolish to let that alone satisfy my suspicions because in the past big names have been associated with scams, often unknowingly. And we know for fact that Dai scammed a previous coin (BitBay) under the nose/behind the back of the rest of the unknowing team and its associates. So in otherwords, there very much so is precedent for my suspicions here.  Honestly, if they could just prove they raised the money they claim they did I would admit I was wrong about that and give the project the benefit of the doubt until the release.

The Alibaba Australia project, which also includes AusPost and nutritional supplement maker Blackmores as partners, is aimed to improve the way foods are tracked, cutting down on the risk of counterfeit products on the market.  The so-called 'Food Trust Framework' effort will see the partners build a pilot blockchain platform in Australia that will track products from producer to consumer.  ""This will include the development of a pilot blockchain technologies solution model for vendors to be utilized by participants across the supply chain,"" Alibaba said in a statement today.  According to ZDNet, Alibaba said the blockchain platform would allow shipments to be tracked in real-time, as well as improving security and transparency in the fight against fraud.  ""The signing of today's agreement is the first step in creating a globally respected framework that protects the reputation of food merchants and gives consumers further confidence to purchase food online,"" said Maggie Zhou, managing director of Alibaba Group Australia and New Zealand.  Food fraud has increasingly become an issue, especially in Alibaba's home nation of China. The new initiative is being seen as a testbed for solutions to the issue that has cost lives in the country and elsewhere.  The move may also bolster Alibaba's reputation following accusations that its online marketplaces are rife with counterfeit goods.",False

I found this to help you with your newbie misunderstandings about crypto security: https://community.coinbase.com/t/can-i-share-my-bitcoin-address-publicly-where-can-i-find-it/7824  ""Bitcoin Address can safely be shared with anyone, anytime without presenting any risk to the security of your funds.  You should be aware though, that once someone knows that an address belongs to you, they can view the full history of send and receive transactions to that address.""  There is only one reason to not share it, and that is to hide something.  Unless you know something the rest of the world doesn't know: that ECDSA has already been broken by quantum super computers?!? In which case the team and crypto as a whole have got much bigger problems to worry about. http://pqcrypto.org/  And here's a better question than your first one: Why are you not asking about the funds when you say you did invest??? Hmm. You say me asking this question is making you start to think I did invest and you act as thought only an investor should be asking this question, which indicates you think my question is normal for an investor, and yet you and the few other people here who claim to have invested aren't asking it! Lol!!!  And it's pretty simple why I am here: overall I am here because I want to see where this goes (will be entertaining no matter what), right now I am here specifically to seek the super easy proof of the funds they claim to have raised in the ICO because the fact they haven't shown proof and so resistant to addressing inquires about it is a HUGE red flag (and as we all know, not the first one) and I don't believe them when they say they raised $10 mil in 90 minutes. I mean, shit, now is the chance for them to prove themselves against us ""trolls"" in an indisputable fashion and it would take no time or effort at all. All they'd have to do is share the addresses, a practice standard to every ICO that isn't a scam.

Prior the SEC’s ruling, the anticipation surrounding the probable “institutionalization” of the once semi-anarchic cryptocurrency, drove its price to the slightly unbelievable all time high of about $1280 per unit.  The regulator’s Nay did indeed administer a felt blow to the Bitcoin market, but not one out of the ordinary for the crypto asset, which grew to be notorious for both – its local volatility and steady macro trend. If anything, recent developments serve as a testimony for the un-patriated currency’s unyielding drive for survival.  With China’s central bank raising heavy restrictions on BTC trade, and US SEC officers reluctant to allow the cryptocurrency’s expansion, Bitcoin is still traded close to the price of an ounce of Gold, aggregating a market capitalization of about 19.4 Billion USD.  Bitcoin blockchain technology geralt / Pixabay Despite the occasional alarmist headline, Bitcoin’s success story is undoubtedly carved out of the stuff movies are made of. Starting as a rebellious open source Cyberpunk project in the aftermath of the ‘08 financial crash, the “Peer to Peer Digital Cash System”, described in a seven page short whitepaper by an anonymous figure named Satoshi Nakamoto, managed to create waves that have reached even the highest windows of the established financial institutions.  The somewhat agitated interest Bitcoin has been enjoying since then among the tech, financial and business sectors and their respective regulatory watchdogs, originates mainly from the technology underlying it, called the “Blockchain”. Hailed in late 2015 as The Trust Machine by The Economist, said Machine holds the potential to eliminate functions, held very dear to the Banking sector and financial institutions, namely those of intermediaries, middleman and trusted third parties. Accordingly, the initial suspicion legacy organizations and government bodies have expressed towards blockchain is not only natural, it probably is well advised.  Albeit, this suspicion has long made way to a very wide spread if-you-can’t-beat-them-join-them attitude, with almost every major financial institution being involved in some sort of blockchain experiment. Moreover, governments around the globe are embracing blockchain more outspokenly than ever. The People’s Republic of China, not very well known as big decentralization fan, has recently included blockchain technology in its upcoming five year plan, while the European Parliament has published several reports, with extravagant titles like “How blockchain technology could change our lives”.     blockchain bitcoin  One of the most recent developments in that respect doesn’t involve Bitcoin itself, but one of its most promising progeny, Ethereum. 30 tech and finance giants, including Microsoft, J. P. Morgan and Intel recently announced the so called “Enterprise Ethereum Alliance”, aiming to drive Ethereum’s blockchain technology to the mainstream business market.  The Ethereum project, in contrast to the inherently ownerless and uncontrolled Bitcoin movement, is a well funded foundation with a clear and charismatic leadership with long term goals, one of which is a decentralized, uncensorable “World Computer”. This “World Computer” uses blockchain technology to  connect a multitude of personal devices, spread around the globe, and makes them perform as one giant global computer. This computer can then execute applications, host websites, validate complex financial transactions, sign off agreements and do basically anything one could possibly think of without requiring central servers or any other kind of standard infrastructure a government could censor or a corporation could eavesdrop on.  If this sounds like a pie in the sky, it’s because it sort of is. For now, at least. The Ethereum network already exists, and does a lot of what it promises, however very slowly and rather inelegantly. However, since the project still describes itself as in alpha state, these problems are by all means tolerable. The team behind the project makes continuous efforts to improve its platform, and with the recent legacy backing, which has almost doubled the price of “Ether” (ETH), Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, these efforts will probably increase significantly this year and bear some surprising fruit.  It should be noted that Ethereum is not alone anymore in its pursuit of the holy grail of decentralized networking. Since Ethereum’s conception in 2013, a long list of so called “turing-complete blockchains” have entered the race towards decentralized application platforms. One recent example is a Singapore-based startup called “The Qtum Foundation”, proposing a sort of hybrid between Bitcoin and Ethereum, exploiting the technological advantages of both systems and combining them.  One of the more interesting capabilities such chimera would have is the ability to access an Ethereum-styled World Computer from smartphones and tablets, a feature Ethereum itself couldn’t manage to whip into existence. With about half of all internet traffic being generated by mobile devices, and with many blockchain applications targeting emerging markets with “mobile only” internet access, this development has been crucial enough to enroll the support of legacy consultant giants like PwC, demonstrating once again what the leaders of the world economy really think about the future of blockchain and Bitcoin-like initiatives.  In light of all of this, 2017 begins as an exceptionally promising year in the short history of blockchains. So exceptionally in fact that the SEC’s rejection of a Bitcoin backed investment fund will hardly be recorded in future reviews.",False

Why are you ignoring this question and why is it not possible for the funds to be viewed and verified independently? There is absolutely no reason not to reveal them unless you have something to hide.  So, when do you plan on sharing the addresses for the funds?  Stackoverflow these questions are not directed at you, unless you are a part of the team? You have already responded to me multiple times with useless answers meant to deflect my question, only helping to bury my question and making me have to repost it again and again in hopes of a legitimate answer, so any response from you will be taken as admittance that you are indeed a part of the team. Kind of sad if you aren't a team member and really are just an investor and you are the one stuck here defending the project because the team is not competent enough or willing to do that themselves and provide answers to simple questions. And yet you are so confident in them lol.  It's a simple question and if it can't be answered it is pretty evident why.",False

I took a risk and put a few bitcoins towards this but even if all the money is really stolen I'd be just fine financially.  There's a good chance that they'll release something really interesting and the fact that they're in the Chinese market is a big positive aspect to me-they understand the importance of stuff like WeChat integration in a way that westerners would never get.  Anyways if it's such a huge scam why the hell would they end their ICO so soon, you could scam millions of more dollars if you didn't.  Come on.  I was a little bit worried that they would multi-list the same tokens on multiple exchanges and rip people off that way but so far it seems like they did try to keep track of how many tokens each exchange had.

There are some questions regarding this project and its future, all of which have been answered by Jordan Earls, one of Qtum’s founders. The future of this project looks quite bright, and the interview below sheds a bit more light on what we can expect from Qtum moving forward.  TM: Bridging the gap between the best of Ethereum and Bitcoin is a bold goal. Some people may wonder if doing so really requires creating a brand new platform with a native token. How would you explain this thought process to less tech-savvy cryptocurrency enthusiasts?  JE: There are some other ways to combine Ethereum and Bitcoin, however, they have some significant drawbacks, one of the key ones being the lack of a functioning light wallet protocol (SPV) for these modes     TM: Are there specific types of dApps you hope to see realized by using Qtum? If so, who those types of dApps specifically?  JE: Our focus is “Go Mobile” and so one of our big hopes is to have completely decentralized apps that can be run (with a small front end) on mobile devices. Though we are compatible with Ethereum contracts, so we of course support many more use cases than just mobile  TM: What are the team’s expectations for Qtum in terms of academic research?  JE: We have a PhD, Alex Norta, who is managing our academic research, and intend to open multiple academic research offices for Qtum globally  TM: The bitcointalk announcement makes a mention of cooperating with other open source development projects. Have any connections been made in this regard?  JE: No firm connections we can talk about yet, but our hope is to unify the different cryptocurrency communities, by the foundation trading a portion of their Qtum for a portion of the other cryptocurrency’s coins. These tokens that are traded would be accessible by each community. So all Qtum holders would be entitled to a share of these traded tokens, and all of the other cryptocurrency’s holders would be entitled to a share of Qtum  We would like to thank Jordan Earls for taking the time to answer our questions regarding the Qtum project.

This year, the anniversary was especially festive, with the cryptocurrency trading at about $1000 per piece - stabilizing around a market cap. approaching 15 Billion USD. Not bad for an open-source project which began its career as a cyber-libertarian rebellion against a corrupt financial sector.  Since its humble first steps, Bitcoin soon managed to shed its counter-establishment flair and attracted the attention of entrepreneurs and regulators alike. But above all, the groundbreaking technology underlying the project, the blockchain, rapidly begun to spark hopes and dreams of techno-Utopian visionaries everywhere.  One gang of such visionaries, led by a 19 year-old prodigy named Vitalik Buterin, teamed up some four years ago to extend Nakamoto’s decentralized exchange model, so it could execute far more complicated transactions, enabling a wide array of new possibilities - ranging from “smart” contracts which execute themselves, to web applications that can’t be taken down, censored or attacked.  The real-world application of Butterin’s new blockchain gospel would probably revolutionize commerce and change it forever, enabling degrees of transparency and corporate accountability unseen since the dawn of the industrial revolution. However, the new and exciting abilities provided by the project came at a price: in order to sustain the complexity of the new platform, called Ethereum, Bitcoin’s elegant and rock solid transaction model had to be modified to the degree that interacting with its blockchain became a complicated and heavy-duty operation - thus far preventing it from exhausting its capabilities.  Combining Forces in Asia  The next step in blockchain’s evolution might come from a surprising angle. The Chinese government has recently listed blockchain technologies among the main development directions under the PRC’s 17th five year plan, and hopes to use the technology to fight corruption.  Following institutional backing, and building upon the under-utilized potential of smart contracts and decentralized applications, Qtum (pronounced Quantum), a Chinese startup, is detriment to push blockchain technologies towards mainstream adoption, promising to make the game-changing technology accessible to legacy organizations and governments around the globe for the first time.  Up until now mostly undiscovered by the western market, the Qtum Foundation has recently published an intriguing Whitepaper which has created ripples, reaching both sides of the Atlantic. The international team, led by a predominantly Chinese management, introduced a blockchain platform, combining Bitcoin’s proven-to-deliver architecture with Ethereum’s extended smart contracting abilities - a combination believed to be impossible until now. The implications of the proposed technology, if found to be functioning as advertised, are far reaching indeed, and bear the potential to disrupt the very way the internet works, while heralding a new age of decentralized commerce.  The blockchain space is notorious for harboring buzzword pumping startups, which very often fail to deliver on their hair-raising promises. The major investors in this industry have long become immune to empty rhetoric and are seldom impressed by teams, promising to reinvent the blockchain. However, judging by the amount of traction Qtum receives, this project seems to play in a different league.  Anthony Di Iorio, Ethereum Co-Founder, and CEO of JaxxWallet; Chen Weixing, Billionaire founder of Kuaidi, the Chinese version of Uber; Jeremy Gardner, co-founder of Augur and EIR at Blockchain Capital; David Lee Cuo Chuen, founder of Left Coast & Libai, as well as Bo Shen, General Partner at Fenbushi Capital; are only a few excerpts from a long and very impressive list of investors and advisers, gathered around Qtum.  Following legacy interest, but still taking the industry by surprise, the company recently announced that its business white paper has been co-developed by one of the ‘big four’ consultant agencies, being the first blockchain startup of its kind to do so.  This unusual involvement of legacy investors and regulators makes it very likely that we’re about to witness the third major breakthrough of decentralized technologies; Bitcoin, of course, being the first, Ethereum, with its smart contract concept the second, leading to the third in terms of finally implementing these principles in the real-world.  If Qtum, backed by its heavy-weight partners, succeeds in its endeavours, we could soon live in a world of decentralized international trade - applying to contracts, supply-chain management and corporate governance the same logic Bitcoin applied to money itself: rendering them cryptographically secured, transparent and immune to corruption and fraud.

Qtum is a smart contract platform for industry use cases, allowing mobile use of smart contracts and employing a Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol. The paper titled, Smart-Contract Value-Transfer Protocols on a Distributed Mobile Application Platform, was authored by the co-founders of the Qtum project, Patrick Dai, Neil Mahi, Jordan Earls and the project’s Scientific Advisor Dr. Alex Norta.  Mobile Support  Qtum’s UTXO-based blockchain supports the SPV (Simple Payment Verification) protocol from launch, which will allow lite wallets, running on mobile devices, to engage natively with decentralized applications and smart contracts for the first time. This feature also allows IoT devices to be secured and operated with smart contracts. Lite wallets allow users to interact with the network without having to download and sync with the entire blockchain, enabling low bandwidth/storage access to smart contracts. With SPV support, transactions can be signed by the device itself rather than having to rely on third-party services to relay messages. The Foundation recently illustrated their mobile functionality in a demo video on their website (https://qtum.org/en/videos/qtum-technical-introduction-and-demonstration).  “Getting smart contracts to work on smartphones and tablets heralds a new age in the field of decentralized computation. With about half of all Internet traffic being generated by mobile devices, every real-world use case for decentralized applications would massively benefit from mobile support – especially if we’re taking the tendencies of developing markets into account”  — Patrick Dai, Co-founder of the Qtum Project  Account Abstraction Layer  The Account Abstraction Layer, described in the whitepaper, is what allows Qtum’s UXTO-based blockchain to seamlessly interact with the Ethereum Virtual Machine and more virtual machines down the line. By enabling smart contract execution on a UTXO platform, contracts are given more functionality thanks to the relative complexity of the UTXO model compared to an Ethereum-account like model. In addition to mobile support for smart contracts and dApps, Qtum’s UTXO structure gives users more traceability of smart contracts while offering more privacy with blockchain innovations like Change Addresses (CA) and more privacy enhancements in the pipeline. For more details please review: https://qtum.org/en/lm/account-abstraction-layer-overview  “This whitepaper fills the gap in the state of the art by presenting the Qtum smart-contract framework that aims for socio technical application suitability, the adoption of formal-semantics language expressiveness, and the provision of smart-contract template libraries for rapid best-practice industry deployment.” — Alex Norta, Scientific Advisor of the Qtum Project  Smart-Contract Lifecycle Management  qtum explained  The whitepaper addresses many concerns presented by industry users because of what happened with the case of the Ethereum DAO attack. Smart Contract Lifecycle Management aims to resolve this issue and other potential issues by allowing contract collaboration, negotiation, review, and tracking. Blockchain technology’s inherent distributed nature allows for contracts to run without being interrupted; however, change is the nature of life and contracts need updating to reflect new landscapes.  With smart-contract management, contracts can evolve according to cross-organizational collaboration. Smart-contract management can help establish trust between businesses with proper security vetting by collaborating parties. Additionally, smart-contract management enables contracts to be more like living documents and when situations changes, (i.e., terms are broken in the contract, such as a delay) parties can determine if they want to amend or close the contract.  “Qtum aims to revolutionize business processes and the way that businesses interact with their customers by making smart contract technology mobile and practical. The SPV protocol allows smart contracts to move from servers and laptops, into IoT and mobile devices.” — Jordan Earls, Co-founder of the Qtum Project  About Qtum: Qtum is an open source value transfer protocol and decentralized application platform. The development team hails from multiple countries around the globe and is a collection of top experts in the industry. The Qtum Foundation, headquartered in Singapore, is the decision-making body that drives the project development.

So many gullible investors burned for millions of dollars. At that time, everything appeared above board, except there's no evidence of actual mining from the company. Paycoin even had a large cult of followers/forum. Eventually, it fell apart. I believe the same thing will happen to QTUM. Maybe it will happen around August, 2017.

The platform has managed to raise almost 90 percent of the required funds in less than 2 days.

The Qtum platform has raised over 10000 BTCs and 68200 ETHs by selling close to 46 million QTUM tokens.  Qtum is a decentralized applications platform that combines a modified Bitcoin Core infrastructure with an intercompatible Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). By doing so, Qtum combines the best of both platforms — Bitcoin’s unfailing blockchain and endless possibilities offered by Ethereum smart contracts.  The developers of Qtum platform aim to provide an end-to-end multi-platform blockchain solution to cater to a range of applications across devices. These breakthrough capabilities are made possible by eliminating the need for specialized heavy software to create, deploy and operate the smart contracts.  The specialty of Qtum combined with its potential applications in low storage environments like mobile, phones, IoT applications etc., has turned it into an attractive investment for the cryptocurrency community.  The increased demand for QTUM tokens among the community has forced the platform to reallocate crowdsale tokens between exchanges. The three participating exchanges, Yunbi, BTC9 and Allcoin have been allocated additional QTUM tokens to meet the demand. According to the latest blog post, Yunbi has been allocated an additional 3 million tokens, 1.2 million to BTC9 and 500,000 to Allcoin. The extra allocation doesn’t affect the total number of tokens created by the platform has it is kept constant.       We are now past the Early Bird discount phase, moving onto the 1st week discounts.  We are less than 8% away from reaching our target of 51 million sold tokens.

He left the currency after it faced controversy involving himself and did not reveal his past to potential investors. He admitted to his past after being confronted with irrefutable evidence.  Qtum claims several high profile investors, including Roger Ver, Anthony Di lorio, and OKCoin CEO Xu Star.  According to chat logs, Steven Dai was the founder of Bitbay. That coin attracted significant controversy after a convoluted scheme that netted the founders thousands of bitcoins was revealed. The chatlogs revealed that the Bitbay launch was manipulated by two notorious alt-coin market whale groups known as bobsurplus and Gekko, the BTER exchange itself, and possibly Dai.   After two years of silence, Steven Dai is back as Patrick Dai.  A photo of BitBay funder Elmer Lin standing next to Patrick Dai seemingly proves that Lin met Patrick Dai.  unnamed (6)unnamed (5)     Questions about Dai’s past were initially ignored by the Qtum foundation and Dai. Two days after the issue was first raised on Twitter and through Slack, Dai finally issued a statement admitting to his past persona. He has ignored requests for comment sent to his email. The Qtum foundation itself initially replied to a request for comment saying that a statement would come the next day but has since ignored requests for additional comments.  In his statement, Dai denied any wrongdoing during the BitBay Scandal. He claims that he decided to leave the community after discovering the “questionable ends and actions” in the coin.  According to Qtum’s website and an article on the Ver owned Bitcoin.com, Roger Ver is one of many high-profile investors in Qtum. Others include Ethereum alum Anthony Di lorio, Jeremy Gardner and the CEO of Chinese Exchange OKCoin, Xu Star. [Side Note: Ver is reportedly suing Star’s OKCoin in an unrelated issue.]  We contacted Ver, Di lorio and Gardner to confirm or deny their investments. Only Gardner replied, confirming his investment. When I asked if he knew of Patrick Dai’s past as Steven Dai, he did not respond.  The Qtum foundation did release their statement, saying that they were initially unaware of Dai’s past but are standing by him.  The BitBay scheme was primarily revealed through chatlogs released by Zimbeck. After the scandal’s release, Zimbeck defended Dai as the only honest person in the group that included Dai, Bobsurplus and Gekko. Today, both Zimbeck and BitBay’s largest investor say Dai left them without support and they allege he stole funds from the BitBay Developer fund and ICO on his way out.  Dai denies that he stole money from Zimbeck or the BitBay investors.He also points to one $500 payment to Zimbeck for development after the scheme was revealed. Zimbeck contends that $500 over two years is not sufficient funding of a coin and is only a fraction of the haul he says Dai gained from the BitBay scheme.  While much of the conversation on Slack has focused on if Dai stole from the BitBay ICO or if he was an innocent victim of Bobsurplus and Gekko. That ignores the larger point: why wasn’t his past disclosed previously?  If Dai was completely innocent in the BitBay scandal, and if he had no ill-intentions with Qtum then he should have been upfront with all of his investors. If he revealed it to the high-profile VCs that have invested is also irrelevant. The fact that he was asking for ICO investment without revealing his past to the public means potential ICO investors would have invested without that information.  Besides the founder who changed his name after being involved in a scam, Qtum has some other red flags.  Besides The Founder, What is Wrong With Qtum?  Qtum does a few things right. The developers designed a competent website and wrote two interesting whitepapers. Digging a bit deeper reveals some troubling issues.  The site includes a Team page with pictures of various team members. That would be a good thing, except for what it doesn’t include: No social media links. No last names (besides Patrick Dai) and no evidence that the team members are who they claim to be. One, “Caspal” claims to hold thirty Chinese and Asian records for Rubik’s Cube competition, as well as 21 gold medals.  According to the World Cube Association,  there is no one named Caspal in the top 100 solvers in the world. Nor is there a “Caspal” in the top 100 solvers in Asia, or even in the top 100 solvers in China. I checked the top ten solvers in China’s photographs, and none of them matched Caspal’s photograph.  While it is possible that Caspal was a Rubik’s Cube champion in Asia under a different name, without a real, full name, it is impossible to be sure. Especially since they are ignoring my interview requests. It sounds absurd slamming a coin for possibly exaggerating the Rubik’s Cube solving capabilities of their team but if they thought it important enough to mention, it must be important enough to question.  Some of the team behind Qtum, also seem to be working on a completely unrelated Blockchain as a Service project called Bitse. Besides Dai, there are two Qtum team members working on the Bitse project and have their last names listed: Neil Mahi and Time Markov.  Neil Mahi, is the second person listed on the Qtum team page after Dai. Googling his name gives no relevant results. The Bitse team page calls him “One of the most seasoned and greatest blockchain application developers” yet no one has heard of him. He is supposed to have 20 years coding experience, yet he hasn’t published anything to Github under that name, or even made a Facebook or Twitter account. What kind of coder, especially a “blockchain” developer, works for that long and has nothing public to show for it?  Time Markov is unGoogleable because his name brings up results for Markov’s Chain, a mathematical principal named in the 1900s. Searching for “Time Markov bitcoin” and “Time Markov blockchain” reveals no relevant results.  Furthermore, Qtum isn’t open source, at least not yet. Their GitHub page is empty. They won’t release the code until after the ICO. Of course investors will have committed their money by that time. They are ultimately asking investors to join in based solely on the experience of their team.  But that team only includes a few minor figures from the crypto world, a whole bunch of unknowns with no google search results, someone who probably exaggerates their Rubik’s Cube capabilities and a founder who either has a past that he seemingly hid from investors and involved the loss of hundreds of Bitcoins.  How Did Qtum Get So Much Attention?  As is so often the case in the cryptocurrency world: Shitty journalism led to its ride. The actions of the bitcoin media is almost understandable. After all, many probably assume that if the likes of Ver are involved, then it must have been vetted by someone. But the truth could be that the Angel Investors are depending on the media.  The first mention of Qtum in a semi-reputable cryptocurrency news site comes from CryptoCoinNews. Their article mentions Qtum winning a hack-a-thon prize hosted by ChainB.  Next, an article by CoinDesk founder Pete Rizzo announced that Qtum received funding by several high profile investors. There, Rizzo mistakenly called the cryptocurrency “open-source” though it’s Github page is empty.  With the credibility of CoinDesk behind it, Qtum began getting more mainstream attention.  Nasdaq.com, Siliconangle and EconoTimes all wrote articles based on the CoinDesk original.  Then, on January 24th, Bitcoin.com’s Jamie Redman wrote an article about Qtum. That article, like the ones before it, parroted the claims made by the Qtum team.  But the biggest bump to Qtum’s visibility was an article by a Forbes Contributor. Roger Aitken will seemingly write about any two-bit cryptocurrency project. Aitken wrote a poorly researched article that shows his tenuous grasp (at best) of blockchain technology. He says Qtum is attempting to be the “blockchain of China” even though regional cryptocurrencies are a long dead fad and were never workable.  Aitken’s articles take phrases straight out of the Qtum website, word for word. “[Jordan] has been developing software since he was thirteen, reviewed over 100 altcoins and identified multiple exploits in coins” appears both on the Qtum website and Aitken’s article.  After Forbes, several other media outlets covered Qtum, including Finance Magnates and the International Business Times UK. Later, Bitcoin.com released a later article with a curious note at the bottom.  “Disclaimer: Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com, is a Qtum investor.”  With Ver’s name officially attached, Qtum seemed likely to be the first big ICO of 2017 largely due to the articles that gave it credibility.  Qtum.org's Alexa.com statistics Qtum.org’s Alexa.com statistics The problem with all these articles is that no one stopped to ask: who is Patrick Dai? Why does Googling his name reveal so few results? And most important: What did he actually do before Qtum?  Because what someone has done in the past is usually the best indicator of how they will behave in the future.",False

We have received unprecedented support from our community, and the press has been covering this closely.  Recently, there was an article on Forbes.com:    https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogeraitken/2017/03/17/qtums-blockchain-crowdfund-scores-over-12m-from-bitcoin-ethereum-investors/#14f1120234ef          Qtum's Blockchain Crowdfund Scores Over $12M From Bitcoin & Ethereum Investors  Roger Aitken  Contributor  I write about financial markets, exchanges, IT and trading technology.  Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.  While Qtum, an open-source software based on cryptographic protocol that will exist on the peer-to-peer network hosting the public transaction ledger (the blockchain), has raised over $12 million - and c. 9,000 Bitcoins - just a day after its crowdfund started and smashed expectations, it’s not a “risk-free investment” according to the offering prospectus.  Although officially slated to run for another 28 days until April 15, matters around their crowdfund might be wrapped up in next few days if the present level of investment interest and run rate continues.  That would mean the ‘Early Bird’ period from March 16-18, where 3,800 QTUM tokens are priced at 1 BTC (3,800 QTUM and 115 QTUM for 1 ETH (Ethereum) - due to ETH's price fluctuation - might not see downward QTUM ETH price adjustments next week (i.e. stipulated at 3,600 for 1 BTC and 105 for 1 ETH from March 18-25).  At the time of writing on day two of the Singapore-registered venture’s crowdfund campaign, 81.72% of Qtum tokens - equivalent to 41,674,877.4813 QTUM units - had been raised. By 6.40pm GMT today it had attracted investment of nine thousand (8,995.104) Bitcoin (BTC) and 64,728.7538 Ethereum (ETH).  In so doing, the project behind this blockchain project, the source code of which comprises the basis for the cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the generation, use and transactions of the Quantum’s native built-in cryptographic tokens - called ‘QTUM’, should have sufficient funds to reached stated goals of public test of the platform in the second quarter (Q2) and launch during the third quarter (Q3) this year.  (Image: Shutterstock).  While the prototype to the Quantum system was completed in Q4 (October) last year it is understood as of this month internal testing remains ongoing.  In order to fund the coding, building the ecosystem, development, promotion and other overheads of the Quantum, the QTUM Foundation initiated its crowdsale campaign to raise funds in crypto-currencies from the backers globally. For Qtum their target was to achieve 100% of the crowdsale within 30 days.  Given the investment interest displayed by Ethereum and Bitcoin enthusiasts from the get go of the crowdfund - now with a little less than a fifth of QTUM tokens remaining in an offering representing 51% of the initial QTUM supply (51 million tokens) - it would seem that the money pledged by the backers is a positive sign for the project’s future success. Or at least it might well give that impression.  And, surpassing the $12m mark in around 24 hours is some going that few had anticipated. But no doubt helping matters is that fact that there are some big hitters in the cyptocurrency space behind the Qtum Project, including one of the biggest bitcoin holders in China and the billionaire founder of the leading taxi hailing firm in the country today.  PwC Support Gained  Add to that it was officially revealed on March 6 that leading professional services firm PwC is supporting Qtum’s efforts to fuel Blockchain adoption across global business sectors. This includes providing comments on a white paper to be prepared by the project team, as well as on their proposed project governance structure.  PwC China’s Fintech and Cybersecurity partner CY Cheung commenting in the wake of its support: “PwC sees enormous potential for blockchain to revolutionize business practices as we know them, and the firm has made great efforts in developing strategic and technical capabilities to adapt existing products and services for the new technology.”  He added: “We’re excited to get involved in the era of innovation and help companies capture the opportunities and benefits brought by the new technology. Working with the Qtum Foundation aligns with our goal.”  Qtum provides what is called a Turing-complete blockchain stack, able to execute smart contracts and decentralized applications, comparable to the Ethereum blockchain. But in contrast to Ethereum, Qtum is built upon Bitcoin’s UTXO transaction model and employs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.  Such augmentations are touted to have “far-reaching implications for the utility of the Qtum blockchain” by the team behind the project.  Both the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains are based on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which secures the blockchain by rendering attacks very resource intensive - both in energy and time - due to what are labelled as “artificially arduous computations”, which are demanded from miners participating in the so-called ‘block-verification’ game.  Furthermore, Qtum aims to establish an array of services, designed to bridge the still existing gap between blockchains and the business world. These include tools and methods to standardize the workflow of business smart contract development, and a hub of tested and verified smart contract templates, addressing various specialized business use cases.  Qtum Investment: ‘Not Risk Free’  All that aside, investors are minded to note that they should have read the ‘Prospectus of QTUM Crowdsale’ that details the conditions. In this connection, 51% of the initial QTUM supply of the Quantum will be available for sale during the Campaign. There are a few interesting points in there that caught my attention, if investors have not already seen them.  It states in this 30-page prospectus dated March 13, 2017, that: “Purchase holding or use of any QTUM is not risk-free” and directs potential investors to Chapter 5's ‘Risk Factors’ details. Their website points out too that “Crypto-token crowdsale is high risk by nature”. And, the Agreement will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Singapore.  Crowdsale Participation  The document further goes on to explain that: “Crowdsale will not involve issuance of any currency, securities (whether equity securities or otherwise) or other kind of investment certificate.  In fact, the QTUM to be sold during the Crowdsale are described as being “merely cryptographic tokens usable on the blockchain of the Quantum.” These tokens are not redeemable, associated with financial return or backed by any underlying asset or repurchase commitment. And, “do not necessarily have market prices or transactions between peers.”  Additionally, investors in QTUM are advised through the prospectus that: “You shall not participate in the Crowdsale with a view to investment or speculation or in pursuit of any profit.” Naysayers might ask what one is actually investing in, although it’s a punt on the future.  ‘Non-Financial’ Nature  The prospectus also states: “Being merely the virtual fuel for the running of the Quantum, by nature QTUM is not and shall in no case be understood, deemed, interpreted or construed as: any kind of currency or money, whether fiat or not; equity interest, voting or non-voting securities (or its like) in, or claims against, the QTUM Foundation or any other entity in any jurisdiction.”  Turning to point 19 (‘Liquidity’) among 22 listed risk factors, it goes on to say that:  “QTUM is not a currency issued by any individual, entity, central bank or national, supra-national or quasi-national organization, nor is it backed by any hard assets or other credit. The circulation and trading of QTUM on the market are not what the QTUM Foundation is responsible for or pursues.”  It added: “Trading of QTUM merely depends on the consensus on its value between the relevant market participants. Nobody is obliged to redeem or purchase any QTUM from any QTUM holder (including the Purchasers). Nor does anyone guarantee the liquidity or market price of QTUM to any extent at any time.”  In order for an investor for divest their QTUM portfolio, it is pointed out that a QTUM holder would have to “locate one or more willing buyers to purchase the same at a mutually agreed price, which attempt could be costly and time-consuming and does not necessarily bear fruit.” And, there could be “no crypto-currency exchange or other marketplace having QTUM listed thereon for trading.”  Development Milestones  Last October the prototype to the Quantum system was completed and of this March internal test of the Quantum is ongoing. The anticipated public test is scheduled for Q2 2017 with the launch set for Q3 later this year, although it is explained that these dates “do not constitute any binding commitment” for the QTUM Foundation or anyone else to deliver QTUM by the respective dates.  In terms of how popular the system could be going forward, point 18 in  the risk factors, it is pointed out: “The value of QTUM hinges heavily on the popularity of the Quantum system. [It] is not expected to be popular, prevalent or widely used soon after the launch.”  Based on the “worst-case scenario”, Quantum may even “remain marginalized in the long run, appealing to only a minimal portion of the users and application developers.” By contrast, a significant portion of QTUM demand could be of speculative nature.  Furthermore: “The lack of users and commercial utilization may result in increasing volatility of QTUM market price and consequently compromise the Quantum’s long-term development.” And, it is stressed that the QTUM Foundation will not - nor has the responsibility to - “stabilize or otherwise affect QTUM’s market price if there is any such price.”  Reassuring at least that such aspects have been addressed and made clear, although one would have expected such details to be outlined in the prospectus. Food for thought nevertheless.

Avi Mizrahi | News (CryptoCurrency) | Friday, 17/03/2017|10:18 GMT     It seems there are plenty of crypto-investors in China eager for a new smart contracts solution. Less than one day in and the QTUM token crowdsale already raised more than $12 million worth of cryptocurrencies (over 8,000 BTC and 60,000 ETH) – reaching 75% of its final goal.  Qtum allows smart contract usage without having to install heavy, specialized software. With this, smart contracts can be used with light wallet apps in low data storage environments, such as mobile phones, tablets and Internet-of-Things (IoT) appliances. This is done by stacking the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on top of Bitcoin’s unspent transaction output (UTXO) architecture.  QTUM are the cryptographic software tokens used to engage with distributed applications and smart contracts on the Qtum platform, and will serve as the staking currency of the Qtum blockchain, as well as fuel for computational operations performed by the Qtum network.  The crowdsale is taking place at these mostly Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges and crowdfunding portals: Bizhongchou, Yunbi, ICOAGE, Allcoin, ICO365, and BTC9.  Ahead of the public crowdsale, Qtum has raised $1 million from investors including Chen Weixing (Kuaidi), Star Xu (OkCoin), Anthony Di Iorio (Ethereum, Jaxx Blockchain Interface), Jeremy Gardner (Augur), Fenbushi Capital’s Managing Partner Bo Shen, and angel investor Xiaolai Li.",False

Enterprise-grade blockchain solutions provider Bloq has launched an initiative to further sponsor what it sees as critical open-source projects in the bitcoin and blockchain ecosystems, BloqLabs. Jeff Garzik, CEO & co-founder, Bloq  “In the 1900s, Bell Labs become known as the ‘The Idea Factory’ for global telecommunications,” explained Jeff Garzik, CEO and Co-founder of Bloq. “BloqLabs can set the tone for the blockchain era and ensure enterprises are tapping into every innovation from our vibrant community of developers.”  BloqLabs launches with several projects and platforms supported by Bloq. These include: Drivechains, Qtum, VeriBlock, bitcoinj and the Android Bitcoin Wallet.  Andreas Schildbach, a developer at Bloq known for creating the first bitcoin wallet for Android, maintains the bitcoinj repository primarily used in bitcoin wallets and transaction services globally. “Open source is at the core of Bloq’s DNA, as both a patron and developer,” commented Schildbach. “I’m grateful for Bloq sponsoring work in open source blockchain software.” Patrick Dai, founder of Qtum  “Businesses have been exploring blockchain technology for years now, but without widespread adoption. BloqLabs aligns with Qtum’s goal to bridge the gap between the business and technical worlds with open-source solutions that meet the commercial needs for privacy, security, and most importantly, usability,” said Patrick Dai, co-founder of the Qtum Project.  Paul Sztorc is an economist at Bloq and chief architect behind Drivechains, a technology that allows a blockchain system to temporarily mimic the properties of another, ensuring interoperability. “The record is clear: open source is the way to go – it’s better, faster, and more secure,” said Sztorc. “I’m thrilled to have Bloq sponsor the project, few companies are this generous.”",False

The initial cohort of supported projects will include Drivechain, Qtum, VeriBlock, bitcoinj and the Android Bitcoin Wallet.   https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bloq-invests-blockchain-innovation-bloqlabs-joins-ethereum-enterprise-alliance/      by Michael Scott   Two announcements from the DC Blockchain Summit came from Bloq, a pioneer in the development of enterprise-grade blockchain solutions. First, the company announced the creation of BloqLabs to boost its ongoing sponsorship while bringing support to viable open-source projects in the Bitcoin and blockchain space.  Second, Bloq revealed that it will be joining the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), an alliance that connects Fortune 500 enterprises, startups, academics and technology vendors with Ethereum thought leaders and experts. Bloq Co-Founder and CEO Jeff Garzik has been appointed to the alliance’s Technical Steering Board.  Introducing BloqLabs  According to Garzik, BloqLabs aspires to set the tone for blockchain technology, ensuring that enterprises are embracing innovations from the community’s robust ecosystem of developers.  As such, BloqLabs will support and help to develop several key projects and platforms. The initial cohort of supported projects will include Drivechain, Qtum, VeriBlock, bitcoinj and the Android Bitcoin Wallet.  “Open source is at the core of Bloq’s DNA, as both a patron and developer,” said Andreas Schildbach, developer at Bloq and the developer of the first bitcoin wallet for Android. He also maintains the bitcoinj repository primarily used in bitcoin wallets and transaction services globally. “I'm grateful for Bloq sponsoring work in open source blockchain software.”  Paul Sztorc, an economist at Bloq and chief architect behind Drivechain, concurred. “The record is clear: open source is the way to go — it’s better, faster and more secure,” he said. “I’m thrilled to have Bloq sponsor the project; few companies are this generous.”  “Businesses have been exploring blockchain technology for years now, but without widespread adoption,” said Patrick Dai, co-founder of the Qtum Project, another early recipient of BloqLabs’ support. “BloqLabs aligns with Qtum’s goal to bridge the gap between the business and technical worlds with open-source solutions that meet the commercial needs for privacy, security and, most importantly, usability.”  “BloqLabs will serve as the platform for deeper engagement between enterprises and the open source community, just like Bell Labs and Xerox Parc did for networks and technologies we use every day,” Garzik said to Bitcoin Magazine. “We’re excited to be kicking off BloqLabs with such a diverse group of projects and established leaders in bitcoin and blockchain [technology].”  Joining Forces With the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance  Further emphasizing Bloq’s commitment to broader blockchain solutions, Bloq has joined the company of Microsoft, J.P. Morgan, BNY Mellon, BG, ING, Thomson Reuters and ConsenSys, as a member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. Garzik has also accepted a position on the Technical Steering Board of the alliance.  Announced on February 28, 2017, the mandate of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance is to build, promote and broadly support Ethereum-based technology.  “Initiatives like the EEA and BloqLabs will be critical to connecting enterprises with open source blockchain innovation,” said Garzik. “We’re thrilled to contribute our time, energy and insights to this project, and I’m honored to be appointed to the Technical Steering Board.”  “Jeff [Garzik] is a legend of the open source community and has been one of the most prominent advocates for strong technical governance of public blockchains,” said Jeremy Millar, chief of staff of ConsenSys and board member of the EEA. “Combined with his experiences from the Linux Foundation, Red Hat and Bitcoin Core, Jeff is a tremendous addition to our technical leadership.”  Bloq delivers blockchain technology solutions for global enterprises. Its software platform enables companies to build, manage and scale solid blockchain-enabled ecosystems, all backed by enterprise-grade service and support.  Led by a team of world-class blockchain developers, entrepreneurs and investors, the company utilizes open-source technology, providing key linkages for secure interoperability with prevailing business systems. Its technology targets critical business issues surrounding security, provenance, authentication and reconciliation.  Over the past five months, Bloq has been in a major expansion mode, having acquired blockchain analytics pioneer Skry as well as co-launching Vulcan Digital Asset Services. The latter is a platform that gives digital assets utility for everyday banking, commerce and assets services, through PwC Australia.

I was pretty broke back then so $100 was a lot to me but needless to say I was pretty sad about that since I was there reading the thread pre ico.

Smart contracts and decentralized applications (DAPPs) are coming to mobile phones, tablets and IoT appliances according to the Qtum Foundation, the Singapore-based foundation driving the development of Qtum, the open-source value transfer protocol and decentralized-application platform for businesses.  The first blockchain protocol that can execute smart contracts with a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism based on an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model, Qtum believes mobile stakeholders will be an important part of its network and will include businesses as well as individuals.  Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Qtum Co-Founder and CEO Patrick Dai stated, “We want Qtum to be the easiest blockchain network to use. That’s why we are pushing our Go-Mobile strategy. Today, everyone and everything is moving, that’s why we can’t have a network that is run by stationary objects.”  Qtum makes this possible through a combination of features of the Ethereum and Bitcoin protocols. Existing smart contract platforms require clients to run a full node and hold a full blockchain copy to run DAPPs, an untenable prospect for smaller devices in a low bandwidth environment. Qtum gets around this requirement by stacking the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on top of Bitcoin’s UTXO architecture, making EVM accessible with lite wallets and the SVP protocol.  This innovation allows users to interact with the Bitcoin network and validate their own transactions without having to download and sync with the entire blockchain.  “Making smart contracts work on smartphones and tablets heralds a new age in the field of decentralized computation,” said Dai. “With about half of all internet traffic being generated by mobile devices, every real-world use case for decentralized applications would massively benefit from mobile support — especially if we’re taking the tendencies of developing markets into account.”  Highlighting Qtum’s goal of being a protocol for commercial applications, Dai also noted that “bringing the blockchain to mobile devices isn’t just about consumers, it’s one of the primary platforms for businesses.”  Following heavy community interest, Qtum decided to bring forward the release of a source code snapshot for public review, illustrating how the platform will work.  In addition to bringing smart contract and DAPP functionality to mobile and connected devices, Qtum sees its platform as a way for smart contract technology to be utilized to control “non-smart” hardware, bringing even legacy hardware and devices into a blockchain-secured IoT.  “Relying on existing Raspberry Pi–like devices already present in most standard appliances, Qtum smart contracts can potentially control any device with an accessible API,” said Jordan Earls, co-founder of the Qtum Project. “This way the interaction of ‘things’ in a given business could be programmed and orchestrated with very little investment in specialized hardware.”  With smart city initiatives aiming to utilize blockchain technology to support connected infrastructure and automated services being announced in the last year for China by the Wanxiang Group and for Singapore by the Singaporean government, the environment may be right for Qtum to roll out the feature-rich protocol they have been building.  The Qtum Foundation, having engaged PwC for project management support, will conduct a crowdsale of its Qtum blockchain token starting on March 16. After the crowdsale, further testing of the Qtum blockchain will be conducted before the platform goes live.",False

This marks quite a significant milestone for this smart contract-oriented project, as it gives the whole world a peek at what the future will hold. Developing an open-source blockchains tack for legacy business use cases is a massive undertaking, and the Qtum Foundation wants to be as transparent about this project as possible.  Ever since Qtum announced their plans, the cryptocurrency community has been buzzing with excitement. A lot of developers and coding enthusiasts requested to see the source code. The Qtum Foundation takes these requests very seriously and decided to unveil a source code snapshot for public review. Unlike other projects, which tend to keep their source code under wraps, the Qtum Foundation welcomes public review and any feedback community members are willing to provide.  The full source code for the Qtum project will be disclosed on GitHub in Q2 2017. This date also marks the launch of the Qtum testnet. Once this source code is revealed, the whole world will gain valuable insights into the code history and all git commits by the developers. It is good to see this team embrace transparency and public review, as that will help legitimize this project as a whole.  Blockchain Platform for Mobile Smart Contracts  In other Qtum news, the team also announced smart contracts and Dapps on the platform will function on mobile and IoT devices. Go Mobile, as the strategy is called, is designed to prepare blockchain technology for the mobile space. Considering how Qtum allows smart contracts use without requiring specialized software, it makes a lot of sense to extend this functionality to mobile and IoT devices moving forward.  More details can be found in the organization’s whitepaper. In the video below this article, interested parties can see a smart contract operating on an Android phone.  Qtum co-founder Patrick Dai stated:      “Making smart contracts work on smartphones and tablets heralds a new age in the field of decentralized computation. With about half of all internet traffic being generated by mobile devices, every real-world use case for decentralized applications would massively benefit from mobile support – especially if we’re taking the tendencies of developing markets into account.”  Additionally, the Qtum blockchain token crowdsale will commence on March 16. Six cryptocurrency exchanges will facilitate the crowdsale, which is an industry first. It is evident there is a lot of anticipation associated with Qtum. Moreover, some of the industry’s most prominent figures are backing Qtum at an early stage, indicating there is plenty of reason for optimism.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TucgSvwTDHo",False

He left the currency after it faced controversy involving himself and did not reveal his past to potential investors. He admitted to his past after being confronted with irrefutable evidence.  Qtum claims several high profile investors, including Roger Ver, Anthony Di lorio, and OKCoin CEO Xu Star.  According to chat logs, Steven Dai was the founder of Bitbay. That coin attracted significant controversy after a convoluted scheme that netted the founders thousands of bitcoins was revealed. The chatlogs revealed that the Bitbay launch was manipulated by two notorious alt-coin market whale groups known as bobsurplus and Gekko, the BTER exchange itself, and possibly Dai.   After two years of silence, Steven Dai is back as Patrick Dai.  A photo of BitBay funder Elmer Lin standing next to Patrick Dai seemingly proves that Lin met Patrick Dai.      Questions about Dai’s past were initially ignored by the Qtum foundation and Dai. Two days after the issue was first raised on Twitter and through Slack, Dai finally issued a statement admitting to his past persona. He has ignored requests for comment sent to his email. The Qtum foundation itself initially replied to a request for comment saying that a statement would come the next day but has since ignored requests for additional comments.  In his statement, Dai denied any wrongdoing during the BitBay Scandal. He claims that he decided to leave the community after discovering the “questionable ends and actions” in the coin.  According to Qtum’s website and an article on the Ver owned Bitcoin.com, Roger Ver is one of many high-profile investors in Qtum. Others include Ethereum alum Anthony Di lorio, Jeremy Gardner and the CEO of Chinese Exchange OKCoin, Xu Star. [Side Note: Ver is reportedly suing Star’s OKCoin in an unrelated issue.]  We contacted Ver, Di lorio and Gardner to confirm or deny their investments. Only Gardner replied, confirming his investment. When I asked if he knew of Patrick Dai’s past as Steven Dai, he did not respond.  The Qtum foundation did release their statement, saying that they were initially unaware of Dai’s past but are standing by him.  The BitBay scheme was primarily revealed through chatlogs released by Zimbeck. After the scandal’s release, Zimbeck defended Dai as the only honest person in the group that included Dai, Bobsurplus and Gekko. Today, both Zimbeck and BitBay’s largest investor say Dai left them without support and they allege he stole funds from the BitBay Developer fund and ICO on his way out.  Dai denies that he stole money from Zimbeck or the BitBay investors.He also points to one $500 payment to Zimbeck for development after the scheme was revealed. Zimbeck contends that $500 over two years is not sufficient funding of a coin and is only a fraction of the haul he says Dai gained from the BitBay scheme.  While much of the conversation on Slack has focused on if Dai stole from the BitBay ICO or if he was an innocent victim of Bobsurplus and Gekko. That ignores the larger point: why wasn’t his past disclosed previously?  If Dai was completely innocent in the BitBay scandal, and if he had no ill-intentions with Qtum then he should have been upfront with all of his investors. If he revealed it to the high-profile VCs that have invested is also irrelevant. The fact that he was asking for ICO investment without revealing his past to the public means potential ICO investors would have invested without that information.  Besides the founder who changed his name after being involved in a scam, Qtum has some other red flags.  Besides The Founder, What is Wrong With Qtum?  Qtum does a few things right. The developers designed a competent website and wrote two interesting whitepapers. Digging a bit deeper reveals some troubling issues.  The site includes a Team page with pictures of various team members. That would be a good thing, except for what it doesn’t include: No social media links. No last names (besides Patrick Dai) and no evidence that the team members are who they claim to be. One, “Caspal” claims to hold thirty Chinese and Asian records for Rubik’s Cube competition, as well as 21 gold medals.  According to the World Cube Association,  there is no one named Caspal in the top 100 solvers in the world. Nor is there a “Caspal” in the top 100 solvers in Asia, or even in the top 100 solvers in China. I checked the top ten solvers in China’s photographs, and none of them matched Caspal’s photograph.  While it is possible that Caspal was a Rubik’s Cube champion in Asia under a different name, without a real, full name, it is impossible to be sure. Especially since they are ignoring my interview requests. It sounds absurd slamming a coin for possibly exaggerating the Rubik’s Cube solving capabilities of their team but if they thought it important enough to mention, it must be important enough to question.  Some of the team behind Qtum, also seem to be working on a completely unrelated Blockchain as a Service project called Bitse. Besides Dai, there are two Qtum team members working on the Bitse project and have their last names listed: Neil Mahi and Time Markov.  Neil Mahi, is the second person listed on the Qtum team page after Dai. Googling his name gives no relevant results. The Bitse team page calls him “One of the most seasoned and greatest blockchain application developers” yet no one has heard of him. He is supposed to have 20 years coding experience, yet he hasn’t published anything to Github under that name, or even made a Facebook or Twitter account. What kind of coder, especially a “blockchain” developer, works for that long and has nothing public to show for it?  Time Markov is unGoogleable because his name brings up results for Markov’s Chain, a mathematical principal named in the 1900s. Searching for “Time Markov bitcoin” and “Time Markov blockchain” reveals no relevant results.  Furthermore, Qtum isn’t open source, at least not yet. Their GitHub page is empty. They won’t release the code until after the ICO. Of course investors will have committed their money by that time. They are ultimately asking investors to join in based solely on the experience of their team.  But that team only includes a few minor figures from the crypto world, a whole bunch of unknowns with no google search results, someone who probably exaggerates their Rubik’s Cube capabilities and a founder who either has a past that he seemingly hid from investors and involved the loss of hundreds of Bitcoins.  How Did Qtum Get So Much Attention?  As is so often the case in the cryptocurrency world: Shitty journalism led to its ride. The actions of the bitcoin media is almost understandable. After all, many probably assume that if the likes of Ver are involved, then it must have been vetted by someone. But the truth could be that the Angel Investors are depending on the media.  The first mention of Qtum in a semi-reputable cryptocurrency news site comes from CryptoCoinNews. Their article mentions Qtum winning a hack-a-thon prize hosted by ChainB.  Next, an article by CoinDesk founder Pete Rizzo announced that Qtum received funding by several high profile investors. There, Rizzo mistakenly called the cryptocurrency “open-source” though it’s Github page is empty.  With the credibility of CoinDesk behind it, Qtum began getting more mainstream attention.  Nasdaq.com, Siliconangle and EconoTimes all wrote articles based on the CoinDesk original.  Then, on January 24th, Bitcoin.com’s Jamie Redman wrote an article about Qtum. That article, like the ones before it, parroted the claims made by the Qtum team.  But the biggest bump to Qtum’s visibility was an article by a Forbes Contributor. Roger Aitken will seemingly write about any two-bit cryptocurrency project. Aitken wrote a poorly researched article that shows his tenuous grasp (at best) of blockchain technology. He says Qtum is attempting to be the “blockchain of China” even though regional cryptocurrencies are a long dead fad and were never workable.  Aitken’s articles take phrases straight out of the Qtum website, word for word. “[Jordan] has been developing software since he was thirteen, reviewed over 100 altcoins and identified multiple exploits in coins” appears both on the Qtum website and Aitken’s article.  After Forbes, several other media outlets covered Qtum, including Finance Magnates and the International Business Times UK. Later, Bitcoin.com released a later article with a curious note at the bottom.  “Disclaimer: Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com, is a Qtum investor.”  With Ver’s name officially attached, Qtum seemed likely to be the first big ICO of 2017 largely due to the articles that gave it credibility.  Qtum.org's Alexa.com statistics Qtum.org’s Alexa.com statistics The problem with all these articles is that no one stopped to ask: who is Patrick Dai? Why does Googling his name reveal so few results? And most important: What did he actually do before Qtum?  Because what someone has done in the past is usually the best indicator of how they will behave in the future.  http://coinjournal.net/ver-backed-qtum-started-bitbay-dai/",False

The developers explain that in contrast to existing smart contract platforms, which require a full node and blockchain copy to be present on a client app to execute decentralized applications, Qtum allows smart contract usage without having to install heavy, specialized software. With this, smart contracts can be used in low data storage environments, such as smartphones and IoT devices.  This is done by stacking the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on top of Bitcoin’s unspent transaction output (UTXO) architecture. With this, the EVM is accessible with lite wallets. Lite wallets, utilizing the SPV protocol, allow users to interact with the bitcoin network and validate their own transactions, without having to download and sync with the entire blockchain.   Patrick Dai, CEO and co-founder of Qtum, commented: “Making smart contracts work on smartphones and tablets heralds a new age in the field of decentralized computation. With about half of all internet traffic being generated by mobile devices, every real-world use case for decentralized applications would massively benefit from mobile support – especially if we’re taking the tendencies of developing markets into account.” Get smart  In addition to mobile support for decentralized applications, Qtum describes its platform as suited for business automation and the development of a blockchain-secured IoT, allowing existing “non-smart” hardware to be controlled and operated with smart contracts, without having to be augmented with specialized proprietary systems. Jordan Earlz, co-founder explains:  “Relying on existing Raspberry Pi-like devices already present in most standard appliances, Qtum smart contracts can potentially control any device with an accessible API. This way the interaction of “things” in a given business could be programmed and orchestrated with very little investment in specialized hardware.” Jordan Earlz, co-founder of the Qtum Project",False

Aaaand they are only selling 51% of the supply. So they hope to reach an initial market capitalization of around 30 million. Lol.  Here's my take on the ICO, without even having to consider the very real possibility of this being an outright scam:  They want to raise 15 million dollars in the ICO for only 51% of the supply. That's an initial market capitalization of 30 million. Based on what? What justifies the biggest initial market capitalization in the history of crypto ICOs? How is this supposed to look appealing to an ICO investor? There is little room to grow and tons of room for the price to fall. Now factor in the additional fact the team is also going to have 29% of the supply that they will be selling to further fund the project (as if 15 million isn't enough?) and the fact the angel backers invested only ~1 million and got 20% of the supply meaning they paid 1/6th what ICO investors will have to pay and they can dump their coins all the way down to 1/6 the ICO price and sell for a profit all the way down. Now how does this look for ICO investors? Like a total ripoff? Looks like a one stage pyramid scheme to benefit the angel investors and team only. How the hell are you going to support an initial market cap of 30 mil when you also have that sell pressure coming from the 49% premine?  Why wouldn't somebody just wait until after the ICO to buy on the inevitable dump below ICO price? That way you could also wait and see for certain whether or not it is a scam.",False

Or is that where your salary solely comes from? Because you already plan on raising 15 million USD, why do you need 12% of supply as well? 12% of the supply would be valued at over 3.5 million if you end up raising 15 mil during the sale of 51% of the supply in the ICO.  And yeah I can read all about how you plan to use the 29% but that still doesn't justify why you need to withhold 29% of the supply for promotions etc in the first place when you are planning on raising 15 million USD from ICO investors (and already have raised 1 million from angel investors, right?). Why can't you use some of that 16 million instead of screwing ICO investors over by taking away a huge chunk (more than 1/4th) of the supply available to them during the ICO? How hard of a idea is it for you to grasp that a 49% premine + 15 million USD ICO is an unprecedented and unjustified funding structure? I know you aren't going to budge, but if you think people are going to stop criticizing this aspect of the ICO you are dead wrong. And it will have an effect on how many people participate and how much money they are willing to risk. I guess we will just have to wait and see how the ICO turns out, but if it is a flop I would guess that has more to do with the ICO structure and logistics than it does with the scam accusations.",False

The international team, led by a predominantly Chinese management, introduced a blockchain platform, combining Bitcoin’s proven-to-deliver architecture with Ethereum’s smart contracting abilities, essentially introducing an improved version of Ethereum, running on a Bitcoin blockchain, while being compatible with both ecosystems.  Following legacy interest, but still taking the industry by surprise, the company recently announced that its business white paper has been co-developed by one of the ‘big four’ consultant agencies, being the first blockchain startup of its kind to do so.  https://qtum.org/uploads/files/cf6d69348ca50dd985b60425ccf282f3.pdf   Correct me if I'm wong, but I don't see PwC on the list of names attached to the linked-to Qtum's white paper, OR PwC or PricewaterhouseCoopers mentioned anywhere within.  Further, Qtum's white paper was released long after the Angel Backers supposedly seeded Qtum with their combined $1M USD, Qtum gladly taking the USD in spite of not legally able to accept US citizen investors for its non-profit having its charter in Singapore, specifically move from Mainland China so not to concern themselves with them pesky regulators.  To date, Qtum continues to NOT address even the most basic concerns like what the fuck is their founder's real legal name known here as Patrick Dai, yet due to KYC and AML regulations, ALL its investors MUST provide documentation proving who the fuck they are. Then again, Qtum is ONLY seeking $30M, so why the fuck should this community care. It's not like deals are being made in the back room somewhere atop an elephant. Oh, wait!",False

Boy, WAS I SO WONG!  I've previous alluded to Qtum NOT having a massive Chinese following. Well, as you'll soon read, Qtum's Chinese following is even more massive than Chantha Owen Lueung's Crypto-city updates. Below, I not only provided the link so that you can verify that what follows is genuine, but copy&paste every convo in Chinese on Qtum's Slack channel AND TOOK THE TIME TO TRANSLATE IT TO ENGLISH (already started with the Lithuanian translation). I suggest you get yourself a giant panda cup of coffee prior to tackling the MASSIVE leak that I was paid to not provide. Oh, and a couple cartons of cigarettes if you smoke should also be at your ready next to your piss can and bed pan for those still having to tether to the Internet. Again, fair warning: a MASSIVE read. MASSIVE! Did I say it was MASSIVE? If not, it's MASSIVE!  Qtum's Chinese Slack is much more massive than it's English counterpart which only weighs in at 6.96MB to date. I would share with you the weight of the QCS, but seriously don't want to put myself in position of being wong again, so I won't. Suffice to say, it's off the charts, predicated on if you read left to right, or right to left.  You'll soon read stuff penned by astute Chinese investors inquiring about Qtum like where is GitHub, then Team Qtum replies with watch us build beautiful projects; where do I find ICO? with a reply of on several platforms and on our website; then a big party is mention; the list is extensive as you'll soon learn upon reading the below.  Again, my takeaway is that the following is PROOF POSITIVE that Qtum has a MASSIVE, MASSIVE, MASSIVE Chinese following. I WAS SO WONG!

Recently, we have begun work on a new website. That should be ready in about 3 weeks, until then, we will continue to use the current one (https://qtum.org). The section where we list our Angel Backers has been updated, we will reveal more names shortly once we have approval. We plan to discuss with our Angels why they decided to support our project, and what they expect from our team in the future.   The Qtum Crowd Sale will start on March 1st. We currently have enough funds to last until the sale ends on April 1st. The Crowd Sale will be hosted by major Chinese exchanges, which will be announced in February. There will also be a direct sale that is done on our website. The concrete information about the Crowd Sale will be announced in our business whitepaper prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers. The technical whitepaper will come out mid-February. The draft section that we released a few weeks back was from the last revision of the whitepaper, so that portion will be completely redone for the new version.  On the Press front, we have done a decent job gaining traction with Blockchain industry sites. Our focus right now is engaging with the mainstream press. A large part of this project involves preparing a Blockchain project for real world business applications. We already have a signed partnership agreement with a company valued at 100 million dollars USD, which we will discuss later. We are currently in discussions with more companies, who are excited about our “Go Mobile” strategy. This was actually the portion of our project that convinced a billionaire to back Qtum.  Our development team is currently merging the Proof-of-Stake protocol into Bitcoin Core v0.13, along with some testing of the Account Abstract layer we implemented to allow the EVM to run on a UTXO model. The screenshot earlier of the mobile wallet is what you can expect to see once we have a working testnet. Jordan Earls can give a better update on this later, and it’s best to ask him questions directly if you want more details.  Again, if you would like to speak with our team directly, there is always someone on Slack:  https://qtumslack.herokuapp.com/  Fuck me in the ass! Qtum's OP on SeemIt also has a MASSIVE following - 5 votes, earning them a MASSIVE $0.56, of which has already been withdrawal and safely in the hands of PwC maintaining Qtum's financials.

To whom are Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) made? Please include a link to their website.  A18. Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) are reported to Commercial Affairs Department of Singapore - http://www.cad.gov.sg/amlcft/stro/  Hello, sirs,  You don't know me, but I'm an infamous paid-to-not-post troll on BitcoinTalk, my main nemesis is cocksuckeroverflow.  Would you be so kind as to let me know where you want me to send the research documents I've amassed recently on an entity known in these here parts as Qtum, a non-profit registered in Singapore?  During the fall of 2016, Qtum amassed over $600K in bitcoins stemming from sources known and unknown, both highly suspicious having nefarious roots. A large portion of said bitcoins were liquidated just prior to Qtum registering its charter in Singapore as a non-profit.  Soon thereafter, they claimed to amassed one million dollars in funding solely to get their ducks in a row for their highly hyped ICO (akin to an IPO, but in the cryptocurrency space), a major chunk of said million coming from the same source Qtum just liquidated the aforementioned bitcoins days prior. Qtum's original goal was to amassed only $10M, but recently was upped it to $15M, with accounts now having the sum upped even further to $30M.  Many folks on the BitcoinTalk forum and Qtum's Slack channel have asked myriad questions, all but the most mundane were ignored, with the few addressed raising even more questions. Qtum also claims to be working hand-in-hand with PwC, but has yet provided an iota of proof of such an arrangement/agreement. Further, Qtum's principals have gone by several different names over the past months and years, not providing proof of the real name of its founder in spite of demanding documentations of its investors under the auspices of KYC and AML regulations.

Seriously, hope all is well at this speaking because me's found some neat stuff that I was paid to not post that'll make you ... ummmm ... not so well. So to let you know that I's no bullshiting, take a look at this hilarious lip sync video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ge8cRLyFl8. Recognize that guy, Mark? Sounds to me like when the doctors fixed his back, they changed his voice to that of a younger man.  Did the docs snipped a tad too low?   For those playing at home, there's still 'bout 2 more days before you get to empty your wallets into Qtum's coffer controlled by NOT PwC.  TBC, I uncovered what I'm about to release thank's to Qtum's shill Bob Smith on their Slack channel which I just happened to tune in to via an email link. Dude also has the red-ass for me just like cocksuckeroverfolw. I like the part where Bob alludes to trusting Allcoin because they've been around for 3-4 years, whereupon Lucy immediately replies with a thanks, not offering up that it's a new Allcoin were supposedly dealing with purchased by Cascadia for $86K+.  Come to think of it, there's no way that Bob is a shill for Qtum, for he wouldn't've mentioned Mark in any capacity, let alone continue to question Lucy. Apologies to Bob for comparing him to CSOF.   Enjoy the following while I pen the big reveal. I swear to Jehovah, dudes, you're gonna love my next post. Bring hammers, for I have the nails for Qtum's coffin. Oh, and please don't forget to watch that video I linked to above, now saved on my computer, for I have every reason to believe it won't be up much longer.    silky.johnson [4:11 PM] Also, can I withdraw my Qtum OUTSIDE of China?

IF foopile is putting out ReviewaPenny, I guess I’d say they are advertising, hardly a crime. Not the first to say they are the best. What could be worse than the fake news articles used by some of the larger well-known auctions? foopile used to be slow shipping, don’t know right now, I haven’t bid there recently. Besides that, I’d give them A+. I think they are one of the most honest sites, bids are very reasonable, the site is user friendly and I’ ve never seen or even heard of timer issues. I only have one questions, is SwipeAuctions kin to or part of Swipebids because it sure looks like it. If so, then the only crime I see hear is giving SwipeAuctions B+.  Paul Vernon owned both Foopile and ReviewaPenny. Paul Vernon's now in China after he ripped off Cryptsy's investors.  Revisiting the following:  On ground of regulatory requirements, our legal terms excludes US citizen from participating.  Two questions come to mind:  1. Since when did it become illegal to invest in a non-profit entity registered in Singapore? If I remember my Maps 101 class lessons, Singapore is not in China. Correct me if I'm wong. Also, correct me if I'm wong in stating that Qtum's main reason for having it's charter in Singapore was so that it didn't have to contend with Chinese regulators, but now is seems we've come full circle in that US citizens are excluded from participating unless, that is, you follow the advice offered up by principals and devs of Qtum on exactly how to circumnavigate the KYC guidelines. Translated: We at Qtum aren't doing anything illegal, but we'll take the time to show you how to take advantage of our ICO via doing something illegal.  2. When did the paradigm shift to being acceptable to solicit investments from investors totalling $10M ... strike that, now $15M (also read a $30M figure in re Qtum) for a non-profit entity regardless where based in hopes of earning an ROI off said investments? I don't think the likes of a Bob and Alice Smith can sell a million dollars worth of shares promising an ROI for their non-profit Food Bank endeavor designed to feed masses of people in some region of the world. Again, correct me if I'm wong. Translated: Nobody invests in a non-profit for an ROI because ... wait for it ... there's no profit.  Qtum has yet to address how they're able to amass $10M $15M in revenue when their Singapore non-profit charter specifically states that they're ONLY able to garner $5M max over the lifetime of their charter. One more time, correct me if I'm wong, but if I remember correctly from my Math 101 class lessons, $15M is morer biggerer than $5M.  Bruno (Chinese name: Luŏ Xióng; 裸熊)   One more thought and I'm done for the day:  Quote First and foremost, this is a global initiative, but we anticipate most of the token sales to come from the Eastern market.  http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/qtum.org    Correct me if I'm wong, but I don't see any Asian countries on the list above, including CHINA, albeit I will admit that all the countries not the US are east of the US if you read from left to right.  Further ...    Qtum gets most of its traffic from BitcoinTalk, which is pretty amazing considering that there's no Chinese translation thread for Qtum on this forum if spite of Qtum being on record in stating that they have a greater following in the Eastern market than us yokels here in the Western market. Again, correct me if I'm wong.  Bruno (Chinese name: Luŏ Xióng; 裸熊)",False

Qtum have also announced their collaboration with PwC, a big player in the consultancy and finance space. The Best of Both Worlds? By producing a variation of Bitcoin and Ethereum, Qtum's ambition is stated in the white paper: ""One  of  the  primary  goals  of  Qtum  is  to  build  the  first  UTXO-based  smart-contract  system  with  a  proof-of-stake  (PoS)  consensus  model.  The  latter means the creator of the next block is chosen based on the held wealth in cryptocurrency. Thus, blocks are usually forged, or minted instead of being mined, there are block rewards in addition to transaction fees and forgers receive a percentage of ”interest” for the amount of funds they stake."" Smart contracts that run on Ethereum's blockchain use the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for their execution, assuming that all value transfers use an account-based method. Qtum is based on the blockchain design of Bitcoin and uses the UTXO-based model and consequently has an account abstraction layer that translates the UTXO-based model to an account-based interface for the EVM. To achieve this, Qtum has extended the Bitcoin 'Script' language, adding three ‘opcodes’ so that it functions as a vehicle to transport code to the EVM, while also retaining compatibility with pre-existing Ethereum smart contracts. The result, contracts are given more functionality thanks to the relative complexity of the UTXO model compared to an Ethereum-account like model. For example, enahnced traceability and privacy of smart contracts. While Ethereum requires you to download the entire blockchain, presenting challenges for mobile applications, Qtum's blockchain supports the SPV (Simple Payment Verification) protocol from launch. SPV allows lite wallets, running on mobile devices, to engage natively with decentralized applications and smart contracts for the first time. More details can be found in the white paper, 'Smart-Contract Value-Transfer Protocols on a Distributed Mobile Application Platform,' with contributions from Alex Norta, Associate Professor at Tallinn University, Estonia and smart contract expert. ADVERTISEMENT  The whitepaper addresses many concerns presented by industry users because of what happened with the case of the Ethereum DAO attack. Smart Contract Lifecycle Management aims to resolve this issue and other potential issues by allowing contract collaboration, negotiation, review, and tracking. Blockchain technology's inherent distributed nature allows for contracts to run without being interrupted; however, change is the nature of life and contracts need updating to reflect new landscapes. Qtum Gains Backing from PwC PwC has helped the Qtum Foundation setting up their governance model, project management, and risk management. In the future, Qtum plans on expanding their cooperation with PwC to help expand the adoption of their blockchain technology. To bring the wide applications that can be built using Qtum to the forefront, ranging from industries such as the supply chain, media, and IoT, PwC's stature will no doubt help them to achieve adoption. CY Cheung, a fintech and cybersecurity partner at PwC China stated that Qtum's efforts resonate with the goals of PwC: ""PwC sees enormous potential for blockchain to revolutionize business practices as we know them, and the firm has made great efforts in developing strategic and technical capabilities to adapt existing products and services for the new technology."" QTUM Crowdsale Begins March 16 To fuel computation operations and serve as the staking currency of Qtum, cryptographic software tokens used to engage with distributed applications (“dApps”) and smart contracts on the Qtum platform will be used to raise funds for the platform and support further development. The tokens are known as QTUMs, with 51 percent (51 million) to be distributed through the crowdsale, beginning March 16 at 12PM GMT. Interested investors can participate with bitcoin or ether at various exchanges and platforms such as Yunbi, ICOAGE, and BTC9. One hundred million QTUMs will be created as Qtum’s total token supply, on top of which approximately one percent annual Proof of Stake (PoS) inflation will be added. Nine percent of the token supply will be used to sponsor academic research, educational materials for developers, and contributions to open-source communities, in particular: ⦁    Establishing research labs in cooperation with high-profile universities. ⦁    Creating tutorials and educational materials for Qtum developers. ⦁    Cooperation with other open-source communities such as Linux, JavaScript, Docker, Php. The remaining 40 percent of QTUMs will be distributed toward business development (20 percent) and to the founders, early investors, and development team (20 percent), with early investors including notable players in the crypto-space such as Anthony Di Iorio, OKCoin CEO Star Xu, and Roger Ver. The Qtum crowdsale includes four price tiers, lasting one week each, as well as an early bird bonus phase, with a rate of 3,800 QTUM per bitcoin for the first three days of the ICO. In an attempt to combine the best of both worlds, capitalizing on the advantages of Bitcoin and Ethereum respectively, along with the backing of major consultancy firm PwC, Qtum is one project that you may want to keep a close eye on.",False

This includes providing comments on a white paper to be prepared by the project team, as well as on their proposed project governance structure. PwC is a network of firms in 157 countries, who are committed to delivering quality in assurance, advisory, and tax services.      “PwC sees enormous potential for blockchain to revolutionize business practices as we know them, and the firm has made great efforts in developing strategic and technical capabilities to adapt existing products and services for the new technology. We are excited to get involved in the era of innovation and help companies capture the opportunities and benefits brought by the new technology. Working with the Qtum Foundation aligns with our goal,” said CY Cheung, Fintech and Cybersecurity Partner of PwC China.  Qtum’s governance structure, which is detailed in the Foundation’s Qtum Blockchain Economy Whitepaper, illustrates the level of professionalism PwC has brought to the team. Qtum’s management structure will allow the project to effectively take hold as one of the largest open-source blockchain projects that can meet the needs of financial services, Internet of Things (IoT), supply chain management, social media, gaming and other industries.      “The Qtum Project is committed to becoming a smart contracts platform for business. To do this, Qtum wants to make it feasible for industries to build practical applications on top of Qtum. Qtum envisions a future where business practices are automated, and machine-to-machine communication is seamless. Having PwC, who has broad expertise across industries and a global network, support Qtum will help us fulfill our mission,” added Patrick Dai, co-founder of the Qtum Project.  Qtum Team BW  The Team behind Qtum  Qtum [pronounced Quantum] provides a Turing-complete blockchain stack, able to execute smart contracts and decentralized applications, comparable to the Ethereum blockchain. However, in contrast to Ethereum, Qtum is built upon Bitcoin’s well-established UTXO transaction model and employs a Proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. These augmentations have far-reaching implications for the utility of the Qtum blockchain, which will be elaborated below.  Furthermore, Qtum aims to establish an array of services, designed to bridge the still existing gap between blockchains and the business world. These include tools and methods to standardize the workflow of business smart contract development, and a hub of tested and verified smart contract templates, addressing various specialized business use-cases. Advantages of Qtum’s blockchain design  Building on bitcoins reliable and proven-to-deliver blockchain, Qtum stacks its Account Abstraction Layer, allowing the UTXO-based blockchain to seamlessly interact with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). With this innovation it is now possible to execute smart contracts and run decentralized applications, simply and securely, in environments that were previously out of reach for Ethereum, combining the endless possibilities provided by smart contracts with the stability and maturity of the bitcoin ecosystem. Going Mobile & A Blockchain Powered Internet of ThingsQtum  One of the main advantages of Bitcoin’s unspent transaction output (UTXO) model is its ability to sustain lite wallets. Lite wallets, utilizing the SPV protocol, allow users to interact with the bitcoin network without having to download and sync with the entire blockchain.  This stands in stark contrast to the way the Ethereum blockchain operates. In order to engage with an Ethereum-based smart contract, one first has to download and sync the entire Ethereum blockchain, which to date weighs up to 30 GB – rendering the mobile use of decentralized applications infeasible.  On Qtum’s UTXO-based blockchain, however, it is now possible to interact with smart contracts from lite wallets, which can easily be installed on any given mobile device, heralding an age of mobile decentralized applications.  With about a half of all internet traffic to major sites being generated by mobile devices, this ability is absolutely necessary for a massive, mainstream adoption of decentralized applications (DApps), smart contracts and a p2p economy enabled by them.  Lite wallet access also allows the syncing of a variety of devices and appliances to the Qtum blockchain, operating them according to pre-determent smart contracts. With this, a blockchain-secured IoT can be established, enabling a trustless, decentralized Sharing Economy. Compatibility across the boardSmart  Utilizing an EVM analog, the Qtum blockchain is compatible with existing ethereum-based smart contracts. Ethereum contracts can be ported to Qtum with little to no change to their code and execute as expected. Furthermore, Qtum implements complete backwards compatibility, meaning that once a decentralized application or contract is deployed on the Qtum network, it will stay operational, even if the system is updated.  With this, Qtum solves a huge problem, very well known to ethereum developers, who very often find their applications rendered useless by recurring changes to the Ethereum network.  The bitcoin-based UTXO transaction model also ensures that Qtum will be mostly compatible with the existing bitcoin ecosystem, allowing Qtum users to benefit from the industry’s top-notch innovations, fueled by hundreds of millions of dollars already invested in the space. Scalability, Speed, and Efficiency  Both, The Ethereum and the Bitcoin blockchain, are based on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which secures the blockchain by rendering attacks very costly due to artificially arduous computations, demanded from miners participating in the block-verification game. This is known to be very resource intensive, in both terms of energy consumption and time.  Qtum is among the first fully decentralized and Turing-complete blockchain stacks to utilize an attractive and much more energy-efficient method to maintain coherence: the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, rendering attacks costly and inefficient, without having to waste precious computational resources and energy.  Further increasing efficiency, bitcoin’s UTXO transaction model, implemented on Qtum, allows the network to process several transactions in parallel and in any given order. Unlike Ethereum’s architecture, which demands all transactions to be processed one at a time. Bridging the Gap between Blockchains and the Business World  To close the gap between legacy business sectors and the blockchain space, Qtum introduces a toolkit for comprehensive Smart Contract Lifecycle Management (or SCLM), which comprises tools and methods to standardize the workflow of business smart contract development.  This includes the formally verifiable translation of human-readable agreements to machine smart contracts, and the error-resilient specification of their elements, terms, and conditions. With this the SCLM toolkit ensures that smart contracts behave exactly as specified by the negotiating parties, leaving little to no room for unpleasant surprises.  Cooperating with a series of partners and third parties, Qtum aims to establish a smart contract hub, offering secure and thoroughly tested contract templates, tailor fitted for a multitude of industries and use cases, such as supply chain management, telecommunications, IoT, social networking, and more. With this, it will be easier than ever for established sectors and legacy institutions to interface with blockchain technology and enjoy their benefits.",False

It's still clear as day you are a shill and I implore anybody who doubts that to simply look through your posts. I love how you don't even try to refute/challenge any of the other things I said in my post lol you just cut it out of the quote in hopes less people will see it.  Well, too bad because here it is again:  Let's just pretend for a moment there is nothing to worry about here in terms of the project being a scam:  Even if this didn't reek of scam they want to raise 15 million dollars in the ICO for only 51% of the supply. That's an initial market capitalization of 30 million. Based on what? What justifies the biggest initial market capitalization in the history of crypto ICOs? There isn't even a github yet. It's ridiculous. What sane investor would invest in this? There is little room to grow and tons of room for the price to fall. With an initial market cap of 30 mil how could anybody expect to make a profit by investing in the ICO, even if this isn't a scam? Factor in the additional fact the team is also going to have 29% of the supply that they will be selling to further fund the project (as if 15 million isn't enough?) and the fact the angel backers invested only ~1 million and got 20% of the supply meaning they paid 1/6th what ICO investors will have to pay and they can dump their coins all the way down to 1/6 the ICO price and still sell for a profit.

Thanks.  I promised BitBay I would stay out of it and gently encouraged them to do the same, but if you don't mind there is one thing I would like to comment. This will most likely be my last comment on this thread. Investors are already aware so they know the risks moving forward.  Even if the price of Qtum goes up, the reality is that Dai walked from our project with a huge fortune that he didn't work for. As stated before we didn't condemn him at first because he agreed to stay. That was not honored and if anyone checks they will notice interviews and news articles after the first year I was condemning Dai (way before I was aware of Qtum). And that is not even mentioning that he pumped the ICO with his own funds and got a refund (free coins). Something I was made aware of a bit too late. There is tons of chat logs plastered all over BCT about that. Some were already posted here. Despite that, I still tried to contact him in a diplomatic manner. Obviously, I got tired of doing that.  So if investors don't mind Dai potentially pumping his own ICO and getting free coins rebated to him & his partners or if you don't mind a 49% premine on top of what they intend to raise go right ahead. Or if you don't mind that Dai has not worked hard in the past beyond an ICO then go ahead.  Or better yet, just invest in projects with honorable teams.  Although it is true I went to the slack and tried to warn the team of the guy they were dealing with. My warnings were ignored by the Qtum team. So although nobody here was calling Qtum a ""scam"" we were simply pointing out that the founder is sitting on stolen funds and breaks promises.  Considering Qtum moves forward with this anyway is sad indeed and whatever blowback they get is deserved. And to the devs who still have a chance to drop off the project despite the big paycheck. I can see money has blinded you guys (Earlz, Brett, etc). I'm very sorry to hear that and just realize you are placing the value of money over your own reputations. And more critically, you guys are at peace risking the funds of investors in the hands of a known theif. (Regardless of the supposed financial ""oversight"" it doesn't change who you work for)  When will people learn to start supporting honorable people as opposed to supporting dishonorable ones? Trust should be the FIRST thing an investor considers when advancing.  Okay well... adios.",False

If no, I think you should keep asking him to return the money, you know they don't care in this forum.

Hopefully someone informed them to be aware of this. They deserve to know what is going on here.  And no of course he did not refund it to me nor did he invest time or money into the project. The dev fund was never his and meant for development. 20 btc from each of the 5 people involved (including myself). So as stated fairly detailed in an earlier post with screenshots and links he got 151-170+ BTC and 10-20% of Bay which he sold and didn't work for. Not a bad payday for simply riding my reputation.  Realize, with BitHalo they already had a prototype to promote so he and the others profited off of two years of my hard work. Obviously I made the mistake of not valuing what I had accomplished up to that point and felt like I was able to license the technology as part of my business model sort of forgetting the value in my own name.  That makes him no better than Bobsurplus, potentially just as bad because he tried to mislead us into thinking he would stay when by his own admission he didn't.  I persisted for 2 years contacting him and got a measly 500 dollars. So I've given up trying to get funds from him. He said he would contribute every month and didn't even do that.  I've learned to value my time now more than ever. So to waste even a moment on him or his friends is a moment not spent on myself, my family or BitBay and Halo.",False

The 30-day token crowdsale will begin March 16, offering 51 million QTUM for either Bitcoin or Ethereum.  QTUM are the cryptographic software tokens used to engage with distributed applications and smart contracts on the Qtum platform, and will serve as the staking currency of the Qtum blockchain, as well as fuel for computational operations performed by the Qtum network.  “This crowdsale will accelerate the development of the Qtum Project and assure that we will have a stable blockchain platform for industry and consumer smart contracts. Given the commercial interest for making IoT, financial, and supply chain applications on blockchain, we imagine Qtum can be the robust infrastructure these applications are built on,” said Patrick Dai, co-founder of the Qtum Project  The crowdsale will be at these mostly Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges and crowdfunding portals: Bizhongchou, Yunbi, ICOAGE, Allcoin, ICO365, and BTC9.  Qtum recently announced a partnership with PwC China, which will support Qtum’s efforts to help fuel blockchain adoption across global business sectors. Qtum has raised $1 million from investors including Chen Weixing (Kuaidi), Star Xu (OkCoin), Anthony Di Iorio (Ethereum, Jaxx Blockchain Interface), Jeremy Gardner (Augur), Fenbushi Capital’s Managing Partner Bo Shen, and angel investor Xiaolai Li.",False

For example:  ""For example, if a payment gateway accepts bitcoin today, it already holds the potential to support Qtum transactions without any significant modifications. This would allow Qtum smart contracts to interface with the two largest existing decentralized environments, making the lives of developers and entrepreneurs in this industry much easier.""  Excellent research by the author.     https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/qtum-aims-to-revamp-smart-contracts          ""Asia’s Qtum Project Aims to Revamp Smart Contracts  CoinGecko March 07, 2017 - Posted by CoinGecko on Coverage  Last year had its ups and downs for the crypto community. Bitcoin surprised skeptics and alarmists, approaching some all time highs towards Q4. However, many in the smart contracts camp were left heartbroken. It began with a sense of optimism with Ethereum’s long anticipated Homestead release, which was soon depressed by the infamous DAO hack.  The immaturity of blockchain smart contracts seemed to be uncovered by this incident, leaving many investors and developers with the bitter impression that smart contracts are still very far away from causing any significant industry adoption.    While the gap between promises and reality left the Western market in a state of sensation-fatigue, China seems to be picking up the pace. Backed by heavy government endorsement, the emerging Asian blockchain industry might just turn the tables on the state of decentralized computation in 2017.  One especially interesting initiative is the “Qtum Foundation” - a Singaporean entity overseeing the development of a business oriented blockchain stack to promote the broad adoption of dApp technology. The Qtum blockchain, developed by the Qtum Foundation, is a Turing-complete smart contracting platform, stacked upon a modified version of the Bitcoin blockchain.  Qtum claims that this architecture should solve many instability issues and allow smart contracts to be executed in business-crucial environments that were until now out of reach for Ethereum-powered applications - including mobile devices like smartphones and tablets.  The project is backed by an extensive list of impressive investors and advisors, including Anthony Di Iorio, Ethereum Co-Founder and CEO of JaxxWallet, Chen Weixing, founder of Kuaidi, the Chinese version of Uber, Jeremy Gardner, co-founder of Augur and EIR at Blockchain Capital, David Lee Kuo Chuen, founder of LeftCoast & Advisor at Libra, as well as Bo Shen, Managing Partner at Fenbushi Capital to name a few.  Corresponding with China’s ambition to create a standardized blockchain environment for legacy business use cases, Qtum aims to bridge the existing gap between blockchains and the business world by allowing smart contracts to consistently adhere to changing commercial rules and regulations.  With Qtum, DApps can trigger real-world, off-chain data inputs, auditable by a verified Oracle or trusted mediator - while the contract’s essential elements, such as participants and authorization structures, are secured on the blockchain itself. With this, an authorized party is able to audit certain aspects of a contract, while its elemental properties remain protected by the decentralized environment.  Since Qtum employs Ethereum’s Virtual Machine (EVM) for the execution of smart contracts, the system is compatible with existing Ethereum applications. Qtum’s Bitcoin-based blockchain, nonetheless, also allows the stack to be mostly consistent with the Bitcoin ecosystem, which is especially interesting due to the millions of dollars already invested in this space.  For example, if a payment gateway accepts bitcoin today, it already holds the potential to support Qtum transactions without any significant modifications. This would allow Qtum smart contracts to interface with the two largest existing decentralized environments, making the lives of developers and entrepreneurs in this industry much easier.  The team seems to just use the EVM as a starting ground for more ambitious plans. In Qtum’s recently published technical whitepaper, the team gives details about smart contract lifecycle management which could make smart contract negotiation more akin to traditional contracts. The team also wants to embrace a new smart contracts language that will be more expressive and have “pattern-based design, process awareness, matching of processes.”  The 17th five-year plan, recently published by the Chinese government, lists blockchain technologies among the main development directions in the PRC’s information planning document. China’s Central Bank, the PBOC, has also signaled support for blockchain, with the bank's chief, Xiaochuan, stating to the press that it had spent ""significant resources"" researching the technology.  With a large part of Qtum’s team based in China, Qtum could capture the demand for local blockchain solutions. Qtum would be the first major blockchain project coming out of Asia. The team is also being supported with its project management by PwC, something no other blockchain project can claim.  With the kind of institutional backing and the investor interest that Qtum has, it seems that 2017 holds loads of potential for blockchain enthusiasts. CoinGecko looks forward to seeing what the Qtum team produces.""",False

Vitalik Buterin, the visionary of Ethereum development and coding genius, has been active in the world of technology for quite some time now. Before he even created Ethereum, however, he was working on building a computer program to solve NP-complete problems. Or as some people would like to call it, vaporware.  NP-complete problems are decision problems revolving around computational complexity theory. While the entire explanation of this concept can be found on Wikipedia, it is safe to assume this will one of those concepts that is always subject to substantial debate.  Vitalik Buterin And The Quantum Computer Scam Interestingly enough, Vitalik Buterin used to be involved in this particular field of expertise before he started working on Ethereum. In fact, he was working on a software tool to address these NP-complete problems in polynomial time. Building such a solution from scratch is both time-consuming and costly, though.  According to an archived post from Gregory Maxwell, Buterin was collecting investments from people to fund the creation of this computer program. However, Maxwell strongly feels this was nothing more than an attempt to fund vaporware. In fact, a post on Qntra refers to his idea for this computer program as “a quantum computer simulation scam”.  Gregory Maxwell explained this vaporware scam as follows:  “Vitalik’s project immediately before Ethereum is that he was collecting investments from people to fund building a computer program to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time, supposedly by simulating a quantum computer. (Never mind that even real QC aren’t conjectured to be able to do that, nor does ‘simulation’ make any sense; unless BPP == BQP that’s not even possible, and virtually all experts agree the complexity classes are probably not equivalent). He built up a reputation for himself writing tech explainers of other people’s ideas usually without any attribution (until someone complains), making him look like the author.” And Then Ethereum Was Born That is a rather interesting take on things. Complex ideas and concepts are difficult to explain, let alone making anyone see the need to address them. Yet for some reason, Buterin felt he had the tools at his disposal to convince people to give him money for this project. It remains unclear as to why he failed in doing so, though.  Regardless of the reasoning, it didn’t take Vitalik Buterin long to come up with a new idea. Ethereum, before it was even released to the public, raised several millions of dollars in investments. To some people, the whole concept of Ethereum is still hit-and-miss, as the code can be exploited in multiple ways. The DAO attack and replay attacks are just two of the examples.  That being said, no one is saying Ethereum is vaporware. Interesting concepts can be built on top of this source code that will change our society as a whole. But this whole ordeal goes to show there is a difference between creating concepts and stealing other’s ideas.",False

Check out our new FAQ section of the website:         ""What is Qtum?  Qtum is an open source Blockchain project that is developed by the Singapore-based Qtum Foundation. Qtum is a hybrid blockchain application platform. Qtum’s core technology combines a fork of bitcoin core, an Account Abstraction Layer allowing for multiple Virtual Machines including the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Proof-of-Stake consensus aimed at tackling industry use cases. We believe this will allow Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications to run on a familiar foundation, while offering a robust environment for developers. The underlying technology uses an “Account Abstract Layer”, which acts as a bridge between the EVM and the Unspent Transaction Output model of Bitcoin Core.  There will be Oracles and Datafeed functionality, allowing developers to create Smart Contracts built around trusted sources of information.  The Qtum Foundation plans to be the public blockchain for business. Development efforts will allow us to market this platform to various industries, such as: Mobile Telecommunications, Counterfeit Protection, Finance, Industrial Logistics (shipping, warranty, etc), and Manufacturing.""       What makes this different than other blockchain projects?  The Qtum project offers many advantages to the Smart Contract development community. This project is designed to implement the best parts of the Bitcoin and Ethereum projects, into a business-friendly blockchain. By implementing the Bitcoin Improvement Protocols, and making use of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, digital currency enthusiasts can finally agree on one platform that will offer stability and direction.      What is the benefit of the UTXO Model over the Account Model?  The account model is similar to a bank account. Each party has a balance and can subtract a portion of their balance to increase the balance of another party in order to send money. This model is conceptually very simple to understand. However, to make this work in a blockchain environment many pieces of logic must be added to avoid “double spending”, spending the same funds twice. This logic makes the account model less simple internally, and adds a number of restrictions.  The UTXO model on the other hand is similar to having an ecosystem built on bank checks (without an actual bank account, the check itself is the money). There is a “pay to” field which in our example provides instructions to how the money must be spent, and each check has an amount. You can not go to cash the check and say “cash half the check and give me half back”. Your “balance” per-se is the sum of the checks which you are capable of spending. This model is more difficult to explain, but because every is either “spent” or “unspent” and there is no in-between, it is much easier to secure in a blockchain environment with less logic required to maintain that security.  Each model has it’s own pros and cons. Accounts are conceptually simpler and thus smart contracts written on an account system tend to be much clearer and easy to understand. With UTXOs however it is simpler to validate a transaction, which can be done simply by verifying that the transaction has been confirmed by the blockchain, in the case of the SPV protocol. The UTXO model also has been tested and proven to be secure by Bitcoin, which has operated for over 7 years with no significant changes to its core model. It has also been proven to be more scalable, and transactions can easily be processed in parallel (which can be more difficult in the account model).  With all of this in mind, we at Qtum felt that building on the UTXO model best aligned with our goals and that adding the Account Abstraction Layer brought us the best of both worlds. Now we gain all of the security and interoperability benefits of the UTXO model, while smart contracts are written as if they were based on the conceptually simpler account model.

Between September 2016, and February 2017, Chun Yin (CY) Cheung and Team Qtum on myriad occasions through press releases (eventually spawning organic news), respective blog postings, forum posts, social media postings, etc., adamantly expressed that PwC is onboard the Qtum project, so why did Brett Fincaryk deemed it prudent to delete Qtum's post regarding what's already public knowledge, with even Qtum's investors formally declaring that such is 100% the case.

So when a project like this comes around here asking for 10 million USD without escrow, without providing source code, and with a whole lot of extra baggage due to its founder being accused of theft and due to shadiness surrounding the identities of other team members and the random Chinese exchanges the ICO will be held on- you better bet your ass you and the rest of the team need to take responsibility and address the concerns of potential investors.

Can you understand perhaps even a little bit why people are skeptical here given the context? There is a rich history of scams on this website and certain technical aspects of this ICO (no escrow, 49% premine, no source code) plus what many perceive as very shady aspects of the team behind it don't help qtum's case at all.

And I don't think Gleb is a paid troll, and even if he was that isn't enough to dismiss all of the concerns he has brought up that are corroborated with evidence or by other people. And just because there isn't a smoking gun doesn't mean there isn't something fishy going on. Btw you can take a look at my first post in this thread I was intrigued by qtum for the same reasons you are, although even initially I was critical of the ICO distribution model, lack of escrow and benchmarks for fund release, and nondisclosure of the PoS inflation rate. Which reminds me, have they said what the PoS inflation rate will be yet?  Anyways, I'm going to stop arguing back and forth with you because it's pointless and a waste of our time. At least until further developments, one way or another.  Also I'd just like to point out that the flood of adverts and press releases is rather trite. Why not spend a fraction of that time and money on disproving the claims made by Gleb instead (or rather, in addition to)?",False

Today's players are Team Qtum and Qtum's Brett Fincaryk, respectively:  September 9, 2016: https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/ethereum-based-identity-project-uport-wins-the-blockchain-competition/  Quote “Qtum will become the first UTXO model based smart contract platform. Different from Rootstock, Qtum is using the Incentive proof of stake as the consensus protocol,also Qtum support EVM. We also divide the blockchain contract to Smart Contract and Master Contract. Through real world data feeds, you can build the Master Contract on QtumChain. We also offer identity on Qtum Blockchain. Qtum add value both to Bitcoin ecosystem and Ethereum ecosystem.”  They have signed a strategic partnership with PwC China, and recently signed a service contract with the world’s largest freight company for the use of VeChain, another project by the team, to better manage supply chains by adding blockchain capabilities to minimize fraud and theft.  February 22, 2017: Qtum's Slack channel before it gets deleted: https://qtumnexus.slack.com/archives/general/p1487836173003937    So, according to Brett, Qtum received the million dollars from Angel Backers prior to September 22, 2016, when PwC was already onboard the project, with Qtum not registering their non-profit charter till November 28, 2016, in Singapore, because astute investors don't need to see no stinkin' charter prior to investing a million bucks after vetting venerable dudes like Patrick Dai.

Firstly, I’d like to confirm that I was indeed involved in the project, going under the name of Steven Dai. I, Xuguang Dai by birth, have been using the western nicknames Patrick and Steven interchangingly in order to engage smoothly with western partners. This is a commonplace practice in Asia, and in fact, I still use Steven from time to time.  As it is clear by now, the BitBay project was indeed highly problematic, with many goodwilling investors and entrepreneurs, including myself, losing some money and time invested in the project due to malevolent activity of some individuals.  My involvement in the project began in 2014, with the intent to support the development of decentralized commerce and the blockchain space in general. However, I soon found out the hard way that not all involved in BitBay’s operations shared these goals.  With questionable ends and actions surfacing, I decided to leave the project in 2015, after doing my best to support the remaining developers and handing them all BitBay related holdings under my control. These assets included about 70 BTC, which were transferred to BitBay’s developers before my departure from the project.  I want to assure you that I regard integrity and rightful conduct as my main priorities in all my business activities, past, present and future. I am confident that my performance in cooperation with the rest of the Qtum team will assert itself very soon.  Sincerely,  Patrick Dai""     Thank you for your patience.    Brett Fincaryk has been working alongside Patrick Dai for over two years over at Bitse but didn't know that his Chinese name is Xuguang Dai. Further, Jordan Earls didn't know that Patrick Dai goes by Steven Dai on occations according to ... wait for it ... Patrick Dai.   *Patrick on wechat:*  1 we released the project last year march 2016 , and won best blockchain innovations award by IBM in August 2016(video link)，we went to EDCON in Paris and made a good speech there, got a lot good feedback from bitcoin and ethereum developers. (Video link and ppt link)  2 we got 1M dollars investment from Roger Ver and Anthoney and Bo Shen and a billionaire and Okcoin's CEO and some senior manager from HuaWei and more, all these investors are not stupid and they made Due diligence on team members' background and Project background before they invest. 3 some team member's told us, they got paid to creat the FUD on Qtum before the ICO, because one month ago there is a group ask some so called  cooperations with Qtum ( to do promotions for Qtum and ask for money) *but Patrick say No.*  [5:47]  Why was Patrick talking about himself in the 3rd person if he was the one doing hte posting???  [5:49]  Regardless - it is seeming rather scammy that suddenly there is so much silence, and PWC is ""unreferenced"".  My urgency level to get involved in this just dropped off a cliff.  yan7181 [6:14 PM] joined #general. Also, @frank6  joined.  qtum-earlz [6:41 PM] His English isn't perfect? Idk I was beside him in the taxi when he typed it though    Taxi Driver: Where to, Steven? Jordan Earls: He called you Steven. Patrick Dai: In China, everybody Steven. It like hookers call mans John. You want hooker, Jordi? Jordan Earls: No thank you. I just fucked the elephant in the office an hour ago. Pissed me off that Brett didn't clean up after himself prior to it being my turn. Patrick Dai: No worry. I see us get more elephants very, very soon. I buy with TileCoin.    ONLY 15 minutes later ...    Totally fuckin WOW! The FUD that Jordan Earls speaketh of is that of the Steven Dai / Patrick Dai connection.    To reiterate for the retards reading this, BitBay was before Bitse which Brett was part of from day one alongside Patrick Dai which Brett never knew him as Steven or Xuguang Dai.  To recap the timeline:  - Patrick Dai is accused of being Steven Dai. - Jordan Earls denied it. - Brett Fincaryk denied it. Brett never heard of Xuguang Dai. - Jordan Earls continued to deny it shortly after being in a taxi with Patrick Dai during his problematic English post. - Jordan and Brett announced a forthcoming Patrick Dai rebuttal. - Patrick Dai confirms the accusations, going by Steven Dai on a many occasions, with his real name being Xuguang Dai. - 15 minutes later, Jordan calls all the accusations FUD after Patrick Dai confirmed that he was indeed Steven Dai. - Brett Fincaryk knew that Patrick Dai went by Steven Dai. - Now, anybody expressing discontent are referred to as FUDsters, Sherlocks and/or paid trolls.  Meanwhile, Qtum ignores the accusation that they deposited over $490K worth of bitcoins stemming from under Patrick Dai's control into Star Xu's OKCoin prior to Star Zu funding Qtum as an Angel investor, the $490K+ worth of bitcoins being a major part of Qtum's coffer valued over $640K worth of bitcoins just hours prior to registering their non-profit in Singapore.  Further, Qtum wants you to believe that all funds going in and out of its endeavor is fully transparent under the auspices of PwC, the exact same PwC who oversaw Danny Brewster's Neo & Bee's funds, of which one would have to have their eyes covered with cocksuckeroverflow's balls to not see what happened to Neo & Bee's Investards' money.

Qtum (pronounced Quantum) uses the Unspent transaction Output (UTXO) design of Bitcoin and connects that with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) which stores and executes business rules as code on the blockchain.  Qtum's co-founder Patrick Dei says he has addressed the complexity involved in combining an unspent transactions model with a virtual machine by creating the Qtum Account Abstraction Layer (AAL). Qtum's proof of stake consensus system includes a kind of ""adapter"" which can build the state of each UTXO and through the new layer, and adapt it so the EVM can process the UTXO-based contract. More from IBTimes UK   The paper titled, Smart-Contract Value-Transfer Protocols on a Distributed Mobile Application Platform, was authored by the co-founders of the Qtum project, Patrick Dai, Neil Mahi, Jordan Earls and the project's scientific adviser Dr Alex Norta.  Qtum's UTXO-based blockchain supports the SPV (Simple Payment Verification) protocol from launch, which will allow ""lite"" wallets, running on mobile devices, to engage natively with decentralised applications and smart contracts for the first time. This feature also allows IoT devices to be secured and operated with smart contracts, said a statement.  Lite wallets allow users to interact with the network without having to download and sync with the entire blockchain, enabling low bandwidth/storage access to smart contracts. With SPV support, transactions can be signed by the device itself rather than having to rely on third-party services to relay messages.  Dai said: ""Getting smart contracts to work on smartphones and tablets heralds a new age in the field of decentralised computation. With about half of all internet traffic being generated by mobile devices, every real-world use case for decentralised applications would massively benefit from mobile support – especially if we're taking the tendencies of developing markets into account.""  Norta said: ""This white paper fills the gap in the state of the art by presenting the Qtum smart-contract framework that aims for socio technical application suitability, the adoption of formal-semantics language expressiveness, and the provision of smart-contract template libraries for rapid best-practice industry deployment.""  The white paper also addresses concerns raised by the Ethereum DAO attack, noted Dai, by allowing contract collaboration, negotiation, review, and tracking. A Smart contract life cycle management system enables contracts to be more like living documents and when situations changes, (i.e. terms are broken in the contract, such as a delay) parties can determine if they want to amend or close the contract.  Earls added: ""Qtum aims to revolutionise business processes and the way that businesses interact with their customers by making smart contract technology mobile and practical. The SPV protocol allows smart contracts to move from servers and laptops, into IoT and mobile devices.""  CY Cheung, fintech and cybersecurity partner of PwC China, posted a blog about the agreement with Qtum, and added: ""PwC sees enormous potential for blockchain to revolutionise business practices as we know them, and the firm has made great efforts in developing strategic and technical capabilities to adapt existing products and services for the new technology. We are excited to get involved in the era of innovation and help companies capture the opportunities and benefits brought by the new technology. Working with the Qtum Foundation aligns with our goal.""",False

With this innovation it is now possible to execute smart contracts and run decentralized applications, simply and securely, in environments that were previously out of reach for Ethereum, combining the endless possibilities provided by smart contracts with the stability and maturity of the bitcoin ecosystem.  Until now, attempts to implement smart contract solutions on top of the bitcoin blockchain have had issues, been lackluster, or failed to break into the mainstream business market. This is primarily due to the fact that the bitcoin blockchain employs an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) scheme to associate coins with addresses, rather than the easier to understand, but otherwise problematic, account-based model used by Ethereum.  An account based model works pretty much the way one would imagine:  if Alice has 10 tokens, and sends 5 of them to Bob, who has zero tokens; 5 tokens are simply subtracted from Alice’s balance and added to Bob’s, who now owns 5 coins.  On a UTXO blockchain, however, Alice does not directly hold 10 tokens, but a series of outputs, which are collections of coins resulting from previous transactions.  In such a model, instead of owning 10 tokens, Alice would, for example, hold 3 outputs: (a) consisting of 6 coins, (b) consisting of 2 coins, and (c) consisting of another 2 coins. In this scenario Alice couldn’t simply send 5 coins to Bob, but instead she (or her wallet, for that matter) would have to pick the best-suited output and receive “change” in return (a process called coin picking). In our example this means that Alice would transfer output (a), consisting of 6 coins, and receive 1 coin back as “change”. This “change” is what is called the Unspent Transaction Output, or UTXO. After the transaction Alice would still hold 3 outputs, this time (a) consisting of 1, while (b) and (c) remain 2.  Employing such a seemingly complex bookkeeping scheme allows the Bitcoin blockchain to support Simple Payment Verifications or SPVs. The SPV protocol enables the support of light wallets, which are wallets that can interact with the Bitcoin network in a decentralized and trustless manner, without having to download the entire Bitcoin blockchain. This property is immensely useful for mobile applications or in any low bandwidth/storage environment.  Until now, Ethereum smart contracts couldn't execute in such environments exactly because Ethereum’s account based blockchain does not provide a SPV analog. To solve this, Qtum builds its decentralized application platform on the proven-to-deliver Bitcoin blockchain and introduces the Qtum Account Abstract Layer, which serves as a communication layer between the Bitcoin Core 0.13 protocol and the EVM.  To achieve this, Qtum has extended the Bitcoin 'Script' language, adding 3 ‘opcodes’ so that it functions as a vehicle to transport code to the EVM, while adding special processing conditions, executing these EVM-using transactions immediately when added to the blockchain - allowing the EVM to operate within a UTXO environment.  In order to relieve Qtum smart contracts from the need to perform coin picking for every transaction, Qtum comes coded with an automated, generic coin picking algorithm which allows contracts to ignore the UTXO mode of operation, while functioning normally, as if deployed in an account-based environment. This method is what enables Qtum to be compatible with pre-existing Ethereum smart contracts, allowing them to be executed on Qtum with little to no change to their code.  For more information about Qtum’s architecture in general, please read this post or review our  Technical Whitepaper.     https://qtum.org/ethereum-contracts-on-utxo/     https://qtum.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Qtum-technical-white-paper-draft-version.pdf",False

Patrick Dai makes an appearance to give his thoughts on the matter:  “The reason they’re doing this is because they want to have more transparency to regulate how money flows between banks,” said Patrick Dai, founder of the Qtum foundation, creators of the Qtum blockchain project.""   http://www.marketwatch.com/story/chinese-banks-experiment-with-bitcoin-like-system-2017-03-06   By Joseph Adinolfi   ""Chinese banks in two cities are testing a custom-built digital currency developed by the People’s Bank of China, according to information gleaned from local media reports and interviews with two individuals who are familiar with the central bank’s thinking.  The digital currency, known to the broader world as “ChinaCoin,” but officially referred to inside China as digital renminbi, or RMB, was developed by the PBOC in partnership with other private and public entities.  Eventually, Chinese authorities hope digital RMB will help the government strengthen oversight of the country’s banks, while helping to prevent financial crime.  “The reason they’re doing this is because they want to have more transparency to regulate how money flows between banks,” said Patrick Dai, founder of the Qtum foundation, creators of the Qtum blockchain project.  In recent months, certain local banks based in Shenzhen, a financial hub in southern China, and Guiyang, the capital of a province in the country’s southwest, have begun experimenting with first using the digital RMB network for settlement and clearing of transactions in the country’s interbank bond market.  China’s national media frequently cites transparency and efficiency as among the potential benefits of the digital renminbi project. However, in an interview with Caixin, a Chinese business publication, People’s Bank of China Gov. Zhou Xiaochuan said it would take China approximately 10 years to fully embrace the digital renminbi. China’s currency USDCNY, -0.0319%  is interchangeably referred to as yuan and renminbi.  But once it is widely launched, digital RMB will be more convenient, protect citizens’ privacy and maintain social order, Zhou said. Eventually, the digital adoption will allow the central bank to make better-informed decisions about monetary policy by allowing it to more closely monitor the movement of capital through the Chinese economy, he said, adding the system could also make it easier to prevent financial crimes such as money laundering.  Zhou also emphasized key differences between digital RMB and bitcoin, arguably the best known cryptocurrency. While the digital renminbi will incorporate some elements of blockchain technology, like the cryptographic algorithms that help secure the bitcoin network, it will more closely resemble a “permissioned” blockchain — a type of closed system that limits who can access and change information.  Read: This bitcoin rival nearly doubled in value in one week  The Chinese system will also be centrally controlled by the government, a concept that contravenes what bitcoin enthusiasts consider to be the cryptocurrency’s most revolutionary innovation: the ability to maintain a monetary system that is resistant to centralized control.  ”The elephant in the room is how much it could potentially increase [the PBOC’s] control,” said Chris Burniske, Blockchain analyst and products lead at ARK Invest.  The price of a single bitcoin US:BTCUSD  was at $1,280 in recent trade, just shy of an all-time high reached late last week. Part of the rise has been attributed to anticipation of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision on approval of the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, which is expected by the end of the week.  The PBOC isn’t the only central bank that’s exploring the feasibility of its own digital currency. The Bank of England joined with researchers at University College in London to create RSCoin, a digital currency for central banks. The Bank of Canada has also said it is developing a blockchain-based digital version of the Canadian dollar. """,False

How is it that you are the only person on BCT that has any (and quite excessive) faith in this project in light of everything that has been brought up? You are obviously connected to this project.  Also, ""No code on Github :’( : not uncommon in ICO projects"" Actually that's pretty damn uncommon for a project hoping to raise 10 million without using escrow. Usually if there is no code at the start, an escrow is used so that the money isn't released until the code is released and certain benchmarks are reached.  Also, ""No Escrow. : Using only exchanges, which are kind of an escrow"" might be true except it has been shown now that qtum team members own some of the exchanges they are using to host the ICO.  Also, ""Connection with multiple projects one being Bitbay.: If someone invested in BitBay, does not make them scammers."" Not simply connected with BitBay, the leader of qtum- Patrick Dai- stole money from BitBay. A bit of a difference there. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=890531.msg17942817#msg17942817",False

You would give an answer within 24 hours, this was on the 10th of February, 1 month ago. Now you say the 9th of March.  The crowdsale is ment to fund your project. This means that there should not be separate allocations for business development and research etc etc, these allocations should be funded from the crowdsale.  So, it would seem most logical to distribute 80% in the crowdsale and the remaining 20% to the initial backers.  What does the money raised in the 51% crowdsale even get used for? I would assume business development and research. No need to allocate more tokens to yourselves...",False

On November 28, 2017, Qtum registered its non-profit charter in Singapore, evident below:  https://www.sgpbusiness.com/company/Qtum-Foundation-Ltd    It's safe to assume that according to all the above, Qtum had yet garnered Angel investment funding prior to the 28th of November, with all the above bitcoin transfers to their coffer prior to, and inclusive of said date stemming from other sources because it would've been unwise for deep-pocket investors to collectively invest at least a million dollars into an entity that had yet registered as a business whether non-profit or not.  On January 1, 2017, at 16:40:39 GMT, a principal of Qtum, most likely Patrick Dai, transferred 500 BTC to Star Xu's OKCoin, the transaction being registered in Block #446154 at 17:28:48 GMT (follow the link).  January 1, 2017, 17:28:48 GMT equates to January 2, 2017, 1:28:48 AM [Eastern] China or Singapore time, as evident below, an odd time indeed to be transferring $461K+ worth of bitcoins to whomever, in this case Star Xu's OKCoin (Star Xu is an Angel investor of Qtum):    If Qtum did receive Angel investment funding prior to November 28, 2016, they would've most likely shout such at the tops of their lungs prior to January 11, 2017, when the announcement first starting making the rounds prior to the release of their first white paper, for Qtum shouts all else up to and including when an elephant farts in its office (allegorous, yet a truism nonetheless).

Byzantine Generals Problem and its Applications Byzantine General Problem     The Classic Problem    Each division of Byzantine army are directed its own general    Generals, some of which are traitors, communicate each other by messengers    Requirements:    All loyal generals decide upon the same plan of action    A small number of traitors cannot cause the loyal generals to adopt a bad plan    The problem can be restated as:    All loyal generals receive the same information upon which they will somehow get to the same decision    The information sent by a loyal general should be used by all the other loyal generals    The above problem can be reduced into a series of one commanding general and multiple lieutenants problem - Byzantine Generals Problem :    All loyal lieutenants obey the same order    If the commanding general is loyal, then every loyal lieutenant obeys the order she sends Reliability by Majority Voting     One way to achieve reliability is to have multiple replica of system (or component) and take the majority voting among them    In order for the majority voting to yield a reliable system, the following two conditions should be satisfied:    All non-faulty components must use the same input value    If the input unit is non-faulty, then all non-faulty components use the value it provides as input Impossibility Results     No solution exists if less than or equal to 2/3 generals are loyal A Solution with Oral Messages - No Signature Oral Message Requirements and their Implications     A1 - Every message that is sent is delivered correctly    The failure of communication medium connecting two components is indistinguishable from component failure    Line failure just adds one more traitor component    A2 - The receiver of a message knows who sent it    No switched network is allowed    The later requirement -- A4 nullifies this constraint    A3 - The absence of a message can be detected    Timeout mechanism is needed Solution     If less than 1/3 generals are traitors, this problem can be solved    Algorithm - recursive    Lieutenants recursively forward orders to all the other lieutenants    Commander's order = majority (v(c), v(1), v(2), ..., v(n))    v(i) = majority (v(i), v(i)(2), v(i)(3), ..., v(i)(n)), 1<= i <= n    v(i)(j) = majority (v(i)(j), v(i)(j)(3), v(i)(j)(4), ...)    ... A Solution with Signed Messages Additional Requirements and their Implications     A4:    A loyal general's signature cannot be forged    Anyone can verify the authenticity of a general's signature    Implication    Digital signature is required Solution     If at least two generals are loyal, this problem can be solved    Algorithm - recursive    Lieutenants recursively augment orders with their signature and forward them to all the other lieutenants    Each lieutenant maintains a set of orders she has received, i.e., the possible sets are:    { attack },    { wait }, or    { attack, wait }    Lieutenant takes action according to the value of the set    { attack, wait } means the commander is a traitor Missing Communication Paths      Network topology or policy could keep a general sending/receiving messages to/from another general     This constraint makes Byzantine problem more general Oral Message     If the communication graph is 3m-regular and less than or equal to m generals are traitors, this problem can be solved    k regular set of neighbors of a node p    the set of all neighbors of p, whose size is k    for any node not in the set, there exists a disjoint path, not passing through the node p, from a node in the set    k regular graph - every node has k regular set of neighbors    Algorithm - extension of oral message    Lieutenants recursively forward orders to all its k regular neighbors    Commander's order = majority (v(c), v(1), v(2), ..., v(n))    v(i) = majority (v(i), v(i)(2), v(i)(3), ..., v(i)(n)), 1<= i <= n    v(i)(j) = majority (v(i)(j), v(i)(j)(3), v(i)(j)(4), ...)    ...

The problem is that the network is not instantaneous, and if two generals announce different plans at close to the same time, some may hear one first and others hear the other first.  They use a proof-of-work chain to solve the problem. Once each general receives whatever plan he hears first, he sets his computer to solve a difficult hash-based proof-of-work problem that includes the plan in its hash. The proof-of-work is difficult enough that with all of them working at once, it's expected to take 10 minutes before one of them finds a solution and broadcasts it to the network. Once received, everyone adjusts the hash in their proof-of-work computation to include the first solution, so that when they find the next proof-of-work, it chains after the first one. If anyone was working on a different plan, they switch to this one, because its proof-of-work chain is now longer.  After about two hours, the plan should be hashed by a chain of 12 proofs-of-work. Every general, just by verifying the difficulty of the proof-of-work chain, can estimate how much parallel CPU power per hour was expended on it and see that it must have required the majority of the computers to produce in the allotted time. At the least, most of them had to have seen the plan, since the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it. If the CPU power exhibited by the proof-of-work is sufficient to crack the password, they can safely attack at the agreed time.",False

Qtum ICO: Building the first UTXO proof-of-stake smart contract platform Update 3/2: Qtum has announced its token sale dates: March 16th – April 15th. They have also launched a new website and reopened their slack channel. They have also released several demos of their blockchain, including a technical walkthrough and a demo of a working qtum mobile wallet.   Update 2/28: Recent accusations have dogged the Qtum project. Here is an abbreviated version of recent events. ICOcountdown has compiled several days worth of relevant communication here, where we found much of the source material.  Here is a highlight of our thoughts at this time. Below, we provide a brief recounting of events, then explain our five takeaways.  There is not enough information to conclusively judge Dai’s character, but his involvement in Bitbay and his attempt to hide it casts a shadow on his credibility. Given the high-profile third-party backing, it is unlikely Qtum is a scam. Qtum should improve its transparency, open up its Slack or explain why signups were stopped, and release some form of code or demonstration product. Interested parties should ignore several red herrings in this issue: PwC’s involvement, Dai’s multiple names, and Caspal’s Rubik’s cube record. The community should not expect this to be a fully decentralized project at launch. We will update our thoughts if more information emerges. We have reached out to the Qtum team for an interview. If there are any issues this analysis does not address, please let us know.  What has happened? First, project Lead Patrick Dai was once the Steven Dai associated with the Bitbay scandal in 2014. Joshua Bouw of Blockcoin exclaimed on February 21 in a series of tweets that Patrick Dai was the Steven Dai “that fucked #bitbay and David Zimbeck.” In 2014, Zimbeck posted an account of the scandal on reddit; in it, he frames Steven as the one who originally approached him about Bitbay but then got “pushed around” by other members of the team, who then go on to try to extort David. In a recent letter addressing the accusation, Zimbeck seems to slightly change the narrative in presenting Dai as a thief and possible scammer. He also says Dai did in fact steal both Bitcoin and BitBay when he left and never returned many inquiries from Zimbeck about repayment.  At first, Qtum appeared to ignore and resist the accusations that Patrick and Steven were the same. However, on February 25th, Patrick admitted to using the pseudonym Steven Dai and being involved in BitBay, though he claims he returned all of BitBays funds before he left in 2015. Shortly thereafter, the Qtum foundation also released an official letter on the topic with the conclusion, “After studying the subject matter thoroughly, [we] see no fault in Mr. Dai’s past activities and regards the accusations as groundless.”  Since then, bitcointalk has erupted in accusations of scam and scandal. Qtum disabled signups to its slack channel, and beyond the letter posted in slack and reposted on bitcointalk, has not officially addressed the issue. While this controversy blankets English-language discussion of Qtum, it’s worth noting that at time of writing, neither major Chinese crypto media nor Qtum’s Chinese-language communities are discussing the issue. In addition, Qtum still has not released additional information about the sales terms less then twelve hours before the ICO is scheduled to launch on several exchanges.  Here are our thoughts on the situation.  There is not enough information to conclusively judge Dai’s character, but his involvement in Bitbays and his attempt to hide it casts a shadow on his credibility. It’s not clear why Zimbeck’s initial account cast Steven as a victim while his recent one casts him as a thief and possibly a mastermind. It’s also not clear why he would lie about it now. Some accuse Zimbeck of trying to pump the BitBay price, but this is unlikely–he has spent years disproving the defamation campaign BitBay team members waged and it’s not plausible that he would consciously throw it away. Zimbeck likely didn’t know what went on behind the scenes of BitBay–if he witnessed a Dai-led conspiracy to oust him, he could have posted it. Based on the information that has been posted, there are multiple ways to interpret what actually happened behind the scenes at BitBay. One’s interpretation would color one’s judgement of Dai. Ultimately, only Dai really knows what his involvement was. But he should have disclosed his version of it and now, he should do something to rectify it.  Given the high-profile third-party backing, it is unlikely Qtum is a scam. Despite what one thinks of Dai’s character, it is not the only relevant consideration in evaluating Qtum as a whole. If Dai did intend to mislead investors, the list of people deceived would include Roger Ver, Anthony Di lorio, business professor and angel investor David Lee Kuo Chuen, and Bo Shen of Fenbushi Capital, among others1. Of course, that’s not unheard of: Elizabeth Holmes’ team presumably misled investors about Theranos for years. However, Theranos-level scandals are far more rare than random pump-and-dump schemes. Even scandals like BitBay lacked third-party endorsement. The DAO was certainly a third-party-endorsed debacle but it was not a scam. Qtum should improve its transparency, open up its Slack, and release its code or a public alpha. Dai should have disclosed his prior involvement to both his team and probably to the community. Dai’s recent success was also an opportunity to make things right with Zimbeck. Dai’s team members initially expressed surprise about the BitBay scandal and mocked the accusations. That looks bad, and Qtum should apologize beyond the formal letter it released. Finally, Qtum should also respond to accusations that there is no actual code. It’s not unheard of for teams offering enterprise-oriented software to keep code hidden from Github, but given prevailing concerns, they should make something available, even if it’s only snippets to show there is actually software. Overall, Qtum has an opportunity to apologize and course correct. It should take it. Investors should ignore several red herrings in this issue: PwC’s involvement, Dai’s multiple names, and Pascal’s Rubik’s cube record. PwC’s involvement is not surprising: a project like Qtum would seek out major corporate partnerships to help it interface with the business community, its target market. The retraction of mentioning PwC’s involvement is also not surprising: small companies with large partnerships lined up do mistakenly release the information before it’s been fully authorized. As for Dai’s multiple aliases, it’s not uncommon in Chinese culture for people to go by different names in different professional and social settings. Given names are generally only used by close family members and friends, while professional pseudonyms are often used in business settings. Many people use an English handle when dealing with foreigners. It’s a little unusual for Dai to use multiple English pseudonyms, but not altogether unheard of. Finally, a Coinjournal article has accused Qtum’s “Caspal” of lying about his rubik’s cube accomplishments. Caspal (the current English name for Yunqi Ouyang) has his Rubik’s cube record available here, which backs up a literal interpretation of the claims on his qtum profile. As with all the team bios, Qtum should have linked to it. The community should not expect this to be a fully decentralized project right out of the gate. Qtum has emphasized a focus on blockchain industry applications and regulatory compliance. The Qtum economy white paper says that, “the design of the Foundation’s governance structure mainly considers sustainability, management effectiveness, and fund-raising security”. The token distribution will be more centralized than other projects. Given that only 49% of tokens will be distributed during the ICO, the team will be able to retain a controlling stake with only a modest investment. The governing foundation also won’t hold elections for two years. This shouldn’t be surprising. Taking a step back, one must acknowledge that this project is backed by many well connected people in one of the world’s most centralized advanced nations: releasing an early-stage fully decentralized project in the context of Chinese political and economic norms is probably not feasible. This could change in the future, but the team seemingly made all aspects of governance predictable and controllable for two years. Perhaps ownership of the network will become more decentralized over time as the foundation distributes its token holdings, but there is no guarantee it will. The revelations about Dai do not change any of these factors. S+C Assessment Qtum will be a proof-of-stake, smart-contract compatible blockchain that can natively run both Bitcoin-based and Ethereum-based applications. The Qtum team plans to take public ledgers to the business mainstream.  From the standpoint of a potential investor and supporter, here are the key arguments for and against investing.  Key Strengths  This has one of the most impressive advisory teams the blockchain industry has seen in awhile. The success of platform technologies like Qtum, especially enterprise-oriented ones, will depend on business adoption. Like Melonport, Qtum’s team has a collective network that touches many of the world’s largest companies. Qtum is the first to implement a protocol based on both Bitcoin’s and Ethereum’s transaction models. Developers on either chain (or their variants) in theory should be able to port applications easily. It is likely that the Chinese government will tend to support blockchain projects based in China. Qtum boasts technical innovations, a stellar team, and existing support within the Chinese blockchain community. If the Chinese government chooses to discourage blockchains not based in China, Qtum should make the cut–and be a platform of choice for a growing developer community and almost 20% Key Concerns  While the governance structure is billed as a DAO, coinholders will not have much influence over decisions. Only 51% of the tokens are available during the crowdsale: 49% are held by the development team or initial investors in some way. In addition, the initial governance membership is set for two years, so coinholders will not have a say for awhile. In addition, while the community will elect 50 delegates to serve across all relevant committees, it’s not clear how the most powerful committee is chosen among them. The ‘capacity’ of the development community to build on yet another platform chain will be tested. Bitcoin and Ethereum have emerged as the primary platforms on which people can build, but more have emerged in 2016 (Waves, Lisk, Antshares) and more are in development (Cosmos, Rootstock). If each becomes its own developer and user ecosystem, there will be large network effects that will leave some platforms niche or mostly empty. Project Description What is the project?  Qtum will be a proof-of-stake (PoS), smart-contract compatible blockchain that can natively run both Bitcoin-based and Ethereum-based applications. The protocol uses Bitcoin’s UXTO model of storing transactions, while also supporting oracles and two types of smart contracts. Applications built for Bitcoin, Etheruem, or either of their derivatives, should be able to port easily. The team is stacked with talent and experience, especially in business, and has framed Qtum as a the public ledger most prepared for business dapps.  Bitcoin + Ethereum compatible: Qtum uses many features of the Bitcoin core blockchain, particularly its UTXO approach for storing transactions. This makes individual coins traceable. Qtum has a layer that abstracts the UTXO data into something the Ethereum Virtual Machine can read. This allows it to interact with both Bitcoin-based and Ethereum-based applications. Qtum will actually make this feature open-source, so any UTXO chain can use it to integrate with an EVM. Protocol Governance: Qtum will have a unique governance approach that is a hybrid of recognizable corporate governance, management models for open-source software, and blockchain-based consensus. The Qtum Blockchain Foundation, a Singapore non-profit, oversees the codebase, helps promote cohesion in the community, and represents Qtum to the external world. 50 people will staff one master committee and four sub-committees, with members serving two-year terms. Initial membership is already defined but the community will elect 50 representatives when their term is over. Master Contracts: are smart contracts that can execute based on off-chain or on-chain factors. Current designs of smart contracts are limited to checking on-chain data, so sources of off-chain data (oracles) must publish data to the chain itself; then whenever the smart contract is executed and verified, it checks readily-available on-chain data. Qtum has proposed a way for trusted data entities, such as official institutions or organizations, to provide data off-chain that master contracts can access. Proof of Stake: The team will use Blackcoin’s proof-of-stake consensus model. Their outreach has led them to conclude businesses are not comfortable with a proof-of-work consensus model. Using a PoS model with some semi-trusted nodes would assuage CEOs that a rogue mining outfit or state-sponsored hashpower attack couldn’t disrupt the network. In the future, Qtum will also have a native identity module that will provide users who register with a special designation that dapp developers and businesses can integrate with their on-chain activities. Some businesses are understandably uncomfortable with the thought of anonymous users. Identity could be solved at the application layer, but a native module would take the burden off developers. Users could still use Qtum without registering.  What is the token being sold? The Qtum token serves multiple roles on the network. It’s used to pay fees, determine the distribution of newly minted tokens through a PoS mechanism, and grants holders voting rights in the Qtum governance organization.  Fees  Qtum tokens will be used to pay fees associated with executing smart contracts (similar to Ethereum’s Gas). At the time of writing, the exact fee structure hasn’t been determined but it will be different from both Bitcoin and Ethereum.  Proof of Stake Minting  Token holders will be able to passively collect mining rewards by setting up a minting node and participating in consensus. Like other PoS schemes, validators will be required to stake some ammount of their token holdings to earn rewards. Coin age and the size of the user’s stake will determine the distribution of rewards.  Governance  Many of the most important governance and business decisions will be made by the Qtum Judgment Committee, which serves many of the same functions as the board of directors would at a traditional corporation. The Judgement Committee consists of 9 core members which are elected by token holders. The weight of votes in this liquid democracy depends on the size and age of user holdings.  What are the sale terms? At the time of writing, Qtum hasn’t released detailed sales terms. However, they have released a list of (primarily China-based) exchanges that will be participating in the crowdsale. Qtum tokens will be available to purchase during the crowdsale from Bizhongchou, Yunbi, Yuanbao, Allcoin, and ICO365, though they say the list might change before the crowdsale start date.  On March 2, they announced that they plan to conduct KYC on all customers (through the exchanges) and will not offer Qtum tokens through a crowdsale website.  Token Distribution  Initially, only 51% of Qtum tokens will be allocated to crowdsale participants. Of the remainder, 20% will be distributed to the founding team and early investors and 29% will be used fund research and development efforts.    Over time, proportional ownership of Qtum tokens will shift towards the community as new coins are minted and the Qtum Foundation sells their share of tokens to finance development efforts. Four years after launch, Qtum estimates that 80% of tokens will be owned by the community.  What is the project status? Initial seed funding  Qtum has already undergone an initial round of funding. Their earliest backers are an impressive cohort of Blockchain entrepreneurs that includes Anthony Di lorio, one of the original founders of Ethereum; and Weixing Chen the founder of Kuaidi, a ride hailing service that outcompeted Uber and contributed to their decision to leave China.  To date, Qtum has secured at least $1 million in seed funding.  Early projects  Qtum has already has a few significant dapp projects in development. Spring Mail promises to make sending cryptocurrency as easy as sending an email with a new Blockchain integrated Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (BiSMTP). Spring Mail works with existing SMTP protocols to facilitate the transfer of cryptocurrency between users.  In a similar vein, Qtum will also build a wallet called “Qloha” on WeChat’s new “mini programs” platform. The WeChat wallet would allow users to send Qtum tokens to other users as well as purchase products from WeChat store fronts.  Leading up to the crowdsale, the Qtum team has been focused on developing their technology and, as a result, doesn’t plan to announce any other major business partnerships beyond Spring Mail and the WeChat wallet.  Who is the team behind the project? Qtum has assembled one of the most impressive advisory teams in the Chinese Blockchain industry. However, in light of the issues surrounding Dai, there is obvious reason to doubt the credentials of the development team. The Qtum English webpage does not provide last names, Chinese names, or links to third-party identify verifications like LinkedIn or GitHub; however, full names of team members can be found in the economy white paper. As we note above, we recommend Qtum provide full names, links to previous work, and verification of their involvement in the project. To our knowledge, no one has proven information in the brief team bios was falsified, though Dai’s former involvement in BitBay was not disclosed.  Five team members don’t seem to have easily discoverable online identities, including Neil Mahi, Dong Baiqiang, Mike Palencia, Amelie Zhao, and Time Markov. That being said, many team members do have LinkedIn accounts or personal websites.  It is possible to locate the GitHub repository of Jordan Earls, Qtum’s lead developer. This contains numerous code reviews of other altcoins, though it has not been active for a year. He does not appear to have an easily-discoverable LinkedIn profile.  Caspal was formerly employed at Baidu as a quality assurance developer, China’s most popular search engine, often described as the “Chinese Google”.  Alex Dulub is the CEO at PixelPlex Inc., a Belarus based Blockchain development lab. He has more than 10 years of experience working as a full-stack web developer.  Roman Asadchiy is a Project manager at PixelPlex with a background in business analysis.  Brett Fincaryk has more than 11 years of experience in Linux server management at Userful.  Official Resources Website Technical white paper Governance and Economy white paper Bitcointalk Github (at time of writing, holds zero repositories) Smith + Crown do not know either Zimbeck, Dai, or anyone involved in the BitBay scandal. We have no special or privileged information. Based on what has been posted, there are multiple ways to interpret what actually happened behind the scenes at BitBay. One’s interpretation would color one’s judgement of Dai. One plausible alternative interpretation is that Dai thought he was a minor character in the whole affair, fled when he saw it going south, and didn’t feel beholden to a group of people he met on the internet and concluded he couldn’t trust. Not defending Zimbeck would have been low but not nefarious. It would be undeniably human to feel ashamed of this and want to avoid it. It’s possible we will never get all the facts about what happened at BitBay. Roger Ver has confirmed his involvement with Qtum in an interview with 8btc.com. Anthony Di Iorio confirmed his through twitter. Bo Shen of Fenbushi Capital signed the letter from the Qtum Foundation regarding issue of Patrick/Steven Dai. Other prominent members the project claims are involved have had plenty of time to deny involvement. Update: We have also updated this to clarify our earlier statements about the “impressive team” as referring to the advisory team. We also updated our team section to acknowledge that many (non-advisor) team members don’t have verifiable identities, though as we noted, Pascal’s Rubik’s Cube record can be verified and lead developer Jordan Earls does have a GitHub account.",False

Vitalik Buterin, the visionary of Ethereum development and coding genius, has been active in the world of technology for quite some time now. Before he even created Ethereum, however, he was working on building a computer program to solve NP-complete problems. Or as some people would like to call it, vaporware.  NP-complete problems are decision problems revolving around computational complexity theory. While the entire explanation of this concept can be found on Wikipedia, it is safe to assume this will one of those concepts that is always subject to substantial debate.  Vitalik Buterin And The Quantum Computer Scam Interestingly enough, Vitalik Buterin used to be involved in this particular field of expertise before he started working on Ethereum. In fact, he was working on a software tool to address these NP-complete problems in polynomial time. Building such a solution from scratch is both time-consuming and costly, though.  According to an archived post from Gregory Maxwell, Buterin was collecting investments from people to fund the creation of this computer program. However, Maxwell strongly feels this was nothing more than an attempt to fund vaporware. In fact, a post on Qntra refers to his idea for this computer program as “a quantum computer simulation scam”.  Gregory Maxwell explained this vaporware scam as follows:  “Vitalik’s project immediately before Ethereum is that he was collecting investments from people to fund building a computer program to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time, supposedly by simulating a quantum computer. (Never mind that even real QC aren’t conjectured to be able to do that, nor does ‘simulation’ make any sense; unless BPP == BQP that’s not even possible, and virtually all experts agree the complexity classes are probably not equivalent). He built up a reputation for himself writing tech explainers of other people’s ideas usually without any attribution (until someone complains), making him look like the author.” And Then Ethereum Was Born That is a rather interesting take on things. Complex ideas and concepts are difficult to explain, let alone making anyone see the need to address them. Yet for some reason, Buterin felt he had the tools at his disposal to convince people to give him money for this project. It remains unclear as to why he failed in doing so, though.  Regardless of the reasoning, it didn’t take Vitalik Buterin long to come up with a new idea. Ethereum, before it was even released to the public, raised several millions of dollars in investments. To some people, the whole concept of Ethereum is still hit-and-miss, as the code can be exploited in multiple ways. The DAO attack and replay attacks are just two of the examples.  That being said, no one is saying Ethereum is vaporware. Interesting concepts can be built on top of this source code that will change our society as a whole. But this whole ordeal goes to show there is a difference between creating concepts and stealing other’s ideas.",False

"" 1. There is not enough information to conclusively judge Dai’s character, but his involvement in Bitbay and his attempt to hide it casts a shadow on his credibility. 2. Given the high-profile third-party backing, it is unlikely Qtum is a scam. 3. Qtum should improve its transparency, open up its Slack or explain why signups were stopped, and release some form of code or demonstration product. 4. Interested parties should ignore several red herrings in this issue: PwC’s involvement, Dai’s multiple names, and Caspal’s Rubik’s cube record. 5. The community should not expect this to be a fully decentralized project at launch. ""  I guess Matt never heard of Josh Garza (GAWMiners) and Uncle Stu (Cantor Fitzgerald - Wallstreet investing).

Quote from: earlz on March 03, 2017, 03:11:07 AM I'd just like to remind everyone how fast misinformation can spread at the hands of a vocal few that do no vetting of the validity of the information other than to support their own viewpoint. For a much more serious instance of this, look back at what happened with the boston bomber witchhunt. There is a reason journalism is a job and these trolls aren't causing actual news (I mean really, don't you think the media these days would love to run with ""scam company wants to raise millions of dollars""!?). Typos happen, especially in weird chinese names, hell according to my debit card I'm actually ""Jordon Earls"", and according to some sites online I'm actually ""Jordan Earlz"". Good thing Gleb didn't find that or I'd be the next scammer not using his real name. I'm not going to try to turn the trolls to our favor, that'd be about as likely as a diehard Trump supporter being convinced to vote for Hillary or vice-versa. But all of you quieter non-trolls, remember that these people are only going to post the info they find that support their skewed viewpoint, and not the info they find that proves it wrong.  Which is complete with hyperbole comparisons built with all the emotional trappings. They call us the trolls   Personally I don't feel Jordan is a scammer, yet he's probably the one with the cleanest record as a background bug hunter. Hence why the team had him post a reply... no matter how ridiculous.  Then the official response from the Qtum page... Cool. Boring and it shows us the next move to try the ICO somewhere else like it was mentioned.  At least it didn't involve threats of suing or dead animals through the post like Garza  ",False

Speaking to CCN, Dai states:  “Qtum will become the first UTXO model based smart contract platform. Different from Rootstock, Qtum is using the Incentive proof of stake as the consensus protocol,also Qtum support EVM. We also divide the blockchain contract to Smart Contract and Master Contract. Through real world data feeds, you can build the Master Contract on QtumChain. We also offer identity on Qtum Blockchain. Qtum add value both to Bitcoin ecosystem and Ethereum ecosystem.”  They have signed a strategic partnership with PwC China, and recently signed a service contract with the world’s largest freight company for the use of VeChain, another project by the team, to better manage supply chains by adding blockchain capabilities to minimize fraud and theft.

Remember, all any person on this planet has to do is provide definitive proof to theymos that I have received payment JUST ONCE for any posting, and theymos has my permission to ban me for life on this forum.  Meanwhile, half-brain Sherlock has more shit to post:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/gongjames/    Quote from: Eric Mu on December 10, 2016, 12:51:02 AM Over the past years, the Chinese seem to have displayed great competence in hardware design and manufacturing, evidenced by the fast rise of companies such as avalon and to a greater degree, bitmain, contrasted by the fall of their overseas competitors. But the club of increasingly small number is seeing a newcomer - a previously unknown brand called Yibite.  Last week an invitation email found its way into my email inbox. I was invited by the company to attend their new product launch event in Chengdu, Sichuan tmr. For uninitiated, the province of Sichuan has become a hotbed for bitcoin mining due to abundant hydropower; it is also the place where yours truly chose to locate his moderate SinoHash farm.  I am not sure if I will attend, as I am expecting to receive a new shipment of S9 over the next three days and want to put them online asap. Just post this here thinking that it may interest some of you.  Some key points after a brief review of the email: The company is publicly listed (at least claim to be - I haven't looked it up), which may give it some legitimacy The company promise to give 6-month warranty, whilst Bitmain gives you a meager 3 months. The company claims to have power efficiency of 140W/T, which doesn't seem to be especially impressive. The company claims that they will release 5,000 units at the launch event.  Anyway, I think this is an interesting development.  Disclaimer: I am not in anyway associated with the company (Yibite) or compensated by it to post this    Ruckily, Red Li of 8btc.com picked up the story: http://news.8btc.com/14nm-miner-by-china-neeq-listed-company-to-escalate-arms-race  Here's Yibites' user account: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=341460  Quote from: stackoverflow on March 02, 2017, 03:36:06 AM Quote from: Wheelys on March 02, 2017, 03:29:00 AM    I don't know who is paid or not, and actually find that irrelevant.  If there are reasonable responses for the concerns raised, all Qtum has to do is post them in the thread.  I agree that the team have been quite silent in regards to some legitimate questions, but there is also a desperate and probably paid for trolling and astroturfing campaign going on here. this thread is so trashed with some really crazy (and irrelevant) accusations.  Hopefully the team will put more effort into addressing the legitimate concerns.  Let me guess, cocksuckeroverflow, you don't know how to quit me.

This will elaborate on my somewhat emotional conversation on Slack. My hands were literally shaking from emotion as it brings back very painful memories. I’m not afraid to confront it again though. The point being he got 10% of BitBay for free that was sold on us. He got 191 BTC minus the 20 he put in the dev fund. The dev fund was 100 btc. There was 5 members so you divide that by 5. Thats 20 each. This deducts it to 171. Steven did release the 2nd key to that multisig. It was a dev fund it wasn’t Stevens money other than 20 btc. https://blockchain.info/tx/7b1c9d0e062bdb61dd0565a98a1136c028c2b5bc05a0fa859aac2dde3d22d6ce?show_adv=false Bob and Gekko stole some of it so that lowered it down from 100 to roughly 50–60. I would have to check year old Skype logs to know exactly what Steven said they took. Steven told me via Skype that him and Lin from BTER would raise it to over 100 but they never did. Instead he just gives me the 2nd key to the multisig (you know its multisig BitHalo because it starts with a “3”). So if Steven/Lin added anything to that it was less than 16 btc. Since Bob and Gekko got 1/2 of the dev fund. So that means Steven got 155–171 BTC and 10% of BitBay which he got for free. Steven Dai will not be wise to deny those numbers. Then he admits much later that him and Lin bought some at the bottom so potentially Steven had 20%. Dai will not deny this as he knows we can produce more chat logs and he himself can probably give you txids of his wallets. Ask him yourself.""""",False

It looked and looks super. But when you dig, the greatness disappears. It is not obvious that this project will bring something wunderfull. Please, what do you answer to the following text (with pictures in http://coinjournal.net/ver-backed-qtum-started-bitbay-dai/)   Ver Backed Qtum Founder Ran Previous ICO Scam  By Ian Demartino - February 27, 2017  Patrick Dai, the founder of Qtum, has admitted to using another name and running another cryptocurrency before Qtum. He left the currency after it faced controversy involving himself and did not reveal his past to potential investors. He admitted to his past after being confronted with irrefutable evidence.  Qtum claims several high profile investors, including Roger Ver, Anthony Di lorio, and OKCoin CEO Xu Star.  According to chat logs, Steven Dai was the founder of Bitbay. That coin attracted significant controversy after a convoluted scheme that netted the founders thousands of bitcoins was revealed. The chatlogs revealed that the Bitbay launch was manipulated by two notorious alt-coin market whale groups known as bobsurplus and Gekko, the BTER exchange itself, and possibly Dai.  After two years of silence, Steven Dai is back as Patrick Dai.  A photo of BitBay funder Elmer Lin standing next to Patrick Dai seemingly proves that Lin met Patrick Dai.  unnamed (6)unnamed (5)     Questions about Dai’s past were initially ignored by the Qtum foundation and Dai. Two days after the issue was first raised on Twitter and through Slack, Dai finally issued a statement admitting to his past persona. He has ignored requests for comment sent to his email. The Qtum foundation itself initially replied to a request for comment saying that a statement would come the next day but has since ignored requests for additional comments.  In his statement, Dai denied any wrongdoing during the BitBay Scandal. He claims that he decided to leave the community after discovering the “questionable ends and actions” in the coin.  According to Qtum’s website and an article on the Ver owned Bitcoin.com, Roger Ver is one of many high profile investors in Qtum. Others include Ethereum alum Anthony Di Lorio, Jeremy Gardner and the CEO of Chinese Exchange OKCoin, Xu Star. [Side Note: Ver is reportedly suing Star’s OKCoin in an unrelated issue.]  We contacted Ver, Di Lorio and Gardner to confirm or deny their investments. Only Gardner replied, confirming his investment. When I asked if he knew of Patrick Dai’s past as Steven Dai, he did not respond.  The Qtum foundation did release their statement, saying that they were initially unaware of Dai’s past but are standing by him.  The BitBay scheme was primarily revealed through chatlogs released by Zimbeck. After the scandal’s release, Zimbeck defended Dai as the only honest person in the group that included Dai, Bobsurplus and Gekko. Today, both Zimbeck and BitBay’s largest investor say Dai left them without support and they allege he stole funds from the BitBay Developer fund and ICO on his way out.  Dai denies that he stole money from Zimbeck or the BitBay investors.He also points to one $500 payment to Zimbeck for development after the scheme was revealed. Zimbeck contends that $500 over two years is not sufficient funding of a coin and is only a fraction of the haul he says Dai gained from the BitBay scheme.  While much of the conversation on Slack has focused on if Dai stole from the BitBay ICO or if he was an innocent victim of Bobsurplus and Gekko. That ignores the larger point: why wasn’t his past disclosed previously?  If Dai was completely innocent in the BitBay scandal, and if he had no ill-intentions with Qtum then he should have been upfront with all of his investors. If he revealed it to the high-profile VCs that have invested is also irrelevant. The fact that he was asking for ICO investment without revealing his past to the public means potential ICO investors would have invested without that information.  Besides the founder who changed his name after being involved in a scam, Qtum has some other red flags. Besides The Founder, What is Wrong With Qtum?  Qtum does a few things right. The developers designed a competent website and wrote two interesting whitepapers. Digging a bit deeper, reveals some troubling issues.  The site includes a Team page with pictures of various team members. That would be a good thing, except for what it doesn’t include: No social media links. No last names (besides Patrick Dai) and no evidence that the team members are who they claim to be. One, “Caspal” claims to hold thirty Chinese and Asian records for Rubik’s Cube competition, as well as 21 gold medals.  According to the World Cube Association,  there is no one named Caspal in the top 100 solvers in the world. Nor is there a “Caspal” in the top 100 solvers in Asia, or even in the top 100 solvers in China. I checked the top ten solvers in China’s photographs, and none of them matched Caspal’s photograph.  While it is possible that Caspal was a Rubik’s Cube champion in Asia under a different name, without a real, full name, it is impossible to be sure. Especially since they are ignoring my interview requests. It sounds absurd slamming a coin for possibly exaggerating the Rubik’s Cube solving capabilities of their team but if they thought it important enough to mention, it must be important enough to question.  Some of the team behind Qtum, also seem to be working on a completely unrelated Blockchain as a Service project called Bitse. Besides Dai, there are two Qtum team members working on the Bitse project and have their last names listed: Neil Mahi and Time Markov.  Neil Mahi, is the second person listed on the Qtum team page after Dai. Googling his name gives no relevant results. The Bitse team page calls him “One of the most seasoned and greatest blockchain application developers” yet no one has heard of him. He is supposed to have 20 years coding experience, yet he hasn’t published anything to Github under that name, or even made a Facebook or Twitter account. What kind of coder, especially a “blockchain” developer, works for that long and has nothing public to show for it?  Time Markov is unGoogleable because his name brings up results for Markov’s Chain, a mathematical principal named in the 1900s. Searching for “Time Markov bitcoin” and “Time Markov blockchain” reveals no relevant results.  Furthermore, Qtum isn’t open source, at least not yet. Their GitHub page is empty. They won’t release the code until after the ICO. Of course investors will have committed their money by that time. They are ultimately asking investors to join in based solely on the experience of their team.  But that team only includes a few minor figures from the crypto world, a whole bunch of unknowns with no google search results, someone who probably exaggerates their Rubik’s Cube capabilities and a founder who either has a past that he seemingly hid from investors and involved the loss of hundreds of Bitcoins. How Did Qtum Get So Much Attention?  As is so often the case in the cryptocurrency world: Shitty journalism led to its ride. The actions of the bitcoin media is almost understandable. After all, many probably assume that if the likes of Ver are involved, then it must have been vetted by someone. But the truth could be that the Angel Investors are depending on the media.  The first mention of Qtum in a semi-reputable cryptocurrency news site comes from CryptoCoinNews. Their article mentions Qtum winning a hack-a-thon prize hosted by ChainB.  Next, an article by CoinDesk founder Pete Rizzo announced that Qtum received funding by several high profile investors. There, Rizzo mistakenly called the cryptocurrency “open-source” though it’s Github page is empty.  With the credibility of CoinDesk behind it, Qtum began getting more mainstream attention.  Nasdaq.com, Siliconangle and EconoTimes all wrote articles based on the CoinDesk original.  Then, on January 24th, Bitcoin.com’s Jamie Redman wrote an article about Qtum. That article, like the ones before it, parroted the claims made by the Qtum team.  But the biggest bump to Qtum’s visibility was an article by a Forbes Contributor. Roger Aitken will seemingly write about any two-bit cryptocurrency project. Aitken wrote a poorly researched article that shows his tenuous grasp (at best) of blockchain technology. He says Qtum is attempting to be the “blockchain of China” even though regional cryptocurrencies are a long dead fad and were never workable.  Aitken’s articles take phrases straight out of the Qtum website, word for word. “[Jordan] has been developing software since he was thirteen, reviewed over 100 altcoins and identified multiple exploits in coins” appears both on the Qtum website and Aitken’s article.  After Forbes, several other media outlets covered Qtum, including Finance Magnates and the International Business Times UK. Later, Bitcoin.com released a later article with a curious note at the bottom.      “Disclaimer: Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com, is a Qtum investor.”  With Ver’s name officially attached, Qtum seemed likely to be the first big ICO of 2017 largely due to the articles that gave it credibility. Qtum.org's Alexa.com statistics Qtum.org’s Alexa.com statistics  The problem with all these articles is that no one stopped to ask: who is Patrick Dai? Why does Googling his name reveal so few results? And most important: What did he actually do before Qtum?  Because what someone has done in the past is usually the best indicator of how they will behave in the future.",False

Just say that you got a million dollars in seed funding whether you did or not, then pay for marketing from the little seed money that you most likely did receive, then you and the seeders will enjoy their ROI stemming from the projected $10M payday. Don't worry if one of your co-founders is a known scammer in this space because your fellow associates making up 100% of your foundation WILL find NO proof that such is the case, else they, too, would loose out on the $10M payday.  Get the point of all this now? If not, have somebody read it to you very, very slowly, for it's difficult for some to grasp the concept after just one read-through.",False

Re ""It seems unlikely that anyone on the team was unaware that Patrick Dai and Shuai Chu were the same person."": Are you telling me that 4/5 direct brainiac partners and close associates of Mr. Whatever-His-Name-Is-Today didn't independently or in concert with others do any due diligence as to exactly who is the leader of Qtum, including its co-founder, Neil Mahi? If that ain't a crazy enough question to ponder, consider asking the same one regarding all them investors who collectively contributed over a million dollars into the project so to ... wait for it ...  http://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-angels-invest-1-million-bitcoin-ethereum-hybrid-qtum/  Quote Dai told CoinDesk:  ""We raised the money to prove that our approach is right. We used the money to do the minimum viable product. The testnet is live now, but it is private, it is already working.""  Dai said that the Qtum Foundation could seek to raise up to $10m in the token offering. In Q3 of 2016, nearly $200m was raised in ICOs, according to CoinDesk Research data.  Qtum also claims to be partnering with PwC Asia, which both its team members and investors said will be providing accounting services for the project.  AND, if that's not enough, does PricewaterhouseCoopers [in Asia] know exactly who they're dealing with regarding Qtum or do they just accept any name one gives them as acting auditors on their entity's behalf, stamping any papers with their approval depicting figures given to them by some nym? Think about it! Think about real hard.  This is what I think:  The advent of Bitcoin -> everybody excited, then it waned. Then along came Ethereum -> cycle repeated. Enter Qtum -> if you liked Bitcoin and Ethereum, you'll love the marriage of them two; please send us $10M dollars.

He knows very well how to scam bitcointalk investors. If the project was that good, the investors would probably bought them out and keep for themself. Which is why they can only sell 49%. A very odd number.  What suprises me though is the fact, another victim of Steven came forward today: https://soundcloud.com/physibles/interview-with-elmerlin-about-patrickdai-aka-stephendai-from-qtumofficial-qtum-bitbayofficial  And Brett/ Earlz/ John decided that the ICO will commence as planned.  How sad? I do  understand that they will lose their job without an ICO and hence they keep defending Steven. But with so much evidence, this Steven Dai is the ""Hitler"" of ICO""s Why risk a venture which is doomed for failure because your boss is a famous conman/scamartist??

And you investors make up your mind from there. This will elaborate on my somewhat emotional conversation on Slack. My hands were literally shaking from emotion as it brings back very painful memories. I'm not afraid to confront it again though.  The point being he got 10% of BitBay for free that was sold on us. He got 191 BTC minus the 20 he put in the dev fund.  The dev fund was 100 btc. There was 5 members so you divide that by 5. Thats 20 each.  This deducts it to 171.  Steven did release the 2nd key to that multisig. It was a dev fund it wasn't Stevens money other than 20 btc. https://blockchain.info/tx/7b1c9d0e062bdb61dd0565a98a1136c028c2b5bc05a0fa859aac2dde3d22d6ce?show_adv=false  Bob and Gekko stole some of it so that lowered it down from 100 to roughly 50-60. I would have to check year old Skype logs to know exactly what Steven said they took.  Steven told me via Skype that him and Lin from BTER would raise it to over 100 but they never did. Instead he just gives me the 2nd key to the multisig (you know its multisig BitHalo because it starts with a ""3"").  So if Steven/Lin added anything to that it was less than 16 btc. Since Bob and Gekko got 1/2 of the dev fund.  So that means Steven got 155-171 BTC and 10% of BitBay which he got for free. Steven Dai will not be wise to deny those numbers. Then he admits much later that him and Lin bought some at the bottom so potentially Steven had 20%.  Dai will not deny this as he knows we can produce more chat logs and he himself can probably give you txids of his wallets. Ask him yourself.  He then proceeded to sell all of that on BitBays head while I stayed and built this project. He got free coins and didn't stay to help build this. Him leaving in 2015 is immediate. He started BitBay in November 11th 2014 so thats only a couple months. Our statement stands. By his own admission, he did in fact abandon this project with investors money and did no work in return for it.  If anyone thinks that is okay then that is very sad indeed.  If Dai wants to say he and Lin did not sell all their BitBay all he has to do is send .001 BitBay from each account he holds to prove how much he has left. Of course that will never happen. He rambled on slack about ""Giving it to BTER"" whatever that means. It went to the inky void I guess.  Why did I say ""Steven is a nice guy"" after the ICO went south? I was not happy with him at all. Lets make this clear. But I do try to be professional. Because everyone in BitBay was told by Steven himself he would not leave the project which turned out to be a lie. I have skype logs of me trying to contact him for years. Google voice logs of me trying to call him to no avail. After repeatedly pestering him he gave 500 dollars. He said he would do so every month. That also turned out to be a lie. I sent him messages monthly and private emails and phone calls which all got ignored after that. Dai may also claim he paid for a website and this is true as well. Our team did try to get him to participate it was extremely hard and was more work than its worth.  Dai raised the point that Elmer asked for a settlement. That is Elmers business, not ours. He got seriously effected since he flew to China and met Gekko and Dai and Lin in person and lost over 100 bitcoins. I personally have no interest in Dai's money. All I wanted was his time and energy to honor his word to investors.  Most importantly, this is the skype log where Dai pumps the coin with his own money https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C5PCSNkWcAIrAay.jpg:large  Then he gets it all back with a refund from Lin(BTER). Lins exchange later gets ""hacked"" for millions of dollars in their cold wallet. They gave Bobsurplus 500 BTC before the project even finished funding which is extremely crazy. There is a txid for that. Bob claims he ""did marketing"" for that. Instead he FUDs his own project from Bays launch since it was a character assassination. The project was set up to crush me, it was a hit job. They chose the ""Baywest"" toilet paper logo for the BitBay logo. Something Gekko and Bob were proud of. None of their financials were made aware to me until I saw the ICO funding. I was the one to blow the lid open on it. Bob/Robert Duskes/International Rob was counting on that, used fake profiles to shill me the second the ICO started, Barabbas is Iconicexpert and Bobs shill profile(tons of evidence they use this to shill on the internet on reddit and other forums this was already exposed), and you can get clear evidence of shilling by looking up ""Diabolic"" for example on bitcointalk which Gekko/Ryan Wright created for the sole purpose of attacking me.  Bob starts a ""Zimbeck is a scammer"" thread to divert attention. No actual accusation was made by the way, its just a dump of chat logs proving i knew him. Guilty by association. And to be honest gets me upset that Bitcointalk mods did nothing about it. Mprep seemed to be partial to Bob in private convos which makes me lose a lot of respect for this forum. Theymos never even responded to a single message despite me trying at his emails, reddit and BCT. Because of the chat log spam it ranked high on Google. Bitcointalk lets anyone post an accusation and these propagandists counted on it.  To make matters worse they had been using me as a fall guy from the day the ICO ended and you can see evidence of this. Kronengburg broke under pressure and admitted to being paid to harm my rep. You can look at his comment history if you like. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=377396;sa=showPosts  Steven was just a liaison for Bobsurplus and Gekko. I didn't know who Bob was until a few days before ICO. They needed my name for the destruction of my reputation and profit off the years of hard work I put into Halo.  They all worked together on BitSwift as Paul from BitSwift will confirm. Its really old news. I made the mistake of claiming Steven was involved in Ghostcoin and that was a rumor I had heard a long time ago which i realize can't be backed up. However I do think Steven will even admit himself working on BitSwift and Paul can back up my claims and I doubt Steve will deny this. BitSwift was a Bobsurplus thing and that is not good news. Paul tried to warn me after ICO but by that time it was too late.  A bit of info on bobsurplus and what he did to BitBay: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=891356.0  We don't want to relive the past. Just be aware this is the guy running Qtum. It saddens us that Qtum is going forward with an ICO despite all this. We won't ""fud"" Qtum. We simply tried to prevent further damage Dai might cause by enriching himself with investors funds as he did with us. Anything beyond this you should direct your questions to Patrick Dai.  We will issue our condolences to the Qtum team as well and any conflict of interest developers may face working for him. Just take a very long pause to think about what is being said here and decide if you are okay with taking investors money and letting Dai manage it knowing what you know now. We personally think ICO is a bad idea. If Dai already got a million, why not prove his concept first and not even hold an ICO? If he releases a working project then move forward. Just run it on testnet until its done? But thats probably wishful thinking... there is no justice in crypto it seems. Can you prove he will not get free coins in Qtum? Can you prove he doesn't have a deal with private investors for them to get free stake or refunds from the ICO funding? The same modus operandi was used on us in BitBay and that you can prove beyond the shadow of any doubt.  BitBay has moved beyond what they have done, through all the adversity. I'm going to finish this project even if it kills me. Even if i don't make a dime off it. I've worked 2 years since ICO and will work 10 more for free if I have to. We don't want your money, angel investment, nothing. We are not interested in riding your marketing. This will be my last comment on the subject. My full time job is coding, not social media management.  Do as you wish with what you know now.",False

Firstly, I’d like to confirm that I was indeed involved in the project, going under the name of Steven Dai. I, Xuguang Dai by birth, have been using the western nicknames Patrick and Steven interchangingly in order to engage smoothly with western partners. This is a commonplace practice in Asia, and in fact, I still use Steven from time to time.  As it is clear by now, the BitBay project was indeed highly problematic, with many goodwilling investors and entrepreneurs, including myself, losing some money and time invested in the project due to malevolent activity of some individuals.  My involvement in the project began in 2014, with the intent to support the development of decentralized commerce and the blockchain space in general. However, I soon found out the hard way that not all involved in BitBay’s operations shared these goals.  With questionable ends and actions surfacing, I decided to leave the project in 2015, after doing my best to support the remaining developers and handing them all BitBay related holdings under my control. These assets included about 70 BTC, which were transferred to BitBay’s developers before my departure from the project.  I want to assure you that I regard integrity and rightful conduct as my main priorities in all my business activities, past, present and future. I am confident that my performance in cooperation with the rest of the Qtum team will assert itself very soon.  Sincerely,  Patrick Dai""     Thank you for your patience.",False

People are making allegations that Patrick is a known scammer previously operating under a different alias.  It is up to you whether you trust your money to someone with questionable history.  It is besides the point that large companies and other backers have done (albeit weak) due diligence.  Moreover, it is a greater concern if following their due diligence process, they consider it ""not a concern"" regarding his history, in which case, should further evidence be unveiled that Patrick is indeed guilty, then their association with him would be a major detriment to themselves as well as all parties who may know the truth but choose to side with him for the benefit of themselves.",False

But yeah, we should totally take your anecdotal opinion of Dai over that.  Even before the history of Dai came to light, this project had some shady aspects to its fundamentals. The token distribution is ridiculous. After the ICO 49% of the coins would be controlled by the small group of people comprising the team + angel investors, in addition to all the BTC they would get from selling off the other 51%. And that 51% that is being sold to the public is being sold predominately through exchanges nobody on here had ever heard of before this project. Exchanges which very easily could also be controlled by members of the team+angel investors. On top of this, the coin is PoS but there is no mention of the PoS inflation rate in either of the whitepapers. A PoS coin with a small group in control of 49% of the supply LOL, so they would also be generating 49% of the the coins generated through PoS. Not to mention all they would have to do is somehow get their hands on another 2% of the supply (through buying into their own ICO, for example) to be able to abuse the network.",False

BitBay’s lead developer, David Zimbeck has confirmed the man using the name Patrick Dai from QTUM, was known as Steven Dai when he was associated with BitBay.  Steven Dai walked away from BitBay with publically invested Bitcoin & millions of BAY from the initial offering which has never been returned.  The BitBay team recommends extreme caution when it comes to investing in any cryptocurrency project associated with Steven (AKA Patrick) Dai.  BitBay is more interested in letting people know about the future than reliving the past. Even without support from the original founders, David Zimbeck has continued with the development of BitBay. A fully functional decentralized Smart Contract client is freely available for public use and is the most advanced crypto currency product available today.   That doesen't look like FUD.

First, why are only 51% of the coins being sold to the community?  Why are they using only chinese exchanges and official website? Note that i got told by a dev on slack that Chinese exchanges are going to be the fastest way of buying Qtum, which is bad for every non-chinese investor. Not to mention that all I hear about chinese exchanges is that they are kinda shady and not trustworthy.  What will be the price/Qtum? Not so worried about it but ICO is in 9 days, could get some info on that.  The fact that it is like the first one to not share its code before the ICO, if not then I am sorry, just not aware of any other like this. And the fact that the Mainnet will only be live at least a couple months after the ICO ""successful"" ending.  Exchanges will keep the coins for all that time, could lead to some manipulation, steal, and whatnot.  I really like the idea, the future plans and the fact that they got a lot of media attention but this last one can also be a very bad thing.    ",False

Whitepapers, website, and everything looks very professional. Keeping my eye on this one. I guess my only concern, like many others, is that only 51% of funds are sold to ICO investors and the rest is being kept by the team et al. 49% token share + all the money you are going to raise through the ICO seems ridiculous (and unprecedented).  And it appears the distribution numbers don't take into account inflation from PoS either? Or am I missing something? It says 51% will be distributed to community (through ICO), 20% team/angels, 20% business development, and 9% for research etc. But then there will also be coins produced through PoS that aren't included in this breakdown, right? So there will be more inflation/share dilution that an ICO investor needs to be aware of. What is the breakdown of the inflation due to PoS?  Also, as a potential investor I wish only BTC was being used to fund development and research instead of the using a share of the tokens. You plan to sell 29% shares of the token to generate funds over 3-4 years, which is going to drive the price down during that time. And when you say ""Ultimately, 100% tokens will be allocated to the community so that Qtum can become a truly open source community."" Isn't that just the same as saying you are also going to sell your 20% team/angel shares?",False

The Qtum Project combines Bitcoin Core with Ethereum by enabling the EVM to operate on the UTXO model through Qtum’s Account Abstraction Layer  The Qtum project has extended the Bitcoin script by adding three opcodes. This provides an environment the Ethereum Virtual Machine can operate in, and do so within the parameters of an UTXO environment.  One may ask, ‘Why is this necessary when the end result is a successful smart contract execution?’  The answer is ‘parallelism.’ The current Ethereum structure takes a linear approach to Smart Contract execution. Reinventing the wheel, when a flexible solution already exists, seems like an industry regression.  Although Qtum is a hybrid solution, we wanted to avoid a situation where we merged two codebases that weren’t compatible. The vast resources available for the UTXO projects – like Bitcoin, Litecoin and others – can easily be modified to work with Qtum’s blockchain. Plus, the ability to implement BIPs was a ‘must-have.’  We believe that the sum of all transactions is what makes up the blockchain. We wanted to avoid a situation where virtual transactions result in two block explorers showing different results for one transaction, as some would be virtually untraceable. The UTXO platform will not allow this, and we also get the security benefits like “Pay 2 script hash” (BIP16), native multi-signatures, protection from double spend attacks, and reduction in the threat of having to fork.  This is only scratching the surface on why we chose the best platform to build on. It is cost-effective to implement the Ethereum Virtual Machine, because of the money spent developing it. We can focus on other core features, and dedicate resources to improve the sustainability of our project.  BC: Do you feel smart contracts will be more popular in the near future?  PD: I think we will see a lot of businesses automate their processes with blockchain smart contracts. A multitude of industries have explored blockchain technology over the last few years, and we believe with the Qtum platform they will be able to move from proof-of-concept to implementation quicker. Once businesses adopt blockchain smart contracts, we will then see more consumer applications of the technology.  BC: Can you explain what a ‘Master Contract’ is?  PD: Designed to be flexible for the mainstream business industry, Master Contracts are ‘off-chain’ agreements that make use of oracles and data feeds. This feature will be designed for certain use cases, bringing a new concept to the blockchain industry, and changing the way contract lifecycle management is handled.  BC: Your team recently got backing from a prominent member of the cryptocurrency space. Can you tell our readers about this?  PD: Qtum received backing from Roger Ver, the first investor in blockchain startups. Roger is a visionary, he saw the potential of Bitcoin before almost everyone, and he bet big on it. This gives us a lot of validation for our project. We believe our contributions will benefit the blockchain community as a whole and illustrate that innovation is the key to growing.  We also have the support of Anthony Di Iorio, an Ethereum founder; Bo Shen, Managing Partner of Fenbushi Capital; Xu Star, the CEO of OkCoin; as well as Chen Wei Xing, founder of Kuaidi, which merged with Didi and others. Qtum ￼Qtum Wins One of the Most Innovative Projects at Demo Day at the Global Blockchain Summit 2016  BC: Why is Qtum designed with a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism?  PD: There are so many reasons to implement a staking consensus model, and we considered this carefully when designing the Qtum architecture. Our lead developer Jordan Earls created a new proof-of-work algorithm in the past, so we spent some time discussing if this was the path we wanted to take. Should a network offer ASIC resistance to fend off centralization of the hashing power or not?  In all of our talks to businesses, maintaining the network through proof-of-work mining was a real concern. They asserted that efficiencies of blockchain technology shouldn’t be undermined by the inefficiencies of mining. Industry users don’t spend an excessive amount of time learning how proof-of-work systems operate. The more we delved into the topic with financial institutions, logistics providers, manufacturers, the argument for a proof-of-stake consensus model became more obvious.  The proof-of-stake consensus model makes a strong case for adoption in the Proof-of-Stake whitepaper. They list some potential threats that Sunny King’s original protocol could be vulnerable to, and offer more incentive for people to secure the network. The fact that this system rewards users who actively stake, opposed to those who just keep their coins on an exchange, or build up coin age to stake in bursts.  In short, the reason we adopted proof-of-stake is the fact that it’s an efficient and secure consensus algorithm.  BC: Can you explain what ‘Sparknet’ is?  PD: “Sparknet” is the fruit of our labor. It’s a fully working testnet of the Qtum Core technology. This is where we merge Bitcoin Core v0.13 with proof-of-stake and the Ethereum Virtual Machine. This is only possible by making changes to Bitcoin Core’s scripting language and adding an “Account Abstract Layer.” While these Qtum tokens will just be used for testing, they will be a great way to showcase our technology while we look for bugs before the main network is launched. We plan to release Sparknet within a couple of months of the crowdsale.  BC: How will Qtum avoid smart contract bugs and exploits, such as the recent DAO incident?  PD: We will try to avoid these smart contract bugs through two approaches.  We will introduce the formal semantics method to verify the completeness and veracity of one smart contract, so before the contract has been deployed on blockchain, we can prevent some bugs.  Also, Qtum aims to establish a smart contract hub, offering secure and thoroughly tested contract templates, tailor fit for a multitude of industries, such as supply chain management, telecommunications, IoT, social networking, and more.  BC: What’s the ultimate goal of the Qtum Foundation?  PD: We recently released a 32-page governance document called: “The Qtum Blockchain Economy Whitepaper.” In the Economy Whitepaper, we go in depth and discuss how the ultimate goal of the Foundation is to become irrelevant, giving the community full control of the project after four years.  The goal of the Qtum Foundation is to assist getting the Qtum Project off the ground and ensuring that the project has sound management. The goal of the Foundation is not to control the project, but to aide it in its infancy.  What do you think about the Qtum project? Let us know in the comments below.

To unlock the Asian market, register now to the iFX EXPO in Hong Kong.  The project is supported by some top investors, mainly from China, including: Anthony Di Iorio, Ethereum founder and CEO of JaxxWallet; Chen Weixing, billionaire founder of Kuaidi, one of the largest car riding services in China;  Jeremy Gardner, co-founder of Auger and EIR at Blockchain Capital; David Lee Cuo Chuen, founder of Left Coast, Libai, and DLEE Capital Management; Bo Shen, General Partner at Fenbushi Capital; Jehan Chu, Managing Partner at Jen Advisor; Qingzhong Gao, Director of HuaWei Strategic Cooperation; Xu Star, OKCoin CEO; Lihua Yi, Partner of ZhongWo Investment; and Xiaolai Li, one of biggest bitcoin holders in the world and Blockchain Angel Backer.   Bo Shen commented to Finance Magnates: “I’ve been searching for a project that could be the foundation of a new blockchain economy. This is it, and this is the team I believe can make it happen.”  According to the whitepaper, Qtum provides a turing-complete blockchain, able to execute smart contracts and decentralized applications, comparable to the Ethereum blockchain. However, in contrast to Ethereum, Qtum is built upon Bitcoin’s well-established UTXO transaction model and employs a proof-of-stake consensus scheme.  Patrick Dai is the Chairman of the Qtum Foundation. He was previously employed by Alibaba, and now committed to the blockchain technology development and research for a doctorate degree.   He said: “We are publishing this business whitepaper because we want the community to know we are serious. We are organized. Most blockchain projects lack this vision when they are starting, and it’s just another fundamental difference that will help make Qtum a success. Qtum’s goal is to be the most stable, user-friendly blockchain for individuals and businesses. We want people to know who they are working with, and who’s behind the code.”  The whitepaper specifies an array of services, designed to bridge the still existing gap between blockchains and the business world, by allowing smart contracts to adhere to changing commercial rules and regulations consistently. They say these services will also enable Qtum’s smart contracts to efficiently interface with real-time data inputs from stock markets, weather forecasts, news agencies, and the like.",False

The blockchain, the technology underlying this achievement, was originally introduced to solve the “double spending problem” in peer-to-peer digital currency systems. However, soon enough it became self-evident that blockchain technology was capable of facilitating much more than allowing individuals to exchange “electronic cash” without having to rely on banks, clearing houses or any other intermediary.  In 2013, a young cryptocurrency researcher named Vitalik Buterin, only 19 at the time, proposed a scheme to generalize bitcoin’s decentralized exchange model, so it could execute far more complicated transactions, which could be tied to binary conditions. For instance: if, and only if, a set of conditions is met (like a product delivered, a service provided, etc.), then a payment should be triggered automatically and irreversibly. This re-introduced the idea of self-executing smart contracts into blockchain discourse – allowing anonymous parties to engage in direct exchange without the backing of lawyers, court orders or the police, taking the idea of intermediary-less p2p commerce to a whole new level. Buterin and his colleagues proposed to generalize this concept of smart contracts even further, exceeding the purely economic realm of economics, and heralding a new age of decentralized computation. Since smart contracts operate on a binary if-this-then-that basis, Buterin suggested that they could serve as the basis of a decentralized programming language, able to code any application, without it having to be deployed on a centralized server. With this understanding, the Ethereum Project was born.  However, these new exciting abilities came at a price: in order to sustain the complexity of the new smart contracting platform, bitcoin’s elegant and rock solid transaction model had to be modified to the degree that interacting with the ethereum blockchain became a complicated and heavy-duty operation. While bitcoin has been running for almost a decade on, more or less, the same code, and has sparked since then numerous light-weight, mobile applications, and gateways; ethereum – with all its potential – remained a niche work-in-progress, not very well suited for massive mainstream adoption. Preparing for a Qtum Leap  Understanding both – the enormous potential of ethereum’s decentralized computation platform, as well the importance of bitcoin’s ingenious simplicity – the Qtum team has designed a system which combines the most valuable assets of both projects. Building on bitcoins reliable and proven-to-deliver blockchain, Qtum stacks a communication layer, allowing it to seamlessly interact with an enhanced version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) called the Qtum Virtual Machine (QVM). With this innovation it is now possible to execute smart contracts and run decentralized applications, simply and securely, in environments that were previously out of reach for ethereum, combining the endless possibilities provided by smart contracts with the stability and maturity of the bitcoin ecosystem. Going Mobile  One of the main advantages of bitcoin’s unspent transaction output (UTXO) model is its ability to sustain lite wallets. Lite wallets allow users to interact with the bitcoin network without having to download and sync with the entire blockchain. Instead, lite wallets use the Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) protocol, which only requires wallets to download a small part of the blockchain, while ensuring that they only receive transactions which are necessary and relevant to operate.  On ethereum, however, the entire blockchain needs to be processed to interact with the network. Therefore, if one is interested in using an ethereum-powered application, or communicating with a smart contract, one first has to download and sync the entire ethereumblockchain, which to date weighs up to 50 GB and has a monthly growth rate of 1-5 GB, depending on the ethereum client. This state of affairs made it impossible to envision a mobile future for fully decentralized applications. Until now, that is. Qtum, based on bitcoin’s UTXO transaction model, allows applications and devices to interact with the Qtumblockchain with a lite wallet, while still being able to process smart contracts on Qtum’s Virtual Machine.  With this, it is finally possible to execute any smart contract on your mobile phone or tablet, as easily, fast and securely as sending a simple transaction from your mobile wallet. With about a half of all internet traffic to major sites being generated by mobile devices, this ability is mandatory if we want to see the massive adoption of decentralized applications (DApps), smart contracts and a p2p economy. A Blockchain Powered Internet of Things  A smart contract fueled Internet of Things has always been among the primary goals of the decentralization movement, and rightly so. Imagine an apartment door that unlocks automatically if and when the owner receives the due payment or a rental car that can be picked up by whoever paid the fee, without having to sign forms or leave a security in escrow. Any given device could be locked or unlocked for predetermined periods, according to a smart contract where all parties agree upon in advance.  Envisioning such a decentralized sharing economy becomes much easier with Qtum’s lite wallet functionality. Instead of forcing each and every device, connected to the IoT, to act as a full node, smart devices could easily sync with the blockchain using a small amount bandwidth and storage, allowing for a much more agile and efficient network. Scalability, Speed, and Efficiency  Both, ethereum and bitcoin, are based on a similar consensus scheme to ensure the coherence and security of their blockchain. Consensus in this respect means that all nodes in the network compare their results, so to speak, to make sure that only entries everybody agrees upon are recorded on the blockchain. There are several ways to reach consensus; the classic bitcoin/ethereum method is called Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining, which functions by agreeing that the most accurate chain of blocks is the one associated with the most work, or computational tasks, behind it. Mining makes attacks very costly due to arduous, and otherwise useless, computations demanded from miners participating in the block-verification game. Mining is very wasteful, in both terms of energy consumption and time. Essentially, millions of devices are performing non-functional operations for the sole purpose of rendering attacks on the network expensive.  Qtum is among the first fully decentralized and Turing-complete blockchains to utilize an attractive and much more energy-efficient method to maintain coherence with a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. In a PoS environment, nodes have to pose a staking fee to participate in the validation game, which is automatically foreclosed upon if the node is shown to operate with malicious intents, hence rendering attacks costly and inefficient, without having to waste precious computational resources.  Further increasing speed and efficiency, bitcoin’s UTXO transaction model, implemented on Qtum, allows the network to process several transactions in parallel and in any given order. This is in stark contrast to ethereum’s architecture, which demands all transactions to be processed one at a time, in chronological order – making it so that at any given moment all nodes connected to the ethereum network process only one single transaction, while all other transactions have to wait in line.  Compatibility across the board Utilizing an enhanced EVM analog, the Qtumblockchain is compatible with existing ethereum-based smart contracts. Ethereum contracts can be ported to Qtum with little to no change to their code and execute as expected. Furthermore, Qtum implements complete backwards compatibility, meaning that once a decentralized application or contract is deployed on the Qtum network, they will stay operational, even if the system is updated. With this, Qtum solves a huge problem, very well known to ethereum developers, who very often find their applications rendered useless by recurring changes to the ethereum network.  The bitcoin-based UTXO transaction model also ensures that Qtum will be mostly compatible with the existing bitcoin ecosystem, allowing Qtum users to benefit from the industry’s top-notch innovations, fueled by hundreds of millions of dollars already invested in the space. For example, if a payment gateway accepts bitcoin today, it already holds the potential to support Qtum transactions easily and link to Qtum’s API, without any significant modifications to their operation.  Bridging the Gap between Blockchains and the Business World Despite their great potential, businesses, governments, and other legacy organizations still struggle with implementing blockchain-based solutions. These groups, in large part, aren’t using blockchain smart contracts because they operate in an isolated blockchain environment. In this respect, the greatest advantage of smart contract based commerce is also its biggest impairment.  To circumvent these technical and legal hurdles, and to unleash the full potential of the blockchain, Qtum introduces the Master Contract concept. Master Contracts allow DApps and smart contracts to trigger real-world, off-chain data inputs, auditable by a verified Oracle or the contracts mediator – while the contracts essential elements, such as participants and authorization structures, are secured on the blockchain itself.  This allows blockchain-based commerce to adhere to changing commercial rules and regulations, while interfacing with real-time data inputs from stock markets, weather forecasts, news agencies, etc.. Cooperating with a series of partners and third parties, Qtum aims to establish a smart contract hub, offering secure and thoroughly tested contract templates, tailor fitted for a multitude of industries and use cases, such as supply chain management, telecommunications, IoT, social networking, and more. With this, it will be easier than ever for established sectors and legacy institutions to interface with blockchain technology and enjoy their benefits Conclusion Smart contracts and DApps hold great potential for the future of both – the emerging p2p economy and the Internet sustaining it; but for them to reach mainstream adoption, decentralized applications have to be accessible, easy to use and operational on all major platforms used by the end consumer.  With this in mind, the Qtum team is building on well-established technologies like the bitcoin network, as well as on state of the art innovations, to produce a blockchain compatible with the major existing ecosystems, as well as cutting-edge capabilities these are lacking. Join us for a Qtum leap towards the future of mobile smart contracts and the mainstream adoption of decentralized applications.",False

Expect to see more press over the next few days.    http://www.forbes.com/sites/rogeraitken/2017/02/06/qtum-mixing-bitcoin-ethereum-launching-proof-of-stake-smart-contracts-platform           Purporting to have a host of tech innovations in the pipeline and influential partners, the architects of the Qtum blockchain – Qtum Foundation – have gained a prominent group of Angel investors and signed up a top four accountancy firm for project governance and risk control. The founder of Kuaidi, a major Chinese car-hailing service that merged with DiDi, and a big global bitcoin holder are amongst the backers.  It was through this network that US$1m was raised last year to kickstart that the Singapore-based project, which has the ambitious goal of becoming the ‘Blockchain of China’ no less.  Having previously announced plans to meld the Bitcoin protocol with Ethereum technology, they are now launching the first ‘Proof-of-Stake’ smart contracts platform. It is all part of what the developers behind the project hope “can disrupt entire business models” by spawning a series of ideas and engagement with enthusiasts.  The Backers  A group of ten major backers have provided their financial support and opened up their network of connections to help accelerate development of the Qtum technology and infrastructure around it. However, the identity of the top accountancy firm helping with the project’s governance structure remains undisclosed for now.  “All of our investors are strategic backers as well as financial backers,” explained Patrick Dai, the 27-year co-founder of Qtum (pronounced ‘Quantum’). It is the Qtum Foundation, established last November and headquartered in Singapore, that is the decision-making body driving the project’s development.  By any measure we are talking to some big hitters on the investment scene when looking down the list of the protagonists supporting Qtum’s endeavours.  As well as Chen Weixing, the billionaire founder of Kuaidi being in the fold, there is Anthony Di Iorio, Ethereum founder and CEO of JaxxWallet; Jeremy Gardner, co-founder of Augur and EIR at Blockchain Capital; David Lee Cuo Chuen, founder of Left Coast, Libai, and DLEE Capital Management. Recommended by Forbes  Then there is Bo Shen, General Partner at Fenbushi Capital; Jehan Chu, Managing Partner at Jen Advisors; Qingzhong Gao, director of Huawei Strategic Cooperation; Xu Star, OKCoin CEO; Lihua Yi; and, Partner of ZhongWo Investment. Add to that Xiaolai Li, one of biggest bitcoin holders in the world and a Blockchain Angel backer.  Dai, a Computer Science PhD candidate at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, commenting on the level of investment attracted said: “We raised more than we originally intended to get the project started.”  He added: “But since these backers were able to provide a great deal of technical and strategic support, we saw it as very beneficial to the project. This has enabled us to hit a few major milestones before our crowdsale.”  A former Alibaba senior product manager, Dai told Forbes that funds from this crowdsale will be used to develop the technology and “enhance the usability of the platform”.  He asserted: “Qtum is committed to creating a globally influential open source community by co-operating with other blockchain communities, third-party developers and technological innovations.” Their ultimate goal is to bring blockchain technology into industries spanning finance, social, mobile, the Internet of Things (IoT) as well as other sectors.  While they clearly want to the community to be involved in helping develop this platform, Qtum has yet to decide on a date for its crowdsale.  As a combination of Bitcoin Core, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the end product of Qtum Blockchain is Qtum Core, which will allow smart contracts to execute on a PoS consensus model.  A major Qtum goal is to build a so-called Value Transfer Protocol, which along with decentralized applications (dapps) can be used to support and enhance various industries. Another goal is to maintain compatibility with existing processes from Bitcoin and Ethereum, to be as secure as possible and to be used not just in the finance industry.  While Qtum can in theory be used just like Bitcoin to send and receive digital currency – except for the PoS modifications – the real power of Qtum centres on the Smart Contract system.  What’s The Interest?  Many consider Qtum to be the top team coming out of China given their industry expertise and enterprise interest. “Our backers like the fact that we have taken into consideration what has and has not worked for blockchain technology…and they see us building from there,” he said. And, the pioneers and the backers aim to make this technology extremely usable going forward.  Dai added: “There is high demand for China to have its own blockchain and our objective is to be the blockchain of China and gradually advance from there to be one of the top technology platforms in the world.”  The team at Qtum alongside Dai includes Jordan Earls, Qtum Core developer, and Neil Mahi, Qtum Blockchain Architect. Earls, who has been developing software since he was thirteen, reviewed over 100 altcoins and identified multiple exploits in coins.  Mahi, who has Master’s degree in Business Administration from ISCAE but specialized later on in computer science, has around twenty years’ experience developing software and four years’ experience in the blockchain space. There are also former employees from some China’s biggest companies including Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent in the team.  Bitcoin Core Protocol  From a technical perspective, Qtum is an open-source value transfer protocol and decentralized application platform, which is boldly touted as an “elegant new paradigm” combining  the stability of the Bitcoin Core protocol with an enhanced version of the EVM called the Qtum Virtual Machine (QVM).  Some have expressed the view that it is basically just another bitcoin fork with extension to the bitcoin scripting language and a new altcoin platform. The founders counter those claims.  While the Bitcoin Core is the most thoroughly tested blockchain code in the world, with billions of dollars of trust within the network and millions of dollars spent each year for the developers to maintain and enhance it, “unfortunately bitcoin is limited in what it can do with its simple script language” according to Dai.  “Primarily it’s used for sending value. On the other hand, ethereum allows for many use cases; but the source code is not as stable and secure as bitcoin’s source code,” he explained.  “The new paradigm of Qtum is where we bring the new industry-friendly consensus with a stable, safe and scalable platform. Qtum is combining the best parts of bitcoin and ethereum,” contended Dai.  As such it is claimed to be “consistent” with Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), as it is based on Bitcoin’s unspent transaction output (UTXO) model, while allowing real-time interactions with the QVM.  Account Abstraction Layer  This is said to be accomplished by using Qtum’s Account Abstraction Layer, which allows the QVM to operate on a stable and proven platform – without the use of Ethereum’s account model. (Note: The open source project integrates the EVM with Bitcoin’s UTXO model and aims to provide smart contracts to businesses worldwide).  Dai pointed out: “Bringing a superior version of the EVM to the UTXO model does more than just allow the standard smart contracts you can perform on Ethereum. And, we plan to expand on this in the next few weeks.”  This Smart Contract and Decentralized Applications platform is further held up as allowing developers to “easily port” projects from the Ethereum blockchain to Qtum’s. But one might ask how exactly.  “All current ethereum projects can be easily ported to Qtum platform since the Qtum platform is compatible with EVM,” explained John Scianna at Qtum, who has worked for several startups included CoinPip and been following bitcoin since 2012. “The only thing a developer needs to do is to construct the states of contract and account based on the Qtum Account Abstraction Layer.”  He added: “We already have two community project. One is springemail (BiSMTP: Blockchain integrated SMTP), which we hope everyone will use their email as a wallet address, so people can send and receive cryptographic tokens through their email address. It aims aim to improve the usability of the blockchain industry.”  Likewise Qloha, is another project that will integrate into WeChat’s new mini app platform whereby people will be able to send and receive tokens through WeChat. Both these projects aim to improve the usability of the blockchain industry.  Qtum’s Roadmap  The startup has revealed that it is “constantly looking” to implement not just what designs they have now, but also to ensure that the designs they are building will be extensible and work well as a foundation to build on for their future activities.  While these are “in-flux designs”, some ideas currently being discussed include: better and faster interactions with smart contracts from SPV wallets, making data feeds a ‘first-class citizen’ on the blockchain with efficiency and usability improvements and Automatic/periodic contract execution, plus enhancing side-chain support with smart contracts.  They have also not limited themselves one particular industry, which is why they have talked to many different potential stakeholders so that they could build an “industry agnostic” platform and not be oblivious to actual business needs.  Embracing Blockchain Technology  Qtum is a compatible community that according to Dai “embraces much of the best Blockchain technology available.”  Through the use of Oracles and data feeds, Smart Contracts can be made that allow anyone to take part in a living economy. This decentralized economy model under Qtum will be fully open sourced, meaning that any developer is welcome to review the code base completely.  An Oracle is a particular agent (i.e. entity, node or address) that is trusted by the participants in the blockchain. An Oracle network can be used to implement a system for off-blockchain computations and (total or partial) contract code execution.  “Useful and exciting smart contracts operating on public blockchains may need or require to process certain data (e.g. financial, economic, business, meteorological, social) that is external to the blockchain (i.e. out-of-blockchain data),” Dai explained.  For example, the result of a smart contract execution could depend on external data such as exchange rates, the GDP of countries, temperatures in cities and sports scores amongst other data. The term data-feed refers to any system, procedure or technique used to fetch ‘off-blockchain’ data and feed it to a smart contract – or decentralized application – being executed on the blockchain.  “Platform approaches based on a blockchain with a built-in virtual machine have the limitation that every node must execute (run) all of the smart contracts in real time, leading to slower speeds and redundant processing,” Dai stated. “Then, it’s possible that smart contracts that are computationally expensive would consume (take) an enormous amount of resources when being run on the blockchain.”  Therefore, in such cases a full execution of the smart contract on the blockchain may not be the best choice. And, he indicated that it might be “better or even necessary” to run the contract or part of its source code off-blockchain, where computations can be done at a much lower cost.  Also, given the public nature of the blockchain – where data and computations are publicly visible – and the privacy requirements of many financial transactions, off-blockchain executions could be necessary to preserve the privacy of smart contracts data and transactions.  Blockchain Ecosystem & Issues  As a promising ecosystem, Qtum Blockchain as well as combining the advantages of Bitcoin and Ethereum community it is said to address the “inherited problems” of existing blockchain systems.  These problems span the lack of business-oriented smart contracts in that the current smart contract platforms are mainly based on ‘Proof-of-Work’ (PoW). However, according to a recently published Qtum whitepaper the “consensus mechanism of Proof-of-Stake is more suited for business applications.”  There is also issue of compatibility between different blockchain technologies. Bitcoin’s UTXO model, for example, is not compatible with Ethereum’s account model.  One can also add the lack of flexibility consensus mechanisms because of different participants. Requirements of consensus mechanisms in the public chains and permissioned chain are different,  Then there is the lack of consideration for business compliance requirements (i.e. identity and KYC/AML requirements of the financial industry, which the current blockchain implementations cannot fully support).  Furthermore, current blockchain systems are not open enough, with most of the triggering criteria for smart contracts being set on the blockchain itself.

Recently, we have begun work on a new website.  That should be ready in about 3 weeks, until then, we will continue to use the current one (https://qtum.org).  The section where we list our Angel Backers has been updated, we will reveal more names shortly once we have approval.  We plan to discuss with our Angels why they decided to support our project, and what they expect from our team in the future.         The Qtum Crowd Sale will start on March 1st.  We currently have enough funds to last until the sale ends on April 1st.  The Crowd Sale will be hosted by major Chinese exchanges, which will be announced in February.  There will also be a direct sale that is done on our website.  The concrete information about the Crowd Sale will be announced in our business whitepaper prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers.  The technical whitepaper will come out mid-February.  The draft section that we released a few weeks back was from the last revision of the whitepaper, so that portion will be completely redone for the new version.  On the Press front, we have done a decent job gaining  traction with Blockchain industry sites.  Our focus right now is engaging with the mainstream press.  A large part of this project involves preparing a Blockchain project for real world business applications.  We already have a signed partnership agreement with a company valued at 100 million dollars USD, which we will discuss later.  We are currently in discussions with more companies, who are excited about our “Go Mobile” strategy.  This was actually the portion of our project that convinced a billionaire to back Qtum.  Our development team is currently merging the Proof-of-Stake protocol into Bitcoin Core v0.13, along with some testing of the Account Abstract layer we implemented to allow the EVM to run on a UTXO model.  The screenshot earlier of the mobile wallet is what you can expect to see once we have a working testnet.  Jordan Earls can give a better update on this later, and it’s best to ask him questions directly if you want more details.

As I don't think so : The Qtum Crowd Sale will start on March 1st.  We currently have enough funds to last until the sale ends on April 1st.  The Crowd Sale will be hosted by major Chinese exchanges, which will be announced in February. There will also be a direct sale that is done on our website. We're waiting for crowdsale and direct sell, and technical explain on the last revision of the whitepaper, I'm glad to learn more about it. Read this : Crowdfunding vs ICO One major difference exists between traditional crowdfunding methods and ICO, and that is market value. When a product is introduced on crowdfunding platforms, investors and buyers are aware exactly what to expect when the product is complete. In contrast, it is virtually impossible to predict the outcome of an ICO, especially if users aren’t fully aware what they can expect. ICO itself is not based on any real-world market value, which thus makes it prone to substantial under or overvaluation of assets. I like the idea of Qtum project which not concerned as medium of exchange instead of focusing on business support, Qtum plans to deliver a business friendly platform that can push forward Blockchain technology.  This means it’s not just a retail coin, in which a merchant can create invoices for products or services. Remember this : This project aims not to be another medium for exchange",False

The blockchain, the technology underlying this achievement, was originally introduced to solve the “double spending problem” in peer-to-peer digital currency systems. However, soon enough it became self-evident that blockchain technology was capable of facilitating much more than allowing individuals to exchange “electronic cash” without having to rely on banks, clearing houses or any other intermediary. In 2013, a young cryptocurrency researcher named Vitalik Buterin, only 19 at the time, proposed a scheme to generalize bitcoin’s decentralized exchange model, so it could execute far more complicated transactions, which could be tied to binary conditions. For instance: if, and only if, a set of conditions is met (like a product delivered, a service provided, etc.), then a payment should be triggered automatically and irreversibly. This re-introduced the idea of self-executing smart contracts into blockchain discourse – allowing anonymous parties to engage in direct exchange without the backing of lawyers, court orders or the police, taking the idea of intermediary-less p2p commerce to a whole new level. Buterin and his colleagues proposed to generalize this concept of smart contracts even further, exceeding the purely economic realm of economics, and heralding a new age of decentralized computation. Since smart contracts operate on a binary if-this-then-that basis, Buterin suggested that they could serve as the basis of a decentralized programming language, able to code any application, without it having to be deployed on a centralized server. With this understanding, the Ethereum Project was born. However, these new exciting abilities came at a price: in order to sustain the complexity of the new smart contracting platform, bitcoin’s elegant and rock solid transaction model had to be modified to the degree that interacting with the ethereum blockchain became a complicated and heavy-duty operation. While bitcoin has been running for almost a decade on, more or less, the same code, and has sparked since then numerous light-weight, mobile applications, and gateways; ethereum – with all its potential – remained a niche work-in-progress, not very well suited for massive mainstream adoption. Preparing for a Qtum Leap Understanding both – the enormous potential of ethereum’s decentralized computation platform, as well the importance of bitcoin’s ingenious simplicity – the Qtum team has designed a system which combines the most valuable assets of both projects. Building on bitcoins reliable and proven-to-deliver blockchain, Qtum stacks a communication layer, allowing it to seamlessly interact with an enhanced version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) called the Qtum Virtual Machine (QVM). With this innovation it is now possible to execute smart contracts and run decentralized applications, simply and securely, in environments that were previously out of reach for ethereum, combining the endless possibilities provided by smart contracts with the stability and maturity of the bitcoin ecosystem. Going Mobile One of the main advantages of bitcoin’s unspent transaction output (UTXO) model is its ability to sustain lite wallets. Lite wallets allow users to interact with the bitcoin network without having to download and sync with the entire blockchain. Instead, lite wallets use the Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) protocol, which only requires wallets to download a small part of the blockchain, while ensuring that they only receive transactions which are necessary and relevant to operate. On ethereum, however, the entire blockchain needs to be processed to interact with the network. Therefore, if one is interested in using an ethereum-powered application, or communicating with a smart contract, one first has to download and sync the entire ethereumblockchain, which to date weighs up to 50 GB and has a monthly growth rate of 1-5 GB, depending on the ethereum client. This state of affairs made it impossible to envision a mobile future for fully decentralized applications. Until now, that is. Qtum, based on bitcoin’s UTXO transaction model, allows applications and devices to interact with the Qtumblockchain with a lite wallet, while still being able to process smart contracts on Qtum’s Virtual Machine. With this, it is finally possible to execute any smart contract on your mobile phone or tablet, as easily, fast and securely as sending a simple transaction from your mobile wallet. With about a half of all internet traffic to major sites being generated by mobile devices, this ability is mandatory if we want to see the massive adoption of decentralized applications (DApps), smart contracts and a p2p economy. A Blockchain Powered Internet of Things A smart contract fueled Internet of Things has always been among the primary goals of the decentralization movement, and rightly so. Imagine an apartment door that unlocks automatically if and when the owner receives the due payment or a rental car that can be picked up by whoever paid the fee, without having to sign forms or leave a security in escrow. Any given device could be locked or unlocked for predetermined periods, according to a smart contract where all parties agree upon in advance. Envisioning such a decentralized sharing economy becomes much easier with Qtum’s lite wallet functionality. Instead of forcing each and every device, connected to the IoT, to act as a full node, smart devices could easily sync with the blockchain using a small amount bandwidth and storage, allowing for a much more agile and efficient network. Scalability, Speed, and Efficiency Both, ethereum and bitcoin, are based on a similar consensus scheme to ensure the coherence and security of their blockchain. Consensus in this respect means that all nodes in the network compare their results, so to speak, to make sure that only entries everybody agrees upon are recorded on the blockchain. There are several ways to reach consensus; the classic bitcoin/ethereum method is called Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining, which functions by agreeing that the most accurate chain of blocks is the one associated with the most work, or computational tasks, behind it. Mining makes attacks very costly due to arduous, and otherwise useless, computations demanded from miners participating in the block-verification game. Mining is very wasteful, in both terms of energy consumption and time. Essentially, millions of devices are performing non-functional operations for the sole purpose of rendering attacks on the network expensive. Qtum is among the first fully decentralized and Turing-complete blockchains to utilize an attractive and much more energy-efficient method to maintain coherence with a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. In a PoS environment, nodes have to pose a staking fee to participate in the validation game, which is automatically foreclosed upon if the node is shown to operate with malicious intents, hence rendering attacks costly and inefficient, without having to waste precious computational resources. Further increasing speed and efficiency, bitcoin’s UTXO transaction model, implemented on Qtum, allows the network to process several transactions in parallel and in any given order. This is in stark contrast to ethereum’s architecture, which demands all transactions to be processed one at a time, in chronological order – making it so that at any given moment all nodes connected to the ethereum network process only one single transaction, while all other transactions have to wait in line. Compatibility across the board Utilizing an enhanced EVM analog, the Qtumblockchain is compatible with existing ethereum-based smart contracts. Ethereum contracts can be ported to Qtum with little to no change to their code and execute as expected. Furthermore, Qtum implements complete backwards compatibility, meaning that once a decentralized application or contract is deployed on the Qtum network, they will stay operational, even if the system is updated. With this, Qtum solves a huge problem, very well known to ethereum developers, who very often find their applications rendered useless by recurring changes to the ethereum network. The bitcoin-based UTXO transaction model also ensures that Qtum will be mostly compatible with the existing bitcoin ecosystem, allowing Qtum users to benefit from the industry’s top-notch innovations, fueled by hundreds of millions of dollars already invested in the space. For example, if a payment gateway accepts bitcoin today, it already holds the potential to support Qtum transactions easily and link to Qtum’s API, without any significant modifications to their operation.  Bridging the Gap between Blockchains and the Business World Despite their great potential, businesses, governments, and other legacy organizations still struggle with implementing blockchain-based solutions. These groups, in large part, aren’t using blockchain smart contracts because they operate in an isolated blockchain environment. In this respect, the greatest advantage of smart contract based commerce is also its biggest impairment.  To circumvent these technical and legal hurdles, and to unleash the full potential of the blockchain, Qtum introduces the Master Contract concept. Master Contracts allow DApps and smart contracts to trigger real-world, off-chain data inputs, auditable by a verified Oracle or the contracts mediator – while the contracts essential elements, such as participants and authorization structures, are secured on the blockchain itself.  This allows blockchain-based commerce to adhere to changing commercial rules and regulations, while interfacing with real-time data inputs from stock markets, weather forecasts, news agencies, etc.. Cooperating with a series of partners and third parties, Qtum aims to establish a smart contract hub, offering secure and thoroughly tested contract templates, tailor fitted for a multitude of industries and use cases, such as supply chain management, telecommunications, IoT, social networking, and more. With this, it will be easier than ever for established sectors and legacy institutions to interface with blockchain technology and enjoy their benefits Conclusion Smart contracts and DApps hold great potential for the future of both – the emerging p2p economy and the Internet sustaining it; but for them to reach mainstream adoption, decentralized applications have to be accessible, easy to use and operational on all major platforms used by the end consumer.  With this in mind, the Qtum team is building on well-established technologies like the bitcoin network, as well as on state of the art innovations, to produce a blockchain compatible with the major existing ecosystems, as well as cutting-edge capabilities these are lacking. Join us for a Qtum leap towards the future of mobile smart contracts and the mainstream adoption of decentralized applications.",False

Recently, we have begun work on a new website.  That should be ready in about 3 weeks, until then, we will continue to use the current one (https://qtum.org).  The section where we list our Angel Backers has been updated, we will reveal more names shortly once we have approval.  We plan to discuss with our Angels why they decided to support our project, and what they expect from our team in the future.         The Qtum Crowd Sale will start on March 1st.  We currently have enough funds to last until the sale ends on April 1st.  The Crowd Sale will be hosted by major Chinese exchanges, which will be announced in February.  There will also be a direct sale that is done on our website.  The concrete information about the Crowd Sale will be announced in our business whitepaper prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers.  The technical whitepaper will come out mid-February.  The draft section that we released a few weeks back was from the last revision of the whitepaper, so that portion will be completely redone for the new version.  On the Press front, we have done a decent job gaining  traction with Blockchain industry sites.  Our focus right now is engaging with the mainstream press.  A large part of this project involves preparing a Blockchain project for real world business applications.  We already have a signed partnership agreement with a company valued at 100 million dollars USD, which we will discuss later.  We are currently in discussions with more companies, who are excited about our “Go Mobile” strategy.  This was actually the portion of our project that convinced a billionaire to back Qtum.  Our development team is currently merging the Proof-of-Stake protocol into Bitcoin Core v0.13, along with some testing of the Account Abstract layer we implemented to allow the EVM to run on a UTXO model.

Qtum Development Updates 2  The Qtum development team has been very busy since our last technical update. There are several different facets which are being worked on now.  Qtum Core Although we have functioning smart contracts and a functioning fork of Bitcoin 0.13 using PoSv3, these are, so far, still on separate branches. The primary focus over the past two weeks has been testing and fixing bugs between these two versions. However, our new priority since both are mostly stable is to merge them together into one cohesive blockchain.  Most bug fixing over the past week or two has taken place in the Qtum Account Abstraction Layer. The AAL is arguably one of the most complicated parts of Qtum and thus getting it correct and secure is of utmost importance.  Here is some recent passing test contracts we have run though:  ## In range block hash ##  pragma solidity ^0.4.7;  contract BlockHash { bytes32 public blockHash;  function storeBlockHash(uint blockNumber) { blockHash = block.blockhash(blockNumber); } }  1. Create a contract called BlockHash 2. Set i = 1 3. Call function “storeBlockHash” of BlockHash with an argument i.  Expected behaviour: state variable blockHash now is equal to the block hash at block number i  Result: Pass  ## Out of range block hash (> current block number) ##  pragma solidity ^0.4.7;  contract BlockHash { bytes32 public blockHash;  function storeBlockHash(uint blockNumber) { blockHash = block.blockhash(blockNumber); } }  1. Create a contract called BlockHash 3. Call function “storeBlockHash” of BlockHash with an argument 2^16 (out of range).  Expected behaviour: state variable blockHash now empty  Result: Pass  ## Out of range block number (block number < current block number – 256) ##  pragma solidity ^0.4.7;  contract BlockHash { bytes32 public blockHash;  function storeBlockHash(uint blockNumber) { blockHash = block.blockhash(blockNumber); } }  1. Create a contract called BlockHash 3. Call function “storeBlockHash” of BlockHash with an argument current block count – 257 (out of range).  Expected behaviour: state variable blockHash now empty  Result: Pass  ## Check that the gas and gas price are equivalent to their input from cli (1000000 gas, 0.00000001 gas price) ##  contract CheckGas { uint public gasAmount; uint public gasPrice  function storeGlobals() { this.gasAmount = msg.gas this.gasPrice = tx.gasprice; } }  1. Create a contract called CheckGas 2. Call function “storeGas” of CheckGas with 1000000 gas with a gas price of 0.00000001.  Expected behavior: state variable gasPrice is 1 state variable gasAmount is close to 1000000  Result: Pass  Also, here is a preview of the Qtum Core git repository, showing the team working on bug fixes:  Qtum Core Git Repository  Qtum Core Wallet (QT wallet) In addition to focusing on the core blockchain protocol, we are starting to work toward branding and reworking the Qtum Core Wallet for PC and Mac. We have a splash screen, basic color changes, and icons. We are still deep in work on this, so there aren’t yet any screenshots available. Additionally, we will soon begin integrating smart contracts into the GUI so that regular users will be able to deploy and interact with smart contracts.  Future Directions We are constantly looking to implement not just what designs we have now, but also ensure that those designs will be extensible and work well as a foundation to build on for our future activities. These are in-flux designs, but some ideas currently being discussed include: better and faster interactions with smart contracts from SPV wallets, making data feeds a “first-class citizen” on the blockchain with efficiency and usability improvements, Automatic/periodic contract execution, simplification of the account abstraction layer (in order to increase efficiency and reduce attack vectors), enhancing side-chain support with smart contracts on both chains in mind.  Qtum Mobile Wallets Qtum will also feature both iOS and Android wallet at release. The majority of our efforts are currently being expended is testing to ensure that they handle PoSv3 fine, and branding and skinning the wallets so that they look professional and are easy to use.

Maybe I should have also used the right wording in saying that Vitalik is invested in QTUM. But his friend and fellow general partner at Fenbushi Capital is invested in it. Maybe Vitalik does not want to be directly connected publicly with the platform but it is very possible for him to be invested in it no matter how he denies it.

Qtum is clearly better than Iconomi, Chronobank and other similar ICO's. Qtum's competition will be against Ethereum. Qtum is offering similar smart contract system but with better ideas. We don't hassle with POW, we go directly with POS.  Here is the important bit of my research. Vitalik is invested in QTUM. We all know that Ethereum is not going to switch to POS ever. QTUM has made their platform compatible with Ethereum's present smart contracts and dapps. So I speculate that a great migration to QTUM will occur simply because it might be more stable, faster and more scalable. The migration will include Vitalik. He will leave Ethereum and declare it a community project.  hmm, i don't know if it is as good a news as you think. and you forgot to give us a resource for this news. besides Vitalik is not going to give up his own altcoin and come invest in something he can not control. ethereum is mostly in his possession and he is making a lot of money from it. so i doubt if he really is planning on leaving anything.  They always do. When a platform has nowhere to go they will leave. Ethereum has already shown to be technically incapable of scaling and their plan to become a POS platform is very doubtful to happen.  He makes a lot of money from ETH only if he moves them to BTC and I speculate he will move some of his personal stake to QTUM.",False

Recently, we have begun work on a new website.  That should be ready in about 3 weeks, until then, we will continue to use the current one (https://qtum.org).  The section where we list our Angel Backers has been updated, we will reveal more names shortly once we have approval.  We plan to discuss with our Angels why they decided to support our project, and what they expect from our team in the future.         The Qtum Crowd Sale will start on March 1st.  We currently have enough funds to last until the sale ends on April 1st.  The Crowd Sale will be hosted by major Chinese exchanges, which will be announced in February.  There will also be a direct sale that is done on our website.  The concrete information about the Crowd Sale will be announced in our business whitepaper prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers.  The technical whitepaper will come out mid-February.  The draft section that we released a few weeks back was from the last revision of the whitepaper, so that portion will be completely redone for the new version.  On the Press front, we have done a decent job gaining  traction with Blockchain industry sites.  Our focus right now is engaging with the mainstream press.  A large part of this project involves preparing a Blockchain project for real world business applications.  We already have a signed partnership agreement with a company valued at 100 million dollars USD, which we will discuss later.  We are currently in discussions with more companies, who are excited about our “Go Mobile” strategy.  This was actually the portion of our project that convinced a billionaire to back Qtum.  Our development team is currently merging the Proof-of-Stake protocol into Bitcoin Core v0.13, along with some testing of the Account Abstract layer we implemented to allow the EVM to run on a UTXO model.  The screenshot earlier of the mobile wallet is what you can expect to see once we have a working testnet.  Jordan Earls can give a better update on this later, and it’s best to ask him questions directly if you want more details.

Recently, we have begun work on a new website.  That should be ready in about 3 weeks, until then, we will continue to use the current one (https://qtum.org).  The section where we list our Angel Backers has been updated, we will reveal more names shortly once we have approval.  We plan to discuss with our Angels why they decided to support our project, and what they expect from our team in the future.         The Qtum Crowd Sale will start on March 1st.  We currently have enough funds to last until the sale ends on April 1st.  The Crowd Sale will be hosted by major Chinese exchanges, which will be announced in February.  There will also be a direct sale that is done on our website.  The concrete information about the Crowd Sale will be announced in our business whitepaper prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers.  The technical whitepaper will come out mid-February.  The draft section that we released a few weeks back was from the last revision of the whitepaper, so that portion will be completely redone for the new version.  On the Press front, we have done a decent job gaining  traction with Blockchain industry sites.  Our focus right now is engaging with the mainstream press.  A large part of this project involves preparing a Blockchain project for real world business applications.  We already have a signed partnership agreement with a company valued at 100 million dollars USD, which we will discuss later.  We are currently in discussions with more companies, who are excited about our “Go Mobile” strategy.  This was actually the portion of our project that convinced a billionaire to back Qtum.  Our development team is currently merging the Proof-of-Stake protocol into Bitcoin Core v0.13, along with some testing of the Account Abstract layer we implemented to allow the EVM to run on a UTXO model.  The screenshot earlier of the mobile wallet is what you can expect to see once we have a working testnet.

Ethereum has an account-based model. So, when you receive and send funds, you have an account with your balance, and you add or subtract from that balance depending on if you're sending of receiving money. Bitcoin on the other hand uses the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model. In Bitcoin you don't receive and send funds directly to an ""account"". Instead, an account does not really exist on the blockchain and instead you have unspent transaction outputs. Imagine it like a check from the bank. You have a check for $50 and you want to send $20 to someone. So, you would go to the bank, give them the $50 check, and then get a $30 check written out to yourself and a $20 check written to the person you want to send to. This is pretty much exactly how Bitcoin works and your ""account"" or wallet balance is rather the sum of how many outputs (checks) you own and can spend.  This is a big deal for a number of reasons.  1. The UTXO model is what Bitcoin uses, and thus Qtum will be compatible with existing processes and technology built for Bitcoin. This means companies that already use Bitcoin should have no problems or massive process changes to adopt Qtum, unlike Ethereum. 2. The UTXO model has the tried and proven SPV protocol for decentralized mobile and light wallets. There is currently no protocol for decentralized mobile and light wallets in Ethereum 3. The UTXO model has so far been proven to be more scalable for the long term, with it's ability to process transactions in parallel and easy method of trimming spent transactions from client node's copy of the blockchain  I'm sure there's more reasons, but the big thing that important right now about Qtum is that it will unify the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities and technology. Ethereum developers will easily be able to port their code to Qtum and gain all of the advantages of Qtum, while Bitcoin developers will easily be able to switch to Qtum while using familiar technology and begin writing powerful smart contracts on this platform.",False

According to the whitepaper, The Quantum Blockchain or ‘Qtum’ is a combination of Bitcoin Core, Proof-of-Stake, and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The end product, Qtum Core, will allow smart contracts to execute on a Proof-of-Stake consensus model. This ecosystem was designed to provide a familiar environment for Smart Contract and Decentralized Application developers.  The project has received support from a number of notable entrepreneurs in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space including ethereum founder Anthony Di Iorio, OKCoin CEO Star Xu, BitFund founder Xiaolai Li and Fenbushi partner Bo Shen.  Patrick Dai, founder of the Qtum Foundation, told CoinDesk that the amount raised will help the team to prepare the infrastructure required to sell the tokens in a public initial coin offering (ICO), or a public sale of unique cryptographic tokens to investors.  ""We raised the money to prove that our approach is right. We used the money to do the minimum viable product. The testnet is live now, but it is private, it is already working”, he said, adding that the Qtum Foundation could seek to raise up to $10m in the token offering.  The project kicked off in March 2016 as a proof-of-concept, and so far it has completed the design of the Qtum model – the world’s first digital currency that can execute smart contracts with a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism based on an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model, as reported by Bitcoin Magazine.  Earlier this month, Qtum said that the team is currently working to make new wallets for desktop and mobile Qtum users. In addition, it is also working to merge the EVM and PoS branches of Qtum. It further added:  “We are extensively testing the Qtum implementation. In addition to Bitcoin and EVM automated tests, we are writing a Qtum specific test suite. Other than automated testing, manual testing is currently taking place as well. After in-house testing, we will request external code reviews and tests from independent software developers and companies.”  Qtum said that after the initial Qtum prototype passes testing procedures, it will be time to launch the Qtum testnet, which has been codenamed ‘Sparknet’. This would mark the final real world test before the official release.""",False

Basically it is just another bitcoin fork with extension to the bitcoin scripting language to support solidity contracts?   A) First of all, Qtum is far from being “just another bitcoin fork”. We have a vision for the Qtum project and one of the biggest and most professional teams ever seen in crypto with support from real world companies and investors. Our goals for Qtum go far beyond the crypto scene and it will be a top project, not just another fork. Our choice of bitcoin core as a main base for Qtum is based on the fact that bitcoin is the most mature, stable and secure blockchain available, in comparison to ethereum or bitshares or others which are still considered unstable with the numerous problems and security issues they had since they launched. In addition to bitcoin having the biggest support from the community which offers a large collection of tools and software related to bitcoin which can be used by quantum as well, in contrast to the other blockchains which sometimes lack even the simplest software (mobile wallets, stable desktop wallets …). Also we use bitcoin script as a bridge between the EVM and regular transaction, the Qtum model was very well designed, and is much more complicated than you make it sound.    Q) There is no compelling reason to choose  UTXO over smart contract via balance. It is like comparing a general journal vs a general ledger, which is better? The answer is it depends. I guess it is only UTXO because it is using a bitcoin fork and calling it UTXO as a feature is just a gimmick. In fact i suspect scalability becomes bigger problem since you need to maintain SPV to manage UTXO for multiple different states? Will be interesting to see how to implement wallets.  Does that make hyperledger better since they supports both utxo and balance?   A) Our choice of UTXO is simply choosing the best technology, there have been some efforts made through some articles to make the account model seem as performant and secure as the UTXO model, however, it’s not. Without going into much details, the account model is too naïve and simplistic and offers no parallelism, it always reminds me of the cup telephone transaction model.   For us, a hybrid model as the one used by Hyperledger was the wrong choice since it will cause us to be incompatible with neither bitcoin nor ethereum. In Qtum we have a priority to keep full compatibility with bitcoin which will allow us to implement future bitcoin BIPs to Qtum thus taking advantage of the developments done by the bitcoin core team and community. For more details,pls refer below：  1) If we wanted just a simple smart contract platform to build on top of, it would've been significantly easier for us to just fork Ethereum.  2) The UTXO allows for the SPV protocol to work. Ethereum currently does not have anything like SPV. There's no way to run a simple wallet on Ethereum without downloading the entire blockchain, or trusting a centralized 3rd party.  3) The UTXO model is overall much more simple, and because it's been used by Bitcoin, it has been thoroughly tested and proven to be secure. Although Ethereum's account model is conceptually easy to understand, it requires more complexities and edge cases in order to secure it from replay and double spend attacks.  4) Scalibility should not be a problem for Qtum. Although contracts can create state changes etc, these state changes are not directly stored on the blockchain. Rather, state is considered the accumulation of all actions and differences created by executing each smart contract. This could admittingly make syncing the blockchain slower (because block processing will be slower than Bitcoin), but the other benefits provided are worth this performance hit. Furthermore, the only additional thing stored in the UTXO set right now is contract code, and contract-owned outputs (though their data becomes unimportant after the output is initially processed). There may be plans proposed later which prune the UTXO set's stored data as well, to reduce the UTXO set size further.  5) SPV will work almost identically to how SPV wallets work today. For a quick summary, a light wallet downloads block headers, and then sends P2P nodes requests (using bloom filters) to get all transactions for each block matching the keys that this wallet own. Because the contract system creates normal transactions, this already works. IF you a contract sends funds to a SPV wallet, the SPV wallet will see these funds and can spend them, today. Our next step with SPV wallets would be to implement a workflow so that people can send money to a contract, while also picking which function and what data to send. We do not need to extend the SPV model to work for Qtum, it already works because of our focus on compatibility.  6) Regarding Hyperledger. I'm no expert on it, so I could be wrong. But I think that their support could end up being worst of both worlds. Now, anything wanting to interact with Hyperledger must be capable of dealing with the quirks of both models. From my understanding also, they only support either UTXO or Accounts on one ledger at a time also (though there is much functionality for messaging and sending things between these ledgers). So I do not think it makes Hyperledger's model better, but rather more complex. Perhaps this complexity provides more power to Hyperledger's model, but it also introduces more security concerns and increases the implementation cost of Hyperledger itself, and any application that uses it (due to to having to deal with both models)    Q) It extended bitcoin script to accept  solidity string but another company called CounterParty have already done it on the Bitcoin public blockchain without having to use a new public blockchain. So where is the need? Furthermore, will qtum have to constantly keep in sync with ""solc"" the solidity compiler to maintain compatibility?  A) Qtum is very different from XCP, XCP uses bitcoin blockchain to store data, and the user have to run XCP software on top of that. Some major drawbacks are the cost of XCP transactions which increased so much that it threatens the whole project now and the complexity to build external software on top of XCP. Qtum aims to offer an all-in-one solution, not based on any external possible points of failure.  For solc support, we made Qtum with that in mind, Qtum uses the exact same ethereum VM, so it will run any solidity compiled code, in the case of EVM updates, and we will be easily able to update it in Qtum as well.    Q) Qtum is a new altcoin platform but there are enough ethereum, ripple and bitcoin out there. Why another one? It is not a bridge as I was led to understand. It is another bitcoin fork.   A) In addition to my previous reply about Qtum not being “just another bitcoin fork”, I would like to add that quantum is not the average altcoin, it will be one of the best, if not “the best” we have all the means for that, and we will do it.  You say it is not a bridge, but really it is. It is bridging the technology. We are taking what makes Bitcoin great, and what makes Ethereum great, and bringing them together as one. We expect to bridge not the actual monetary value (ie, the market cap) held in each coin, but rather the communities and separate interest. Right now there is a real divide between serious Ethereum users and developers, and Bitcoin users and developers. By aiming to be compatible with the technology involved with both, we hope to merge these communities and be an answer both for 1) Those who want Ethereum smart contracts, but are uncomfortable with the stability of the Ethereum account model and lack of protocol support such as SPV; and 2) Those who like Bitcoin, but are unhappy with it's limitations for implementing smart contracts and more powerful types of transactions. We as a team are also tired of these copy-paste coins that people constantly make to try to get a quick buck, and we would not have chosen to make this it's own altcoin if we had not weighed the cost and benefits very carefully.    Q) What is the block confirmation time? Bitcoin is 10minutes and Ethereum is 18seconds?   A)  Ethereum blocktime of 18 seconds is a bit exaggerated and causes a lot of empty blocks and uncles thus bloating the blockchain with useless data (which resulted in the currently atrophied ethereum blockchain), and bitcoin block time of 10 minutes is a bit too long for a smart contracts platform. We aim to have a block time of 1 to 3 minutes for Qtum.     Q) I did not go too deep into the details of the POS but the protocol is similar to Peercoin's DPOS and it maybe susceptible to coin age accumulation attack if the intention is to incentive to miners that leave their stake longer on the chain. In fact it should be the opposite to prevent long range attack, Bitfury and Vitalik has written good articles on the types of attacks it is susceptible to.   A) Qtum uses BC PoS v3.0 which has removed all major attack vectors, including coin age accumulation. In conclusion, Qtum will be the first standalone UTXO and PoS based smart contracts platform thus making use of the best available technologies to deliver an outstanding blockchain solution.   -----END-----",False

Qtum is designed to be secure, stable, and fast. Quantum has expanded the scripting language of Bitcoin Core, so that it will now be possible to run Smart Contracts based on the Unspent Transaction Output model (UTXO).  This means Qtum will not require the use of accounts to execute contracts between interested parties. Existing Ethereum Smart Contracts can be ported to Qtum with minimal changes. Other virtual machines and programming languages will be supported as the project matures. There will be functionality for third party data feeds and oracles, along with ‘off chain’ data processing. Qtum’s consensus model will utilize Sunny King’s classic Proof-of-Stake, which will secure the Blockchain, while rewarding coin holders.  Qtum aims to bring a new ‘Value Transfer Protocol’ to the industry. Bitcoin has done a tremendous service to the commerce and finance industry by providing a means of value transfer, and we would like to expand on this momentum. We plan to support the Qtum Blockchain with Smart Contracts that allow users to control coins by taking advantage of various Internet Protocols. One project that will be released as a working beta is SpringEmail, which uses a modified Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).  This allows users to send and receive Qtum as part of an e-mail.  We call this hybrid protocol “BiSMTP”.  This should lessen the learning curve for users interested in Qtum but do not have a wallet.

Let me get the media articles for you:  Quote from Bitcoinmagazine.com:  ""Qtum, a forthcoming digital currency and open source community project, announced this week that it had passed $1 million in backing from top industry executives. Some of the project’s high-profile supporters include co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Jaxx Blockchain Interface, Anthony Di Iorio; co-founder of Augur and EIR at Blockchain Capital, Jeremy Gardner; OkCoin CEO, Star Xu; blockchain technology advocate Bo Shen; billionaire Kuaidi Dache founder, Chen Weixing; and Chinese angel investor Xiaolai Li, among others.""  I think we have to be the first blockchain project with a billionaire investor, I believe he invented an 'uber' in China.  There are some other investors involved, everyone knows them in crypto, we just haven't asked if we can namedrop them.

I'd like to give a brief summary of this section that was revealed, so that you don't have to read through the whole thing to figure out what we're doing. It is indeed a very rough draft also.   Basically, we're taking Bitcoin Core 0.13, integrating the Ethereum Virtual Machine, and adding an ""Account Abstraction Layer"" so that existing Etheruem contracts will work on Qtum with minimal changes. The exact way we are integrating the EVM is by adding new Bitcoin Script opcodes, and adding special processing conditions so that when these EVM using transactions are added to the blockchain they are executed immediately (rather than only when attempting to be spent, as is normal).  Along with this, the account abstraction layer allows for contracts to only worry about balances and sending funds. This is a bit more complicated to explain without going into a lot of technical detail, but I'll try. Normally in UTXO based coins (such as Bitcoin of course), you can't just say ""I want to send 20 coins to X"", you say ""I want to send this 10 coin output, and this 5 coin output, and this 8 coin output to X, and also send 3 coins back to Y, which is my wallet."" This is called coin-picking, and is one of the reasons that smart contract implementations on top of Bitcoin have been so difficult up to this point. A coin output must be either spent completely or not spent at all. What we've done with this account abstraction layer is make it so that smart contracts on the blockchain have something similar to a wallet. When a user (or other contract) sends coins to a contract, the code will create a standard ""funding transaction"", which is spendable only by the appropriate smart contract. It would be a great burden for smart contracts to have to pick their own coins (ie, having to write your own algorithm in Solidity), so we have added a consensus-critical coin picking algorithm which all contracts must use. So, for a contract to ""send 5 coins to X"", the miner will pick contract-owned coins (using the consensus-critical coin picking algorithm), and when it has enough inputs for the value to send, it will then construct the outputs of the transaction. In this case it would be ""5 coins to X, remaining coins to sending smart contract (change output)"". This transaction is then added to the current block. It's important to note that these transactions are not broadcast on the P2P network, they are only added by miners (and it is consensus-critical that they add them if they put the contract transaction in the block)  I'm sure that explanation wasn't 100% clear, but the TL;DR; of it is that we integrated the EVM onto a UTXO based blockchain, and writing contracts for this should be just as easy as Ethereum, but you get the benefits of the UTXO model. These benefits include mobile/light wallet support by SPV, a more stable model (whereas Ethereum has forked many times to fix problems with this), and compatibility with existing Bitcoin tools and protocols.",False

Many people may be wondering: ""What is Qtum?"" and we would like to spend some time going over a few things.  We plan to release the Whitepaper in early January.  This announcement thread was launched during the holiday season, and we wanted to just get some translations in place and answer a few questions.  Now that it's 2017, we plan to hit the deck hard and really get things going.  Our lead developer spent a few minutes writing a technical summary of where we stand in the development cycle, so this will be the first update of 2017.    Quantum Development Status (by Qtum lead developer Neil)  Major completed milestones:  1- Quantum model:   The first challenge for us was to make a model for Quantum that integrates both the EVM and Bitcoin UTXO model. The EVM natively uses a state database, so we had to extend its capabilities to work with a UTXO based accounting model.   While we decided to keep a state database for storing smart contracts code and data, our model uses UTXOs for all financial operations of the EVM.   After finishing the model, we moved to the implementation.   2- Quantum Implementation:  The implementation was based on Bitcoin core 0.13 and cpp-ethereum EVM part. After integrating the EVM code and dependencies with Bitcoin core, we worked on implementing the Quantum model which required adding support for Quantum smart contracts creation, funding and calling through Bitcoin script, and also adding UTXO support to the EVM. Other implementation details were also finished, including the Quantum gas model, EVM coin picking algorithm and much more.  We now have a fully working implementation of the Quantum model which is being currently tested.  3- Bitcoin core proof of stake:  The proof of stake (PoS 3.0) algorithm was ported from Blackcoin to Bitcoin core 0.13 and is now in final stage testing with dozens of nodes deployed.  What’s next?  1- Quantum wallets:  Work is in progress to make brand new desktop and mobile wallets for Quantum, for the desktop wallet, we are working on a dynamic and user friendly wallet which will include in addition to the classic functionalities, support for smart contract operations and a new innovative design.  Our Mobile wallet is also in the works, with versions for iOS and Android, the initial mobile versions are already in testing.  2- Merging with proof of stake:  We are currently working on merging EVM and PoS branches of Quantum.  3- Testing Quantum:   We are currently testing the Quantum implementation. In addition to Bitcoin and EVM automated tests, we are writing our Quantum specific test suite.   Other than automated testing, manual testing is currently taking place as well.   After finishing in-house testing, we will require external code reviews and testing from independent and professional renowned software developers and companies.   4- Releasing Quantum Sparknet (testnet):   Once our initial Quantum prototype has passed internal and external testing procedures, it will be time to launch the Quantum testnet code named ""Sparknet"". which will be the final real world test before the official release.  Happy new year ! From Qtum Foundation""",False

Come Speak With the Team Directly:  https://discord.gg/zyVMQSv  The Blockchain Made Ready for Business   Build Decentralized Applications that Simply Work Executable on mobile devices, compatible with major existing blockchain ecosystems  MAINNET NOW LIVE!   ABOUT  The Qtum Foundation is a Singapore based entity that promotes adoption of the Qtum Blockchain. Project inception began in March 2016, leading up to a successful crowdsale a year later. Over 10,000 BTC and 72,000 ETH were raised in less than 5 days, making Qtum one of the largest crowdfunded projects in history, at $15.6 million dollars.  Qtum is an open source Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain application platform. Qtum’s core technology combines a fork of Bitcoin Core, an Account Abstraction Layer allowing for multiple Virtual Machines including the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Proof-of-Stake consensus aimed at tackling industry use cases.  We believe this will allow Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications (DApps) to run on a familiar foundation, while offering a robust environment for developers. The underlying technology uses an “Account Abstraction Layer”, which acts as a bridge between the EVM and the Unspent Transaction Output model of Bitcoin Core. Building on Bitcoin’s reliable and proven-to-deliver blockchain, Qtum stacks its Account Abstraction Layer, allowing the Bitcoin Core 0.13 blockchain to seamlessly interact with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). With this innovation it is now possible to execute smart contracts and run DApps, simply and securely, in environments that were previously out of reach for Ethereum, combining the endless possibilities provided by smart contracts with the stability and maturity of the bitcoin ecosystem. There will also be Oracles and Datafeed functionality, allowing developers to create Smart Contracts built around trusted sources of information.  The Qtum Foundation plans to be the public blockchain for business. Development efforts will allow us to market this platform to various industries, such as: Mobile Telecommunications, Counterfeit Protection, Finance, Industrial Logistics (shipping, warranty, etc), and Manufacturing.      Build decentralized applications you can trust  Combining a modified Bitcoin Core infrastructure with an intercompatible version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Qtum merges the reliability of Bitcoin’s unfailing blockchain with the endless possibilities provided by smart contracts.  Designed with stability, modularity and interoperability in mind, Qtum is the foremost toolkit for building trusted decentralized applications, suited for real-world, business oriented use cases. Its hybrid nature, in combination with a first-of-its-kind PoS consensus protocol, allow Qtum applications to be compatible with major blockchain ecosystems, while providing native support for mobile devices and IoT appliances.      Smart Contracts that Mean Business  Qtum makes it easier than ever for established sectors and legacy institutions to interface with blockchain technology. Create your own tokens, automate supply chain management and engage in self-executing agreements in a standardized environment, verified and tested for stability.  Smart Contract Lifecycle Managment  Qtum, in cooperation with its academic partners, develops tools and methods to standardize the workflow for business smart contract development. This includes the formally verifiable translation of human-readable agreements to machine smart contracts, and the error-resilient specification of their elements, terms and conditions.  Setting Industry Standards  Cooperating with a series of partners and third parties, Qtum aims to establish a smart contract hub, offering secure and thoroughly tested contract templates, tailor fitted for a multitude of industries and use cases, such as supply chain management, telecommunications, IoT, social networking, and many more.    Go Mobile  Building on Bitcoin’s UTXO model, the simple payment verification (SPV) protocol is supported by the Qtum codebase by default. As a result, it is now possible to execute smart contracts from lite wallets, which can be easily installed on any given mobile device, heralding an age of mobile decentralized applications.  With this, the blockchain is finally ready to take up disruption in a world in which half of all internet traffic is being generated by smartphones and tablets.    Account Abstraction Layer  Qtum extends Bitcoins 'Script' language so that it functions as a vehicle to transport code to Qtum’s version of the EVM. With this, it is now possible to execute smart contracts and run decentralized applications, simply and securely, in environments that were previously out of reach for turing-complete blockchains, combining the endless possibilities provided by smart contracts with the stability and maturity of the bitcoin ecosystem.

Cross Platform and Backward Compatibility  Qtum is compatible with existing Ethereum contracts as well as Bitcoin gateways, and will maintain backward-compatibility even if the system is updated.   Specification  Total QTUM Supply: 100,000,000 Block Target: 128 seconds Stake Return: ~4 QTUM Algorithm: SHA256   Additional Features    Whitepapers  (Click pics to Download)      CROWDSALE  The Token  QTUMs are cryptographic software tokens used to engage with distributed applications (DApps) and smart contracts on the Qtum platform. QTUMs will serve as the staking currency of the Qtum blockchain and fuel computational operations performed by the Qtum network.  QTUM supply and Initial Distribution  With the setting of Qtum’s Genesis Block, one hundred million (100,000,000) QTUMs will be created as Qtum’s total token supply, on top of which ~1% annual Proof of Stake (PoS) inflation will be added.  The QTUM token supply will be allocated as follows:  51% of Qtum tokens (51,000,000) will be distributed through the crowdsale 20% of Qtum tokens (20,000,000 QTUM) will be distributed among founders, early backers and the development team 29% of Qtum tokens (29,000,000 QTUM) will be allocated to community initiatives concerning business development, as well as academic research, education, and market expansion  For a more detailed overview of QTUM token allocation visit our website: https://qtum.org/en/crowdsale#question-2   Exchanges Bittrex: https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-qtum Yunbi: https://yunbi.com/markets/qtumcny YuanBao: https://www.yuanbao.com/trade/qtum2cny BTER: https://bter.com/trade/qtum_cny           https://bter.com/trade/qtum_btc Allcoin: https://allcoin.com/markets/QTUM-BTC/0/ [/size=12pt]https://coinone.co.kr/exchange/trade/qtum/[/size] BTC9: https://btc9.com/trade/22     The Qtum Foundation: Governance Structure  The development and maintenance of the Qtum Blockchain, as well as all services provided by Qtum, are directed and supervised by the Qtum Foundation - a non-profit organization, representing Qtum’s stake and token holders as elaborated below.  In order to avoid the inefficient conduct, open source and blockchain projects often suffer from, and to ensure a coherent and standardized implementation of the Qtum blockchain, the Qtum Foundation was established under the guidance and support of PwC. The Foundation will oversee the development of the Qtum Blockchain, advocate governance transparency, and promote the safety and harmony of the open source ecosystem.      The design of the Foundation’s governance structure mainly considers sustainability, management effectiveness, and fund-raising security in the open source community. The Foundation consists of various committees, such as Executive Judgment, Code Review, Finance & HR, as well as Marketing & PR. The different committees work in cooperation to manage Qtum’s daily operations and special occasions with detailed operational procedures and rules.  Learn more here: https://qtum.org/en//the-qtum-foundation-governance-structure    Decentralized Governance Protocol  The Decentralized Governance Protocol (DGP) is designed so that individual blockchain parameters can be modified through a specially designed smart contract on the blockchain. Most importantly, this technology allows these blockchain parameters to be changed without any disruption to the ecosystem. After a setting change, no new software must be downloaded by users, and no intervention is needed from stakers and node operators.  The way the DGP works is relatively straightforward. First, a governing party for the DGP makes a proposal to change a parameter. Afterward, all the governing parties for the DGP can vote on the proposal, and if it receives enough approval votes, then the parameter change proposal becomes active. The proposal data is then placed in a standardized format and a particular storage space so that the blockchain software can easily access it without needing to execute the DGP contract directly.  Learn more here: https://qtum.org/en/blog/qtum-s-decentralized-governance-protocol      The Qtum Foundation will list the total assets that it holds including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Legal Tender, and QTUM Tokens.  The Foundation will also seek complementary services to aid our efforts in transparency and professionalism with a professional auditing firm, legal team and a professional digital asset management solution. We hope this will help promote the healthy development of the Qtum Project and serve as a model for other projects.  The content that will be made public to the community on the Qtum website:  The Qtum Foundation obtained digital and traditional assets, which include: bitcoin, ether, and other digital assets such as Qtum tokens, as well as, legal tender in the form of USD and RMB Qtum will release monthly spending reports, including employee compensation, operating costs, marketing costs and other expenses  Learn more here: https://qtum.org/en/blog/qtum-foundation-financial-reports-governance-plan   TEAM  Qtum is a global project that aims to be the bridge between the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities, the real world and blockchain world. Therefore it only makes sense that the Qtum team comes from both the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities as well traditional companies like Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, NASDAQ and more.  The Qtum Project is proud to be backed by some of the most notable blockchain players, traditional Venture Capitalists, and executives from some of China’s largest technology companies.
