They constantly said their token would be listed ""soon"" and already during their ICO they hyped it with saying they would have an agreement with a Top-5-exchange:  savedroid ICO: SVD Token will be traded on top 5 exchange https://medium.com/@ico_8796/savedroid-ico-svd-token-will-be-traded-on-top-5-exchange-f45a453ca3ef  Later/Reality: Listing was delayed for months, including a voting without any transparency and meaning in between, and the Top-5-exchange never came.

Exactly that will happen and you‚Äôll see: In a few weeks the public will just not care much about this project anymore. You already can see that dynamic. The media has thrown this project into the scam-or-dumb-section and that is what you asked for. Some will probably make some fun about you like I do, but attention will continue to decrease significantly - and with that a lot of potential. What will be left? My guess is: Damage to your Investors - that‚Äôs it.  To the rest of the team: I would make a bet that not all of you disagree with what I try to explain here, even if I do it in an insulting way to the company that pays your checks.

True value is all about context and this is still an App and the token is not really necessary. But much more important: Savedroid needs licenses and Users of course. Both is hard to achieve with a history like they have. They often refer to criticism as FUD but their own projects and Investors suffer because they've started a huge FUD-campaign (Scam-PR-Stunt) first to break promises right after (Top5-exchange etc.).  Then there are other aspects:  1) If the idea/usecase of saving money into Crypto with a gamification approach (whenever trump tweets....) would have so much potential, guess who could develop something like that easily and probably much better besides an already running business: Exchanges. Simply because they already have the infrastructure in place.  2) It's already not that easy to trust a company that it securely manages Customer-funds without being hacked on day. I personally never leave anything for a longer time on exchanges for example. But if I would have to make a choice if I trust Binance or Bittrex or Coinbase - or Savedroid... I would never trust Savedroid to have high competence when it's about security.  3) When it's about the market situation: There are thousands of projects out there. Many are bad or even Scams but also many are quiet good, with skilled and professional teams. Many of the good ones are not able yet to make it on one of the top exchanges. But who will be picked first when it's about better listings? Projects with a clean history or Savedroid with it's Scam-Brand?   To make it short: This is not undervalued but in my opinion it's the opposite. Not only because of the Image but also because of it's fundamentals.   And just btw: There are so many really good projects out there that have done a much smaller ICO. The big winner of the past days on IDEX for example is Quant - a team of high level Cryptosecurity experts who have worked for governments and in Finance. They're building really unique Blockchain-infrastructure. They have raised about $11M. Coinlion - they are building a whole exchange and have raised about $7 M if I recall it correctly. Senno: Also an AI-project about sentiment analysis. They've raise only about $3M and even dropped in price after the ICO.   Savedroid raised about $50M for an App-project. That's ridiculous... What I don't get if I think about this and exclude the PR-Stunt and all the controversy is simply:  Why has nobody ever questioned how much the company is worth and why the token-economy should be valued much higher than the whole company? I don't know how much Savedroid as company is worth but I would think that it's not $10 M, maybe not even $5 M. They have not been successful before raising tons of money in Crypto but the opposite. So why would the total supply of the token be worth more?",False

Winners ranked 1-10 get svd token with a total of 288k tokens every day and that means the svd shares total of 5,760,000 free tokens. And what happens at Cobinhood the traders sell and buy at the same price as the number of trading volumes up to billions of tokens every day, and there are no fees so they can do that without experiencing any losses at all and with one goal to be a winner in that competition. I knew that because I was one of those who took part in the competition ... and became winner eventhough I was never able to reach ranks 1 through 3.  In my opinion trading competition using cobinhood that has no fee is to raise the volume of trade every day was good idea, because if you use hitbtc, the trading volume will not match the volume that has occurred in cobinhood, but it seems that there has been a strategic error that the SVD team might expect because trading volume in cobinhood has never been recorded in cmc, and that does not raise the ranking or prestige of savedroid",False

That seems to be it - just compared the competition-announcement with the volume and it perfectly fits.  But anyway, my point was not that much about how exactly the volume was generated, if by wash-trading-bots or whatever, but that it wasn't natural daily volume as a result of real interest.  If we look at the SVD-markets there are several problems in my opinion:  1) Volume is low obivously 2) Price is about 94% below ICO-price or with other words: It would need x16 just to reach ICO-level again 3) I don't believe that Savedroid will get to that level out of own strength again  What would most likely help the price? A bull run like 2017. And I'm very optimistic that we'll see something like that again, but I doubt it will be in the next months.  Out of perspective of those who are invested (I'm not) and when a price has gone down hard, there are usually two ways while second often follows first:  1) First People often refuse to sell at a huge loss because that would realize it (it's a psychological barrier) 2) Some (and over time often a growing number of people) realize the loss to take other opportunities  All goes down to the simple question if Investors believe to have more chances to make it back by holding SVD, or selling it to put the money in something else. That in combination with 1) time, 2) increase of circulating supply over time, 3) watching other projects going up is likely to keep the price under pressure.",False

I don't think they're scammer in a way that they are total frauds who don't want to deliver. What I believe of how they are and what happened is this - but it's just my personal theory of course:  When they started the ICO they had near to zero experience in this space and their company wasn't in the best shape. There are some signs that they underestimated Crypto when it's about quality, that most or even all wallets are too complicated, that there are no easy-to-use-solutions and so on. And I believe that they have thought pretty arrogant about Crypto in general, because of the crazy hypes and so many people buying into everything - including a lot of shit. I believe that they really believed they could do a better job than most others. There is no lack of confidence in this team but people tend to be over-self-confident if they have a lack of experience and are not able to see the bigger picture, including all potential problems and so on. Many teams are like that and have to learn the hard way that it's not that easy.  Something that is obvious and so it's not necessary to guess about that: They have no sense for the social aspects in Crypto. What I mean is what could be called empathy - the ability to put oneself into the other and maybe contrary perspective. That is already visible in the way they've promoted their ICO. The way how they've done that, all the simple hype-headlines and promises, attracted a certain kind of Investors, also unexperienced ppl. I don't mean that critical since everybody was without experience at a time. But that leads into new problems, especially if you fuck with them like they did and the most obvious was the PR-Stunt of course. The community is totally divided since then and became a hostile environment. Savedroid on the other side doesn't know how to handle that. They try pretty much everything to show respect but in my impression it's pretended like everything else. They always prefer the big show and what they believe to be good marketing over fundamental work and maybe they are not even aware that they are not even good on the marketing/PR-side.  Just take this pictures of them bowling as example. It's not a big thing. It's not about the question if they are allowed to have a good time or not. Of course it's okay if they spend their free time bowling. But they wanted to show what a cool and relaxed team they are, real friends. And they have to push things like that out while their Investors look at a near All-time-low and hope for some news that would push the price up or even on them delivering on their promise to get the token on the top5 exchange etc. The Savedroid-guys are a one-trick-pony that repeatedly misses the point and doesn't even understand why.",False

More meaningful and more important than price in a situation like this (bear-market and maybe/hopefully bottom-building) is volume and liquidity. A change will be signaled through volume kicking in.  In Crypto that would probably happen this way:  First more Volume in BTC and ETH and a hard move. If that move would be u it would signal more money coming in and the rest of the market would be affected pretty much the same way and probably pretty fast.  Risk in such a situation would be: Projects that would not participate are at risk because once Investors of a project see a clear change in the market, a lot of green nearly everywhere plus higher volume plus better liquidity, they want to participate and become increasingly impatient if their asset doesn't react similar.  I'm not saying that because I believe that SVD would be that way. It's just a probability in all Cryptos that are not that known.  ________________  Edit: Helpful to understand the current situation and when it's about to change can be this:  https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/price_volume/2y/USD?r=month&t=lb&vu=curr  Bitcoin-Volume on ""monthly"" or ""weekly"" to have a clear picture. It's obviously decreasing since some time but I believe that very soon volume will kick in and we'll see a hard price move. Question is just in which direction. I personally tend to believe that it will be up because I expect Bakkt to get approval but that's not a safe bet. It could be down and a down-move with volume would signal what is called ""capitulation"" and that would be the final step before a longer period of bottom-building. In such a case it would need more patience until the next bull run most likely.",False

Right now only about 6.400 EUR. But, who looks at the markets to see the numbers per exchange will see this:     The volume on Cobinhood is excluded because Cobinhood charges no fees. But the volume is not just higher than on other exchanges, it is 5700% of HitBTC.  Most interesting question is: Can that be real volume? I mean, one could say: Since trading is for free people simply trade much more.  Why I don't believe that: The other exchanges show that not many are interested in Savedroid. I know Shitcoins from 2014 which have a higher volume. And the orderbook shows: On the BTC pair only 25 M SVD are on the buyside. On the ETH pair: 30 M SVD. Even if all of that would be at the current price level that would only be about 35000 EUR. But most of it is much much lower (15 Million SVD below 3 SAT on the BTC pair for example).  So, where does the volume come from? My bet: It's wash trading, done by bots. Maybe it's the exchange that trades SVD they got from Savedroid to list the token back and forth or it is another entity.  What is Wash trading?  A wash trade is a form of market manipulation in which an investor simultaneously sells and buys the same financial instruments to create misleading, artificial activity in the marketplace.[1] First, an investor will place a sell order, then place a buy order to buy from himself, or vice versa. This may be done for a number of reasons:  To artificially increase trading volume, giving the impression that the instrument is more in demand than it actually is.[2]  (...) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wash_trade  It's not unusual in Crypto. Even Bitfinex is accused to do it with Tether (Bitfinex and Tether are owned by the same ppl). But it's misleading of course and actually not legal.    2) Price   Yesterday something interesting happened:     That dump sent the price nearly to zero (about 0.000028 EUR) - with only 12 Million SVD.  Two scenarios:  1) Somebody simply wanted to get out. Without thinking about how to do it smart, he sold 12 Million SVD at a huge loss because a lot of it was sold significantly below the current price while it would have been possible to sell 12 Million with a little bit more patience and not only the ETH-pair without losing so much money.  2) A wash-trading-bot went crazy...   I don't know what it really was. Scenario 1 is possible because there are enough people who bought into SVD without having any experience, or maybe somebody was mad as hell and just wanted to crash the price or whatever. But.... stupid of course. Scenario 2: Bots don't always work as intended and that the volume is no real trading is a pretty safe guess in my opinion.     3) Cobinhood has influence on the price, not the best one...   But, what I actually want to show is: Whatever happens on Cobinhood with SVD doesn't help the price. It's the opposite. A second look on the first screenshot above shows: Prices on the Cobinhood-pairs are below other exchanges. With other words: The high(er) volume, in comparison to other exchanges SVD is listed on, would indicate high interest. If that would be real the price should reflect that as well. The liquidity is low, so the price actually should be above the prices on other exchanges. Why is that not the case?  A potential scenario could be this: Wash-trading, done by bots, is happening. The higher volume attracts real Investors but more of those who want out. So they choose to sell their SVD on Cobinhood and whenever somebody sells into the buys, the price goes down. Bots adjust and place their orders at lower prices as well. With other words: They would help to suppress the price even more. Other exchanges follow the leading exchange by volume and price circles down.  If I'm right, everybody who would be interested in higher prices can say a big ""thank you"" to whomever does this funny moves on Cobinhood.   The Chart looks this way - new All-Time-Low:      ",False

See, there are two kinds of ""dead"":  1) ""Walking Dead"" --> A project is still listed on some exchanges and traded with very low volume but the team has given up and it's not under real development anymore.  2) Dead --> A project is also not listed and traded anymore   Savedroid will not be delisted and the team will also not give it up anytime soon. They have so much money, they can keep on for years without running out of funding.  But there are several other problems in my opinion.   1) Team: I don't believe in this team. They don't seem to be competent, they are very bad communicators, they've proven not to act honest and transparent, whenever they had the choice between several different ways to do something, they consequently chose the worst one.    2) Market:  a) SVD would need a better exchange and as everybody knows, the team used the announcement of a top5 to promote their ICO and they still pretend to have an agreement. I don't believe they have this agreement and after all the shit they've done and the low volume, I also don't believe that this will be listed on any of the bigger exchanges.  b) This project is not very interesting for Crypto-Guys. That's another reason why the buyside is very thin. I don't believe that will change because of 1)... Plus: There are so many projects with a lot of potential out there that I wouldn't know why anybody would pick this one. And those who may be interested will start to do research and find all the scam-topics and back off.    3) Economics:   a) It's still not cheap. The current price has to be multiplied with the total amount to get the total value: about $5.2 M. It's very cheap in comparison to the ICO price but that only shows how ridiculous overvalued this was, especially if calculated in $.  Total supply: 6.997.578.543 SVD ICO-price in EUR: 0.01 ICO-price in Dollar: 0.012  Total Supply * ICO Price in $ = $83.9 Million!  It's completely crazy that they have been able to sell this at such a high price. I mean, the whole company is probably not even worth $10 M but a utility token for a not existing business should already be......??   b) What many may not see at the moment is: The price went down while only a fraction of supply is tradable yet. More and more SVD will flow on the exchanges once it becomes unrestricted. That is no inflation if focused on the total supply, but it like inflation for the market - and for the price only that matters.     But: If/Once the whole market turns into a new bull run it's likely that also SVD will rise in price. Last year I've seen really dead coins go to $30 M marketcaps and some even higher. I personally wouldn't hold SVD because of that, simply because I believe there are better opportunities out there, especially a lot of good projects are down at the moment. But under the line I think it is possible that the price will recover, even if the project would not get traction as a business model.",False

Under the line that is what they do. Today is just another example. I don't know their reasons but to charge a high amount of SVD for a withdrawal - after it already dropped 90%, that is so stupid. I've seen some screenshots of discussions on their channels (I'm banned) and obviously several others were banned today, including a guy who was really supportive until now.  Actually it's funny again: This Savedroid-Guys don't even remember that the ICO-price of the SVD was 10 times higher than it is now. The Savedroid-team seems to think: ""We just charge 2 EUR for a withdrawal!""  But, for a guy who bought 10k SVD for 100 EUR during the ICO it's this:  1) First they've done so much bullshit that the value dropped to 10 EUR without much hope for recovery 2) Now they want 20% of his holdings just that he can move his SVD  They've already forgotten how much money they once got for this shit.  And just btw: If they want such a high fee if their ICO-Investors want to transact their SVD, it also tells a lot about their business model. They talk about micro-savings, that ppl will transact small amounts into Savedroid to invest that into Crypto. And now imagine that somebody makes 10 transactions into SVD, each for 20 cent. 100% of that will go to Savedroid. Who will use a service to save money if using this service will cost so much money?  They don't have the right mindset for their own business model. It's obvious that they give a shit especially about those who don't have much money.",False

Reasons:  1) Much too low liquidity and volume. It's near to impossible to accumulate a lot and once that would be achieved it wouldn't be possible to sell that without crashing the price,  2) Even more important: There are whales in this, big holders who can not sell without crashing the price to zero.  3) In the last AMA (right before it hit the exchanges) Yassin said, and he meant that positive, that it would start with lower circulating supply because of lock up periods etc. Also: As far as I know many Credit Card Users still don't have their tokens (?). That means: Over time the circulating supply will increase. It's not real inflation because the total will not change but for the market it is inflation.  4) Additionally there is a specific problem this project has: A really bad reputation. That leads to a lack of buyers.  5) It's still not cheap. Ppl just believe that because they compare the current price to ICO-price. But truth is: It was unbelievable overvalued. Nobody (!) could ever explain in which universe a total value of > $80 M would be justified. Right now it's at $8 M. The whole company is most likely not worth $8 million, why should the total SVD-supply be worth that much?

He also thought about replacing the website with the picture of a dick (when doing the Exit-Scam-Prank)  - If a potential (token) Investor changed his mind and quit the pay process Yassin wanted to insert a message that the potential Investor only wouldn't want to buy because he has a small dick.  - The team convinced Hankir not to do such things   About work-atmosphere:  - ""It was dirty and the atmosphere was depressing"" a former employee says  - Although Savedroid has to deal with sensitive data employees had (have?) to work on their private Laptops  - In the ""welcome-letter"" new employees were prompted to give Savedroid a good rating on Kununu (rating portal for employers)  - The mood was good in 2017, there was ""startup-spirit"", but also on Kununu the ratings went shouth in 2018   Then the article gives links to bad ratings as an employer...   - Although employees worked overtime it was never enough and while there is an agreement in the contract that Savedroid would pay employees with Crypto for overhours, several report they were not paid  - Founders booked a trip to Thailand for the team in May to lift the mood - it was paid with ICO-money.  - The gap between founders and employees became greater over time and Yassin Hankir increasingly acted like a ""dictator""   Advertising & ICO:  - The Facebook-ban of Crypto-Ad's hit Savedroid hard. Traffic went down 95%  - The daily number of token sold tokens also went down  - They've tried to circumvent the ban with writing Crypto with ‚ÄûŒ©‚Äú instead of ""o"" - but it didn't really work out.  - Shortly before the ICO ended the Sales team got order to contact big Investors and to convince them to give more money. They had to promise premium and a good return. A prediction of an increase in value of 500% and more in a few months was also used to convince Investors.  - Also a fake-image of SVD trading on Binance was sent to Investors to convince them  - Savedroid wanted to hire a german rapper as testimonial but only hired Influencer on YouTube.  - A german Journalist (Roland Klaus), who is also member of the Advisory-Board of Savedroid, made advertising in articles on Wallstreet-online without identifiying it as that  - Savedroid got twice as much money during the ICO as expected but after the ICO also about half of the team left   About competence and expertise:  - Former employees have a lot of doubts that the Savedroid team has the expertise to build safe software  - There is a lack of knowledge about Blockchain-tech  - Until the end of the ICO nobody knew how to build a wallet  - During the ICO there was no work on the product, selling tokens was the only focus  - The website often does not reflect the current status but shows team-members that don't work for Savedroid anymore. Only after multiple requests Savedroid would delete pics of former employees   - The former Savedroid employees who talked to Gr√ºnderszene are relieved not to work for Savedroid anymore.  - They had to defend themselves against friends and others because of the PR-Stunt.  - One guy says: ""I'm sorry for the team that tried to slow down Yassin"". That he talks about it all now is not meant as revenge, he wants to do the right thing and to tell people what happens at Savedroid. He is glad that he left and says: Like in the movie Wolf of Wall Street     What I didn't translate: Gr√ºnderszene asked Yassin to directly comment on the allegations but he didn't want to. Instead he sent a Statement ""why Savedroid is an attractive employer"". In the article his quotes are kind of used to show the gap between reality and his irrelevant advertisement talk...

Especially this one - German original:  ""Kurz vor Ende des Tokenverkaufs sei das Sales-Team angewiesen worden, Gro√ü-Investoren des ICOs zu kontaktieren und zu weiteren Investments zu √ºberreden. Dabei habe man hohe Boni und Renditen versprochen. So sei eine Wertsteigerung der Savedroid-Token von 500 Prozent und mehr innerhalb weniger Monate prognostiziert worden, erz√§hlen ehemalige Mitarbeiter. Des Weiteren sei ein gef√§lschtes Bild herausgeschickt worden, das zeigte, dass Savedroids Token auf der bekannten Kryptob√∂rse Binance gehandelt werden solle. Auch dazu wollte sich Savedroid auf Nachfrage von Gr√ºnderszene nicht √§u√üern.""  Translation:  ""Shortly before the end of the tokensale, the Sales team was instructed to contact big Investors of the ICO and to persuade them to additional Investments. There have been made promises of high premium and returns. An increase of value of the SVD-token of 500% and more in a few months was predicted, former employees tell. Also a doctored image was sent out which showed that the Savedroid Token was planned to being traded on the known Crypto-Exchange Binance. Savedroid didn't want to comment on that as well.""     The question here is: Are those allegations true? Some told me that several (many?) in the community believe that Gr√ºnderszene just wants to generate traffic. I don't believe that, because such allegations are too serious to play a risky game. Savedroid could very well sue them in case that Gr√ºnderszene hasn't fact checked or even made things up.  But:  1) Obviously they've talked to several former employees of Savedroid. 2) One allegation also is that, even if employees had to handle sensitive data, they had to use their own private computers to do that. If true, there is some probability that the journalists have seen proof... let's say a former employee showed them mails and the fake-pic or maybe they've even contacted bigger Investors to ask if that is true.    What I find interesting about this situation is: Some of the allegations in that article are so serious that Savedroid would have to sue in case it's just a made up story combined with serious lies. I mean, just remember: Savedroid publicly threatened the guys who published this study, which called Savedroid a scam, to take legal action (I doubt they've really done that). And the study was a non-event in comparison to this article.   How could Savedroid react on this?  1) Taking legal actions against Gr√ºnderszene? Sure, but only if Gr√ºnderszene doesn't have proof to underline it all. 2) Publish a blog post and say ""this is not true""? Sure, but only if Gr√ºnderszene doesn't have proof to underline it all.    What I want to say with that: It's very likely that Savedroids reaction will show if those allegations are true or not. If it's just random talk without any detailed rebuttal and/or taking legal action --> Gr√ºnderszene tells the truth  If Savedroid rebuts details of the article and/or takes legal action it would be interesting to see who will win.   What I believe is: The guys of Gr√ºnderszene are no stupid kids but that they are prepared. They know that they can not just come up with something like that without having fact-checked it. And if they have done that, they have a lot to reply on everything Savedroid could come up with. At the same time: It wouldn't need that article to know that Savedroid doesn't have any integrity. They have a long track record of deceptive hype and lies.    And btw, I've already said this at the end of a long post in late April:     What I meant by that is simple: I've never believed that the whole team agreed to do this insane PR-Stunt - yet, it was done. Just that tells a lot about the company. It would be unlikely if there wouldn't have been more situations in which team-members had to follow insane orders of the founders. That's the reason why I'm not even too surprised that some former employees become whistle-blowers now, while I would be very surprised if their allegations should turn out as lies -  simply because everything what is said in that article fits into the obvious track-record of this crazy hype project which always showed a total lack of competence, integrity, sustainability, transparency, communicative skills while the opposite was often totally obvious, especially their greed and hypocrisy.",False

On April 26 I had an interesting discussion with tobson2 and said this about communication:        If we think about what a natural reaction of a legit project on such an article would be, it's also possible to think about what they communicate with their silence.  Imagine you are a high-level-member, or even the CEO, of a company that gets attacked by a made up story build on lies. Wouldn't you want to rebut it as soon as possible? And of course, a detailed reaction may take some time but a natural thing to do would've been:  1) Right after the article hit them at least react with a tweet, saying that the article is bullshit and a detailed reaction will follow 2) After about 8-10 hours at latest it should be possible to publish a blog-post that refutes all lies.  And when it's about serious allegations (and that article absolutely has that): It would be right to take legal action and in such a case, differently to the study, it would also be right to publicly say that legal actions will be taken.   They've done nothing so far. Why?   If anybody should have doubts that there would be good reasons to react fast on something like that, just take a look at the chart:     The chart does not only show the reaction on the article. It shows much more:   1) There wasn't even an immediate and strong reaction right after the article was published 2) But since there was no reaction of Savedroid, more people became uncertain and sold 3) Then there even was a bit of a recovery - maybe because some believed, Savedroid would ""soon"" rebut the article 4) But over the day today the silence was interpreted as ""what is said in the article is probably true, otherwise Savedroid would have refuted it""   The problem also is: After such a long time a reaction of Savedroid could not have the same impact as if they would have reacted reasonable and quickly.  So, again the question is: Why?  Simple answer: There is a high probability that the allegations lined out in that article are true.   And again, the most serious one in my opinion is this one:  ""Shortly before the end of the tokensale, the Sales team was instructed to contact big Investors of the ICO and to persuade them to additional Investments. There have been made promises of high premium and returns. An increase of value of the SVD-token of 500% and more in a few months was predicted, former employees tell. Also a doctored image was sent out which showed that the Savedroid Token was planned to being traded on the known Crypto-Exchange Binance. Savedroid didn't want to comment on that as well.""     The problem for Savedroid is, in case that should be true, that they can not say that it is not. Because if they've done that there is proof out there. In such a case former employees probably still have such mails and some of the bigger Investors have those mails.  But, if they don't say that it's not true it would be the same like confirming it to be true.   Considered such allegations are true, and I believe they are, the situation for them right now is probably like this:  They try to find a way to react on this in a convincing way while not saying too much, because if they would go into details they would go into total confrontation. They could easily lose such fight within a few hours, maybe just minutes, with the result to be outed as blatant liars. Just imagine Savedroid would claim that they have never done this and Gr√ºnderszene simply replies with a screenshot of a mail including such a doctored SVD-Binance-Pic. Or imagine a big Investor, who is mad as hell now because his 100K are not even 10k now, would come forward.  But... if they just come up with random and unspecified write up it would also say a lot while additionally they would be confronted with questions, like ""Hey, you didn't say anything about the Binance-allegation! Is it true or not?""...   With other words: In case such allegations are true they find themselves in a trap without any good option.   There is another thing in case the Binance-topic should turn out to be true: It could legally cross a line. My knowledge about that is too limited but I don't think that it would not be illegal to manipulate Investors into giving them high amounts of money using lies and deception.   Plus: Also on April 25 I've written a longer post about a potential scenario regarding the Top5-Exchange:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2578161.msg35591368#msg35591368   In case this Binance-allegation should be true, it's totally safe to say that SVD will never be listed on Binance. And it's also likely that no other big exchange will list them. And that would have more consequences when it's about the price of course. The chance that this goes back to ICO-level is not high but it would even decrease significantly if SVD doesn't get a better listing in future. The price is constantly falling at low volume and the result is that more and more Holder think ""damn, I wish I would have sold yesterday or last week"" etc. And those guys will use every bit of recovery to sell, especially if they see no hope.     Result today: The price right now is at 0.00081993 EUR. That's a loss of 91.8% - it  would have to rise x 12 to get to ICO-price-level.  That makes obvious who is bleeding for their bullshit.",False

But since the ICO, the situation at Savedroid has deteriorated severely. Not only the catastrophic action with the fake exit-scam, but also the amateurish and non-transparent behavior of all participants regarding exchanges. In addition, the team and the leadership does not look good. To value such a company with 40 million is insane. Many investors have seen that and try to save their money.

I only looked at the seize because I wanted to know if bigger Investors refuse to sell or not. But there were several big transactions that can not be from Bounty Hunters.  My view on the market situation is this:  1. Those who believe that big guys don't sell are not right. It may depend on definition of how much it needs to be considered as ""SVD-whale"" of course, but several who have invested > $10k in the ICO transacted to an exchange (and go home with 1.5/10th of their Investment)  2. More important: Nonetheless the price has dropped with low volume, low liquidity and while there is just a percentage in circulation yet, the circulating supply will increase what will be ""inflation for the market"". Credit Card Users for example but also the more SVD become unrestricted over time.  3. HitBTC is not helpful, probably even the opposite. Only about 8 ETH (ca. $2300) on the buyside of the ETH-pair and only 0.39 BTC (ca. $2450) on the BTC-pair.  4. High probability that the volume may dry up nearly completely. Right now it's at about $62.511 USD for the last 24 hours) on all exchanges in summary.  5. Many believe SVD is cheap now. But truth is: It was so unbelievable overvalued during the ICO that it distorts the view on a more realistic value. That's not only true for Savedroid of course but also for many many other projects. The total value (calculated with 7 bn SVD) would be at about $11.7 million and that is still a lot. It's not circulating yet, but even if only about $3 million or whatever it might be, are circulating and ready to be sent to the exchanges, it might lead the price to drop further at low volume.

Conbinhood Volume: $2.202.961 USD HitBTC Volume: $245.898.056 USD  The airdrop is nonsense. They want to airdrop SVD worth of 1000 EUR, distribute it to those who don't sell. Just calculate the very unlikely situation that the price comes near to the 0.01 EUR level and if it would make sense to hold it, to get some cent in SVD, or to sell.  But anyway... that will not happen. 0.01 Euro Cent would give this project a total valuation of about 70 million EUR (nearly $80 M). The company is probably not even worth 5 million and they've never been able to explain why their token-economy should be worth more.   At the moment I believe they come up with this new move because HitBTC rejected Savedroid. It's kind of telling that they make this announcement but not even mention HitBTC.  And just for the record: They locked the smart contract with the reason to ensure good liquidity for HitBTC. That also didn't make sense but unlocking it now for Cobinhood while not saying what's going on with HitBTC is kind of a weird ""strategy"".

First they unlock too early. The explanation is: They had to do that to give HitBTC and Bancor time for testing. But even if that should be true, and I'm not too sure about that, they should've known and explain that earlier. But they've said that they'll unlock on 8 pm CEST  multiple times during the AMA.  And because IDEX and TIDEX did not need testing with an unlocked smart contract everything was prepared. So the unlock (hours before the scheduled time) was tantamount to trading start on both exchanges. And then... they let it run for about 2 hours, price is dumped to shit, and without any explanation or warning before they lock it again. Given reason, hours later:  ""We have not yet received the technical GO from HitBTC that the markets for SVD are open. We are talking to HitBTC to understand the situation. Once we learn more and get to know when the markets for SVD will open, we will immediately inform our community. Until then we are forced to pause the SVD smart contract to ensure the best liquidity for SVD at listing start. We are very sorry for any inconvenience caused. All the best, Yassin & the savedroid Team.""   That's a lie because it implies that trading didn't start yet while right now SVD is traded. It's true with focus on HitBTC of course. Conclusion: They ignore TIDEX and IDEX and make all their bets on HitBTC (just btw: they don't even mention Bancor), probably with the hope that the bigger exchange will help the price.  Second: They want to ensure ""best liquidity"" while the pause has an opposite effect on both exchanges SVD is already traded on: Funds are frozen again and no SVD can be deposited. Traders play with a very low percentage of the supply now and drive the price up. Many will be surprised once Savedroid unlocks the smart contract again, because the real dumping is likely to start just a minute after the unlock with increasing intensity.  What they (Savedroid) maybe hope (in case that they think about all of that at all): The lock up leads to very low liquidity on IDEX and TIDEX, less selling, so the price recovers on both exchanges. Once HitBTC opens trading, they hope for more buyers who tend to buy at higher prices because they see the prices on IDEX and TIDEX.  But: I'm nearly totally sure that that will turn out as a misconception. The effect could very well be the opposite.  If we think about it: Only those who recognized that the unlock was hours earlier than communicated sent their SVD on exchanges - a minority. At the same time the low supply that reached both exchanges already was enough to dump it about 80% below the ICO-price. A majority of potential Sellers waited for 8 pm CEST - but the smart contract was already on pause again at that time.  The second problem is: This whole confusion about trading start, plus the decision to set everything on hold, additionally hurt Savedroids reputation. They got a lot of criticism from own Investors, they got a lot of laughs outside of the community, and even some negative media attention. Problem: After the price was dumped on IDEX and TIDEX and all the critique it's not likely that HitBTC can help much regarding the price. I believe that the price will find new lows once HitBTC finally lists SVD and all gates are open to send SVD on exchanges.  Third: If a price recovers first, because the market is not natural (many don't figure that), the psychological effect is much more devastating once the merciless dumping really starts.  And they've set it all up to make such a worst case scenario very likely and they don't seem to get it.    1) Again they show that they are not able to think through situations like that and manage it all properly and in best interest of their Investors.  2) Again they show poor communication. The post I quoted above is inconclusive and misleading, no matter if intentionally or not. And what did they say after posting that? Nothing...  3) Again they show that all what they said before was just cheap talk. Trading start and unlock at 8 pm CEST? Who cares. Best was this: ""savedroid democratizes crypto!‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäWe‚Äôre not kidding."" (Headline of their Medium post). To say that is nonsense anyway but right now they clearly show what they mean by that: Arbitrarily unlock and lock all funds, misleading Traders on IDEX and TIDEX, not ever explaining anything right...  4) Again and again they clearly prove that they should not have control over other peoples money. Decisions of the past:  - PR-Stunt without thinking about effects  - Exchange-voting, including being totally intransparent and even manipulate the voting (contacting pre-sale Investors to vote after voting was officially closed). And while the manipulated result was on ""wait for Top5"" it's meaningless now. Top5 exchange? Yassin said in the AMA about the Top5: ""In Crypto nothing is ever safe!"". But back in March they announced it as ""secured"" to hype their ICO...  - Then they wanted to wait with the listing for better market conditions. Market conditions are worse now and Yassin (rightfully) says: Yes, that's hard to time.. but he could have known that before and never come up with such bullshit.  - ....and so on...    I wouldn't ever count on anything what they say, because they change the rules whenever an idea comes into their minds. Usually that are bad ideas, poorly communicated and executed in a totally incompetent manner.   But they want to educate others and even advise other projects... I still don't get how they can be so arrogant and not learn out of their mistakes.",False

First they unlock the tokens too early and two exchanges start trading hours before the announced time. The other exchanges don't start trading at all and Savedroid locks the tokens and says:  ""We have not yet received the technical GO from HitBTC that the markets for SVD are open. We are talking to HitBTC to understand the situation. Once we learn more and get to know when the markets for SVD will open, we will immediately inform our community. Until then we are forced to pause the SVD smart contract to ensure the best liquidity for SVD at listing start. We are very sorry for any inconvenience caused. All the best, Yassin & the savedroid Team.""  ......and go to bed(?)   Interesting about the message above is:  1) While not only HitBTC didn't list SVD yet but also Bancor, they don't even mention Bancor? 2) They say that they don't have received the ""technical"" GO. Does that mean HitBTC is technically not ready yet but you believed to have a technical GO even hours before the scheduled time? Actually exchanges know how to list an ERC20 3) You are forced to pause the SVD smart contract to ensure best liquidity at listing start? That doesn't make sense at all. You guys already listed > 12 hours ago and this is already trading on two exchanges. What you are doing is market manipulation because ppl on TIDEX and IDEX are playing around with a percentage of the real supply and low liquidity! 4) You said that you are ""talking to HitBTC to understand the situation"" and that you will immediately inform your community once you know more. But after more than 8 hours you didn't learn more? You guys went to sleep without saying anything because you didn't learn more in all those hours?   I had no doubt that the price would tank hard but never expected this shitshow.    A theory:  Savedroid unlocked the token hours too early and trading started on IDEX and TIDEX. HitBTC and Bancor didn't like that Savedroid crashed the agreed schedule, so they refused to list under those circumstances. Savedroid simply locked it all again and is in negotiations.  But, one never knows what is really going on with this project. Only safe bet is that they have unbelievable talent to push their own community into a state of total confusion and frustration.",False

It all comes back to the unlocking of the SVD-Token about 3 hours before the officially announced start of the listing at 20:00 CEST. And that has been in total control of Savedroid's devs and that's why they are fully responsible for the aftermath.  They can't srsly expect, that the community is going to tolerate one failure after another and keeps calm another few months and potential new investors honor this bullshit.  Since this failure disadvantages the investors again there can only be one fair, honest and final solution:  REFUND all investors who apply for it!

I've lined it out months ago:  1) They would have less money but they got so much that it would still be enough  2) It would have given choice, so everybody who would have decided to hold would have no reason to complain  3) It would have reduced the supply which would have been better for the price.  4) After their Scam-no-Scam-Pr-Stunt people still had reason to call them scammers because they've done all that on the back of their Investors while having their money safe. A refund would have strengthen their Community and would have been a positive sign for the public - that Savedroid is able to take on their responsibility instead just saying ""We are deeply sorry"" (*but fuck you all*).   Since they have build one bad decision on another one and are teachers who refuse to learn.... No, there won't be a refund. What they'll do is: No matter if HitBTC will list SVD or not, they have to unlock the token again and that should happen soon. Supply will reach the exchanges and most of it will probably be dumped right away. In the end and after months of madness they've damaged their reputation again and once more.

Very good analysis of the red flags of this project. I think there is a bit more on the upside though.  I think it's obvious Savedroid does or did not have proper advisors when making all these decisions that were hurting the brand more and more. I see this happening with many other projects too. The majority does not have the expertise or experience to actually build what's outlined in their white paper. And even if they are capable, they lack often the network within this space, making it very hard to find the right people or get listed at exchanges. This seems to have affected many projects this year too. As bad as past decisions were made I still believe they can turn the negative sentiment around by doing a sequence of very smart decisions.

Payment and Banking awarded them in March 2018, probably because of their successful ICO (raised a lot of money). But the award was withdrawn right after their PR-Stunt, so actually it's not honest and justified to say ""Savedroid is an award-winning AI-FinTech made in Germany"".   https://twitter.com/paymentbanking/status/986901107854249984 https://paymentandbanking.com/aberkennung-des-preises-zum-fintech-des-jahres-fuer-savedroid/  That's in german but here is an english article that mentions it all: https://cryptocurrencynews.com/icos/savedroid-scam-but-not-a-scam-pr-stunt-faces-the-consequences-of-a-terrible-idea/   Also other things in that article are misleading. They say:  ""We provide easy access to cryptocurrencies for everyone‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääabsolutely no crypto exchange signup, wallet setup, and private key handling required.""   Truth is: Sure, one can say that it doesn't need exchange signup because Savedroid is no exchange, but user need it all for Savedroid as well. Savedroid is not Switcheo. It also requires registration and KYC etc.  Even more interesting is that no private key handling is required. Yes, exactly like on a centralized exchange if you decide to keep your money there. Problem is: As long as an Investor doesn't control his private keys he also really doesn't own the money. Like all exchanges Savedroid could get hacked and Users would lose their money.  What's better on Savedroid than on usual exchanges? It may be less complicated. But while users pay 0.x% fees on an exchange per trade, Savedroid wants 15% for each action, which means:  After a user bought into Crypto on Savedroid (15% Fees) he needs about 30% price increase to be able to sell (another 15%) and not to lose money. Not so sure how it can be smart to ""save"" money that way.   Also interesting is to say ""We have created a utility token with a deflation mechanism as suggested by Vitalik Buterin.""  Yes, they say that they'll burn a ""certain percentage"" of the fee. But as far as I know they've never said how much. Now everybody can calculate how many Users it will need, who make their savings-transactions on Savedroid and are willing to pay up to 15% for each action to generate that much volume that a percentage of that will reduce the SVD-supply enough to justify a marketcap of about $50 Million and a total value of significantly more.   Just btw: What do they actually mean with saying ""savedroid democratizes crypto!‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäWe‚Äôre not kidding""? If they are not kidding they should be able to explain how they democratize Crypto? They will hold the private keys of all of their Users and they are a centralized company. What has that to do with democratizing Crypto?  And especially their PR-Stunt and their unwillingness to really overtake responsibility other than saying ""We are sorry"" shows their tendency to dictatorship, because who can not even move the tokens so many months after buying into the ICO while who sits on the real money that is not at risk because of all of their silly actions? Who will suffer because of a dropping price because of their damaged reputation while Savedroid rejected all who wanted to get their money back?   But yeah, an ""award winning"" project ""democratizes"" Crypto... they must be kidding! ;-)  All what I see since I watch Savedroid is smoke and mirrors. Nearly everything what they say should be questioned because they tend to mislead.",False

Right now the climate for ICO's is toxic and unless the SEC decides in favor of the recent filing regarding ETFs this might continue for much longer.

Indeed there are many other opportunities, less ICOs but coins you can buy for large discounts.  Regarding the use case, I have not seen the app yet but from what I know so far it's sounds like a lot of people could benefit from it, however there were similar projects that combined Crypto Saving with AI like Daneel and they did not take off either, were trading far below ICO price last time I checked.

But I'm still sceptical. Interesting read but unsure how reliable: https://theicojournal.com/source-bitcoin-etf-nearly-certain-to-win-approval-later-this-year/    Quote Regarding the use case, I have not seen the app yet but from what I know so far it's sounds like a lot of people could benefit from it, however there were similar projects that combined Crypto Saving with AI like Daneel and they did not take off either, were trading far below ICO price last time I checked. But I see Savedroid superior compared to Daneel as they do not ""borrow"" their AI from IBM (Watson) and create something of their own.  I don't believe that AI will make much difference any time soon and I don't believe in the big AI-promises of small projects like Savedroid or Coinanalyst. What I believe in: Customers want an easy to use and safe entry into Crypto. That could be the fundamental brand of Savedroid. But that is highly about trust because as a user you will have to trust Savedroid with your money. And they have damaged the trust-topic very effectively. Second: The search for the perfect balance between easy to use and safe is not new. A lot of projects are working on that and in my opinion the future will be about applications and Desktop-Wallets that 1) give user control about their money and 2) are directly connected to decentralized exchanges to be cheap. That future is also not there yet, but it will come for sure.  Savedroid: Will not give users control about their money and it will be expensive. That's something I see as major problem, because I don't understand the concept of saving money while paying 15% for each action and not really owning the assets.  Quote     The stunt did hurt the brand for sure, the explanation of the CEO afterwards made sense for me, but the large majority never watched that and indeed if you do some research you find mostly sites that report about the stunt at the time and never updated their reports, which is quite normal in the press as most online media is mainly interested in clicks and dramatic headlines. On the other hand people who would have never found out about this project now are aware of it. If you do a bit more research then you will also find out quickly that it was ""just"" a stunt or awareness campaign.  See... the explanation can make sense to people simply because there is a lot of fraud going on in this space and it's pretty much everywhere. But at the same time it's so trivial and superficial and presumptuous to do such a PR-stunt. In my opinion it goes down to two conclusions: Those who didn't follow the whole story still think Savedroid is a scam. Others find it stupid. To me there is one big conclusion: They think superficially, they focus on bold headlines while ignoring the context. But context is everything.  The paradox is: They wanted to educate others, implying they would have understood this space. But it's just a proof that they don't understand. They are egocentric newbies to Crypto. Also this legal threat because of the study underlines that. Is it wrong to rebut the claims of this study? Of course not. Is it wrong to consider legal actions? Not necessarily. Is it wrong to communicate it that way? Absolutely, because the reactions are predictable. They have put themselves in such a weak position because they themselves have caused the ""scam-shitshow"". And then they communicate such a threat in public.... it will be forgotten soon but to me it shows again: They make stupid decisions, have zero sense for smart communication and under the line everything is communication.  Or take the whole top5-communication and how the story changed over time or their attempt to hype the Coinanalyst-ICO. And a lot of what they communicate... they like to put others into ""wrong"" and themselves into ""right"". A simple example: It's very usual for Yassir to say that they are open for critical arguments but that they don't listen to those who are loud but to those who come up with arguments. Truth is: They are loud themselves and they ban people with critical arguments on their Telegram channels. Or: Yassir likes to talk about the moon prices of exchanges and that they don't want to play that game. Sounds reasonable. What he doesn't say is that they've liked the ""Hype-ICO-Game"" and still like it (Coinanalyst). And they have given their own token a moon-price.  In my opinion: Narcissistic Hypocrits.",False

Savedroid often apologized for the ""hard time"" they gave their Investors, referring to the 24 hours they pretended to be vanished. That's nothing compared to the longterm impact especially on the own brand and therefore on the way this project is seen by the public. The study they are fighting now is just one example and interestingly they seem to see this study as overly damaging, but in my opinion there is some dishonesty in play here. The difference is not that the study is more damaging than all the articles that are out there anyway. The difference is that the study can be attacked (because it's inaccurate) while the articles are a direct result out of their own actions. But all the articles are as bad for their reputation as the study - the study is not more meaningful. At the same time, even if inaccurate - also the study is a result of their own actions and while it's right to set the record straight it's stupid to publicly threat with legal actions.  What I try to say here is: I believe the team has not learned much. There is a lack of ability to anticipate community and public reaction and they don't seem to understand how much they show with moves like that.

It doesn't look good for sure and I don't believe all the reasons they've given in the past. If I would be invested: Short-term I would only look at sentiment. That's really bad for now and I don't expect that to change any time soon, but a high-volume/liqudity-exchange would help of course. At the same time: Even if the mood of the community would change it would need so much to change how Savedroid is seen by the general public. Whoever googles it finds the Scam-Headlines. The team underestimated how dangerous it was to play with that and I believe they still underestimate how hard it will be to regain trust and to be considered as reputable service and team.  A more interesting question is if this project could have longterm-potential and if the team has the competence to deliver. I personally don't believe in the use-case because I don't believe that there are many who would want to use Crypto to ""safe money"". Crypto attracts another kind of people and there are so many competitors out there, and even more will come, who make it easy and convenient to buy into Crypto. I don't see anything special in Savedroid, besides the ""gamificiation-approach"" with the smooves. But that also makes it expensive (15% fees for each action is a lot) while it doesn't provide much real use.  But, the use case and if ppl could find it attractive is something I don't know enough about. If I should be wrong it will need a lot of time to get traction - that is true for nearly all services (good exchanges may be an exception, like Binance). Considered that this team has near to zero experience in this space (Crypto), I believe that they are not able to anticipate technical problems as well and run into other kinds of trouble in the future.    The problem out of Investor-perspective may be:  1) Short-term it's about sentiment and that is not good 2) Longterm it's about real/fundamental potential. Even in best case that would need some time 3) At the same time there are a lot of other opportunities, especially if the market should turn bullish",False

This is the Top5-story until now:   1. Top5-Announcement in March and during the ICO as ""secured""  2. Problems with KYC  3. PR-Stunt and a lot of trouble as result - maybe/probably such a damage of reputation that exchanges reject them  4. Still problems with KYC and distribution  5. Savedroid claims, the Top5 is about to readjust the listing-requirements, therefore it will need a bit more time. But: The Top5 exchange still wants to list Savedroid and even for free!  6. Community-voting if to wait for the Top5 (4-6 weeks) or not. Result: A majority wants to wait. Another result is: Zero transparency and they admit that they've contacted Pre-Sale-Investors to vote after the voting was officially closed.  7. Additional argument: Bigger Investors want to wait for the Beta-Release  8. Beta is released but obviously the Top5 still didn't get their listing-requirements finished  9. Now, said during the last AMA: Actually they wouldn't want to wait for the Top5 anymore, so the voting result is also not important anymore. But especially big Investors (again) are concerned about the bear market. Funny is: The bear market is going on since January... but now it replaces all other ""reasons"" and made it on #1 on the excuse-list.   What is a known pattern: They often refer to big ticket buyers whenever they come up with excuses.  - Big Investors liked the PR-Stunt - Big Investors want to wait for the top5 - Big Investors want to wait for the Beta - Big Investors want to wait because of the market conditions    And what's kind of funny: They like to put it that way as if the big guys would be the smart ones. Small buyers ""scream"" and are loud... the bigger ones are the thinkers, calm and nice and strategic masterpieces. The big issue here is: How smart can it be to put much money into a hype-project like this?   What I said/asked shortly after the PR-Stunt was this:  Quote from: tempus on April 24, 2018, 09:28:15 AM  Still all exchanges on board that agreed to list you? If you think through this out of their perspective and after your PR-Stunt: It wouldn't be that surprising if they are unsure if they want to be associated with such a move.  (...)   In my opinion there are mainly two options with some probability:  1) There never was an agreement with a top5 exchange but they've just used the announcement to hype their ICO. 2) There was an agreement but the top5 rejected them after the PR-Stunt   What I find interesting is that they didn't just say they would have such an agreement but that they wouldn't have to pay anything for it - while later they constantly complained about high listing prices.  And what I didn't believe for a moment is the given argument that the top 5 exchange delayed the listing because of readjustments of their listing requirements.",False

Here is our statement on the various points of criticism. ( We are looking forward to constructive feedback in our ANN Thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4461332.0 )  Please read it and make your assumptions based on these facts and get into a discussion with us.  CoinAnalyst is a spin-off of Cogia GmbH from Frankfurt, Germany. Cogia GmbH exists since 2010, with a track record of more than 7 years of intensive development, numerous awards and Fortune 500 customers.  We are familiar with crowdfunding and the like: At the beginning of 2017, we successfully completed a crowd investing via the well-established Companisto crowd investing platform (companisto.com) with almost 1000 investors who have been watching us very closely ever since. Lots of its investors now also support CoinAnalyst already!   savedroid  We know savedroid. We believe in the future of their products ‚Äì and we don't let plain PR stunts distract us.  The solutions of CoinAnalyst and savedroid complement each other extremely well and has great synergies. This can only be in the interests of all investors! If you want to make ""Cryptocurrencies for everyone"" possible, you also need ""Understanding Cryptocurrencies"".  Every savedroid customer needs CoinAnalyst. And every CoinAnalyst receives an easy way to get crypto coins with savedroid. The synergy of the products is obvious ‚Äì that's why a product partnership like this makes sense. If you don't think so, please let us know why.   Whitepaper  Our whitepaper is almost 30 pages long. Yes, we took some of the paragraphs from Savedroid, because they just make sense. We asked Savedroid for permission. We thought about how we could create more value for our supporters and COY traders ‚Äì and we looked for the best practices for the COY.  Besides Savedroid as a source of inspiration we also learned from Binance. We got some feedback about the combination of the burning model and the buyback program, but we make it clear how this model works for us. CoinAnalyst is a profit-oriented company ‚Äì so as soon as we make profits from the sale of our product, the traders also profit from it.  Finally, we chose Token Hodl Discounts, which were also not used by savedroid.   COY and CoinAnalyst in focus  We would be pleased if you continue to follow our development and take a deep look at anything we do! We will continue to respond transparently and adjust if there is justified feedback in our ANN Tread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4461332.0 .  We hope you support our mission to make cryptocurrencies more transparent and trading more secure, by using artificial intelligence and our big data analysis technologies.

One thing about Savedroid is obvious: They like it very much to point on others, on the greed and the lack of sustainability in the market, on the high listing prices on certain exchanges which are economically not rational out of Savedroid-perspective but ""moon-prices"". They like it to talk about transparency and educating others, they like to present themselves as serious and reputable.  But....  They used the ICO-Hype to make as much money as possible, they used everything to hype (""Top5-Exchange secured!"" - ""it's possible to invest with many other cryptocurrencies"" - ""here is a price-prediction chart"" - ""made in Germany"" etc.) while they could never explain why a little Startup that wants to develop an App needs more money as many of the projects who are leading today (Ethereum, Neo, Binance, etc.)  They could never explain why their token-economy could ever be worth the high price they've already given it during the ICO. And just btw: They also don't give numbers about the burning-rate while they like it to let their Investors believe that the burning will give real value to the token while the whole company is not near to be worth what they got in the ICO.  They could never explain how it's possible to be sure that their PR-Stunt would not have bad impact on the future price - which Yassin said in an interview.  And when it's about transparency.... what do they let their Investors know? Whenever it's about the important aspects they simply say ""trust us"".  Any informations about Exchange-Listing? --> ""trust us"" How much SVD will be burned of each fee? --> ""a certain percentage, just trust us"" Do you really need that much money? --> ""trust us"" Was the exchange-voting legtit? ---> ""trust us"" How did you come to the price-chart? How was it calculated? --> ""trust us"" The PR-Stunt will not have bad effect for the price? ---> ""trust us"" etc...     They have the real money now and it's naive to believe that hypocrites like that will give any of that back if they have the chance to keep it. Otherwise they would have refunded already because many wanted that the day after their PR-Stunt. But, what was their reason again?  ""The project did not change.""

I was banned on the german Savedroid-Channel today what was kind of funny. Actually it was a good discussion first. I was critical but didn't spread FUD, didn't attack anyone personal (and clearly said that it's not my intention to do that), I even said some positive things as well and it was totally on topic, about fundamental aspects of the project. But after some time an Admin asked me to stop and since the discussion was pretty much over anyway, I was quiet.  But some hours later I recognize that another Admin quoted a post of mine in which I had expressed my critique that Savedroid pinned the Price-Simulation on the webpage, but without giving any transparency how they come to those conclusions, also that it's my impression that no one who believes and supports the project seems to be able to explain...  1) why Savedroid wanted and got so much money in the ICO 2) why the total value of SVD should be that high and why (much higher than the value of the whole company btw) 3) what the burn rate will be, because I've never seen any number 4) why nobody of those who believe in the project seem to be able to come up with fundamental arguments instead simply ask critiques to be quiet and/or asking others just to have trust   So this Admin quoted my post, and linked a screenshot to the whitepaper which shows a basic explanation how they came to the chart - but without giving any numbers. I explained again that I know the explanation but that it doesn't say anything and asked...  - if there are numbers - if Savedroid provided informations about the expected volume - about the expected burn rate etc.  Then another guy replied on my post and I replied on him, even said something positive (that I'm not critical about the concept in general but about some certain aspects which I pointed out). After a few minutes when I looked again: Banned  That's ironic. Earlier I had agreed to stop and I was quiet, but I made the mistake to believe that it's okay to reply if somebody quotes me, including an Admin. But... that already seems to be enough to get kicked there without any explanation or a warning. ;-)   Many got kicked btw.

It's so damn superficial there while the german group seemed not to be that way first. But it seems that a deeper dive into the fundamentals is not well received anywhere.  But, I don't take it personal. In my opinion it's the weakness of the project, all the weird team-decisions and contradictions, the lack of transparency and actual facts about important aspects, what simply overwhelms those who communicate in favor of this project. If confronted with all of that, they can not really reply with arguments, but if they can't reply it would make those weaknesses obvious, so they try to find reasons to shut down fundamental and critical discussions.  Isn't it ironic as well: Savedroid wanted attention, wanted to educate, warn and start discussion about the whole Crypto-space and the topics:  1) transparency and a lack of 2) economical sustainability and a lack of 3) honesty and a lack of 4) greed 5) hype etc.  But obviously they prefer theoretical discussions about ""everything"" that is not Savedroid while the look into the mirror scares them. ;-)  ",False

There are several things I see as contradictions:  1) They constantly complain about the high prices to get a good listing but they also claim that they secured a listing on a top 5 already during the ICO without having to pay for it. 2) While they said that listing would be secured back then, they say now: Due to an update of listing policies the certain exchange delays the listing. But why does the update has an effect on Savedroid if there already was an agreement? And if the update has influence on Savedroid, how can they still say it's safe that they'll meet the new requirements and get the listing (and without having to pay for it)? 3) Some days ago I've checked all Twitter accounts of the top 5 exchanges and I saw no difference. They all are listing new projects constantly. 4) The way Yassir talks about the listing also slightly shifts from ""save"" and ""soon"" to ""we have no influence on that"". 5) The voting was weird. While there is no proof that they've totally fabricated the result (I wouldn't even exclude that) they have admitted that they've contacted Pre-Sales Investors after the voting was closed - what seems to me as if they didn't like the result previously.   The only scenario that would make all that possible without lies would be:  They had a listing agreement with a top5 exchange already during the ICO, and while other projects have to pay Millions that exchange did not want money from Savedroid. Now the exchange says: ""We have to change our listing policies and until that is done we will not list Savedroid - but others - and while we list not Savedroid but others, it's still save that we'll list Savedroid after the changes are done"".  Doesn't make much sense to me. I also believe it should be known by now if one of the big exchanges needs several weeks to update their listing-policies. Also that is hard to believe - this exchange needs weeks to update the listing-requirements? And Savedroid shouldn't be the only project that is affected by this, but if that is the case (that Savedroid but no other projects are affected) it's hard to understand why the team still claims that listing would be save and for free.  My impression is that the story shifts a little bit from week to week into vagueness. Once they come up with the name of the top 5 it will be possible to see if the given reason (the exchange updates their policies and delays the listing) was true or not. I know how I would place my bet.",False

But the market situation will be very complex no matter on which exchange. A big exchange would probably help but it may not be enough to keep the price. Reasons are:  1) Savedroid doesn't seem to have much support from the Crypto-community and in my opinion there is nothing about this project that will impress Crypto out of several reasons - actually more the opposite. While Crypto-folks are not necessarily the target-group of this project but people who just want to save money in an easy way, the problem for the market-situation will probably be: Those potential users are simply not there yet.  2) The price that was set during the ICO is very high with a marketcap of about $50 million while the total is even higher. Even under best circumstances it wouldn't be easy to keep such a high valuation.  3) The business model seems totally flawed to me. No rational mind will save money by paying a 15% fee first to get money into it, just to pay 15% again if he wants his money back. In such a case there are two scenarios: Such a guy would lose and not save money if the portfolio he buys just keeps its value - and the loss would be significantly: about 30%. If the portfolio would rise in value by about 30% he would not have any profit because fees would take it away. Incentive to use Savedroid? None. If they lower the fees it may be a little better but wouldn't change the problem fundamentally - Savedroid would still be 1) too expensive, or 2) will not burn much SVD. That makes SVD to a bad Investment in both scenarios. Considered that it's ICO-price is on an insane level... it would need irrational and/or uninformed gamblers who buy it.  4) The PR-Stunt was damaging of course and it was damaging in several ways. It frustrated Investors, damaged trust, told a story about the team and in/competence etc.  5) The voting was absolutely not helpful as well. Actually it had a similar effect on Investors, just without big headlines and therefore not much impact on the public.  6) They have no shots left now, shouldn't disappoint again.    There is a scenario that may include a chance and it's mainly about two, maybe three, aspects:  1. They should manage to get this on a big exchange, if that shouldn't realize, disappointment and frustration will be overwhelming and probably have terrible impact on the price.  2. In best case they are able to combine a listing with a good release, something that gives hope and raises more positive attention  3. The market may turn bullish - but that is impossible to predict  But even if... just the high valuation doesn't leave much potential and if impatient guys don't see price potential after a listing they tend to sell. Considered all the points above that may already be enough to drive the valuation down significantly. At least this won't be boring...",False

Every investor should have the possibility to apply for a refund...  I think until now only a small part of the funds has been already spent for project related things, so it should be possible to refund an investor by his application for almost 100% by return of his SVD Tokens.  This is the only honorable and legitimate way to handle this situation.  It would be the proof of a good will and would represent a true excuse by savedroid and its team.

What I would like to know is if they maybe refunded individuals, big pre-sale-Investors who may have more leverage, more legal power and influence. There is no reason to assume that until now, but if and if something like that would come to light, the next shitshow would start immediately.  Credit-Card-Buyers may have a chance, because they don't have the token yet.  But I agree, they should've done it as a choice for all participants, because it would have had a lot of advantages for all sites, while the disadvantage of having less funds is not significant. It would still be about >$20 million if 50% would want a refund. It would have lowered the total supply what would give more price-potential once listed, it would stop the bad mood and complaining, because those who would have made that choice would have left.  But: They should have made that decision right after the PR-Stunt and communicate it smart - in such a scenario they could have turned the bad situation into showing integrity and fairness. If they do it now... it would probably just lead to more bad headlines because it would be considered as a very late admission. And after the delays and the messed up voting maybe/likely even more would make the choice to get the money back.  Btw, regarding the market situation: The situation of credit card buyers is another reason for pessimism. Their tokens will not be mined and given to them until 180 days after payment = 6 months. That means, in about 3 months their supply will reach the exchanges. While that is not a real increase of supply, practically it will be exactly that for the market. Since listing will probably not happen before July there will also not be much time for the price to find a high price until the first Guys are smart enough to anticipate that dynamic as risk and start to sell. And if the price should dump hard before - not much time to recover until CC-buyers send their SVD to exchanges as well.   This team is very consequent in making bad choices.",False

Also, this way, we‚Äôre accepting the personal interests of every token buyer at the same time. One vote for one SVD is also fair in my opinion. Small token buyers are there to max their purchase and that‚Äôs why they want to be in the exchange ASAP. Token buyers with a bigger ticket are typically interested in a good start at the exchange and hence, a portfolio of 5 big exchanges is more appealing to them. Giving 1 SVD = 1 vote, we got our result and we will now execute this Community Voting result!""   No concerns about the zero-transparent-approach?

It's a bit superficial but all right as a first guideline. But the big problem is that Savedroid does not meet such standards and I believe that they may not even really understand that. They have understood that the PR-Stunt was a huge mistake and probably they've also figured that the way they've done the voting was damaging. But there is so much they obviously don't understand and think through. The other possibility is that they intentionally mislead people.   A few examples:  1. Transparency first We put transparency first, we describe in depth the business and token model in a comprehensive prospectus or whitepaper. We inform visibly about the risks.  Besides the fact that they've shown little transparency after their ICO (the voting is a prime-example) I would also not necessarily agree that they've given an in-depth-description of the business model. Maybe they have and in that case Investors are to blame for not thinking through it all. Especially the token-model has to be seen in context of their fee-model and that needs to be seen in context of their business-model which needs to be seen out of customer-perspective. And if somebody takes a deeper look... it doesn't make any sense at all.   2. Serve the Community We respond to community questions, concerns and take-up community feedback. We are part of the entire crypto community and build a trustworthy, reliable crypto ecosystem. We keep the community updated about the status, milestones, (insider) trading and failures without sugarcoating.  Probably they have communicated more and smarter during the ICO but since I pay attention nothing of that is true for Savedroid. Their communication still is terrible in my opinion.   5. Real Token Value We create a token based on a crypto use case with real economic value - not just a speculative bubble. We do not hype or play with the greed of people (no ‚Äúpump ‚Äòn dump‚Äù, ‚ÄúFOMO‚Äù).  That is the most important aspect in my opinion (of course everything needs to be seen in context) and the most hyprocritical one.  1) Use-case, ""real"" economic value and the token / What I said above in numbers: Their use case is to save money. The expected fee is: 15% avg. transaction fee for all Services! And a fraction of the collected Fee in SVD would be burned. Looks good on first sight? No. Who will save money if one action, let's say buying into a Portfolio Savedroid will offer, already takes 15% of the money somebody wants to save? And if such a guy wants to have his money back: Again 15%! Means: The portfolio has to rise about 30% just that such a customer gets the money back he wanted to save. Nobody with an IQ above a cake will do that! And even if the fee would be reduced to 3% it still would be too expensive. Usual exchanges take 0.x% per trade.  Now let's think about the possibility that they will reduce the fee: How much of the token burning will happen then? Near to nothing, because Savedroid will not be an exchange with big guys trading forth and back. Savedroid aims to target small guys who want to save a few Euro's here and there. That will not generate high volume and such guys won't pay a high fee because that contradicts their Intention and Savedroids whole business model. And if they really would want to invest and to trade: They would go to a good exchange. And just btw: There are others who do what Savedroid promises. One example: https://www.revolut.com/de/vaults?lang=en  2) Economic value: They wanted to sell tokens for 60 M Euro. The total value (total supply * price) would be 100 M Euro! That is telling what they believe their ""eco-system"" should be worth, OR: It was intentionally misleading. They've ""only"" sold token for about 40 M Euro. But in which universe is it possible that a token for a usecase that contradicts itself with very high fees be worth more than the whole company? Or does anybody believe that Savedroid is worth about 60 - 100 Million? No way. I believe: Not even 10 Million.   3) Hype or no hype: They say: ""We do not hype or play with the greed of people (...)"" while they have done exactly that. They've announced the top 5 exchange 4 days before their ICO ended. That was with intention. They've even used a price-simulation-chart on their website, and of course, it's a nice chart that only knows the north-direction. They've collected as much money as possible while much bigger projects give themselve a hard cap significantly below sums like that. Binance started with $15 million, NEO also started with about $15 million, Coinlion started with about $7 million. Savedroid needs more money than Ethereum to get their shit done? If they are not able to develop and deliver their goals with $10 million they will not be able to do it with $40 million.  The whole ICO was hype and their messed up PR-Stunt was hype. And the last posts of the Savedroid account: A voting on an exchange is ""Big news"" and an aridrop is ""huge"". Yep, very subtle!   7. Equality We treat every token buyer equally. We do not unfairly privilege big ticket buyers by offering unfair discounts without compensating lock-ups. We prefer buyers that participate in the crypto community and not speculators.  Maybe they've not given big buyers better prices during the ICO. But they've contacted and encouraged pre-sale-Investors to vote for an exchange-option after the voting was officially closed. Besides the fact that they've not acted transparent during or after the voting, what makes it impossible to know if the results are not just made up, that already is a manipulation and it has nothing to do with equality.   8. Enforceable Rights We ensure that the token buyer‚Äôs rights are enforceable. We do not set up offshore entities to avoid regulations but chose jurisdictions with advanced consumer rights protections. We provide an understandable token sale agreement and comply with the regulatory regime.  But what was their answer when many Investors demanded to be refunded after their PR-Stunt? A clear ""No""! They've said that nothing has changed, while they've successfully damaged their credibility, trashed their own reputation, divided the community, delayed pretty much everything etc.    In my opinion these guys should not collect money, should not manage other people's money, should not give advice to others at all. I consider them as hypocritical, arrogant and naive and not able to properly plan what they are talking about. Even without the whole PR-Stunt-and-voting-mess this project already had many red flags before and during the ICO.        ",False

Yassin Hankir does not pause when he talks. The founder of Savedroid, a German payments startup, doesn‚Äôt punctuate his sentences with umms, or aahs: he speaks in declaratives, with clarity and purpose. Only once during our 40-minute discussion does he hesitate significantly, perhaps sensing that in this moment he needs to find the right word. A brief silence, almost as though he‚Äôs conferring, and then he returns with ‚Äúprosecution‚Äú.  Dr. Hankir made global headlines in April when he disappeared from public view, faking an ‚Äòexit scam‚Äô ‚Äì a phenomenon in the virtually-unregulated cryptocurrency world, in which the founders of an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) disappear with the money they raised, leaving investors with no recourse ‚Äì and no cash.  Hankir, whose company raised almost $50M, made sure his intentions were clear: the Savedroid website was replaced with a still image nabbed from South Park, the Telegram account was abandoned, the offices were gutted of equipment ‚Äì and to make sure the message got through, he tweeted a photo of his supposed departure from an airport ‚Äì and subsequent enjoyment of a beer on the beach. The message that accompanied the tweet? ‚ÄúThanks guys. Over and out.‚Äù   Frustration, Anger, Action, Apology  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sorry‚Äù says Hankir, several times during our talk. ‚ÄúWe need to apologize for the action we took; since it was very spontaneous we didn‚Äôt think through all the consequences and we gave people a very hard time, our ICO investors‚Ä¶ and we are sorry.‚Äù  Hankir did not fit the bill for an exit scam. A public figure who speaks at conferences, and who built a strong community around his ICO, he has both an academic and business background that suggests strong credibility. The product itself ‚Äì Savedroid‚Äôs payment system for converting fiat to cryptocurrency, designed for simplicity and mass adoption ‚Äì seemed to be adhering to the roadmap, and has been under development for three years.  Hankir‚Äôs account of the run-up to his stunt does not seem practiced or forced. We spend some time discussing the Savedroid app, which has some novel features for saving ‚Äì some suggested by the community. The app will transfer micropayments of fiat to crypto based on an IFTTT-type trigger system ‚Äì for instance, it might use geofencing to send a deutsche mark or two when you get to the gym; when you achieve your step goal (monitored by your phone) it might send another one; and when Donald Trump tweets about North Korea, it might send fifty DM to your nuclear bunker fund.  But his voice changes when we move on to the subject of his company‚Äôs ICO. He speaks faster, and is clearly agitated.  ‚ÄúFor the whole time of our ICO, four months, on a daily basis, 24/7, we were exposed to scams,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúScammers duplicating our website‚Ä¶ cloning it‚Ä¶ doing Google ads to drive traffic to them and then changing the [ETH] addresses so that people would buy ‚Äútokens‚Äù, but of course they were really sending their money to some scammer, and then it‚Äôs all gone.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOn Telegram, people doing fake profiles as admins‚Ä¶ some strange guys who wanted to deposit physical cash which of course is for money laundering purposes‚Ä¶ scamming in every direction, trying to rip off your community‚Ä¶ and you realize it‚Äôs like fighting the wind. We warned people in our newsletters, we contacted Google to remove the ads, but you cannot prevent it 100%. You want to protect your community but you cannot, and this was a really frustrating experience.‚Äù  Frustration boiled over into anger, Hankir admits, and this anger ‚Äì plus a healthy dose of self-interest ‚Äì drove the decision to do something about the scamming.  ‚ÄúSo we could say, lucky us, why deal with this any more‚Ä¶ but we decided that the ICO market is not sustainable, the scams create a significant risk to the market. If there is no trust, the whole market will break down. So this is in our own business interest.‚Äù  As Hankir describes it, this is what led to the spontaneous decision to fake an exit scam.   How The ‚ÄòExit Scam‚Äô Looked From Within  ‚ÄúWe went to a city close to Frankfurt, Wiesbaden, about 50 kilometers,‚Äù says Hankir. ‚ÄúWe went to the most prominent startup location and rented a room, and the whole team was there, working on this. It was very spontaneous, there was no planning, we just got in the car and went there and then we took down the website.‚Äù Hankir sent me a link to the co-working location.  ‚ÄúWe had no idea that the story would be picked up ‚Äì in Germany of course, we expected it would be a big topic, but then it was the ‚ÄòStates, and Bloomberg and TechCrunch, and that was not expected.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe whole action took place over 24 hours, and we used this day to work on the communication, to make clear what the point was, and what a solution could look like.‚Äù  I asked Hankir about the two photographs in the tweet, and how he reacted to the fact that Crypto Briefing journalist Adam Selene had located the resort pictured in the second photo.    Yassin Hankir  Founder, Savedroid     ‚ÄúAt the end, we did not manage to get our message across.This was very badly done, and we understood that fairly fast, and the way the action was carried out was not appropriate. Now, a few weeks past, people are able to have a fact-based discussion about the future and what could be done differently in the market.‚Äù  The reaction to Hankir‚Äôs spontaneous protest over ICO scammers was profound and immediate. When Crypto Briefing published the location of the resort where Hankir had stayed (and was presumed by many to be staying at the time of the stunt) volunteers in Egypt from our Telegram group began contacting local authorities; random threats of violence against Hankir were immediately banned, but the more specific ones were kept ‚Äì just in case:  ‚ÄúI lost around $70k‚Äù, said one Telegram commentator. ‚ÄúWith $70k I can hire 10 Hitmans [sic.]‚Äù  Another suggested that ‚ÄúI am -15k because of this ugly turk‚Äù and ‚ÄúI can come from Bulgaria and kill this motherfucker.‚Äù  Hankir himself was visited by the Frankfurt police:  ‚ÄúOne person filed a complaint on that night. Then the prosecution has to initiate an investigation. And the police check by your office and see if there is any real cause ‚Äì and we got visited by the police, and they found yes we were here, we were working, and so it was just one office visit and the outcome was very clear, so the thing has been closed down.‚Äù  As to the impact on Savedroid‚Äôs reputation and success ‚Äì that may never be quantifiable. The SVD token is not currently listed on exchanges, although the website claims it will be soon. In the Google App store, Savedroid has over 100,000 installs ‚Äì but the dominant comments concern the exit scam stunt, and it‚Äôs hard to imagine that this conveys the trust that Hankir so covets.   So What Was The Point?  ‚ÄúWe are not the messiahs‚Äù, explains Yassin Hankir. He wants the world to know that he‚Äôs sorry, deeply sorry‚Ä¶ but his apologies are immediately followed by justifications.  And that‚Äôs where there‚Äôs a disconnect in our interview. Sorry, but‚Ä¶  Hankir is not sorry for trying to create awareness that the ICO world is full of scammers and driven by short-term financial gain. He‚Äôs not sorry, in my opinion, that he took this action at all.  He‚Äôs sorry that we didn‚Äôt hear or understand.  It‚Äôs the one aspect of the interview that continues to disturb me. He has a noble cause, but I come away from this discussion with a sense that he believes, deep down, that the end justifies the means. Which has a somewhat messianic ring to it, after all.  To be fair, the message that he has now made clear is one that the cryptocurrency industry needs to hear. An implosion of value is, Hankir believes, virtually guaranteed if market participants can‚Äôt begin to examine their motives and methods, and adjust to fit a more normalized market model.  ‚ÄúWe are a small startup, we cannot change the market,‚Äù says Hankir. But he is trying to lead by example ‚Äì holding live Ask-Me-Anything (AMA) sessions for two hours every few weeks, inviting his constituents and stakeholders to the office, enabling community voting on certain key decisions. And of course, building the due diligence checklist he announced in his ‚ÄúNot An Exit Scam‚Äù video.  The responsibility for safer ICO participation, he believes, lies with the potential investors as well as the founders of the team. ‚ÄúPeople expect 5x or 10x and this is unrealistic, and they need to invest 10 minutes into looking at a whitepaper, and doing some diligence to come to a better investment decision.‚Äù  Of course these sentiments are admirable and, by any reasonable standard, correct. Words and actions are seldom perfectly synchronized, however‚Ä¶ this ‚Äòtoken price simulation‚Äô is directly from Savedroid‚Äôs ICO website. Regarding the ICO model, Hankir is concerned the external regulation will kill the crowdfunding model unless the industry begins to take responsibility for its own sustainability. He believes that only the creation of a self-policing entity, some kind of centralized certification organization for ICOs, will curb the excesses of the market.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs binary,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like 3.4 or 4.2 out of 5‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs one or zero. So either you get it [the certification] or you don‚Äôt get it. Once you get this, if the good quality ICOs are getting it, why is the scam ICO not getting it? And that will make investors ask questions.‚Äù  Was It Worth It?  In the final analysis, it‚Äôs clear that Hankir has reflected on these events, and that he is both remorseful about the anxiety he caused his investors, and distressed by the fact that the message he sought to spread was not the focus of the coverage.  Between the lines, however, there are interesting choices of language in Hankir‚Äôs interview. Every description of the fake exit scam is as an ‚Äòaction‚Äô. Never a stunt, never a public relations exercise, always an ‚Äòaction‚Äô. Someone, it might be inferred, has taken some serious legal advice.  I can‚Äôt blame him. The prank was childish, and harmful. As Adam Selene commented to Business Insider‚Äôs Zoe Bernard, ‚ÄúThis is not monopoly money, [Savedroid‚Äôs investors] are real people. People were panicking on Telegram. This is not funny.‚Äù   But the message ‚Äì which Hankir continues to push ‚Äì is on-point and worth hearing.  ‚ÄúThe action itself, I fully admit I have to apologize, it has not been the right way to communicate ‚Äì but we stick to our message that the market is way too scammy, and this needs to change or it will be unsustainable.‚Äù  It‚Äôs hard to disagree. And hey, here we are, spreading that message. Maybe it DID work, albeit with a delayed reaction?  Meanwhile, Hankir wants to get on with building his company and his product. Yassin Hankir isn‚Äôt just the guy who pulled a silly fake exit scam; he‚Äôs someone who‚Äôs advocating for a business model that many of us have found to be exciting, inclusive, and rewarding.  Maybe we should give him a mulligan‚Ä¶ and accept his apology.  ‚ÄúI just want to duck below the table and say, okay, please don‚Äôt be mad at us.‚Äù  And although these parting words may represent some wishful thinking, I‚Äôm personally ready to move on.    https://cryptobriefing.com/yassin-hankir-savedroid-exit-scams-ico/",False

See, I really don't want to assume that you guys are dishonest but I've learned in Crypto to consider ""everything"". That's not even meant personally and also not in regards only to this project, but maybe a sign for the principle that spreading doubts (PR-Stunt) can be like a virus while restoring trust is not that easy. If my considerations should turn out as false and you guys as honest regarding the exchange-subject the chance is good that it will be possible.  By the way: I'm not invested but 1) If I was and 2) in case the given info about the top5-exchange is true and there will be no further delay, I would vote for waiting for the top5-exchange. The reason is this: In case SVD starts trading as soon as possible on low-liquidity/volume-exchanges the probability of a dropping price is likely to increase. Those who may have lost trust would be likely to sell and others might panic because of that. I believe the price will probably reflect uncertainty in general and the community shows a lot of signs of impatience. Usually that is a sign of a lack of experience what may lead into an even more sensitive situation on the market. On the other hand: If listed on all exchanges, including a bigger one, at the same day: That would restore trust and decrease uncertainty and the time from now until then could be used to restore trust as well - if done right. But the opposite is also true.  It's an interesting situation because it's a totally psychological one. But... in case your impression might be that I wish this project any harm, that's not the case. I just still believe it would have been right to give choice regarding refunds.",False

His answer is this - german original:  ""Wir haben kurz vor dem ICO 1,5 Millionen Euro Eigenkapital von Investoren eingesammelt. Insgesamt haben wir nun 3,5 Millionen Euro Eigenkapital bekommen. Mit dem ICO konnten wir gleichzeitig eine neue Nutzergruppe auf uns aufmerksam machen, schlie√ülich wollen wir mit dem Kapital eine Plattform zum Sparen in Kryptow√§hrungen aufbauen. Die Zielgruppe ist eine ganz andere. Aktuell haben wir etwa gleich viele weibliche und m√§nnliche Kunden, die zwischen 18 bis 40 Jahre alt sind, sehr konsumfixiert sind und sehr schlecht mit Finanzen umgehen k√∂nnen. Die Mitglieder der Krypto-Szene sind √§lter, sehr technologieaffin und zu 95 Prozent m√§nnlich.""   In english: He explains that they've collected 1.5 mln EUR before the ICO selling real shares and that they got 3.5 mln EUR in summary. The interesting part is:  ""Due to the ICO we were able to get the attention of a new user/target group, since we want to develop a money-savings-platform in Crypto. The (this) target group is very different (...)""  Why I point on this is: Actually he says that the ICO itself was about marketing/PR, to get attention in the Crypto space and more users for the App under the line. It's not what I'm critical about per se. But good projects always try to create win-win-situations. To do that it's about the whole context and exactly that is totally distorted when it's about Savedroid:    Purpose of the token:  Utility tokens were invented by decentralized networks and have two or even three purposes: 1. Financial incentive to secure a decentralized network (mining for example). 2. Payment for services / Fees 3. Sometimes Utility tokens are also government tokens   SVD is about two: Payment for services / Fees. But:  1) That would not just be possible but much easier to do without the token at all, just to collect fees in whatever Currency they may offer in future.  2) He says that they want to develop a savings-App for Crypto. The offered service would be about helping Users to put money aside using algorithms that initiate automated transactions which follow some fancy rules - like whenever Trump pushes something out on Twitter, money is transferred from User-Address 1 to Adress 2 (savings-address). The problem with that is: It's a total contradiction in itself because each transaction costs fees. If somebody wants to put money aside he does exactly that, but he doesn't pay for unnecessary transactions that cost money having less money as result. How does it help anybody to save money if the whole business idea is about tricking the mind into tiny transaction that cost a lot of money under the line?  3) To do that Savedroid needs control about the used addresses. It's not possible to make automated transactions (or any transaction) from an address without having the private keys. That means: A user additionally pays to keep the money he wants to put aside in an online environment (unsecure) and to give up control about his private keys ---> money (unsecure!!!). Result: Savedroid-Users would pay for having less control and weaker security.  4) Economics of the ICO: They've believed it would be good to have a total supply of 10 bn tokens at a price of 0.01 EUR each. That makes obvious what they believe or want to make others to believe how valuable their economical system is or will be: 100 million EUR = 129 million Dollar. They wanted to sell 6 bn tokens but sold less while the exact numbers are nowhere to find. At least I didn't find them. But it's said they got about $50 mln. That is insane in itself. There are much better projects who not just didn't get that much money but didn't even ask for so much money because they know they don't need it. ICO's with experienced teams can be very attractive because they simply act honest and rational, also and especially when it's about the economics. That gives room once a token hits the exchange. But Savedroid took all the money they could get, leaving not much or even no room but a lot of potential that this could really sink like a stone. Experienced Guys would have stepped back only seeing the economical design.      Marketing   Considered the context above (and sure: nobody needs to agree with my view on it) Savedroid has showed real commitment only in two aspects:  1) Creating a buzz, using everything for marketing 2) selling as much of their token to a ridiculous high price   Yassir now apologizes but in my opinion that is more in regards to the german Fintech-Community. If it was about their Crypto-Investors this apology can not be considered as honest, because otherwise he would have agreed to refund those who want get out. It's not possible to honestly admit ""I have done something wrong"" while saying ""No, actually I don't want to repair the situation for those who are likely pay the bill"".  And actually that's not just a mistake others are likely to suffer from. It's also not good for the project itself to start with such a high token valuation. They wouldn't ever need so much money to start. Software Development is not about building tons of infrastructure. They undermine their own credibility with that as well. Even without the PR-disaster Savedroid has to be seen as a hype-project without any interesting fundamentals. I personally see no potential at all because there are contradictions on all important aspects.  Plus: They've pushed themselves into a very bad position. Yes, they are millionairs now but that comes along with a lot of pressure. I consider it as a safe bet that no one of the team is happier now than he/she was before they've pulled of this ICO and especially their PR-Stunt. They will earn pressure each and every day and that will cut between them and their own Community while there is only one connecting aspect: The lack of experience. Team and their Investors seem to have that in common.    And just btw: Those who bought with Credit Card are the ones who are really fucked in this game.  Reason number 1: They have to wait 180 days after the payment was made until they will be able just to move their tokens Reason number 2: Once they can it will be about significant supply flooding the markets and others will anticipate that. Just imagine you hold SVD and you know: ""In three days first Credit Card buyers will be able to move and therefore to sell their tokens"". What would you do? More supply flooding the market means pressure on the price and because ppl will anticipate that, the price is likely to tank some time before.   Another interesting point of the Interview:  The Interviewer calculates:  ""You speak of 200,000 App-Downloads but you don't give numbers about actual Users. Marketing-Experts expect that only 20% really use an App after downloading it. Therefore you would only have 40,000 Users. (...)""  The interesting part is: Yassier doesn't reject that. He answers that it typically needs some time to get new users and more attention and so on. And yeah, that's probably true. But what he can't say there is, that it's also about trust. And besides everything else which I personally totally dislike: They've targeted trust with their PR-Kamikaze.  Plus: Their business model didn't work that well with Fiat until now while that actually makes much more sense, because it's not that much about security like in Crypto and it wasn't about high fees yet (or any fees).   What he says about exchanges:  ""At the moment we're coordinating the trading-start of our token so that it will start at the same day on all exchanges. It should start in a few weeks.""  Original: ""Im Moment koordinieren wir den Handelsstart unserer Token, sodass dieser f√ºr alle Krypto-B√∂rsen auf den gleichen Tag f√§llt. In wenigen Wochen soll es so weit sein.""   If that quote is correct it doesn't seem to be about hitting exchanges ""end of april or early may"" anymore, but about weeks.  If so, the question would be why...?  My guess is: Exchanges backed off after their PR-Stunt, but of course, I can't know that for sure.   What he speaks else about is that they will put some effort in becoming better... also regarding communication etc. To read the whole interview in english Google Translator might be helfpul.    I don't even want to blame Savedroid for everything because in my opinion everybody should show some self-responsibility and think about projects and potential Investments. What I'm really eager to see is the due-diligence-list Savedroid has promised to put out, to help people to invest in a rational way. Because they'll find themselves in another paradox:  If that due-diligence-list should be high quality, it would have ruled out their own project. It will have to be superficial not to do that.",False

They want to make a voting, if I understood it right it will be this way:  Investors can vote on:  Option 1: To list the Token as soon as possible (within days) on the smaller exchanges that are listed on the webpage and the bigger listing would follow once ready.  Option 2: To wait for the Top5-exchange to get the token listed on all exchanges at the same day.

I can't know it but something doesn't add up. To make it as short as possible:  Given reason why it needs more time to get SVD listed on that exchange is, quoting tobson2 - telegram:  ""(...) the exchange decided to update it's listing policy in the next weeks, so it might take more time than expected to get started""  Yassir also said that during the AMA and even explicitly added that this exchange wants to raise their listing standards to assure a higher quality.    Some things to consider:  1) The top 5 exchange was initially announced on March 5 and communicated as ""secured"": ‚ÄúSecuring a second well-known exchange shows that SVD is an attractive token for the large crypto exchanges. This allows us to create trading opportunities for token buyers on the best exchanges, which is good for liquidity. ‚Äú says Dr. Yassin Hankir, founder and CEO of savedroid.  2) The last AMA was 14 days ago but this explanation is new, what means, if the given explanation is true: This certain exchange made the decision to change their policy and to raise their standards and to delay the listing of SVD during the last two weeks, or Yassir didn't communicate that while it already was known (unlikely).  3) If that exchange was already secured in early March, why would a change of policy should have any effect on Savedroid now? Why is it necessary that Savedroid has to meet the new requirements?    4) Most important and the key question: If this certain exchange has to delay the listing of SVD because they change their listing-policies to raise their own standards, how can the Savedroid-Team still be totally sure that it will just be a delay but not a rejection? How can they know that they'll meet these new requirements?  5) On Twitter it's visible that not one of the top5-exchanges shows an interruption when it's about listings.   With other words: This scenario can only be the whole truth if the announcement in March wasn't as safe as it was communicated since Savedroid will have to meet the new requirements/higher listing standards now. And a delay only makes sense if it's not safe that Savedroid will meet those new requirements. But if it's not safe it's not honest to communicate it as ""just a delay"".   I can't know it but this whole explanation doesn't make that much sense in my opinion and I wouldn't be surprised if it's just about buying time and if there would be an explanation in a few weeks, like ""damn, they've raised the quality standards too high and now they want to have so much money, we will need more time"". By the way: Tobson2 confirmed on a question that they didn't have to pay at all to get that listing and also that the exchange didn't back off because of their PR-Stunt - but now they have to meet new requirements. I really don't get the logic here...",False

You can imagine it this way: It's normal that at least some ICO-Investors sell (impatience etc.). If there is not enough attention and liquidity to catch that even a few guys selling can push the price down significantly.  And it's not just about liquidity, but also about the psychologics.

If asked for an exact date for the AMA the answer is: ""There is no exact date as of this moment. We will provide more information this week. Thank you for your patience.""  There will also be their Barbecue on Wednesday in Frankfurt (ICO-participants are invited) which was announced right after they showed up again after their Fake-Exit-Scam.   The pressuring topics are:  1) Something went wrong with the token distribution. Some Investors obviously got significant more because of double-transactions (or even triple or whatever). For more infos they again point on the coming AMA and obviously it's a topic they would like to hide because they've burried that info on reddit while tried not to talk about it on platforms with more attention and activity.  2) It was said exchange listing would be end of April or early May. Obviously that didn't happen, for more infos... AMA   So, let's try it with some logical scenarios to think about what they eventually communicate without saying anything at all:   First: If they would plan to do the AMA today or tomorrow they would know that already and there wouldn't be any reason not to communicate it. Actually it would likely to be the opposite. Especially in the current heated up situation it would be smart to get all positive infos out as soon as possible, simply to cool down the mood and to avoid a shitshow during their real meeting on Wednesday/Barbecue. That they don't give an exact date for the AMA could mean: They don't know it yet themselves. That would be a bit odd, because an AMA is something that is 100% under their own control. So why not give an exact date already? Maybe: They are waiting for something that didn't happen yet. Could be that there are more uncertainties about the exchange situation or/and that they still didn't figure out a good way how to handle the false transactions or something else.  Again: It would be rational to come up with something positive before (and especially because of) the Barbecue.   What would be a nice twist: If they do the AMA during the Barbecue-meeting. Actually that would be a perfect scenario: A real meeting with Community-Members and a Live-Show on YouTube for those who can not attend personally for example. A team that would have good news would probably do something like that, also because it's safe to say that questions will come anyway. Maybe they think about such a possibility, but if - they're uncertain. Otherwise they would have announced it already. That's why I don't believe they'll do that.  Actually I believe that they are scared about the Barbecue and would like to call it off. They've announced that with some naivety before they knew how bad the feedback on their PR-Stunt would be and before they knew that they would do additional mistakes (erroneous SVD-transactions). And the exchange situation is also not solved yet. Probably they are concerned about the possibility that some who may show up there won't come with ""party-mood"" but more with a ""let's roast Savedroid - Intention"". That's why I'm surprised even more why they seem not to be able to come up with positive infos before.   Under the line it's not likely that the AMA will be today or tomorrow or Wednesday. My guess is: After the Barbecue - end of the week. If it should turn out to be that way it wouldn't be a good sign in my opinion, because again: It would be stupid to hold back good news if there are good news. My impression is more the opposite. They play on time because there are no good news.   At least the situation is not boring at all...  When exchange Which exchange When moon When lambo ;-)   ______________________  Edit: They've just announced that the AMA will be tomorrow:  https://twitter.com/savedroidAG/status/993424202458894337",False

The biggest task is to find a good solution between easy-to-use and high-security. It's the latter that concerns me when it's about Savedroid (actually it doesn't concern me personally because I won't use it). Thing is: The business-model of Savedroid was to help people putting money aside. In the Fiat-world it doesn't matter so much if you have money on this or that bank-account. But translated into Crypto there are several differences and difficulties:  1) Experienced Crypto-Users wouldn't ever store Crypto-Assets as savings in an online environment. That would be similar to having it on an exchange-account  2) It's the other way around: Crypto-Assets ""should"" be stored in a cold fashion what means: Not just should never ever anybody else have control over the own private keys but in best case (most secure) those PK's shouldn't touch an online device until the user wants to transact  3) If I get it right: Savedroid will have control over the private keys and of course it's not a cold-storage-service  4) The Savedroid-Guys are not experienced in Crypto themselves  5) Under the line: Users will have to pay fees to put money aside (doesn't make that much sense) and to give away control about it. Very true is this saying in Crypto: Who has control over the private keys owns the money.  6) Competitors are better and there are many.   Under the line there is not much incentive to use Savedroid at all, and even if: It's unlikely that they'll be superior to projects who basically do the same, but without all the fancy stuff (unnecessary transactions whenever trump tweets etc.) and focused on what matters: Security and easy to use. Actually I don't even get how Savedroid was able to market themselves as ""we want to simplify"" because that is not what they do. Their own token is not necessary but adds complexity. All the ""AI-transactions"" (if....happens...transact...amount x to..) add complexity and are not necessary. Question really is what is left?   And what already is obvious, even if we don't think about their silly PR-Stunt anymore. They are not ready for Crypto yet, overwhelmed by the tech and communication, don't know how to build and treat their own community etc. Just one example: This is on reddit today:  Currently investigating a minting issue, relevant for <1% of all tokens. Will announce details and solution in the next AMA before trading start. https://www.reddit.com/r/savedroid_ico/comments/8goxr6/currently_investigating_a_minting_issue_relevant/  That seems to be all what they are saying about that subject and it's a weird choice to put that on reddit which is a desert for the project - near to zero activity, while not saying it anywhere else I would know of. But they used a megaphone to demand the whole space to be more transparent and that it would need higher ICO-Standards etc. I don't see any sign that they meet any of that themselves.",False

I'll reply on your post a bit different. Your quotes in bold.   What could have been stolen in that moment is all the money which is not covered by an escrow, which is at least still enough for a CEO to survive for a long time. Besides that the escrow only holds the money until all tokens are minted, so it's more our call when we've finished it.  The problem is that you guys would have run into a contradiction that leads to confusion (and all kinds of other side-effects) in any case, which should have made you calling that off. What I mean is this:  Theoretical Scenario 1 - 100% in escrow: You do your PR stunt and then you call for better ICO-standards (which include escrow of course). But at least part of your delivered message was, that you‚Äôve even done an exit-scam despite having escrows. Since nothing was so powerful like the first message you‚Äôve done damage to a security measure you try to preach now.  Theoretical Scenario 2 - 0% in escrow: You do your PR-Stunt and what Yassir said would have been true (could have stolen all funds), and then call for high ICO-standards. In that case the contradiction would be that you have not met the high standards in your ICO you are demanding others to meet.  Executed Scenario: What you did is a mixture of both. Some was in escrow, other money wasn‚Äôt (as far as I know it was especially FIAT that was not under escrow what would add another contradiction). That makes what he said in his video a) untrue (would have been easy to steal ALL funds) and b) it also contradicts the call for higher ICO-standards because obviously you have not totally met them yourself.  Most important is c) What you‚Äôve left behind is just a lot of confusion and anger, also because you can not control how this case was and is reported and how it will be reported in future, how individuals interpret it and to what conclusions they come. You seem to expect mostly rational interpretation but that itself is not a rational expectation.   No that would not be fair, because the product plan is still valid, the token economics didn't change at all.  1) You‚Äôve damaged your own reputation. One of the biggest issues here is that even the purpose and goal of your project is to manage other peoples money. You didn‚Äôt just undermine the trust of your Investors but also already existing and potentially future customers.  2) To promote your coming ICO-advisory-service you‚Äôve used the imbalance of power between you and your Investors. That‚Äôs why I use the word ‚Äûhostage‚Äú, because they couldn‚Äôt and still can‚Äôt do anything. And you do that while they didn‚Äôt buy this Savedroid-plan to become ICO-advisors. They‚Äôve bought into what you‚Äôve promised to develop.  3) ICO-Investors have to face all kinds of risks, buying into all kinds of scams for example. But also  the risk that a team simply is not good enough to deliver in some or all ways. And of course: All teams, even the best ones, make mistakes. That‚Äôs natural. So, let‚Äôs call your stunt a mistake‚Ä¶ but at least I can‚Äôt see it as natural because it was intentionally and targeted own Investors, Supporters and Clients and the whole usecase and targets the only fundamental value that backs all others: Trust   No I would not agree to that  You can see the ‚ÄûSavedroid is a scam headlines‚Äú, you can see ‚ÄûSavedroid has executed the most stupid PR-stunt ever‚Äú whenever you google your own company. You can see comments of own Supporters and Investors on all social platform your project is represented, which clearly show that many have lost trust - but you don‚Äôt agree that a damage of trust and credibility is the case. I hope for you guys that you‚Äôre just dishonest.   The investors have bought the tokens, as already mentioned the token economics and the product roadmap didn't change at all. Buying a token is NOT buying the full savedroid company.  Of course not. But if the existing team would do advisory service: It is not what your Investors bought into. If you should finance this new advisory service with the money you‚Äôve raised: The money wasn‚Äôt meant for that. Plus: The trust issue that was caused due to an egomaniac but still intentionally PR-show.   That's our hypotheses, noone can of course predict the future.  Yassir said in the interview (about the price risk because of the stunt): ‚ÄûI don‚Äôt see it that way, otherwise we wouldn‚Äôt have done it. It was a crucial criterium for that action.‚Äú. That implies that you guys were totally sure that it will have no negative impact on the price, because & obviously: You  have  done   it. Now you say: Of course, no one can predict the future.  Don‚Äôt you recognize the contradiction? If you (and your team) would have come to the insight of unpredictability before the stunt - you wouldn‚Äôt have done it or what Yassir said was just a lie and you simply didn‚Äôt care. Both conclusions are not in your favor.   No we didn't expect that somone harms himself as that also didn't happen in previous real scams. We've investigated these scams a lot and checked what happened there. Besides that I hope that never anyone will invest so much money, that it's worse harming himself, neither for a scam, nor when a token-price drops which is not unlikely in this high-risk market.  Suicides because of fraud and huge financial losses happened, it's just not that easy to identify:  Financial Loss and Suicide https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3431736/  About MMM:  ""This led to wide spread panic in the nation and even attempted suicides.[8] On December 14, LASEMA (Lagos State Emergency Management Agency) of Lagos State pleaded with Lagosians to dial their emergency number if they spot anyone trying to commit suicide. LASEMA took this action due to the number of suicides MMM caused in Russia[9]"" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMM_Global   Thing is: It would be irrational to assume that it didn‚Äôt happen just because you were not able to find articles about it. Those who have lost somebody because of such a situation have other problems than to run to the media to make it public.  It‚Äôs a simple thought: If you have >30k Investors you always have at least some who invested too much, in opposite to your ‚ÄûI hope that never anyone will invest so much money, that it's worse harming himself (‚Ä¶)‚Äú. More important: When it‚Äôs about thousands of people it‚Äôs stastitically safe to say that there will be some who may have psychological problems, like depression, are in all kinds of individual situations that may have additional effect.  That you guys took that risk, besides all others, leads me even more to the conclusion that you are not the right ones to teach anybody else about anything, because you didn‚Äôt think through the most important aspects and risks related to your stunt, or if, only superficially.   Of course some people will distanciate from us, especially the ones which have a motivation that the current status quo stays intact and no questions about that are asked.  That is a not very subtle accusation to critiques and I consider it as a cheap excuse and probably even self-deception. If you don‚Äôt get why Savedroid is roasted that hard you must still be in the egomaniac fish-bowl that made it possible to believe in your ‚Äûgenius‚Äú plan and to perform it.  Let me tell you why many distances themselves: Because you‚Äôve damaged the only real value which is trust/reliability/credibility.  Another thing you guys obviously never have thought about: A community is not only valuable as money-givers. They are the ones who would be your marketing-base, those who explain your project and it‚Äôs goals to others. No project, no matter which kind, can have success without what is called network-effect. Kill that and you kill your project. Now take a look at those who try to defend you. Not many are left and those who are can‚Äôt explain anything because nothing really makes sense to them. They are just kind of forgiving or too unexperienced to understand the problem or trapped in a stockholm-syndrome-status because their money is still locked and they hope for some kind of happy end (good price to get out). Take a look at your telegram-channel. You‚Äôve successfully pushed the smarter minds out and what is left are ‚Äûmoon-kids‚Äú (when exchange, which exchange, when moon, when lambo).  We're surprised be the feedback of the FinTech-community, as this PR-stunt was not related at all to FinTech and only a critic at the crypto-scene.  Yeah, what a surprise. You, as a Fintech company, were not able to hit the target more precisely. But you really don‚Äôt understand their critique? You want to be something like a Crypto-Fiat-bank, you raise money, you trash all trust‚Ä¶ what the hell did you expect? Applause? (more a rhetorical question). They must be embarrassed because you have achieved one thing: International headlines. Now they are scared that may have impact on their credibility as well because they understand one thing: Trust is only partially a rational result but more about subtle and often unconsciously impressions. You know the value of the ‚Äûmade in Germany - brand‚Äú - you use it yourself for the ‚ÄûICO-advisory coming soon‚Äú. Just turn that into it‚Äôs opposite and you understand the problem and why they are mad.   Of course we think about the brand, but don't think it'll have a long-term impact and the content at the end will survive.  Ok. Good luck by deleting Google, Reddit, Bitcointalk, etc. Hard to believe that you‚Äôll ever make equally powerful headlines in a positive way to heal that. And to believe that you‚Äôll make a change when it‚Äôs about your new goals to make this space ‚Äûmore sustainable‚Äú‚Ä¶ you really have to wake up and stop your self-hypnosis.  And just btw: It‚Äôs always said that Crypto is so plagued by all kinds of fraud and shadiness, and yes, that is true. But the impression also results out of the fact that Crypto is more transparent. Things become more and faster visible. There is no lack of fraud in the established system as well. Main difference is that established systems already have all kinds of mechanisms to keep things more hidden. Regulation can even be part of that, because it can be deceptive (‚Äûit‚Äôs regulated, nothing to see here‚Äú)    The communication was definitely not ideal and has to be improved, totally agree on that.  See, everything what is expressed is communication under the line. That even includes ‚Äûa lack of‚Äú at the wrong time, because also that is interpreted. And communication is not just about ‚Äûwhat‚Äú but also about ‚Äûhow‚Äú and intensity, context and timing and even if done near to perfect, there are unknowns because everything is interpreted subjectively by individuals. Your PR-Stunt was ‚Äûhigh-intensity-communication‚Äú on a very deep psychological level and included a lot of unintended aspects you didn‚Äôt even think about. Since that action you have to face all kinds of reactions you would have to analyze deeply to come to good conclusions. And that is simply not possible for you because you‚Äôve caused psychological complexity you can‚Äôt fully understand. If you could, you wouldn‚Äôt have done it.  Experience will teach you guys more humility. That‚Äôs also why I believe you should refund those who would choose that option, because at the moment you make them pay for the lesson you need, while the lesson you‚Äôve given was very simple:  Misuse an imbalance of power to push those who can‚Äôt even react but put trust in you into disillusionment and humiliate them and you get what you get - Isolation. Even supportive posts show that.    Think through it on a psychological level and always think it into extreme scenarios, which is a method to make it more obvious/recognizable. You‚Äôll see that you‚Äôve done nothing of value but the opposite: You‚Äôve performed an attack on value. Psychologically that is like breaking a natural law and when it‚Äôs about human topics (which are relations under the line), psychology is natural law.   Not that I'm aware of  Surprising. I would have believed that many call their lawyers and that especially those who hold equity in your company might have some leverage to sue. But my knowledge about legal stuff is limited.   That's definitely not true and we're already in contact with our legal department about these false statements. savedroid has NEVER sold or tried to sell user-data!  Ok, good to know (if true). See, I‚Äôm nobody who wants to assume the worst in others. But even I always recognize, whatever I read of you or others of your team: Very hard to believe in anything. And I don‚Äôt even have a horse in this race.",False

It‚Äôs a combination of what I know about exchanges in general and given informations from and about Savedroid. It will not be totally accurate or a safe prediction. I think in probabilites. But it is realistic and with some tendency to be likely in my opinion.   Background about the Savedroid-situation:   Information: Yassin Hankir said in the AMA that many exchanges demand high amounts of money for a listing, up to or even above $1 million. He also said about the announced top 5 exchange that he can‚Äôt say anything about it, because it‚Äôs under NDA.  And yes, it is true that at least some Exchanges sell listings for high amounts and also NDA‚Äôs during negotiations are common. They don‚Äôt like it to be public but it‚Äôs also not a secret. Btw, usually also projects don‚Äôt talk about bought listings. That he did and what his intention might be, ‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs get back to that later.   In this post I‚Äôve already pointed on the fact that they‚Äôve used the announcement of a top 5 exchange to hype their ICO, to give it a last push 4 days before it ended:  savedroid ICO: SVD Token will be traded on top 5 exchange https://medium.com/@ico_8796/savedroid-ico-svd-token-will-be-traded-on-top-5-exchange-f45a453ca3ef  Sidenote: They have used everything they could think of to hype the shit out of the ICO. That‚Äôs visible everywhere. I mention that because it shows that they are not just greedy but also unexperienced/stupid/careless. There are several good reasons why legit teams don‚Äôt do that, rational reasons - not about idealism or whatever. But, I don‚Äôt want to write a book about that, so, back to topic:   A potential scenario regarding the exchange-situation:  They‚Äôve started negotiations with such an exchange or probably asked all of the bigger ones during the ICO. It could have started with a simple question if there would be a way to get listed, if yes how much it would cost etc. But it‚Äôs not likely that anything was finalized. More likely is a Memorandum of understanding and that Savedroid had a financial strategy that could have looked like this:  - we are four days before the end of the ICO - we already know that we have raised many millions - we would have to pay xxxx Dollar for a listing - since such an announcement is likely to give the ICO a last big push it would be beneficial to do it. Maybe it would not only pay for itself but even lead to much more money, plus: the market situation after the ICO would be better with a good listing (not even sure if they are capable to think more than just superficially about market-dynamics and potential effects)  Good exchange-listings have multiple, especially several psychological, effects. So there might be some probability that it seemed to be a good decision to come to an agreement, that they would pay for a listing. And that may have given them the option to announce a top 5 exchange. Why it is unlikely that anything was finalized at that time: They were not able to pay and are still not able to do that.  There are two other possibilities:  1) The top 5 announcement was a lie. I don‚Äôt want to say that this scenario is likely but it‚Äôs not impossible. Reason: Since they don‚Äôt say which exchange they also wouldn‚Äôt have to be too scared that any of them would dispute, while such an announcement is safe to bring in more money.  2) That there is not even some kind of agreement, that they just thought: ""Yes, we‚Äôll pay what they told us"" but without that the exchange already agreed.    Situation now - after the PR-Stunt   Important in that context is that there is a new situation now, that is unlikely to have no consequences. Potentially there are at least two important kinds of bad consequences:  They‚Äôve successfully burned down their own credibility. What I can read out of the german media-echo is: They are toxic now. Even payment and banking (those who gave them the award and revoked it after the ‚ÄûExit-Scam-Prank‚Äú) destroy Savedroid now publicly, brand them as snakeoil, not credible, buggy software and so on. Their reason to do so: Probably they want to come clean now and burn all bridges to Savedroid. And of course one can be critical about that move, but if focused only on facts, the given information in that article are true in my opinion. Savedroid is and never was what so many hoped to see in this project.  Another consequence is the financial side. Yassir said in his AMA that especially big Investors would like his PR-Stunt. What he says there between the lines actually is: Big and smart Fintech-Guys see how genius it was, just little and stupid Crypto-Kids still don't get it! But how likely is that? Sure, there is no lack of stupid and/or unexperienced millionaires. Rich guys are not necessarily smarter. But let's stay rational here. It's simply not possible that all of them liked it. I believe it‚Äôs the opposite. It's just that rich guys don‚Äôt write posts here. They call their lawyers. Yassin also said that not all the ICO-money was in Escrow. Savedroid has made contracts with individual Investors, maybe even with individual conditions. And it‚Äôs very likely that many of those contracts are now under review in law firms to find a way to get the money back. In case of NDA's nothing of that is likely to reach the public. The thing here is: Since lawyers tend to do research instead of taking action in an impulsive way, and they are not in a hurry, Savedroid could be in the bad situation that they don't even now yet what may come on the legal front and how much money they may be forced to give back. I believe he also said that big guys liked it to calm down other big guys who maybe didn't like it while he doesn't even know that until now.  Under the line: It‚Äôs something I can‚Äôt know but they may have to sell back huge amounts. Plus: Many bought into the ICO using Credit Cards. Those guys can reverse transactions (a reason why Savedroid will not give them token until the money is safe).     Now, keep in mind the above - back to the exchange topic:  Savedroid has burned down it‚Äôs own credibility and professional exchanges also have their ‚Äûdue diligence list‚Äú. Of course they want to avoid to list scams and projects that may turn out as that, because that would damage their own credibility. It‚Äôs simply not possible that a serious and professional exchange will just go over this insane PR-Stunt and say ""yeah, great!"" or ""whatever"". Much more likely is that they don‚Äôt want to list Savedroid anymore, or: that they‚Äôve changed the conditions and that a listing would be much more expensive now.  Combine that with Savedroids situation on the legal and financial side, that it‚Äôs likely that they don‚Äôt know yet how much they‚Äôll have to pay back, especially to big Investors and Credit Card Users, and that they don‚Äôt know what costs they will have to spend to clean up the legal side etc. There are many signs, that they are  scared like... #hopefully.  And if this guy here doesn‚Äôt lie, and I believe he tells the truth, this is how Savedroid reacts on guys who want to have their money back:  ""Savedroid has destroyed its own reputation whether or not its an exit scam. I believe the majority of us would like a refund and it is crazy for them to lock tokens for 180 days but only give us a short period of 14 days to refund. Very unfair terms and I will be taking action under the Consumer Protection Act 2015. I have already asked my bank for a refund as Savedroid have acted both unprofessionally and in an incompetetive manner. I am still completely unsure if this was a failed exit scam or if they are buying time to take our money.  I spoke to Tobias (co founder) and he is extremely rude and unprofessional and he said he would send me a bill if I refunded (I mean seriously, what will you do with a bill from Germany??).""  Source: Comment on FB  With other words: There is a reason that they try everything not to refund, because that could lead into a dynamic with a damaging result: That they would be left with legal costs but not that much money any more. Add that they are toxic now ‚Äî> RIP.  Yassin said during the AMA that he doesn‚Äôt agree to payfor a listing while I consider it as highly unlikely that they were able to get an agreement for a top-5-exchange-listing without paying for that. That‚Äôs why I said in my last post:  ‚Äû(‚Ä¶) it might very well be that he is already preparing excuses.‚Äú  But, just for fun: Let‚Äôs assume that I'm wrong and they really were able to secure an agreement for a listing without payment on a big exchange: How likely would it be that this exchange doesn‚Äôt care about their clown-show and doesn't step back?  If you consider that as unlikely you also know in which direction this goes if he says that he doesn‚Äôt want to pay for a listing now.     Some additional words about the legal side:  I can‚Äôt know how deep the trouble is which they are in. But it‚Äôs near to impossible that no Investor has called his lawyer. Probably it‚Äôs about hundreds who did that while Savedroid is maybe not even aware of all of them. What also most likely happened: Investors have written to the escrows, to exchanges, to their bank etc. - all to make pressure to get a refund. Smart guys don‚Äôt want this to be traded, because trading would significantly reduce the chance to get a refund.  I believe that it all will depend on how safe their own legal situation is. I didn‚Äôt check their legal stuff because I don‚Äôt have the competence to come to safe conclusions. But things like that are in a grey area quiet often. That's why I believe that they also have to fight with a lot of unknowns but maybe scary stuff.    What I believe will be the result of this shit-show:  (it‚Äôs speculation of course, because there are too many unknowns to make safe predictions and the situation is not static but vibrant)  1) I believe that several big guys will get their money back. They have some power Crypto-Investors don‚Äôt have - not just because of the legal side. Several of them also may have some influence. Savedroid would be stupid to create even more enemies in the German Fintech-space and risk more bad press. Maybe they‚Äôll just give the money back to those who are influential without much complaining.    2) I believe that Savedroid will do everything not to refund Crypto-Investors and small Investors in general. The reason is simple: If they would agree on that they would have to refund everybody who wants out. And while that would also help those who still would decide to give this a try (because less supply would reduce the risk of dumping later) the Savedroid-ppl want to keep the money of course. And they couldn‚Äôt know how many would want to be refunded if they would agree on that possibility. They could lose $20 millions easily. Since they've already proven to be hypocritical teachers who love to educate others about greed it's a safe bet that they‚Äôll fight hard to become multi-millionairs. #this-project-will-never-generate-more-money-than-during-their-Hype-ICO  3) I don‚Äôt believe that this will hit a big exchange. Reasons are pointed out above.  4) I don‚Äôt believe that this will not lead to significant losses once traded. Even without PR-stunt‚Ä¶ this is so damn overvalued. It would need some hype just to keep it‚Äôs value, but after a hyped up ICO and a burned down credibility - is there anything left to hype with? Development takes time, right? And how much time was spent on that before their Clown-Show? And now‚Ä¶ exactly!  5) Probably they will put some effort in making ""everyone"" believe that the PR-Stunt also had a lot of positive effects, because they are known now - so much attention! And of course they say that they will keep on with their education, with their message to help this market to become more sustainable and so on. But what should they say else? Admit that they‚Äôve fucked up like no project before while that would directly lead into refunds? Nope‚Ä¶ they won‚Äôt do that.  6) But yes, the scam-brand and the ‚Äûfucking-stupid-idiots-brand‚Äú is nothing they‚Äôll ever overcome. Just check the numbers, how much retweets they get, how much views on FB, how much activity there is on reddit etc. Compare that to their successful stunt! There will also not be much more ‚Äûeducation‚Äú and ‚Äûmessages‚Äú. It‚Äôs not even that Crypto would need to forget them. Crypto has never cared much and Investors are unlikely to build buy-walls for their new stupid-clowns-who-are-scam-or-fake-brand.    And yes, I know - some or even many here don‚Äôt like to read things like this. But that‚Äôs natural in situations without any good solution. My advice is also not to simply believe what I or others say. My advice is to think cold about it all, with some distance, to just take things into consideration, to think in probabilites and to come to conclusions that are not fix but about potential scenarios. Exactly that is what this team shows a total lack of ability in, while they still want to believe to be right. For me it‚Äôs astonishing to see such an insane combination of arrogance, hypocrisy and naivety and before all: That there was nobody internally who stopped those who came up with their great fame-creating-kamikaze-scam-let‚Äôs-call-it-education-prank-strategy. #welcometothejungle",False

What did you prove then? Whenever asked for refund, the reply is that a refund only would have been possible until 14 days after ICO. Your (debunked) argument was that regulations are so lax that it would have been easy to get away with theft, but when it‚Äôs about giving money back to Investors the rules are so strong and wouldn't it be fair to do that? In the AMA was said that there will be no refund because the project didn't change. But wouldn't you agree that Trust and Credibility are crucial and that the ""Savedroid is a scam headlines"" and ""Savedroid has done the most dumb PR Stunt ever"" have done significant damage? And wouldn't you agree that the Investors and their Investment were used to promote something they have not bought - the ""ICO-advisory-service"" you plan to offer? Yassir said in an interview with Gruenderszene that the PR-stunt would not have negative impact on the future price of the token, otherwise the team wouldn‚Äôt have done it. How could he/you/the team ever know that? When you planned that PR-stunt‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt you think about a potential scenario that an overwhelmed and shocked Investor could have done harm to himself out of desperation? ‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt you think about the scenario that your bank, lawyer, german fintechs, german blockchain association, advisors etc of you would be forced into distancing themselves from Savedroid? ‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt you think about the potential scenario that the connection of words Savedroid and Scam would not be the best brand to move on? ‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt you think about the scenario that you‚Äôll not be able to control the communication and establish your narrative afterwards? Is it possible that there will be legal consequences for Savedroid? In a german article is said that the Savedroid team was thrown out of an office in it‚Äôs early days because of ‚Äûdubios and irresponsible behaviour‚Äú and that you‚Äôve tried to sell user-data. Is that true? https://kryptoszene.de/savedroid-status-update-alles-nur-ein-pr-stunt/      Edit: Since you mention the FUD-problem - let's not forget who started the biggest FUD-campaign I've ever seen, targeting the own Investors and credibility of the own project.

Besides that the escrow only holds the money until all tokens are minted, so it's more our call when we've finished it. No that would not be fair, because the product plan is still valid, the token economics didn't change at all. No I would not agree to that The investors have bought the tokens, as already mentioned the token economics and the product roadmap didn't change at all. Buying a token is NOT buying the full savedroid company. That's our hypotheses, noone can of course predict the future. No we didn't expect that somone harms himself as that also didn't happen in previous real scams. We've investigated these scams a lot and checked what happened there. Besides that I hope that never anyone will invest so much money, that it's worse harming himself, neither for a scam, nor when a token-price drops which is not unlikely in this high-risk market. Of course some people will distanciate from us, especially the ones which have a motivation that the current status quo stays intact and no questions about that are asked. We're surprised be the feedback of the FinTech-community, as this PR-stunt was not related at all to FinTech and only a critic at the crypto-scene. Of course we think about the brand, but don't think it'll have a long-term impact and the content at the end will survive. The communication was definitely not ideal and has to be improved, totally agree on that.

Who didn't watch it, please do‚Ä¶ it's worth it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41OuMFt_fMc  This guy clearly lives in a parallel-world in which he has a strong and very persistent ability to ignore his own lies and contradictions. He is able to say one thing and to contradict that just some sentences later, while he is not even aware. Actually he reminds me of Trump. It‚Äôs a different style of course, but the principle is similar and shows Conman-acting on a high level.  What is also interesting: He is not aware how naive it is what he says. Just one example: He was so surprised that pishing sites popped up. He must be not only new to Crypto but to the Internet! But yeah, please Savedroid, help to regulate this shady stuff away! Already an idea how to achieve that? ;-)  He talks about Savedroids role to make the market as a whole more sustainable and that would be in favor also for SVD-token-holder. I think he already showed how to achieve that using his own project as example how to trash trust and undermine the value of the own token. Yes, good approach! The Crypto-space will take him seriously and ask for advice!  He points on all the GREED in this market! That's bad, isn't it? It comes from a hypocrite who just raised about $50 mln by selling a token that is not necessary at all (besides exactly that purpose) using hype, buzzwords and a price-prediction-chart.    They want to come up with a due-diligence checklist for ICO's to help Investors to come to an informed decision. Please, everybody with some experience in Crypto: Take a deeper look at Savedroid and imagine it‚Äôs about 1 week before ICO-start. I just can say for myself: My due-diligence-checklist would have ruled this hype-project out within 15 minutes. After their trash-all-trust-PR: 1 second.   More important for Savedroid-Investors - Clear lies and deception about refund, provided messages and more:   He gives a ""no"" to all who want to be refunded. Reason: The project hasn't changed. Interesting statement that reveals something quiet concerning but not surprising at all: He does not understand, or intentionally ignores, what the real value is about that backs everything else: Trust. But yes, that didn't change after all the headlines that Savedroid is a scam and after all the lies, deceptions and confusion...  He gives insights about the own escrow setup and he clearly says that it would NOT have been possible to steal those funds. But in his ""And it's NOT gone-video"" he said that he wanted to show, quote:  ""(...) how easy it could've been that even we, as a highly regulated german stock corporation, could have just run away, then exit scam with all the funds (...)""  Isn't that a lie? Ah, let's not care about such details and talk about his lies or it would also be necessary to talk about the trust issue, right? Nothing to see here, nothing has changed.  He points on the message he pretended he has given and he does that again and again and still believes it to be good and that it will have positive impact. He also advices his viewers to check if a project that runs an ICO uses an escrow-services. Let's take a deeper look at the provided message and the given advice:   Action taken during ICO: Savedroid used an escrow. Message: Savedroid is a safe Investment on that front  Action taken after ICO: The team faked an exit-scam Message: Oh no, Yassir vanished to a beach in Egypt and took all the money. Damn, if that is true, not even escrows can be trusted anymore!  Action taken after PR-Stunt: He explains in his video that it was just a PR-Stunt but that he could easily have executed an exit scam with all the funds Message: Did he just confirm that he really could have taken all the funds despite having an escrow? Damn, it‚Äôs true, not even escrows can be trusted anymore!  Action taken to explain the mess: Ama yesterday, saying that he would NOT have been able to steal the funds, explains his viewers the advantages of escrow-services Message: WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TEACHING HERE? ;-)   Some Facts about the real message Savedroid delivered:  Savedroid-is-a-Scam-message was delivered internationally, probably to millions who will continue to connect the words Savedroid and Scam and continue to believe that Savedroid is exactly that - question probably is if that is wrong under the line ;-)  Message that Savedroid has done an insane and irresponsible PR-Stunt on the back of all others was also delivered powerful  AMA yesterday was delivered to, in best case: a few thousands.  Result: Some believe ""this"" and others ""that‚Äú, others already came up with own theories that are quiet often a damaging combinations of both, like ""they tried it but got scared and backed off"". The majority will just not care much more about this. Who does really believe that Savedroid will ever be taken seriously by any real professional in this space, or just guys like me who have a real ‚Äûdue-diligence-checklist‚Äú?   Something funny besides: On the german AMA he explains that he was surprised and that they didn‚Äôt expect that the Exit-Scam-Info would have international impact. He believed that would be limited more to Germany. Additionally he didn‚Äôt expect (and is deeply sorry about) that it had impact in the Fintech-Space. But what the hell did he expect? Surprise, Crypto is international and surprise, Savedroid is a Fintech. But he believed he could place his trash-trust-PR focused on Germany and not international and everywhere in Germany but not in the Fintech-space? What did he smoke?  Funny as well: Especially big Investors liked his PR-Stunt... sure!    Exchanges:  A loooong explanation that some exchanges would want millions in USD to list SVD, that he doesn‚Äôt agree with that and doesn‚Äôt want to pay for such a listing. I tend to agree with him as well. But: Wouldn‚Äôt it be a good first step to a more sustainable market to make such exchanges public? Or is it maybe just not true?  Top5 exchange: Nothing to say about that‚Ä¶ all under NDA.  That‚Äôs an interesting combination btw. I would not hope for a listing on a bigger exchange at all, because it might very well be that he is already preparing excuses.     Most important fact:  They have the millions and won't give any of that back, because: nothing has changed.  Let‚Äôs forget deception, contradiction, hypocrisy and proven lies. Why paying attention to such details when it‚Äôs about the better of the whole industry, less scams and a more sustainable market. Everybody should take Savedroid and it‚Äôs high standards of honesty and transparency as example, right?   Some words to Yassin: You have done a powerful job to give your company the scam-brand and it‚Äôs totally deserved. You also say that the situation is still too emotional and that you expect that to calm down over time. And yes, you‚Äôre right. Exactly that will happen and you‚Äôll see: In a few weeks the public will just not care much about this project anymore. You already can see that dynamic. The media has thrown this project into the scam-or-dumb-section and that is what you asked for. Some will probably make some fun about you like I do, but attention will continue to decrease significantly - and with that a lot of potential. What will be left? My guess is: Damage to your Investors - that‚Äôs it.  To the rest of the team: I would make a bet that not all of you disagree with what I try to explain here, even if I do it in an insulting way to the company that pays your checks. But think about where that money came from and ask yourself just two questions:  1) Do you really believe it‚Äôs deserved?   2) Do you also believe that a refund should not be given because nothing has changed? #trust?",False

We talk about financial investment and thus about trust from customers and the market.

The fact that the company with the most successful ICO in Germany so negligently deals with the subject of customer confidence shows an enormous naivety.

And it very well could be true, because if you think about the App and what it actually does: It's purpose is to help ppl to put money aside by simple rules. Let's say you connect your bank-account to the Savedroid-Account and you activate that a tiny amount is transacted from your bank-account to the savedroid-account whenever Trump makes a tweet or whenever you walk 1000 m or whenever you go to your Fitness-Club: It doesn't make much sense at all. In my opinion that are just annoying and useless gimmicks. Some might find it funny for 2 weeks but it's hard to believe that it attracts anybody over a long time. And, most important: It doesn't generate any money, just unnecessary transactions. What it generates though: User-data. Dependent on the rules a user choses, they will know a lot. Put that in context with the financial side and users become perfect targets for all kinds of shady stuff.   Now translate that into Crypto: It's not possible to connect a normal and external address in a way to the Savedroid account like it's possible with an external bank-account. The Crypto-assets need to be stored inside Savedroid and they'll have the private keys. A fully developed Savedroid would have total control and the user would be transparent like glass. And for what? I have no idea what the real value for the user would be. I mean, he would even have to pay for that... with the token, which is just a made-up-purpose, because (considered this would make any sense): Normal fees would be much more efficient. But they needed something to sell in an ICO, so they've created a token and tried best to promote it as purposeful and even valuable. They've even used a price-prediction-chart on their website.  If sane ppl with a bit experience in and knowledge about Crypto think about that:  - who wants to have his savings in an online environment he has no control about (experienced guys put everything on cold storage)? - who wants Savedroid to have control over private keys, especially when it's about money somebody wants to put aside for later? - who needs all the unnecessary transactions, let's say whenever he goes from home to the fitness-club? - who wants the App to know the own location and other stuff - is there anything to find here that is in favor of the user?  Really... the PR-Stunt is probably not even the worst about this project and in my opinion, it has no chance in Crypto, because it is a total contradiction of what Crypto is about in so many ways.  Now add the PR-Stunt on top of that: They let their Investors and Users believe that they ran with the money... what a great joke for guys who raised $50 mln with a promoted business-model of managing other ppl's money.  I really believed I would have seen everything in Crypto, but this is....... so damn..... new! #insanity ;-)",False

What I try to say is simple: Whatever my intentions might be, no matter if shady or if I just express my opinion honestly, the most effective way to address that would be to rebut on topic in any case. You just try to compromise what I say with the attempt to make readers believe that I would want to buy cheap. And I don't believe that you believe that. Out of your perspective it may make some sense, because you try to place a message like ""tempus actually believes that this project has such a great quality that he puts some effort into getting it cheap"" , or even better: ""tempus was sent by a competitor! How great Savedroid must be that others are so scared that they go on attack"".  But: Isn't that much more manipulative than what I do? Let me explain why the answer is ""yes"": Because you try just that and nothing else. You don't show up with arguments in favor of the project. You just focus on the market situation because that is what scares you when you have to read critique like mine. You don't try to rebut what critiques say and you don't say why this would be worth an Investment or just to stick to it. I'm not even sure that you really get what I try to explain here. But it's you who tries manipulative games. I don't blame you. Actually I challenge you to do a better job (while your question should be why that should be your job - shouldn't they have communicators in place to have this and other platforms at least under some control?)  Another important point, which I've already explained: If I would want to buy into this cheap, I wouldn't write in favor of a refund. Again: A refund would be positive for all Investors, those who chose to get their money back and those who still believe in this project. It would reduce supply (only if burned of course), it would reduce the risk of dumping on exchanges. I can not say that and be against anyone who is invested in this. And the team should be able to start with $20 mln as well, or do you believe that's not enough?  Binance:  ""Binance.com launched on July 14th, 11 days after its ICO which raised $15m, (...)"" https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/6zukht/binancecom_stats_and_bnb_valuation/  Not because it wasn't wanted but because they didn't hype it up like mad. Same with NEO (formerly Antshares). Their crowdfunding was in summer 2016. They've also raised about $15 mln (at that time it was the most expensive ICO I ever bought into - and just btw, it even fell below ICO-price first and for about 6 months). Factom in 2015: Only about $1 mln. Or Icon last summer: about $30 mln. I consider all of these as legit projects with professional teams who didn't hype the shit out of it. But this one needs about $50 mln just to make it's first steps? And they claim that it would have been easy to steal that money and even let ppl think they would have done that, but when Investors ask for refund: ""no... we have to stick on the rules. that would only have been possible until 14 days after ICO!""  But yeah, I'm the shady one here. Dream on, honey!     Btw, I have some good news for you: This topic and my posts are unlikely to have much impact. Reason is this: ""Read 15476 times"" since it was created in December. The activity was probably on it's high during the ICO and now it's about less than 100 clicks per day and not even 50% by different people. No need to be scared. But yeah, I don't like the usecase, I don't like how they treat their own supporters/Investors, I don't like how they've hyped it and how greedy they prove to be, I don't like how they communicate (if they do that at all) etc.  And not a single satoshi of mine will ever be on the buyside if this hits the exchanges.  The only thing I agree on is education. But my approach is totally different of course. I prefer a much softer approach of respectfully communicating arguments instead of pushing others into desperation first to keep holding them in a stockholm-syndrome-situation afterwards. And while Savedroid asked for payment in advance to deliver their educational torture, my posts are for free!     Herr, die Not ist gro√ü! Die ich rief, die Geister, Werd ich nun nicht los.",False

But what does that mean? My history goes back to 2014 while your account was registered in march 2018. Couldn't I come up with similar theories about you, just the other way around? But see, I wouldn't even care if you are a paid shill or not but always focus on what you say instead on theories I couldn't ever prove (I wouldn't even see much sense in doing that).  2) My Nr. 1 Intention is not to be helpful. I came because I was a) curious about what this is about, b) angry, because I have zero respect or understanding for what they've done, c) fascinated by the psychological situation.  3) You are free to believe whatever you want to believe. And if you really believe what you say about me I consider that as wishful thinking. Questioning my intention gives you the freedom to ignore questions you maybe should have about this project and the team behind.   Quote Your combination looks like this:  You guide FUD on the community - you enter to the TOP5 exchange with high liquidity - you buy most of the SVD at the bottom - pamp the price - then sell - take a profit. Just Business  Let's not forget that the concerns and fear this community is trapped in was not caused by me or anybody else who is like me. Critique about this is effect, not cause. That's number 1.  2 is: I wouldn't be able to write the price down. May I have influence on some readers? Yes, but not that many because this thread is not that important. You can see that if you compare the numbers. Most Investors have never clicked on this topic, not even once.  3: Your theory would only make sense if I would have any measure where the price should be and that it would come back after a crash. Since this team has acted with more insanity than some scammers I've watched over the years I wouldn't want to risk that. I don't see much sense in playing games and taking risks like that.   Quote If the team did not announce the TOP5 exchange - you would not even have looked here. Interesting point because it implies that I believe that. But I don't believe anything what came from them or at least nothing what was used to hype.  I'll give you a simple lesson: Not just a given information is important, but also context and timing. Now let's take a look at their announcement:  savedroid ICO: SVD Token will be traded on top 5 exchange https://medium.com/@ico_8796/savedroid-ico-svd-token-will-be-traded-on-top-5-exchange-f45a453ca3ef  Given information: SVD will be on a top 5 exchange Context: ICO Timing: 4 days before end of ICO  And there is more context: They've hyped with everything what came to their mind. Conclusion: That is hype. It's not necessarily a lie but the risk is too high it could turn out as that, at least in my opinion. And I don't buy things like that because I don't trust hype. This is a high-risk-market with a lot of shady stuff and I see zero sense in buying into anything that just has a little shadow. I have learned what they pretended to teach long before they've joined this space.  Now there is, in case that info was not a lie, also another scenario: It's possible that this exchange called it off because they don't want to be associated with this project. Did you notice that I've asked that question but didn't get an answer? Do you believe I'm surprised that no answer was given?  Of course, they don't have any reason to like/respect me. But they could give the info to you and others, right?  Lesson 2: When it's about communication of a team it can tell you a lot if you pay attention on what they DON'T reply on.   Quote Thank you for such help - the community will solve their problems without you  The community will NOT solve any problems. Only the team could do that. A good start would be not to cause more damage and to give you and all others the deserved respect. In this case it would be a sign of fairness and respect to give those their money back who want that.",False

Some quotes that show the status quo:   we don't need answers, we just need refund  i did think i lost my money after your antics...üòß worried feeling all day, this is my last ico i will invest in.  Savedroid has destroyed its own reputation whether or not its an exit scam. I believe the majority of us would like a refund and it is crazy for them to lock tokens for 180 days but only give us a short period of 14 days to refund. Very unfair terms and I will be taking action under the Consumer Protection Act 2015. I have already asked my bank for a refund as Savedroid have acted both unprofessionally and in an incompetetive manner. I am still completely unsure if this was a failed exit scam or if they are buying time to take our money. I spoke to Tobias (co founder) and he is extremely rude and unprofessional and he said he would send me a bill if I refunded (I mean seriously, what will you do with a bill from Germany??).  __________________________________________  I don't have a FB-Account and since I'm not invested I wouldn't ask questions anyway. But otherwise I would ask this:   You said that you wanted to prove how easy it is to execute an exit scam and to steal all ICO-funds, your bank and lawyer were forced into statements that everything is safe and your CTO confirmed on the german section of Bitcointalk that it would not have been possible to steal the funds. What did you prove then? Whenever asked for refund, Savedroid-Admins on Telegram reply that a refund only would have been possible 14 days after ICO. Your (debunked) argument was that regulations are so lax that it would have been easy to get away with theft, but when it‚Äôs about giving money back to Investors the rules are so strong? In an interview with Gruenderszene you‚Äôve claimed that the PR-stunt would not have negative impact on the future price of the token, otherwise the team wouldn‚Äôt have done it. How could you ever know that? When you planned that PR-stunt‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt you think about a potential scenario that an overwhelmed and shocked Investor could have done harm to himself out of desperation? ‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt you think about the scenario that your bank, lawyer, german fintechs, german blockchain association, advisors etc of you would be forced into distancing themselves from Savedroid? ‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt you think about the potential scenario that the connection of words Savedroid and Scam would not be the best brand to move on? ‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt you think about the scenario that you‚Äôll not be able to control the communication and establish your narrative afterwards? The PR-Stunt has caused damage to the reputation of your project, what will you do to repair that? Have you lost any partnerships and/or advisors? You've used and deceived your Investors to promote Savedroid as ICO-advisory-service while that hasn‚Äôt anything to do with what you‚Äôve promised to deliver and the sold tokens during the ICO. Don't you think that would be a reason to refund those who want out? Is it possible that there will be legal consequences? Is it possible that exchanges will reject to list SVD now? Do you believe that attention is equal to trust? In a german article is said that the Savedroid team was thrown out of an office in it‚Äôs early days because of ‚Äûdubios and irresponsible behaviour‚Äú and that you‚Äôve tried to sell user-data. Is that true? https://kryptoszene.de/savedroid-status-update-alles-nur-ein-pr-stunt/      Edit: One guy just posted this article:  Savedroid CEO to be Grilled at Frankfurt BBQ https://bitsonline.com/savedroid-ceo-grilled-frankfurt-bbq/  LMAO:  ""As for Hankir‚Äôs promised appearance at the community BBQ, only time will tell whether that will be fulfilled.

If you think through this out of their perspective and after your PR-Stunt: It wouldn't be that surprising if they are unsure if they want to be associated with such a move.  Btw, there is the theory out there that it wasn't just a ""Prank-Exit-Scam"" but that you guys tried to execute it and backed off because you got scared and that the explanation and ""making-of"" a day later was just a cover up. I know that's not true, because you were not even able to move money. But your problem now is that none of the results are in your favor:  - some still believe it was an exit-scam (realized), because the first message (and it's gone, over and out) was more powerful than everything what came after - some are informed and consider it as stupid and irresponsible - some believe it was a failed scam, like said above - near to zero positive feedback.   Another btw: What I thought about is how you guys pulled that off, how it was discussed and planned in your team before. I can't know it, but I think it's unlikely that everybody agreed and believed that to be a smart move. Assumed I'm right, there is something I additionally find irresponsible: Those who didn't agree and expressed their concerns were pushed in an impossible situation without any good option. Actually they only had the options to participate or to quit. Theoretically everybody could have stopped it by saying ""If you really want to pull that off, I'll make it public before"" (whistleblowing). And the paradox here is: In that case it wouldn't have happened and that would have been better for Savedroid. They would have rescued it. But: Because it wouldn't have happened they wouldn't have any proof to be right. Those who believed the ""Hoax-strategy"" would be a smart move could have seen that as betrayal, blaming the person who avoided the disaster.  If you think about that... creating such a situation of pressure and without any good option for those who actually disagreed is already irresponsible against the own people.  Of course there is also the scenario that everybody on your team believed it to be a great idea right away. But actually that would be the worst scenario.",False

I have nothing to hide:  1) Yes, I'm not invested. I didn't even know this project until I saw the desperation on twitter after the Savedroid-CEO had pushed out his ""over and out - tweet"".  2) I recognized they are germans. I'm also a german and probably that was the first trigger to pay attention  3) After reading a bit and thinking about that move, nothing made any sense to me. Especially that got me really interested, simply the question what this is about. My first conclusion was: Whatever it is or will turn out to be, in any case it's stupid and insane.  4) The next day their explanation-video... I just thought ""what a stupid idiot, what an insane combination of pure arrogance and naivety."" that has lead into such stupidity and ruthlessness, pretending an educational purpose while clearly they are the ones who should go back to school.    5) It was a safe prediction that it would backfire hard and to see that was kind of entertaining but also embarrassing. Actually I was happy to see the hard media-echo in Germany. I talked with some of the german Investors on the german thread and got more information, figured that not even their story was true (would have been so easy to exit scam with all of the funds).  7) Even after the first hard feedback they didn't learn. They kept on with their arrogance (most of it on german threads), still pretending they could have executed a scam, pretending that they wanted to educate people about that, and even about the greed in the market. And yes, all of that made me really angry, even if not invested myself. They hyped their ICO to $50 mln, then put anybody else at risk including their own partners, while risking nothing of their own money that they only got because people trusted them. And they even want to educate others and even point on greed? Damn, that's bolt!  8 ) They pretend the intention to educate all others, but in fact they have acted deceptive. And while they also pretend they would have solved the situation with their explanation, they've just built another lie on the first deception. Whenever I see something like that I consider a high probability that the claimed intention is also not true or at least not the whole truth. Since they've even started a new website, saying ""ICO Advisory coming soon - made in Germany"" I believe their main-intention was promoting that.    9) They are the ones who have turned what was meant to be business into a social experiment with educational purpose. They, and those who still believe in them, shouldn't have a problem if others do exactly that. And my credibility is not at stake here. Everybody is free to come to own conclusions. To believe my posts would be manipulative because I'm not invested doesn't make much sense. It's the opposite: I simply point out my honest thoughts because I have no horse in this race.  10) No, I have zero intention to write the price down and I won't buy into it in any scenario, no matter of price. I'm one of those who don't believe in the use-case and I don't believe in the team. I don't believe in their abilities to lead a project to success and even without this silly PR-Stunt I would see this project and their ICO as an overvalued hype, which only worked out so well because it was ""pre hyped"" in the fintech-space. And what a majority doesn't seems to care much about, but it really is a major aspect in my opinion: I consider the introduction of their new idea to become Ico-advisors as a bad sign because 1) it is not thought out as well, 2) it has nothing to do with what they've sold in their ICO, and most important: 3) it shows a lack of commitment regarding their core-project.  A committed team would never decide to make things more complicated. There would also be no reason to hype a project even more after a successful ICO with any kind of PR before real delivery. They got about $50 mln and shouldn't have any time to think about ICO-advisory, about torturing their own Investors, making silly videos including a ""making of"". #smokeandmirrors  I wouldn't ever buy into a project that shows such a lack of having priorities.  _____________  Some words to those who believe posts like this to be strategic- or maybe even paid FUD: It's natural that you want to see it that way because you recognize critique as risk of your Investment. That's understandable. But again: Those who push for a refund are right and giving that choice would be best for everybody. If I would want to see Investors suffer, maybe even buy cheap later, I would not write in favor of a refund but the opposite. Again, the reason is simple: The probability of a crashing price increases the more supply will hit the exchanges and the other way around.",False

In this case it was the team itself that started exactly that. Now they have to face the fact that the feedback is about 2. And of course, that concerns many of their Investors, but why? Because informations about what Savedroid has really done might increases the risk that it will not be so easy to offload own bags on others.  And I see it this way: They pretended to educate all others about risks in this markt with a PR-Stunt in which they first have spread a lie about themselves and afterwards told a lie about that, because all of that was done under false premise and to promote their new business idea that has nothing to with what they've sold in their ICO.  In my opinion there would only be one legit move: If they would refund everybody who wants out. But, a guy on the german thread just posted a quote out of telegram:  Serg Antourag, [20.04.18 13:38] hey, is it possible to get a refund?  xxx | savedroid, [20.04.18 13:40] [Admin] [Antwort auf Serg Antourag] We cannot process refund anymore since it is more 14days from ico   Very paradox situation. They pretended to be scammers, than told the world that they just wanted to educate, but fact is that they have the real money while putting everybody else at risk, especially own Investors. And I believe it needs education about that. I really feel bad for their Investors but I also think that everybody who thinks about buying this later on an exchange should have the chance to figure out what they do here. And since Savedroid is all about educating others and now even about professional advisory that is fully in line with their own ideals. Or they are just dishonest...  ",False

Last conversation about it went this way:  Q: When refund? A: Refund is allowed 14days after you registered. Q: Why not 14days after marketing fail? A: I'm sorry but that's one of policy.   In my opinion they've really crossed a line to fraud, because:  1. Their pretended message is based on a lie. They could not have stolen the funds, while Yassin even said in his infamous video that it would have been easy to exit scam with all of the funds. A german journalist of gruenderszene said on youtube that Yassin didn't want to give an answer on the question how much of the money they really could have taken. Surprise... because the answer is: near to nothing or even nothing, especially no Crypto.  2. Besides the fact that their pretended message about regulations is totally trivial, it's actually even worthless in that context. There is no regulation against insanity. Since they didn't think through it and acted deceptive, I highly doubt that the message really was their true intention. If it was, it just proves their superficiality and inability of thinking through stuff.  3. Their real intention behind this PR-Stunt probably was to promote their new business-idea of ICO-advisory, which has nothing to do with the use case they've sold during the ICO. To invent a new business that has nothing to do with the usecase that was promoted to sell out the ICO would be a no-go anyway, even without the self-destructive PR-stunt.  4. Yassin said in a german interview that they don't think their PR-stunt will have bad impact on the future price of their token, otherwise they wouldn't have done it. The latter implies and underlines the pretense of being totally sure about that. That must be another lie, because nobody with an IQ above a cake could believe to be able to make such a prediction. Truth must be that they didn't care about Investors or again: are not able to think through stuff.  5. Investors beg for actions to repair the caused damage, but how should they manage that? It's not possible to get on top of the communication if confronted with several of their own lies and the inconsistency of their pretended message. Anybody seen any public communication of the leadership lately?  Quote: ""Yassin has currently not answered our request to interview him and post the results publicly. We will update the situation in case anything changes."" https://medium.com/@BestofICOs/savedroid-the-damage-caused-4de56625aa26  6. They reject all requests of Investors who wish a refund. Of course they don't want to give the money back. It's about $50 mln in Fiat, Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies. And while prices of BTC and alts are rising, Investors of their token are in hostage and can't do anything but wait. #stockholmsyndrome   ______________   If they would have been fair they would not only agree to refund those who would like to get their money back but even would've planned a refund into the ""PR-Stunt-Strategy"". Afterwards they would've refunded everybody and then announced a new ICO - also as kind of a poll/voting about their PR-strategy. That would still have turned out to be a stupid move, it still would have been irresponsible. But at least it would have been a little bit better and also give them a better situation to react on accusations.  But they know they've fucked up, so they prefer the corner they've put themselves into while keeping the money, because they know they wouldn't ever get $50 mln again...  The interesting part about this situation really is to subdivide it all into the topics Inconsistency vs. Consistency, what they really care about and show real committance and what they don't care about. What they really cared about and where they have done a great job actually: To market their ICO and get a lot of money.  Everything else shows poor strategy, incompetence, selfish and ruthless action, inconsistency and even deception.   ",False

Total supply and marketcap would be reduced and the market-situation would be relaxed and have more potential.  3) It would have psychological effect, send a different and better message and probably/hopefully help to restore trust in a) the team & project and b) the market-situation    There may also be a negative: It would be the admission that they have done a terrible mistake and it's not possible to predict the media echo on such an admission.

There are so many incredible hard working entrepreneurs, innovating and providing real value exchange through the use of blockchain and crypto currencies. They have not only damaged their own reputation, but that of the 1000's of European start-ups invested into delivering genuine ICO's and blockchain technology.  I think the German Bundesblock said it best!  Public Statement of Bundesblock regarding the Savedroid PR Stunt On 18th of April, 2018, the German blockchain startup Savedroid AG having its registered address at Eschersheimer Landstra√üe 121, 60322 Frankfurt am Main, took its official website offline, for more than 24 hours, leaving behind only an internet meme with the inscription ‚Äú‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs gone‚Äù ‚Äì referring to the funds collected from thousands of investors in its recent tokensale event (ICO).  Yesterday, 19th of April, 2018 it was revealed by the founder of Savedroid, Yassin Hankir, that the pretended ‚Äúexit scam‚Äù was merely a publicity stunt to catch the world‚Äôs attention. In a Youtube video released to the public yesterday, Hankir spoke about the need for stronger regulation in the context of public crowdfunding campaigns based on blockchain technology ‚Äì  so-called ICO‚Äôs (Initial Coin Offering).  The German Blockchain Association Bundesblock believes the claimed PR stunt lacks any professionalism and sense of responsibility. It sheds a negative light on the whole blockchain ecosystem. It created a sense of fear and anxiety among users and investors alike. Instead of leading by example, Hakir decided to risk the collective reputation of thousands of responsible and diligent entrepreneurs in Germany and Europe, for minutes of dubious fame and potential benefits for their own. We strongly reject Savedroid‚Äôs behavior.  The Savedroid team has operated a controversial marketing campaign throughout, which ended in a truly damaging event. Savedroid AG has never been a member of our Association.  We want to remind the world of the beneficial values for society that lie in the concepts and practices that blockchain is about. New forms of crowdfunding are important for the ecosystem. The [Suspicious link removed]munity needs to show maturity where it counts. We are deeply disappointed by this behavior, which clearly harms the goals of the [Suspicious link removed]munity as well as ongoing ICO projects, which face now as a result the withdrawal of support due to this irresponsible stand-alone PR gag.

I'm not so sure that they really will have to face legal actions because of their ICO-Investors. But, german law says that faking a crime is a crime. And their amateurish-educational PR-Stunt has implications beyond Crypto.    Thing is: It can't even be education because their premise is false. Their CEO states in his video that they wanted to show, quote:  ""(...) how easy it could've been that even we, as a highly regulated german stock corporation, could have just run away, then exit scam with all the funds (...)"" https://youtu.be/o5_bwFf_byo?t=1m20s   Fact is: That's a lie. There were escrows in place and also their CTO confirmed on the german thread on one of my questions that they could not have taken the money.   What have they proven? Even a big stock company, let's say Tesla, could do what they did. Imagine the Tesla Leadership leaves their offices, shuts down the site, Elon Musk makes a ""funny"" tweet like this Savedroid-clown, and of course: Their stock-price would crash. No regulation could ever prevent that insane and narcissistic amateurs play with the trust of their own Investors and partners. That is what happened here and nothing else.  Their useless and dishonest move involves a high risk to devaluate their own coin, but of course, that's not a problem for them. Their funds are in EURO and BTC and other Cryptocurrencies. With other words: Their stupid PR-stunt happened on the back of their Investors, their partners  (Frick-Bank for example which is in anger now & their lawyer), the whole german fintech space and so on. A guy of a bank wrote an open letter and explained how bad this move was for the whole space, several Fintech-ppl wrote an open letter in which they distance themselve from Savedroid, Paymentandbanking retracted their award, the german blockchain association issued a statement in which they write:  ""The German Blockchain Association Bundesblock believes the claimed PR stunt lacks any professionalism and sense of responsibility. It sheds a negative light on the whole blockchain ecosystem. It created a sense of fear and anxiety among users and investors alike. Instead of leading by example, Hakir decided to risk the collective reputation of thousands of responsible and diligent entrepreneurs in Germany and Europe, for minutes of dubious fame and potential benefits for their own. We strongly reject Savedroid‚Äôs behavior.  The Savedroid team has operated a controversial marketing campaign throughout, which ended in a truly damaging event. Savedroid AG has never been a member of our Association.  (...)""  https://www.bundesblock.de/2018/04/20/savedroid-pr-stunt-public-statement-of-bundesblock/    And the ""super-fun-fact"": If they should get away with this it would only be because of what they pretend to criticize and give a lesson about to everybody else: no clear regulations. Maybe they would say ""yeah, that's what we wanted to show"", but again: What they show is how easy it is to make a trashy move on the back of everybody else while they have the $50 mln. Will be interesting to see their ""strategy"" to clean up this mess and repair their own reputation. ""Savedroid is a scam"" made international headlines, even in Asia. The next headlines are ""dumbest PR-Stunt ever"", the rest is confusion and Etherscan calls them ""suspicous"".   Another interesting question is: What did they really try to ""promote"" with their PR-stunt? Their new business idea ""ICO-Advisory"". But how many would have bought into their ICO if they would've known that the team wants to become ICO-Advisors? And just besides: Which serious team would ever ask these amateurs for advice?  tobson2 said on the german thread that the advisory-stuff will be a whole new company with new ppl and also new capital but that there are no plans... Everything shows that they have zero clue and didn't think through anything. But what they've accomplished is to get many millions from Investors who saw no signs that this could turn out to be a scam but these arrogant amateurs believed it would be necessary to trash their own credibility and their Investors by giving a dishonest lesson under false premise.  In my opinion this crosses a line and is near to a scam out of a simple reason: While they have the real money, they're putting all others at risk. And best is: They didn't only want to show how easy it would be to scam (and again, that is not even true). tobson2 says on another german forum (https://coinforum.de/topic/11429-savedroid-svd/?page=34&tab=comments#comment-290166) that they also wanted to show how greedy this market is. That is so hypocritical... who has the $50 mln and rejects all questions for refund? ;-)  I'm in Crypto since 2013 and there was so much craziness over the time. These clueless teachers, who are an embarrassment for germany, found a whole new level of being damaging and entertaining at the same time.",False

The balance is (as long as not confirmed from our side) defined by the amount of tokens the investor has confirmed to buy.

So if we see in the review process that an investor has paid less or at a worse exchange rate the tokens will be reduced.

It is good that concerns are stated; he will have to experiment and study the data generated from the post-ico traction and amend accordingly. Businesses should be flexible to change and I don't expect any ico to stick to every word in the whitepaper. The businesses operate towards a bigger goal, and is making money. Anything that could stop that or minimize that should be eliminated or restructured that is why in many cases we see ideas come out as one thing and pivot to a completely different thing; take groupon for example it started as a whole different thing.

Sure you can find one example to fit the narrative that 7.5% is not a bad fee.

Even crypto noobs know that it doesnt cost 7.5% at ANY other exchange  ,and yes, they will learn through pain if they use the app and see how they are not saving money, but how the money gets smaller and smaller paying that fee. Then they will leave.   It is a bad percentage , please think   ""savings app, please pay 7.5% each time you buy crypto""  The 7.5% is for a buy or sell and not based on any asumptions at all, in fact it was confirmed by the team, that it is not 15% but indeed 7.5% that two actions they expect per month. Now if that is just what they think people will do, or if that is what the AI will suggest they do to meet the 15% , who knows.

I am simply pointing out facts and stating my opinon.    working product  Please dont mislead people, please really do not do that.  Your crypto product is not live, it doesnt work. We dont see it, we cant use it. In that case it doesnt exist. No you dont have a working product that has anything to do with savedriod token or the ico, no there is no product related to the ico that is live right now. Please do not mislead people. If im wrong, link us to the download. That would be great. I hope the working product can show us in a transparent way how much it costs to buy or sell crypto.   There is a logo on the bottom right of the ICO page,    you know the one where you ,              give them money.   There is no link.  It looks at a very minimum as if some part of the ICO was checked by the T√úV, but guess what     It has not.  When you put the logo on the page like that,    then expect questions about it. Really it is not amazing to ask questions about things that you put in the forefront of your website. You should be really happy to answer these questions and they should be really really really easy to answer.    This is not fud, this is just the truth, and the team has had every chance in the world to make a really clear simple answer, but instead they send people to talk about so called ""FUD"". If the answer to every critical question is ""go read the whitepaper""   ""look in google"" or ""go read some german document"" then im sorry that is not enough.    This is an app that say it is for noobs,     it charges an amazing 7.5%  each time you buy or sell crypto, yes 7.5%     I will never ever accept an app that advertises itself as trying to promote crypto to the ""masses"" with those kinds of fees,  it is more like how do we make the masses rekt. On top of that they talk bad about ""offshore icos"" that are ""shady"" and dont offer the investors any protection, but guess what, the token holders of savedroid have zero protection, they are in the exact same boat as any other ico. The way to dance around questions is just to make enough noise, with enough sockpuppets and just go forward, this will just increase the signal of the truth, of how this app works with the revenue model as staded in the savedriod documentation. Furthermore as soon as every noob figures out that the app charges such high fees, and that they pay for the app every month then they will just leave the app, they learned that if you use a third party to make things ""easy"" you pay a whole lot, and there is not an AI out there that will recover a 15% spread.",False

However I think one major advantage that is not getting much attention is the fact that they have traction generated before the ICO; so we know the product works and growing. What is more is the 1 mil seed investment. Landing a seed investment with that value (1 mil) is basically valuating the company at a some millions; not sure what equity is owned by the team but it is not easy securing that fund when you are a seed; If you are raising round A or B maybe we can say that that amount translated from the profit evaluation but you are speaking of a seed investment, not many startups get funded at that stage with that much money.

Yea on that page as described in my post, in the lower right hand corner, there is no link. Just a logo.  What is T√úV? Is that the financial authority for Germany?  Good question for the non Germans, it must be a real big deal as we see it everywhere on the page. What does it mean for the ICO itself, is the ICO checked by the T√úV. I like how you can find an English version of what all this means.   You can see the T√úV certficate on Savedroid's website, it took me one google search to find it... which took about 5 seconds...  Heres the link KRACH - https://ico.savedroid.com/resources/  Thanks for the sockpuppet response savedriod team. As with the whitepaper ""read the whitepaper it is there"" , there should be a simple answer as to what part of the ICO the T√úV checked, the answer is easy. Nothing, there is no part of the ICO that is checked by T√úV, zero, BUT it is on the ICO page where you give them money. The tone of the responses should really tell a story.   I think T√úV Saarland checked the Datasecurity for this ICO and not the ICO itself. It looks good, but is not really significant.  This would be the approprate response from the team, throw a softball and you get responses like ""look in google bro"", alright who is asking for money here?    Its ok , your data is safe with savedriod, that is why you can opt out of the marketing pop up after you buy ""Hans bought 50000 tokens from Wein"". Notification so everyone can see it when they go to the page.   There is no KYC done before you buy tokens. The default token ammount is level 2 KYC.   Some interesting questions and good to hear directly from the official savedroid team Although those streams are live, they are still quite a controled environment, it is easy to skip delete and overlook questions you do not want to answer. Better is to see what happens in a non controled environment.  At the Frankfurt Blockchain meetup the presentation spoke of shady offshore ICOs that do not protect investors. What protection do investors of savedroid have?  If needed I can find the exact timestamp of when this question was asked and we can see how it is not answered,   at all.

There are plenty that you can find that do that. The way I see their business plan is that they offer a savings platform. Right now it works with fiat, and they want to expand it to cryptocurrency. I simply think that most of the crowd they aim at (people with no technical background who find it hard to get into the crypto market) won't be interested to keep a savings account on such a volatile market. This suits more to people who invest in the market and don't mind it's volatility.  About what you said about security. I would strongly advise you against holding all your coins in their app if you care about security. Even Savedroid themselves encourage their users to use secured wallets once they feel comfortable enough doing that. Their service is all about simplicity and user friendliness, and it means that it's less secure.  I will repeat what I said in my previous post. This project has some great aspects, and their large user base and exceptional team makes it very promising. I just think they should focus on the other aspects more than the savings platform.

It's more the whole technical part with wallet, seed, private and public key (and of course security) that scare people away.

But they need to raise money ,                      again.    1) THE VISION : Is to offer an AI based crypto saving platform that is easy to use for anybody, is simple and can offer better security than others as it is based on German financial legal protections.  With the fees in the documentation of 7.5% and projected 15% a month that is not exactly the best way to save. People looking for better than 2-3% at banks will have to do a lot better since they get hit with 7.5% just to enter. Is this the kind of crypto mass adoption we want?   7 ) YOU WHAT NOW? : The way they avoid falling foul of Sharia is by not paying dividends or interest, so the gains are purely on the speculation of rates and buying low / selling high.  I guess Sharia does not mind paying 7.5% fees on each transaction.      very nice summary, thank you Unfortunately, I have no more merits to send, I guess i have to wait until someone gives me some.  for me, then point 3 of your lineup will be interesting, monthly $ 100 I put in cryptocurrencies already today, with Savedroid will it be perhaps even more successful :-) I'll download the app today to see how it works already, even if currently only Fiat can be saved  If you put monthly in 100$ go ahead and take 7.50$ out of that each month, or 90$ a year, almost the same as one month what you put away to ""save"". That means your ""savings"" (notice not investments) have to overcome a huge 7.5% spread on the buy or sell side. It might be possible, and a lot of plebs in the public dont even understand this, or dont even care, they just want to play the crypto game and get in fast and easy. Forget that they will have to overcome those fees first.  Although the aveage pleb on the street might not make this caculation the people that are good at saving and investing will, and they will see the fees and move on to cheaper waters. Since most people are not good at that, then the app should be fine.  Join telegram to earn massive ammounts of savedroid tokens",False

Seems like we have another suedo-AI based crypto savings product to consider!  Looking at the website I think it's fair to say that a great deal of thought and effort has gone into this one.  To view the official website go here ( https://ico.savedroid.com/ ), annd to see their initial YouTube on the product please go here ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRDK5aqiP1U ).  I shall give you a little break down of the white paper, though I advise any investors to do what I just did and read it in full yourself!  Here it is :  THE SAVEDROID WHITE PAPER BREAKDOWN (Read 28/1 version 1) =================================================  1) THE VISION : Is to offer an AI based crypto saving platform that is easy to use for anybody, is simple and can offer better security than others as it is based on German financial legal protections.  2 ) CONTROLS : The user control has settings where you type in how much you would like to save, and it will adjudge based on what you type, and suggest how and where you save that money for max profits.  3 ) DEMOGRAPHIC : This product is largely aimed at 25-35yr old professionals who want to save upwards of $50-100 per month, and look for a better return than the 2-3% savings accounts offer.  4 ) AUTOMATION : This product can be set up to automatically debit your account (currency) and convert this into coins in your saving account, as well as report on your spending habits via email.  5 ) MANAGEMENT : The board is mainly made up of people with actual financial and technology backgrounds, and is linked with several German financial blue chips.  6 ) ANTI DISCRIMINATION : The coins and products on offer, are and I quote ""Sharia law compliant"" and so are more than likely to be heavily backed in Islamic countries as well as Western.  7 ) YOU WHAT NOW? : The way they avoid falling foul of Sharia is by not paying dividends or interest, so the gains are purely on the speculation of rates and buying low / selling high.  8 ) OPENING EXCHANGE RATE : From the opening day the coin value is fixed at 100 SVD = 1 EURO / 0.85 USD (at todays exchange rate on Google, EURO to USD)   There you have it, the entire white paper boiled down to the 8 most important points Please drop your merits in the hat.

When shown in black and white what the industry standard is, then the goalposts are moved to ""only buying crypto with credit card"" where the model is still more expensive.  When asked about the ""hidden fees"" of other platforms there is zero response or reaction.  In general when asking about anything there is the ""read the whitepaper"" response which is not what these communication channels are for. They are indeed for communication about your project, in which you are asking money for. If you or anyone on your team is unwilling to take the few seconds to answer a question, from anyone, and instead just say ""read the whitepaper"" then you might want to sight your beg to ""stay professional here"".

Just answer :   How is introducing the ""masses"" to crypto with a 15% haircut monthly something we should be cheering about?  When I as a user find that I paid 15% in fees, why should I keep using your app, just because I like the most  expensive crypto gamification out there, when I should be thinking of saving money?  At what point will the company start buying the token on the public market as to support price, as sighted in the whitepaper itself?

You see this is at part of the root of the problem. If the questions would be answered in clear ways, there would be no need to try more than one channel. As it is the only way that one gets results, then it will be the method. If you would prefer to try and critic the mode of communication instead of answering really simple softball questions that should be able to be answered in very simple ways and distract from the matter at hand, that is up to you, however I will point out such action every single time.    Feel free to adjust it to in your opinion ""realistic"" and ""market standard"" level.  Feel free to just tell us how much the fees will be and where you came up with 7.5 and 15% . They are not taken out of the air they are from your information. When these numbers dont suit you , you say they do not apply. Again the goalposts are moved, industry standard? move goalposts, 7.5%? move goalposts....the main thing moving forward are the goalposts.    Make your own mind if this is a good business case or not. Everyone should decide on his own if he wants to invest based on these assumptions or not  Indeed, please eveyone make your own mind and decide if an app that markets itself as a savings app that charges 7.5% on every action makes sense. Also please eveyone ask yourself if we want to promote the mass adopotion of crypto on the credit card rails with fancy UI and mega high fees. Welcome to crypto, now pay high fees , thank you.

I mean  not answer as in, other questions answered and this one was not, as if it was not read. You know when you are asking for money how you typicaly answer questions, even if they have been answered before and if you want to quote the whitepepe documentation then you quote the exact page and paragraph since you are the one asking for money here.  Only after asking the question again was it even approched, otherwise it would have been swept under the rug, ignored and the bounty, pumpy pumpy questions asked by the outsourced sockpuppet service would continue.  Now lets have a look at those  ""common market practice"" numbers. Can you please breakdown how coinbase and kraken charge 7.5% , and that is not a tx fee, a tx fee is a fee on a blockchain transaction. You mean a trade fee I think. So you mean to tell me fees which are 0.2 - 0.5% plus spread is 7.5% ? Ok, lets have a look.   All prices taken from bitcoinwisdom.com orderbook display     Bitfinex BUY 11190 sell 11192 to sometimes a 10$ spread if you just watch the orderbook 7.5 % of 11190$ = 839,25 $ We dont know if there is a fee or spread when buying the tokens in order to pay this 7.5% or a tx fee to transfer to the app. Lets just say that it is ""free"".   Bitfinex with a 10$ and the trade fees (hidden?) We will just use taker, which is the higher fee of 0.2% 0.2% of 11190$ = 22,38$ + 10$ spread = 32,38$ for 1 bitcoin vs. 7.5% = 839,25$  ok great, bitfinex is offshore and made for trading, not for your average noob to buy crypto and wait for moon in a savings app. Alright lets check out coinbase. 1.5% or 3.99% with credit card  The spread is large 11318$ Sell 10984$ Buy 334$ spread Plus the trade fee 1.5% or 3.99% with Credit Card 169,77$ or 451,58$ ! with credit card 7.5% = 848,85$ Even if you add the spread 334$ and use a credit card 451,58$ (785,58$) 7.5% is still more than a small ammount higher.  Ok ok, maybe those are just the worst examples possible, lets try bitstamp, you can send a typical SEPA transaction to bitstamp and they got there start in the EU. Sell 11231$ buy 11225$ maybe sometimes a 10$ spread They have a 0.25% trade fee , they also have a 0.5% deposit fee and a 0.09% withdraw fee Lets just add all those up to 0,84% per trade, even though we wont withdraw or deposit each time we can still use it just for this example. Again we are going to buy one bitcoin. 94,34$ fees plus the 10$ spread 104,34$ sounds like a lot right? 7.5% fees which is "" common market price compared to Coinbase and Kraken (if you add their hidden fees)"" 842,32$  Im just trying to find the "" common market price compared to Coinbase and Kraken (if you add their hidden fees)"" that is anywhere near 7.5% , maybe you can break down the hidden fees or whatever it is you see that gets to 7.5%.

And the demand still remains strong after the end of the pre-sale. But don‚Äôt worry: the sale continues from February 9th as the Main Sale. And you can already secure the tokens beforehand.  Friday afternoon, January 12th, 2018: all hell breaks loose in the savedroid headquarters in Frankfurt. Every second, more orders for the SVD token come in. The interest in the first ICO of a German stock company according to German law has exceeded all expectations and gets the savedroid team into a sweat. After only seven hours, at 10pm, it is final: the ICO is a complete success. The whole allotment of 500 million tokens, which were reserved for the pre-sale, are sold out. In fact, the pre-sale was supposed to run until January 26th.  ‚ÄúWe are totally overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of our community,‚Äù says savedroid CEO Dr. Yassin Hankir. ‚ÄúThank you to everyone who has helped to make the pre-sale such a success. And now: step on the gas for the Main Sale!‚Äù Indeed, the pre-sale was only the introduction to the savedroid ICO. On February 9th, it continues with the Main Sale. Then another 5.5 billion tokens will be offered. The following terms apply: 100 tokens = 1 euro.  The Main Sale won‚Äôt have the 30% bonus anymore, which the buyers of the pre-sale got. Nevertheless, there are various bounty (bonus) programs, where it is possible to get additional tokens. You can, for example, get a 5% bonus for every token-buyer you refer. How that functions we will explain to you in the next days in this spot.  Important for everyone who is now impatiently waiting for the start of the Main Sale: you can soon go to ico.savedroid.com and add your tokens to your shopping cart, so that you can purchase them immediately at the start of the Main Sale. It is important that you get a login for this page. When the tokens are in your shopping cart, they are reserved for you, so nobody can grab them before you. We will activate this function in the coming days and inform you at that point.  Until then, the savedroid team is working on other exciting news for the cryptocurrency trading platform. With that, we will radically simplify the process of crypto saving and thereby make it as easy as using online banking. You‚Äôll be surprised at what developments we have in store for you in the coming weeks!  Join savedroid in making the world of cryptocurrencies accessible to everyone.

Learn more about savedroid's vision: https://youtu.be/YRDK5aqiP1U  x The savedroid Token x  We create an utility token with a deflation mechanism as suggested by Vitalik Buterin. savedroid tokens can be used to purchase crypto services within the savedroid ecosystem. Once tokens have been used for a purchase, we will burn a percentage of these tokens (i.e., deflation) to support the future value increase of the savedroid token. The savedroid token (ticker symbol SVD) is also already listed at various token exchanges for trading, the full list can be found on our webpage: https://ico.savedroid.com/  Using the SVDs within the savedroid ecosystem will provide additional user and network benefits  to  further  stimulate savedroid‚Äôs  growth. The process is described in details in our white paper, page 29: http://ico.savedroid.com/savedroid-ico-whitepaper.pdf  At the beginning we declared our total supply of 10 billion SVDs tokens, that will be issued on the Ethereum blockchain using a smart contract. However, it was a presumed amount because the total supply depends always on the number of tokens that have been sold.
