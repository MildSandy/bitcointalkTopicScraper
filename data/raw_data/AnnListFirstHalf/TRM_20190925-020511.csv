We also expect the first batch of ASIC miners to arrive any moment now, and as soon as they do, we begin setting them up and running tests.  The cooling system for the second farm will be different from the first generation MMU: this time the heat exchange unit will have a cold water circuit utilizing artesian well water at 8-10°C. The water will transfer the heat away down into the same well. This solution allows to cool down the heat transfer agent inside the baths more efficiently without much extra expenses.  You still have some time before the end of Post-ICO to buy TRM2 tokens and become the owner of a share in our farm's hashpower. Each TRM2 token is backed by 1Mh/sec of Scrypt algorithm mining hashpower. The revenue from mining is equally split between token holders and the company.  As opposed to cloud mining, with TerraMiner you don't just rent, but own the hashpower, which means you can sell the tokens on an exchange.

The coins mined are then sent to an exchange and swapped for ETH to be distributed between token holders. Today we are happy to announce that 100% of TerraMiner hashpower was moved to our own pool! We congratulate our investors on this step, and remind them how our new system works: now all payments are sent in ETH to investors’ wallets automatically (through a smart contract). Payouts will be done daily (subject to a minimum threshold of $50 worth). This also allows us to increase security as the company would not store funds and does not allow interactions with the wallet through the website. So even in the event where the website security gets compromised, hackers won't be able to steal investors’ profits. We also want to point out that all the funds that haven’t been withdrawn will be swapped and paid out in ETH. You can track the pool’s statistics at https://terrahash.online/",False

As you might know we've been working on overclocking our ASIC miners. Unfortunately, until now that process has been slow because it was being done remotely from Moscow. Oftentimes tuning would continue late into the night when there was nobody to reset the ASICs if and when they hang, as they usually do during such process. Not until morning that our Chinese team would be able to manually reset the frozen ASICs. Considering we have over a hundred of them, this whole process was unacceptably slow.  This is about to change with our overclocking expert going to China to get a hands-on access to the hardware. This means the farm will finally reach the target overclocking (up to 1260 MH/s per ASIC miner).  This will allow the company to finally allocate profits towards further project development including token listing on prominent exchanges as well as the promised token buyback program for 10% of the company's profits.

Starting tomorrow the bonus will drop down to 24%.  When you become our investor, you set yourself for a stress-free mining operation where we take on the responsibility of installing, maintaining and housing all the mining hardware, freeing you from the problems that usually come with such endeavour. Now TRM2 token costs $5.5, each of them backed with 1 Mh/s of hashpower from our future mining farm.  P.S. Dear investors, when you buy tokens from TerraMiner.online using Ethereum, don’t worry if you receive less tokens than you’re supposed to – the remaining amounts are transferred separately within 24 hours of the purchase!",False

The reason for that downtime is that the container is being moved.  The good news is that this downtime will be compensated for at the rate of $0.029 in BTC per TRM token, the compensation will be made after the ASICs are fully overclocked and we have migrated to our own pool, which will happen before February 10. The reason for moving the container is this: as you know, we’re preparing to build our second farm in the coming months, and we’ve already pre-ordered the first batch of hardware from the manufacturer. Then we had to make a choice and had to consider quite a few options of where to put the new containers. The best place to put them required moving the first container as well, and there is no better time to do it than during the testing phase, which did require disconnecting most of the hardware.",False

So far we have found 12 ASICs faulty in one way or another, and returned them to Innosilicon, the manufacturer. 8 units have already been replaced and we're soon to finalize their installation. Another 4 are expected to arrive in the coming weeks.  Pavel Kuznetsov's decision to build the farm, of all places, in China has paid off despite all the sharp criticism. We managed to quickly replace the defective hardware with fully functional ASICs. If the farm was some place else, it would take quite some time for the hardware to go through customs clearance alone, and that's not even speaking about other complications. Now these ASICs would probably still be on the way to China. Meanwhile our ASICs are already up and running.

We have great news for all our potential and existing investors — until the end of the pre-ICO phase (31 January 2018) everybody gets bonus tokens for investing in our project! The bonus will decrease as time goes by, meaning it’s better to invest earlier than later, at the end of pre-ICO. You can already receive your bonus TRM2:  09 Jan — 10 Jan +25% tokens 11 Jan — 17 Jan +20% tokens 18 Jan — 24 Jan + 15% tokens 25 Jan — 31 Jan + 10% tokens  All our existing investors will receive a 20% bonus to their investments! You can submit your request for bonuses on previous purchases to bonus@terraminer.online (please use the email you signed up with). One other announcement — the minimum investment bar has been lowered from $100 down to an equivalent of just one TRM2 token, which is $7. Please keep in mind that the bonus depends on the final token price you receive after the bonus. You are only eligible for the maximum bonus offered if your final token price does not fall below $3.5.  Here’s an example: You spend $700 on tokens for a price of $7 per token, which makes you eligible for a 25% bonus. You would normally receive 100 tokens, but with the bonus you actually get 125 TRM2. Final price per token becomes $5.6.  If you make a purchase for, say, 66 ETH (some $72 000) at the price of $4 per token, but your 25% bonus would make the price per token go down to $3.2 if you were to receive 22 500 tokens, and that is lower than the minimum we can offer.

Unfortunately, we ran into unexpected issues – as you know, the Ethereum blockchain is an open ledger, and all the TRM1 transactions are open source, which was taken advantage of by some sneaky characters. The dashboard on our website does not allow you to link one MEW to two different accounts, and so they went through the extensive list of TRM1 token holder addresses available on etherscan and similar block explorers and found the unclaimed addresses containing tokens. These addresses include exchange wallets, custodial wallets like coinbase and others that do not allow regular users to interact with the ERC20 tokens inside. This issue was caused by users’ sending Ethereum directly to our smart contract during the first ICO while not having the private key to the payment source address. We made the mistake of letting that slide and resending the tokens to such users as a new transaction, effectively issuing tokens twice. This left the network with quite a few extra tokens that we considered unusable until now, but as it turns out, some people managed to scope these addresses out, register new accounts and link the extra tokens, eating away at the other investors’ share of profits. Luckily, when this issue began manifesting itself, we locked down withdrawals and no coins were withdrawn by people who don’t deserve them.  To put an end to this issue we ask you to undergo a simple process of verification that will prove your ownership of the private key associated to the MEW address your account is linked to. It consists of one step – send 0.00000001 TRM from your MEW address to:  0x20C5D0a35cC469A10D48Fc92d0fc0C6a6ee490E1 Just by sending the miniscule fraction of a token you will prove your full ownership of the MEW address.  After we weed out all the extra tokens from the system, the profits will be recalculated and result in a slight increase in our investors’ profits!  We are sorry for the inconvenience, but completing this procedure is crucial to all of us. Please undergo verification before 25 January 2018. The profit withdrawal will come back on after we recalculate profits on 26 January to only accommodate verified addresses.",False

We have great news for all our potential and existing investors – starting now and until the end of the pre-ICO phase (31 January 2018) everybody gets bonus tokens for investing in our project! The bonus will decrease as time goes by, meaning it’s better to invest earlier than later, at the end of pre-ICO. You can already receive your bonus TRM2:  09 Jan — 10 Jan +25% tokens 11 Jan — 17 Jan +20% tokens 18 Jan — 24 Jan + 15% tokens 25 Jan — 31 Jan + 10% tokens  All our existing investors will receive a 20% bonus to their investments! You can submit your request for bonuses on previous purchases to bonus@terraminer.online (please use the email you signed up with). One other announcement – the minimum investment bar has been lowered from $100 down to an equivalent of just one TRM2 token, which is $7. Please keep in mind that the bonus depends on the final token price you receive after the bonus. You are only eligible for the maximum bonus offered if your final token price does not fall below $3.5.  Here’s an example: You spend $700 on tokens for a price of $7 per token, which makes you eligible for a 25% bonus. You would normally receive 100 tokens, but with the bonus you actually get 125 TRM2. Final price per token becomes $5.6.  If you make a purchase for, say, 66 ETH (some $72 000) at the price of $4 per token, but your 25% bonus would make the price per token go down to $3.2 if you were to receive 22 500 tokens, and that is lower than the minimum we can offer.

This post will cover the bounty campaign held during the first ICO. We get a lot of questions about our bounty rewards, and we’ll do our best to clear this up. Bounty campaign token allocation was set at 1% of the total amount of tokens sold, which is 1 480 TRM (total sold: 148 000 TRM). Every week during pre-ICO, ICO and post-ICO, bounty campaign participants were awarded a different number of stakes for their actions on social media. The total amount of bounty tokens was divided into sections, for example, Twitter was allocated 20%, which is 296 TRM. 524 Twitter users were awarded 7 995 stakes, therefore, 10 stakes would earn a user 0,37 TRM. Other social media platforms had the same mechanism. Bounty calculation and payment were done automatically, and after the campaign ended, its participants received their bonus tokens. That’s when we started receiving complaints about the low bonus payments, and we decided to recalculate the results. It took quite sometime, but here we are: the results came out just the same. From the mathematical standpoint, bounty rewards are 100% correct. What we didn’t take into account, however, was the human factor, we couldn’t track this issue down with this many participants, many of whom turned out to have a big percentage of bots among their followers. Unfortunately, we can’t find out the full scale of this fraud. Right now we’re developing new bounty campaign terms for the second ICO that we’re holding this December. We will contact real experts in the field and use algorithms that will allow us to eliminate cheaters and reward honest bloggers who believe in the project. We hope for your understanding and invite you to participate in the next stage of our bounty campaign. Details are coming soon, so stay tuned!

Yesterday Pavel Kuznetsov held a webinar where he told about his business trip to China and our current state of affairs. Here’s a summary for our English-speaking investors.  ✔New farm location “We decided to relocate the farm away from the hydro power plant closer to the city so that we could tap into either the hydro plant supply, or the city energy supply, which is important to avoid downtime: small hydro power plants in China don’t work year round. When the power plant is undergoing maintenance we will power the farm from the local power grid. This will cut farm downtime to mere 2 days a month on average. All the hardware will be mounted in a branded container making a convenient and mobile solution. The container itself is being prepared for hardware installation. We have concluded the rental contract with the site owner. We’re not the only mining projects on that site too, which makes it particularly special. We’ve been looking for such a place for a long time, comparing different options, and this one hits home just right. If you remember, I left Guangzhou on a quick notice, that was for negotiations with the landlord. We’re granted the space, public utilities, and an engineer to help our own engineering team with the hardware. This site also allows us to scale up our project and install as many containers as we need.”  ✔ INNOSILICON contract. Why not Bitmain? “Bitmain doesn’t sell chips separately, they only have ready-made solutions, and that’s not what we need. INNOSILICON agreed to sell us chips only. I’m also their partner on projects other than TerraMiner. We’re already receiving hardware for our other projects, that’s why we put our trust in that supplier. We visited their HQ in Wuhan and our negotiations went well into the night until almost 2 AM. The main point of negotiations was our request for them to install chips into hashboards by themselves, so that if something went wrong, we’d be able to troubleshoot quicker and eliminate the risk of our own mistakes during hardware assembly and installation. They did not take that too well initially, but gave in and agreed to make an exception for our company. Why did we decide to change our plans and order hardware assembly at INNOSILICON? Should we assemble the hardware ourselves, we won’t have the right for warranty, which is annulled in the case of a third party assembling the hashboards. That’s why we decided to assemble the first batch with the help of the manufacturer and avoid unnecessary problems. We’re likely to order our second batch assembly somewhere else, however.”   ✔ Mineral oil cooling technology “We don’t make our own cooling baths, and order them from a third company, from our own blueprint instead. We’ve already ordered and paid for them. Their manufacture takes 2 weeks and another 10 days for delivery. They arrive on 15 December, and the manufacturers are responsible for their installation as well. Baths are warranty-protected as well. For the first TerraMiner farm we placed our bets on hardware and cooling baths warranty, concluded agreements to guarantee uninterruptible power supply and keep downtime to a minimum. We could’ve assembled it all ourselves, and lose warranty because of it. Considering how one bath contains dozens of hashboards, any unscheduled repairs or failures would put almost a third of out farm’s capacity out of operation. That’s why we went the longer and more expensive route this time, which is more reliable in return – full warranty for all hardware and installation.” How does one get started in this game he knows nothing about? “Our project is just for you. You don’t have to buy a miner for $1000-$5000. Buy some tokens for as much as you want and enjoy minimal risks. You’ll see how it works. You just buy hashrate, the rest of the work is on us.”   ✔When the payouts start “The payouts begin the first day our farm is launched, and will go on for as long as the profits are higher than electricity costs.”   ✔Plans for the future “Our plans haven’t changed: we want to build a 3 terahash per second farm. We need $15 mil to do that. We’re talking with big investors, and soon we’re launching the second ICO. The first one was more of an introduction, since $2.8 per token covers hardware costs only, all other expenses aside.  We’re still paying for everything in cryptocurrency – the rent, cooling baths, chips, etc. This was the core idea of the project. During this trip to China we managed to reach all the goals that we’d set for it. So far it’s going according to plan.” We would like to remind you that our first ICO is over, and the second one starts in December. Right now you can buy TRM tokens on the EtherDelta exchange, for near ICO prices.",False

If you watched the latest video about Pavel Kuznetsov’s trip to China: https://youtu.be/qMHzxEeU6WE then you’d know that we’ve decided to place our farm somewhere different than the hydro power plant premises – in a specialized mining compound, closer to Shaoguan. This lets us power the farm from either the hydro power plant or the city power grid, protecting the farm from power outages. Besides, the compound is well guarded 24/7, and provides a mining engineer to help our team.  We will install all the hardware into an intermodal container – a metal box that can be quickly transported anywhere in the world. How is this decision beneficial to the investors and the company?    ✔ If the Chinese government decides to change its stance on mining, the project can be quickly packed up, relocated and deployed on one of our backup places. We won’t have to disassemble the miners, which decreases downtime drastically.   ✔ Intermodal containers are robust and durable, and  have been in use for decades all over the world, and a lot of times – for things other than moving cargo. There’s a whole container  city in Mexico, where these boxes make houses, kindergartens, stores, labs, etc. It’s almost a monolith structure that doesn’t need a foundation to stand strong on the ground, and it’s highly mobile by design.   ✔One of the pros of these containers is that they can be stacked, and make a structure of almost any size. Since we’re planning to scale up our project, this is the most convenient solution for us.  Just a couple of weeks left before the launch! If you haven’t invested, you can buy TRM off the EtherDelta exchange.  Invest in mining with us and enjoy your new passive income!",False

The contracts with the hydro power plant and hardware manufacturers have been signed, and farm assembly is scheduled to mid-December. After launching the hardware our investors will begin receiving dividends. We receive a lot of questions about how to join the project at this stage. Direct token sales are over, but you can still buy them off the EtherDelta exchange for great prices ►https://etherdelta.com/#0x241684ef15683ca57c42d8f4bb0e87d3427ddf1c-ETH After the farm is launched, TRM price will go up, so you better buy some now. Every token is equivalent to 1 Mh/s from the farm's hashrate. Profits will be distributed between the TerraMiner company and its token holders 50/50. It's a lifetime contract in contrast to cloud mining. Token holders will receive dividends as long as the farm brings profit. Later down the line we will launch new farms and new ICOs. Stay tuned and buy hashrate from our farm in Shaoguan, and receive mining profits from home!

A lot of you have noticed a pre-ICO timer running on our website. This is not a mistake, we really are planning a second TerraMiner pre-ICO, December 27 2017!  The new token – TRM2 – will be of a limited supply of 2 870 000 tokens. Minimum investment for a contract is $100. You will be able to manually set the ETH to USD rates and send tokens. What’s important is how all the ETH will be accrued to the beneficiary’s wallet.   TerraMiner has decided to reward everyone who’d put faith in the project before anyone else, and bought over 100 TRM during our first ICO. On the 20 December 2017 we’re launching a Pre-sale that will last exactly a week, till 26 December 2017. The price of TRM2 during the Pre-sale will be just $3.5 regardless of your investment amount in ETH! Please note that Pre-sale is only available to investors holding over 100 TRM on December 20.   Get your TRM count up to 100, or keep it at that till December 20 if you already have this many, and be the first to take advantage of the Pre-sale!

On November 4, the company ruled its local administrators to cut off power from miners since Bitcoin is illegal. This Caijing article has sparked heated discussions in cryptosphere, namely, on Reddit and Twitter. Does that mean China is imposing a ban on mining and is cutting off power from farms? Let’s preface this with saying that Sichuan energy company, just as any other, has no legal power declaring activities illegal, this is up to the government. @cnLedger on Twitter has already confirmed the company admitting the mistake. They blamed it on rushing, and now assure that they don’t take on the role of the government in deciding whether mining is legal or not. The same account explains that decision with the company’s concern for small and distant villages’ power supply. The point is, six out of nine Sichuan hydro power plants provide power to miners. The company was worried about prioritization issues that would lead to power outages in certain towns and villages, and decided to take measures. Therefore this internal document is no reason to believe that China is imposing a ban on mining. If a major gas station chain decided to stop servicing black cars, would that mean the country outlawed driving black cars? Not in the slightest. Are there grounds for concern to TerraMiner investors and TRM holders? There are none, here’s why: 1. Shaoguan, where the TerraMiner farm is located, is a 20 hours drive from Sichuan. Whatever their energy company decides has no bearing on the local power grid. 2. Shaoguan belongs to a free economic zone, providing more favourable business conditions compared to other regions in the country. Therefore any legal rulings will be adjusted with free economic zones in mind. 3. Even the most pessimistic scenarios don’t include a complete ban on mining. Energy power companies want miners to buy power for market prices instead of reduced rates. One of the largest players in the cryptosphere, Bitmain, are already buying ene rgy for market prices, and their mining revenue still exceeds energy costs. 4. Let’s consider the extreme scenario of an outright ban on mining by the Chinese government, or restrictive measures so tight that mining becomes unprofitable. Dr. Craig Wright, one of the chief scientists at nChain, reminded his Twitter followers that there are 20 more countries out there where energy is even cheaper than in China. In case everything does go south, miners can leave China and get a better deal elsewhere. 5. To conclude, let’s give TerraMiner a closer look. As we said before, Sichuan decisions don’t affect us one way or another. If the Chinese authorities do set out to ban and restrict, the project has a backup plan in Russia, Irkutsk, where electricity is even cheaper than in Shaoguan. When it comes to Russia, judging from the government statements, we can see there is no drive to ban these activities, but regulate. First Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, Sergey Shvetsov, has recently commented on the matter, unveiling plans to develop standard legal requirements to mining and ICO, and legally define cryptocurrencies, blockchain and smart-contracts by 1 July 2018. “We must create regulations that won’t smother businesses and at the same time protect investors from obvious scams”, said First Deputy Chairman. We can draw the conclusion that cryptocurrency operations and mining will remain legal in Russia, while tax and registration initiatives will come into the picture no sooner than Q1 next year. We hope this information clarified the issue for concerned investors. Any questions and comments are welcome in our Telegram chat https://t.me/joinchat/EirtT0FmYMoFY7P12HjGhQ",False

TerraMiner CEO, Pavel Kuznetsov, says hello from rainy Wuhan! South-east China is pleasant at this time of the year, with 19-20°C outside, albeit the rain is driving humidity up. The local time zone is 5 hours ahead of Moscow, so for Pavel, as well as our new supervisor Rustam Itaev and chief engineer Ruslan Sharamet, this workday began early – at 5 am Moscow time. As a destination, Wuhan was primarily interesting to us because of our key partner there – a hardware manufacturer INNOSILICON LTD, located in the Optics Valley. The meeting proved to be productive, and the parties agreed on mining hardware delivery terms and dates. INNOSILICON LTD agreed to prepare a contract, set the exact delivery date and hashboard specifications. Those who have dealt with Chinese companies know that specifications rank number one on the list of importance, otherwise the manufacturer may ship something the buyer never requested. No doubt that a major and respected company such as INNOSILICON LTD will not risk its reputation, but TerraMiner team decided to cover its bases and secure some guarantees that would protect the investors' interests. It's late night in Guangdong now, and the team headed by Pavel Kuznetsov is having some rest at the hotel. Early tomorrow morning they are setting out into the mountains – to the hydro power plant supplying the TerraMiner farm with electricity. Pavel is planning to solidify all the terms and agreements in documents as well as inspect the power station and make sure it's capable of supplying the power our future farm needs.

Yesterday we released the first news and pictures from the road. In case you missed the post, fill yourself in here: https://www.facebook.com/terraminer/posts/1914023725481740 Do you remember that Pavel and his colleagues are in a different time zone? When you were just drinking your first coffee this morning, our CEO and the team in Wuhan were boarding the train to ShaoGuan. A few hours' trip ahead before arriving at the location of our future farm. Pavel and his colleagues will check all the partnership documents signed with the hydroelectric power plant, and begin preparing the premises for hardware assembly and installation. Perhaps you heard the rumors about the recent “ban” on supplying power to miners imposed on Chinese hydroelectric stations. This is not true, and we gave a detailed statement on the issue here: https://www.facebook.com/terraminer/posts/1913913698826076 Everything goes according to plan, and now we wait for the next batch of news and photos from our colleagues in China. We would like to remind you that the post-ICO phase is over, and you can no longer buy TRM tokens off terraminer.online. You can, however, buy some on the EtherDelta exchange ►EtherDelta. Unfortunately, you can't receive bonus tokens buying TRM on an exchange, like it used to be during ICO. It's still a profitable investment while the prices haven't changed much from what we'd been offering. Tokens will begin appreciating in value as soon as we launch the farm, so if you missed ICO, head over to ►EtherDelta! Stay tuned for updates!

We have previously released some pictures and news from the road. If you missed these posts: Day 1 ►https://www.facebook.com/terraminer/posts/1914023725481740 Day 2 ► https://www.facebook.com/terraminer/posts/1914399195444193 Yesterday Pavel and his team took the train to ShaoGuan, from where they took the car to the mountains, far away from big cities, to visit the dam – and our hydroelectric station. There, Pavel, Rustam and Ruslan met with the administration to make sure everything is on schedule. Later that day TerraMiner team returned to ShaoGuan where Pavel had another business meeting. In the evening Pavel and his colleagues took a car to Guangzhou. Yesterday we told you about one peculiarity about doing business in China, namely, the need to request the precise equipment specifications. Another distinct feature is that you can't expect to do business in China from the comfort of your office in Moscow or New York. If you want to be sure everything is going as you want it to – you will have to get down there and get your hands dirty. One more important point – in China, business people and government officials value personal relationships more than anything, you should rather meet your partners in person once than exchange a thousand emails. Some people have been asking why Pavel went to China, well, this serves as another reason for that. Stay tuned to all our updates and reports from the TerraMiner trip to China. A lot of you have been asking whether or not you can still buy TRM tokens off our website. Since ICO and post-ICO are over, this is no longer available. However, TRM is listed on the EtherDelta exchange ►EtherDelta. Tokens will begin appreciating in value as soon as we launch the farm, so don't lose your opportunity now!

We decided to gather all the questions and answers in one place and post in on our website so you can always find this information. Don’t get upset if you missed the webinar: you can get a quick rundown here. If you watched the webinars, you can also skim through these posts to refresh the key points in your memory and make sure you got everything right.  When will you finally launch the farm? How many days behind schedule are you? ✔The hardware manufacturer has notified us about delivering on December 15th. Thus, we’re lagging 5 days behind, which is insignificant. I would like to remind you that we’re not buying a ready-made solution — we design our own, higher performance miners.  Why is the launch postponed? Haven’t you raised enough money during the ICO? ✔We have enough money to launch the farm at the stated capacity.  When will we see the first dividends in our wallets? ✔As it was stated earlier, the payouts begin after the farm is launched, late December.  When and why are you going to China? Why have you postponed the trip? ✔On Monday we fly to Shaoguan to sign a lease agreement with the power plant as well as a mineral oil cooling baths installation contract with the respective manufacturers. We already have visas and tickets. The trip was delayed because we were looking for the best candidate to fill the onsite project supervisor position in China. The supervisor has been found, and he’s flying with me to China, where he will stay to control the farm building process and its launch. I will return to Moscow after 10 days.  How many miners will you install? ✔According to the declared hashrate of the farm, we must make 53 miners. However, we will make more — 60 miners, to have about 20% of output as backup. This ensures that even in case of force-majeure, the farm will provide the required output.  Why is the company registered in Bulgaria? ✔I would like to remind you that the original aim of this project was to pay for all the services and equipment in cryptocurrency only, avoiding operations in fiat money and bypassing the banking system. Therefore, a legal entity in Bulgaria was created as a formality, to conclude lease agreements and hardware contracts. We are under the Bulgarian jurisdiction, but all our payments in China are made in cryptocurrency, bypassing the banks.  What guarantees can you provide to investors? ✔Token holders own the hashrate. The hardware manufacturer offers a three year warranty, and this is enough to protect the interests of TRM token holders. With those who invest over $ 10,000, we additionally conclude a pledge agreement. All payment documents with manufacturers and landlords will be released on the website upon my return from China.  When the farm is ready, will anybody be responsible for the safety of the equipment? ✔We conclude a three year lease and register it officially. It means that the landlord will be fully responsible for what is happening on our premises.  What is your plan in case mining and cryptocurrency operations in China are banned? ✔ We have a backup project ready in Irkutsk, Russia. Electricity there is even cheaper than in Shaoguan at just 5 cents per kW. We are ready to launch the Russian project as soon as we hear the official position of the authorities on the issue of cryptocurrency and mining.  How many tokens are planned for issue, and will there be a subsequent offering? ✔I would like to remind you that each token is backed by a fraction a mining farm, 1 token is equal to 1 megahash, therefore their limited number is exactly 104,600. Additional tokens can occur only if the farm gives output, which is more than the planned one.  Why can’t I buy tokens for fiat money? ✔As I’ve already said, the idea of the project was to create a real business with virtual money, and we succeeded. That’s why we do not accept investments in fiat money — only in the cryptocoins.  What are the privileges for those who invest over $ 10,000? ✔Those who invested over $ 10,000 receive a bonus in the form of additional tokens to increase their share in farm hashrate, sold by private subscription.  When will you start redeeming tokens on an exchange? ✔As it was mentioned earlier, we will redeem tokens on an exchange, on 10% of our profits. We will begin after the project launch and its first payouts, namely, sometime in January 2018.  Will it be possible to buy tokens in December? ✔In December, you will only be able to buy tokens off an exchange, if someone from existing investors wants to sell them. Therefore, I advise you to buy them now, directly through the website. It is a good deal even at price of $8.4.  Will there be new ICOs? ✔Yes, there will be new ICOs, as we will be raising more money to expand this farm. In the future, we are planning to build a 3 terahash farm. At this point we have raised about $500,000, but we would like to raise $15,000,000. The next pre-ICO period will last 2 months, so that we can hear the opinion of investors who have already entered the project with large investments, and agree on the terms. If you still have questions on these topics, ask them in this chat and we will answer. Stay tuned and share our project with people interested in cryptocoins and investments.",False

All the mining rigs in the whole world are already consuming more power than the country of Iceland – can you imagine that? Miners have to improve their performance in order to keep up with the growing complexity of network. In other words, they are forced to upgrade their equipment on a regular basis. One can’t implement it at an easy rate due to high prices and complicated logistics of freshly released mining gear. To sum up, the best days of independent mining enthusiasts are long gone. A homemade rig is now just a trinket, not a substantial source of income. The industry becomes more and more centralized. Cloud mining companies and big farm owners are now the chief stakeholders in the field of digital currency. Terraminer is aware of these tendencies. That’s why we decided not to make a shift with our already operating farms, although they are extremely profitable. This fall we launch a new efficient farm in Shaoguan, China, where the mining process will be conducted by means of INNOSILICONE A4+ chips that can perform at as high as 3,8 Mh/sec. You can join us by purchasing the TRM tokens at the POST-ICO stage of our project. To learn more, visit https://terraminer.online/ Please feel free to contact us via Facebook “Contact us” form.

How do you feel about the cryptocurrency boom, do you consider the blockchain technology and cryptomoney to be an effective financial instrument? I believe that the cryptocurrency is the first step towards the future of our society, and its boom is inevitable. Blockchain technology is the result of a massive frenzy for cryptocurrency. However, many people aren’t aware or underestimate its prospects. For better understanding of the blockchain system importance, one can take as an example the Ethereum Blockchain. At the moment, there is an Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), which includes large companies such as Microsoft, Intel, BP, Credit Suisse. This only proves how reliable the blockchain system is. Do you think investing in cryptomining is profitable? Isn’t it easier to invest in traditional assets, as business, phiatic currency, securities, etc.? At the moment investing in cryptomining is extremely profitable, as the prices of cryptocurrencies are growing every day. In addition, cryptomining investments do not require huge funds to get a good profit, unlike other kinds of investments. What do you think of TerraMiner project?

What makes the TerraMiner project different from other mining farms? Three main differences of the project from others: • The Terraminer farm will work on the unique equipment inaccessible to ordinary miners, with A4+ chips • Everyone and not just large companies can become the co-owner of the farm capacities • Getting TerraMiner tokens, investors become co-owners not only of the farm, but also of its equipment. They buy ready-to-work capacities for cryptocurrency production and can gain income from them right after the beginning of the farm work. 2. Who can buy the project tokens? Anyone can buy the project tokens and become its investor – but only till December 1. After that sale of tokens to investors will stop. 3. What TerraMiner tokens purchase gives to investors? Tokens are provided with the mining equipment. The more tokens – the more equipment, the more bitcoins are produced the higher is daily income. Capacities of the project aren't rented, but are bought and become the investor's property. 4. When the first dividends payment is planned? In two months after the ICO launch. 5. Is it possible to sell TerraMiner tokens? Yes, after POST-ICO tokens will be traded at the EtherDelta exchange for $8.4. The owner will be able to sell them any time – thus having transferred the rights for the equipment and income gained from it to the buyer. 6. Are there any discounts for tokens at the project initial stages? In the ICO period tokens can be bought at 40% discount. The price of each one will be $5. The ICO expiration date is on November 1, 2017. Then within a month tokens will be sold at full cost. After that the tokens release will stop – they can only be sold.",False

I’m wary of any kind of boom. There are always those who blindly rush into any trend, and those who want to make money on a frenzy. However, fortunately, there are always those who embrace trends as an opportunity to to widen the scope, and leverage new possibilities to benefit not only themselves, but also the community. The same is relevant for the cryptoindustry: I trust only those projects that are responsibly approaching the matter. In general, blockchain technology is interesting, as it eliminates intermediaries in transactions and therefore gives people access to financial instruments at a minimum cost. You are an employee of an oil company. Do you think it’s true that oil and other non-renewable energy sources are gradually losing ground? Or vice versa, oil and gas are reliable, unlike digital and crypto, for the latter are not more than just a fashion? For many years I’ve heard rumors that oil and gas will soon become irrelevant. But let’s be honest: most of modern production, transport systems and other spheres of life go with traditional energy sources. Of course, there is a future for renewable resources, but this future will not come at a blink of an eye: it will take decades to gradually reconfigure existing equipment. I think that in the modern economy there is a place for both proven resources and the new ones, among which are digital and crypto. Do you think investing in crypto mining is profitable? Isn’t it easier to invest in traditional assets, as business, phiatic currency, securities, etc.? Any investor will confirm that you shouldn’t “keep all the eggs in one basket”. It is worthwhile to have different instruments in your investment portfolio, including precious metals, securities, venture investments and cryptocurrencies. What do you think of TerraMiner project? How do you feel about the idea of ICO, do you think the company is promising, is it worth to trust the guarantees? When evaluating any new project, I look at the experience and previous projects of the team members. I’ve seen a lot of bright-eyed youngsters with ideas “worth of a million”, but even the best idea is doomed if a person simply does not know how to manage business processes, delegate responsibilities, negotiate with suppliers, etc. In the TerraMiner project, it is important for me that the founders already have successfully operating cryptomining farms, as well as vast experience in related areas — business, programming and marketing. I also see that the headhunters of Pavel Kuznetsov managed to gather a “golden team”, where everyone fits together perfectly. Therefore, I’m not surprised when I look at the success of the project, and see lots of people buying tokens. What would you recommend those who want to invest in cryptocurrencies and in our company? I advise those who are still in doubt, to invest only in those projects where they purchase not only “thin air”, but something tangible, for example, a share in capacity, — that’s how project “TerraMiner” works. Also I advise them to choose those projects in which there is an opportunity to sell a share on the exchange, because there’s always a chance that you’ll need your money back at once. TerraMiner provides token holders this possibility as well. As concerning those who plan to invest in this project, I advise them get acquainted with the whitepaper and feel free to ask all the questions to the customer support service. As far as I know, they are quick to answer in social networks, by email and by phone. And, of course, good luck!",False

If not, is it not easier to have your own farm? Is the risk of investing in the TerraMiner project justified? My dear, here we must run as fast as we can, just to stay in place. And if you wish to go anywhere you must run twice as fast as that. Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland “Mining is no good these days, go find a job!” You’ve probably heard or read this joke if you hang out with crypto enthusiasts or follow them on social media. They complain and droll, but they are still there and don’t even consider a possibility to quit. Why? Although the easy money was scooped out by the pioneers long time ago, the blockchain technology and cryptocoin mining still has quite a lot to offer. We can lament as long as we can about the times when bitcoin was sold for a dozen of bucks, but it changes nothing. “If I knew”, they say, but let’s admit: you never know. If there’s a venture that is extremely profitable — it’s risky at the same time. The question is, do you understand all the details about the asset you’re purchasing, and do you have enough nerve to take the risk. At the webinar on Nov. 24 Pavel Kuznetsov, the CEO at TerraMiner, was asked if it were profitable to invest $10,000 in TRM tokens. “If that’s all you have, then think twice”, Pavel suggested, and went on “but if you have several sums like that in your disposal, it would be a misstep not to invest one of them into a reliable cryptocurrency project”. Ok, but wouldn’t it be smarter to assemble my own small mining rig worth of $10,000 and get my income dripping little by little? Yes, mining is available for everyone, but small scale miners will sooner or later find out that all the earnings are being spent on maintenance, spare parts and electricity bills. Even if you managed to find a location with a cheap or even chargeless electricity, you still have to deal with equipment, troubleshooting, power cuts, legal issues, hackproofing, shipping delays, etc. It’s time to face the fact: only those of us with high-powered gear are able to profitably extract altcoins and bitcoins nowadays. The TerraMiner project offers an opportunity for everyone to buy a share in a large mining pool with an impressive hashrate. Situated in the free economic zone at Shaoguan, China, the TerraMiner farm leverages the low electricity fare due to the local power station to provide a sustainable income for the token holders. “Risky,” they say, but can you think of a reliable asset where low risks meet high profitability? We don’t think so. Those who now rue the days when bitcoins were cheap, will soon rue the days when TRM tokens were cheap. So now is the “make it or break it” moment. Join the TerraMiner project, if you share our vision! All you need is a BitcoinWallet and MyEtherWallet. For more details, visit https://terraminer.online/ Questions and comments are welcomed.

That’s how the founders of TerraMiner project came up with an idea of an ICO as a crowdfunding tool for a high-performance mining farm construction. To ensure a superior profitability, they started researching in order to find the best technical solution for the project.

During the run-up stage we decided to adopt a fair and user-friendly model of allocating the profit. It occured to us that a smart contract would be the best option for an error-proof distribution of earnings beyond hackers' reach. A smart contract is a savvy software that automatically implements business dealings through a blockchain. Daily reward is suchwise distributed among the token holders according to the amount of their tokens. This scheme ensures that your profit depends on your contribution to the overall system. As you already know, the payout will be in BTC. Users are free to keep their gainings with a likelihood of growth or withdraw them and turn into phiatic currency. We consider it to be a robust and viable pattern of running the project, and more than 200 investors from all over the world relied upon our expertise to mould and shape a profitable mining enterprise that provides stable income. As usually, feedback and shares are more than welcomed. Please let us know what you think of us by commenting the post.",False

I looked up this company after watching a youtube video add interupt the video i was watching where the guy claimed that the gpu setup he had was purchased for over $300,000. I will admit that there r alot of video cards in the images and videos but i find it hard to believe the cards cost over $300k including the psus and cheap mobos/proc/ram combos used to run the cards. Thats the first flag for me.  the second red flag is that the company took the name of a well known asic manufacturer that scammed many customers outta alotta money before filing for bankruptcy which no smart business wants to build on a name that 1 isnt theirs to use and 2 is associated with such a terrible string of events like the real terraminer company is. did they not spend the 5 seconds googling the name before ripping it off??  the third is they promise pretty big returns on your investment and that should always be a red flag. even if they say ""once we launch the tokens will be worth xxxx dollars"". did u guys forget josh garza and his hugeeeeeee paycoin scam where he promised a $20 floor on each and every coin which was never honored?  the 4th is if u had $300k to invest on video cards but need money from people to support ur expansion its safe to assume u didnt make back the full investment yet correct? if u had u would have $300k available right now to buy hardware from hardware makers and 300k in hardware will go a very very long way to fill up a new mining location. even 200k with the other 100k going towards the setup and building rental the machines will go into. this to me sounds like u signed up for big costs and before making it back u want others to pay for ur expansion before making back when u invested which is too much at one time. its a huge gamble at these peoples expense and the numbers r claiming wont happen once the november and oct batches of miners from the multiple manufacturers start shipping.  the final reason is the crazy amount of double trippe octo posting these people are doing. often times posting random questions and answering those questions like they are coming from actual customers every couple of hours. im not sayin these guys r scammers but how can a company sell hashing power on their service forever? no miner lasts forever and the costs of running that miner isnt forever. if u pay $100 for power costs and that covers 1 year of what they pay for power what do you think happens after that 1 year?? that $100 ran out.....someone has to pay the power costs and u paid for ""forever"" so do you think a company can survive by paying more than it brings in until the end of time??  Maybe im not understanding the concept of this investment or maybe im much more skeptical than others but i feel like the people posting claiming this sounds great are either shills or they are new to crypto and havent taken the time to read the literally hundreds and maybe even thousands of posts about companies offering ""too good to be true"" returns.",False

In the very beginning we had a belief that there is a better way to benefit from cryptocurrency mining than a noisy and red-hot homemade mining rig. Our two high-end mines in action were a living demonstration of it. But we aimed even higher. As the crypto industry became more and more crammed, we realized that a group of enthusiasts must come together to create a mutual enterprise for a better partaker experience. That's how we came up with an idea of an ICO as a crowdfunding tool for a high-performance mining farm construction. To ensure a superior profitability, we started researching in order to find the best technical solution for our project. We scrutinized the latest releases and ascertained the reputation and expertise of companies all over the world. We also kept in mind that our partner to-be should be located not far from our future farm to decrease the fare expenses. It was also significant to us to obtain a fully customizable product. It took us quite a while to figure out that our best option is INNOSILICON Technology LTD. The company has multinational R&D teams in China and North America that collaborate to provide customers with right-on digital solutions. We've discussed our expectations with INNOSILICON and were convinced that they are good for the job. Terraminer farm will run on ASIC miners, which will use A4+ chips from INNOSILICON Technology LTD. These chips provide the utmost output along with a frugal power consumption. To learn more about the technical issues of the project and check out the scans of our contract with INNOSILICON Technology LTD, head to terraminer.online.

Some people see them as a threat to the global economy, others joyfully embrace them as tools of great use for creating a new worldwide financial system, a more transparent and fair one. In this post we’d like to share with you our thoughts upon the matter. In Terraminer we believe that people from all around the globe have an equal right to access handy financial tools for quick and chargeless money transfers, safe online shopping without a necessity to reveal personal data, trading financial derivatives, etc. However, the traditional economy that is operating by means of banks and governmental supervision does not allow individuals a freedom of action. And vise versa, blockchain technology and digital currencies cut out any kinds of obstacles, because they don’t belong to anyone, and therefore imply no extra expenses. The system is powered by computing capacities of crypto enthusiasts’ equipment all over the world. Blockchain algorithm, for its part, is in fact a distributed public ledger that makes it possible to record all the transactions. How about a way to manage a business, store savings, buy goods and make secure money transfers in a blink of an eye with no bank fees? That’s the tomorrow of economy, and we at Terraminer do our best to make it happen. If you share this vision, let us know in comments. It’s always encouraging to meet like-minded people.

We hear the question way too often to ignore it. This concern is quite understandable, since there are several ICO launches every day. Every participant has to be aware of our advantages before he decides to contribute to our ICO campaign. ✔First and foremost, this is not a startup. We already own two profitable farms equipped with mining gear that is worth $300,000 approximately. We know all the weak spots of the business and are capable of covering them up. Moreover, we take into account our previous mistakes to make sure we perform better every day. ✔Since we rely not only on raised funds, but also on our own finances, the project will be launched anyway regardless of the amount of money raised via selling tokens. It also means that you can benefit from participating in the campaign this December, not in distant future. ✔ We give you a wide range of options. In the post-ICO period you can keep your tokens and have a share in our productive capacity and income, or you can sell your tokens any time for a good price. ✔ We don’t conceal our faces, names, and whereabouts.

Therefore production and technological giants join together creating new large-scale bitcoin services and mining farms modern capacities of which allow to increase cryptocurrency production considerably. Ordinary miners won't be able to compete with them – but they have an opportunity to become investors of projects available to ordinary citizens.  One of the first such projects was Giga Watt farm created by the MegaBigPower company and the Cryptonomos blockchain platform. An opportunity for Giga Watt tokens ownersto lease capacities of a farm or to establish on them own miners for different cryptocurrencies production became the main idea of this project. At the same time capacities in the form of power supply and service center maintenance are offered for miners located directly on Giga Watt mining farm in the USA.  What does it mean to become the TerraMiner project tokens owner? Leading companies on production of the mining equipment INNOSILICON Technology LTD and J&W IPC Technology Development Ltd have gone further and have begun work on the TerraMiner project. The TerraMiner mining farm will be situated in China, in the area where electricity consumption is subsidized by the government and costs much lower than anywhere. Besides the farm will be near equipment producers that allows to reduce the expenses on transportation significantly increasing its prime cost. The main difference between this project and others is that getting TerraMiner tokens, investors become co-owners not only of the farm, but also of its equipment. They don't need to think about how to establish their own miners on it or to lease the part of capacities – they buy capacities already ready to work for cryptocurrency production and can make profit out of them right after the beginning of the farm work. No additional actions for this purpose are required. The farm maintenance will be conducted by its organizers. And the most important thing is that TerraMiner tokens owners will be able to sell them any time they need. There are no temporary restrictions on tokens possession - and, respectively, on the mining farm equipment. The project organizers offer investors highly liquid property - and it makes TerraMiner unique among other cloud mining projects.  Besides, the TerraMiner investors can be sure that they buy the best modern mining equipment, the largest and most powerful Scrypt-ASIC miners on A4+ chips with oil cooling. The equipment of such level and power is inaccessible for owners of house farms, and it allows to extract the maximum cryptocurrency amount. Thanks to it the farm will work most effectively – and anyone can become its co-owner. At the same time at the construction stage it's possible to buy mining equipment capacities much cheaper, than to order of already prepared standard options from producers. Before launch of the first stage farm investors can get its capacities at the 40% discount.

It has to be an area not far from the equipment manufacturer, with cheap electricity and labour, cool climate and favorable legislation considering cryptocurrency mining. China is generally known as a country that has what it takes to launch and maintain a business from scratch. However, in recent times the government started to impose restrictions, and crypto enthusiasts are now concerned about their existing or prospective enterprises. As you probably know, we are going to build our mining farm in Shaoguan, the northernmost prefecture-level city of Guangdong Province. This area is a free economic zone, so you don't need to worry about the restrictions. Electricity is extremely cheap here, it will cost us as little as $0,05 for 1 kw-hr. Our ASIC A4+ miners are assembled not far from this place, and it reduces delivery expenses of spare parts and ready-made equipment. As you see, we singled Shaoguan out as a best option for subduing bare costs of running a cryptocurrency mining business. Our goal is to maximize profitability, so that you'd have a superior ROI.

We are eager to introduce you the people behind Terraminer and briefly detail their remit and scope. We hope to bring to your notice how they made a difference in their previous roles, and how they’re contributing to our project right now. Pavel Kuznetsov is the founder and CEO of Terraminer. He holds more than two decades of experience as a certified mathematician, project manager and a major executive. After his graduation from Moscow State University, where he studied higher mathematics, Pavel started his career as a researcher at Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics in the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow. To improve his knowledge of business management, Pavel entered Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration. After becoming qualified in this field, Pavel brought his experience in calculus, probability, statistics and matrix algebra to business area. He proved that business management can be done way more effectively, when there’s a mathematician involved. Prior to Terraminer, Pavel held senior positions in a Russian-German joint venture IVOTECH. Founded in 2008, the company has become a leading developer of computer accessories, including wireless gear and storage enclosure. In his time at IVOTECH, Pavel has led process improvements by focusing on finding ways to help customers achieve greater value from their enterprises. Later Pavel was invited to join the “MAKS Insurance Company JSC”, one of the top insurance companies in Russia. As a head of the department, Pavel was responsible for the calculation of the drug provision program for customers. He leveraged his academic research experience and profound skills in economics and management to develop and implement a system of preferential drug provision in Russia. Pavel has always excelled at identifying new opportunities, therefore when cryptocurrency became a global phenomenon, he could not but joined the stream. He made great use of his maths and business knowledge and experience by launching two successful cryptomoney mining projects, but this was not enough for him. As a visioner, Pavel sought an opportunity to bridge the gap between those who have access to a powerful mining equipment, and those who don’t. That’s how he came up with an idea of Terraminer project. Then he handpicked his team members, who were intended to be not just a workforce, but a well-rounded and complementary team. That was the message for today. In future posts we will continue to introduce you the Terraminer team, so stay tuned!",False

Today, there are few people who relate dull miners or under mining to it's significance being a complex technological process of issuing a certain cryptocurrency.   To facilitate the understanding of the process and get rid of unnecessary terminology, we suggest examining the nuances of mining using the example of one cryptocurrency - Bitcoin. In a broad sense, mining is an issue of cryptocurrency, based on the distributed computing work of users' computers located around the globe. The implementation of mathematical algorithms, or rather the scope of this work, determines the probability of obtaining a reward - units of cryptocurrency, that is, Bitcoin. There is no single control center for this activity, which guarantees its safety. Why this process was called mining? Because at some point Bitcoin was called digital gold. In order to penetrate into the essence of cryptocurrency mining, you need to arm yourself with special knowledge, or at least a minimal understanding of the relevant terminology. What is the work of the miner and why does he get a reward for it?  All the Bitcoin transactions are recorded in a special log, which is then passed on to the miners who, using the capabilities of their own equipment, try to calculate one single hash value that matches the private key and new transactions. As soon as this happens, a new block is generated. The computed hash is the hash of the previous block, and collectively this is called a blockchain (chain of blocks). For the generation of each new block, there is a reward - in fact, a unit of cryptocurrency. Why do cryptocurrencies need miners? At least the miners of the XXI century ensure the stability and efficiency of the entire world cryptocurrency system, since the more people who use Bitcoin, the wider is the decentralization becomes.  The first thing to consider after reading all of the above, is why do I still stay aside from mining? Purely having a computer and a stable broadband connection to the Internet, anyone can replenish the multi-million army of modern miners. However, the effectiveness of solo-mining today, most likely, will tend to zero. The fact is that the distribution of Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency between the miners directly depends on how many people are engaged in this activity and what aggregate capacities they have. So if in 2009 the extraction of digital currency using the private processor, and then the video card, also guaranteed a stable (and sometimes even high) income, now this activity has almost no sense. For the last 3 to 5 years, entire data centers have grown in all corners of the globe, which the only purpose is Bitcoin mining. The most modern equipment is installed there, the hardware of which (ASIC chips) is optimized for mining. Each data center has tremendous processing power (from 0.1 to 1 - 2 percent of the total computing power of the Bitcoin network). To compete with such monsters makes no sense for ordinary users.  The only possibility to jump onto the departing train is to try to study the cryptocurrencies in second and third place, the amount of calculation of which is still at such a level that a small farm of 3 - 5 - 10 powerful video cards can guarantee a stable inflow of coins. However, you need to understand that the cost of an admission ticket even to this sector is at least 2,000 - 2,500 thousand dollars, not counting the cost of electricity. Plus, no one guarantees that the cryptocurrency, which you have been mining diligently for the past few weeks, will not turn to be a scam within a month.  Another, affordable option - an alternative to regional mining - the purchase of capacity in an operating farm, such as TerraMiner. Today, the launch of one small farm can go up to $ 10,000, in the project TerraMiner buy 1Mh / s capacity can be priced from $ 2.8. The company will take on the solution of such problems as high noise level; expenses for equipment rent; payment of bills for electricity; problems with warranty equipment; constant monitoring of equipment. Further - all the income from the mining is divided between the company and the investor 50/50.  Want to learn more about how to become a $ 2.8 farm owner?

Therefore, they looked forward to the announcement of the entry of a new Antminer L3+ into the market, so that they can upgrade their farms.  Bitmain released Antminer L3+ only in April-2017, it is sold as a limited edition offering — only to order making it impossible to find them on the open market. It is no wonder that today Antminer L3+ is the most powerful Scrypt-ASIC miner with 288 chips and the highest hash rate in comparison with its analogues. It has a small payback period even when used at home farms – and in large data centers, there are thousands of such miners that can start to bring net income to owners even earlier. Therefore preorders for Antminer L3+ considerably exceed the volume of released batches. Besides dealers  interfered the process buying out miners for resale at  price several times increased.   How Do Dealers Influence Farm Equipment Payback  While dealers establish Antminer L3+ price much higher than producers, the equipment payback period considerably increases. Respectively, receiving income is postponed also. Therefore those who want to gain income as fast as possible prefer to invest not in an upgrade of old ones, but in new projects, the equipment for which is already purchased and installed. One of such projects is the TerraMiner – the largest mining farm in China. The first stage of its equipment is already tested and will be launched closer to New year. The equipment of the second stage now undergoes the mounting process. It was purchased directly from producers at the optimum price – therefore investors will begin to make profits in three months. This profit is predicted to be at the level of 300%. Cryptoinvestors can buy project tokens already now on the website terraminer.online. Within October their cost will be $5, since November, 1 the price will be raised.

Let's consider this question on example of the TerraMiner large project offering to investors the most transparent cooperation conditions. If you make investments in your own equipment then in case of its failure or obsolescence your money just burn down. You should make investments again. If it's about cryptoinvestments into TerraMiner, then you buy not the equipment, but the part of profitable farm capacities. Whether the equipment at the farm work or it should be replaced – the investor doesn't need to pay extra money, his rights for the equipment aren't lost, he keeps the share of property and gains income proportional to quantity of his tokens. Another advantage is that you don't need to personally conduct farm maintenance and to control its work. While cryptoinvestments make profit, you go take care about your own business. As the future is about such large-scale projects like TerraMiner, the farm investors can be sure of their income stability – unlike small miners.

All the mining rigs in the whole world are already consuming more power than the country of Iceland – can you imagine that? Miners have to improve their performance in order to keep up with the growing complexity of network. In other words, they are forced to upgrade their equipment on a regular basis. One can’t implement it at an easy rate due to high prices and complicated logistics of freshly released mining gear. To sum up, the best days of independent mining enthusiasts are long gone. A homemade rig is now just a trinket, not a substantial source of income. The industry becomes more and more centralized. Cloud mining companies and big farm owners are now the chief stakeholders in the field of digital currency. Terraminer is aware of these tendencies. That’s why we decided not to make a shift with our already operating farms, although they are extremely profitable. This fall we launch a new efficient farm in Shaoguan, China, where the mining process will be conducted by means of INNOSILICONE A4+ chips that can perform at as high as 3,8 Mh/sec. You can join us by purchasing TRM tokens during the ICO phase of our project. Don’t miss a chance to buy tokens and get a bonus. This offer is only applicable to purchases for a total of $10,000 and more. To find out more, visit https://terraminer.online/ Please feel free to contact us via Facebook “Contact us” form.
