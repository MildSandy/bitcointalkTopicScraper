This is a sandbox for startups and many established companies tried to get the spot. There were almost 400 of them. This is made together with UK regulators on all fields.  They will try to find a way how to help such startups with getting licenses and setting new laws needed for this new Tech and Blockchain companies.  This is huge news and together with this last info about the 3rd China Innovation event the price of ATL token should move up but this is not happening because Atlant has literally done nothing with this news.  I don't understand this straight very politics they have, that there will be marketing only with truly working products and licenses in place.

There are 2 bounty payments left for bounty hunters which were eligible for payout, done full KYC and whitelisted their ETH address used for to bounty signup and this cost additional 1ETH.  One will not get unpaid bounty back!!! If one missed few rounds and will whitelist today then will be paid only in this last two months. Atlant will not pay for this month were one were not whitelisted or missing KYC. I think this is another red flag. They changed rules to almost 2 years distribution and if you don't follow closely every month then you will lose your ATL tokens.  There are many people who did all that was required and don't come back because there is no need or they just forgot about it. Bounty hunters should be time, 3 or 6 months for such changes and Atlant did it from week to week. Another successful attempt to scam bounty hunters.  This is what makes Atlant looks so ugly. How they treat their investor and bounty hunters after ICO. During the ICO they were the best and creators of success and just after the biggest enemy and banned all of them from Telegram and closed all threads even before full bounty distribution.

Atlant is accepted by The Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN), a cross-border regulatory sandbox for firms testing innovative financial products, services or business models across multiple jurisdictions, to participate in the programme.  Chaired by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, the GFIN comprises 29 regulatory bodies from across the world. In January it put out a call for applications from banks and fintech companies interested in the fast-track opportunities for authorization implicit in the initiative.  From a total of 44 applicants, the GFIN has selected eight firms for an initial cross-border trial of the service. These include Onfido, Tradle, Ascent RegTech Starling Trust, Alphapoint, Coinvestion, DACX and Atlant.  The evaluation report comes as the FCA unveils its fifth and biggest sandbox cohort to date, comprising 29 firms with propositions across a range of hot-button innovation areas, including digital identity, tokenization of financial assets and financial inclusion.

I see a change of -50% for ATL token only today and the entire week price was dropping despite the market was green and many alts gained 100 or more percent. We can clearly see there are no new investors interested in Atlant and holders (like me) have enough and dump their holdings to invest in better performing altcoins. This is not surprising and I thought that will happen a lot faster.  There is no product, no roadmap, nothing. All we have is a demo which is not enough even for toughest believers to stay. I don't see any talks in Telegram and when people ask for licenses the only answer they get is ""we can't disclose any information"".  We can easily assume that price will be falling further and is already too late to abandon the ship so all holders will sink together with the team.  Finally, Atlant token will be delisted from HitBtc and that would be the end of the story. Only 6 to 12 months that is all that it would take. I will come back here and quote myself at this time to confirm my prediction which is harsh but this is the reality, sorry. I was truly a supporter but there are too many red flags now and the price shows the real value of this project.  Even one big investor not left and new once run away when they see what is going on. I tried to convince one big fish a few months ago when we were discussing projects. At the start when he heard about Atlant and what it is all about he was very enthusiastic and jumped into research. After few days he laughs me in the face and said that he is an investor, not a gambler and even if he would be a gambler he will never invest because there are no chances for Atlant to be successful and finally start a working product. The product would be already ready and used even without licenses as a prelaunch or something to gain investors by showing real value.  Atlant team is taking a nice salary each month, travel the world, visit conferences and take their time to build a perfect product as they say.

Of course, since the dev team was well-funded, they continued to work and then eventually traders and investors took notice and some of them jump into 4x to 10x instantly because the volume was less than $1,000 worth.

Until today there is even no demo for rentals and Atlant has in plans to finish the demo soon. They are waiting for licenses to trade and issue securities but nobody knows where and how.  I kept asking about P2P rentals here in this thread multiple times and never got an answer.  For me, there is no logic in what Atlant team is doing because everybody knows from the start that tokenization can be even not possible at all at this time because of the lack of regulations. That is why the first thing which should be developed by Atlant team is the P2P rentals platform because this is possible to start from today.  Atlant was advertised as an Airbnb killer during the ICO with an added platform for tokenization properties and they said that P2P rentals are almost ready to launch just after ICO. 2 years later we are still waiting and if we ask something they say: ""We can't disclose any more information about licensing"" or ""updates are published frequently in our blog"".  There should be P2P rental platform already in place and running which would bring customers, investors, volume and awareness for the project and ATL token. Then in the meantime, Atlant team could slowly work at developing tokenization platform and wait for licensing when there is a product in place already up and running. Am I right?  Ask yourself if this would be your project and all money invested was yours would you do it as I said above or like Atlant team does actually?

If you will look videos on Atlant YouTube channel (if not removed) from the time before ICO you will see how the CEO Jullian says to the audience live that: ""P2P rentals platform is already ready and Atlant can start just after ICO and frankly even today (months before ICO) it would be possible"".  2 years later and we have nothing only demos (a child at age 14 is able to do in 2 days.  Nobody answered my question: ""Why Atlant is waiting with P2P rentals platform and keep developing the tokenization platform if there are no regulation and licenses in place?  Why they wait with P2P? Why?Why?Why? Quote Tomas Atl: We’re not unable to release, it just naturally takes time to develop outstanding P2P platform. It could have been rolled out by now, but we don’t make compromises and are trying to make the platform better than anything else out there. ETA is Q1 for the first P2P release, make sure to stay tuned Aaa, I know... they want it to be perfect. Now, this is a different story. Yea sure Atlant take your time no hurry.   ...If I can't help the team to make it fast, at least I can make the atmosphere stay positive and let the team do all the things needed. Afaik keep complain everyday doesn't help the token price. No matter if you pour perfume on shit, it will stink anyway.",True

These smart contracts resemble the usual microservices in a web application architecture, each having an API and dependencies. With growing amounts of services in distributed applications, challenges with deployment and data management become very significant. The problem is being solved by leading tool sets such as the Truffle framework, however with high amounts of overhead that might not be needed by all developers.  Inspired by Ansible Playbooks, ATLANT’s Ethereum Playbook is a declarative tool for comprehensive DApp automation, while remaining as minimalistic as possible. As a part of the ATLANT team’s open-source effort to make Ethereum development easier, Ethereum Playbook is the first step towards simple yet flexible and powerful DApp management.  Released as a command-line application, this tool is intended for ease of use and does not have a steep learning curve.  Ethereum Playbook greatly simplifies working with Ethereum DApps, allowing for seamless configuration and deployment of numerous DApps without losing control over the decentralized infrastructure.  The Playbook uses a simple and clean YAML syntax for creating static specifications. The flexibility of declarative configuration brings confidence into your decentralized application development lifecycle irrespective of the size of target deployment: single DApp or multiple DApp infrastructures.  Ethereum Playbook is not an integral part of the ATLANT platform, rather, it is used to facilitate DApp management within the platform as an internal product. We have decided to release the first public version of the Ethereum Playbook in an attempt to spark further development, laying foundation for a new community-driven project targeting Ethereum developers worldwide.  Download Ethereum Playbook:  https://github.com/AtlantPlatform/ethereum-playbook/releases/latest  Release builds available for Windows, OS X and Linux.

ATLANT’s Motivation  There are several security token standards which have been proposed recently, however ATLANT team has concerns about most of these proposals. In our view issues stem mainly from the scope of each of the EIPs, which contain many project or market-specific details. Since many EIPs were designed and backed by for-profit companies, they capture niche requirements which are excessive for general use cases. Further explanations and rationale with examples and case studies are available in the original draft of the ERC-1462 standard.  ATLANT proposes an EIP which is simple, yet modular solution to creating base security tokens for the widest possible scope of applications. ERC-1462 is designed so that it may be used by issuers out of the box, or be built and improved upon. Other issuers are able to add further restrictions and policies to their tokens, using proposed functions and implementation, yet their creativity will not be limited in any way, while using ERC-1462.  We believe that a pragmatic approach is necessary to create a clear and concise general security token specification. Due to this approach, ATLANT’s proposed ERC-1462 draft has now become the first merged standard draft addressing the general case of Security Token utilization on the Ethereum blockchain. We continue collecting feedback from the community, as well as developing our own projects which leverage ERC-1462.  For further details, please visit the EIP-1462 page for ATLANT’s proposed security token standard in the EIPS section of the Ethereum.org website.",True

Just watch youtube videos from the Atlant official YouTube channel and you will see. Of course if these videos are still there not deleted.  As I said, I thought before and during ICO that the certification will be the biggest problem because nobody has done such things before and of course, I shared my fears on Telegram and asked many questions about this subject. Like I told you I was banned and at the start, I have heard that they are almost there (as always) and during the time when more people started to ask the same questions, first of all, they stopped to talk about this topic and later found an excuse that this information can not be disclosed because they can't preannounce this and is kept secret as an agreement.  I asked many detailed questions: - where Atlant asked for certification, license. - what for license or certificates. - how far they are already. - how much time is needed approximately?  Of course (like I said before) never got a proper answer only ""we are almost there"" in begin of the ICO and ban from Telegram group a few weeks later.  I have to add that despite all these shady moves from Atlant with bounty distribution, lack of information, bad support, problems with team leaders, massive Telegram bans and many more.  I am still a supporter of this project and wish them all the best. I see that the CEO is very involved and development is ongoing of course not without problems and delays.

Let us all be fair guys. You know, this project had somehow failed the bounty participants early on.  KYC per se is something I admit is almost necessary nowadays, given the fact that government regulations require a lot to those projects that want to be duly registered. Atlant I believe is going through the legal way to develop their project.  However, it is not hard for the project to give the bounty participants here enough time to comply. You do not just come with a late announcement and then forfeit everything from those who complied late. A lot of people were not able to comply, including myself, because the process of payment has already been going on for several months. Everything seemed to be smooth sailing. And then all of a sudden, changes are made. And it is not just a little change. We are talking here of passing KYC, which will not be approved in an hour or two. Actually, bounty participants could be spared from it. After all, not all of them will be using the platform. They just helped promote this project in exchange for some tokens.  Also, 1 ETH is too much. That might even be higher than the payment itself.

We have received an overwhelming response, and many questions about verification procedures on ATLANT, specifically Know Your Customer (KYC) and Address Whitelisting (AW).  As previously stated, both procedures are required in order to be fully compliant with applicable rules and regulations in most jurisdictions where we plan to operate.  ATLANT strives to be as compliant and transparent as possible, and given that we have ongoing processes to acquire necessary licensing for operation, it is crucial for us to follow the rules enacted by regulators and relevant government and regional authorities.  ATLANT KYC Procedures  Token withdrawals and/or payouts on ATLANT require users to pass a number of standard AML/KYC procedures, including list screenings (SDN, PEPs, etc), due diligence and document checks. Most of these checks are performed automatically after submission of KYC documents on the ATLANT Platform. Others, however, require a manual effort by internal compliance officers, or further interaction with users.  We recognize that this is sometimes an arduous process, and to alleviate this inconvenience, we are in a process of integrating 3rd party KYC providers, among them, a regulated US Trust, to expedite verification procedures.  Another difficulty which we are addressing with our legal team is the volatility of governments’ positions in various countries with respect to security tokens and cryptocurrencies, and proliferation of existing and newly enacted laws and regulations.  Further, we are working on more integrations in our KYC process, including well known players such as Civic and Telegram Passport — these are expected to eventually streamline KYC user experience, as we look to make the process easier for clients.  Described KYC/AML procedures are centralized as in most traditional financial institutions, predominantly for GDPR compliance and other regulatory requirements. Whitelisting, however, involves storing whitelisted addresses on the blockchain.  ATLANT AW Procedures  Address Whitelisting is a KYC-related concept which is inherent to ATLANT and its proposed model of operations.  Any event involving token transfers to external Ethereum addresses would require a user to whitelist these addresses, provided that KYC/AML procedures have been passed successfully. At this stage, an Ethereum-based ledger representing a decentralized KYC registry comes into play.  The current implementation of ATLANT KYC Registry brings transparency by enabling any application, both internal to ATLANT or external (e.g. regulators), to check a particular address, verifying its KYC status near-instantly without suffering from possible service downtime/unavailability or tampered records.  Once Ethereum address is entered on the ATLANT Platform (Verification page), we automatically check the address for relevant transactions between it and ATLANT, when ‘Verify’ is clicked. In case there’s one or more transactions, the platform deducts a whitelisting fee and adds the address to the Ethereum ledger, marking it as verified by ATLANT.  Whitelisting involves paying a small verification fee which includes a network fee and imbeds costs for compliance and integration/monitoring. Please note — we are trying to streamline the KYC procedures (per above), and hope to further automate and lower the costs involved.  You can always check your address status on ATLANT via any Ethereum explorer, (e.g. Etherscan):  1. Navigate to  https://etherscan.io/address/0xd63a77fe246c4a0095796b13c33c15e55fea1f6c#readContract  2. Insert your external (personal) address into the “address” textbox (“getStatus” panel) and click “Query”  3. Check the number returned by Etherscan. “1” stands for “verified by ATLANT”.  Statuses will be more nuanced in the future but some tentative guidelines are:  “0” — non-verified address  “1” — verified address  “2” — suspended address  Sample values:  Verified: 0x65dc3935b20eAaa9aAb0d8AcCfAC99f3cF862823  Non-verified: 0xA10Da3724c7A7b8Ad2E6Aa8a439f9AC38a9a3182  Additionally, we have implemented a versatile approach in AW, making it possible for external KYC providers to conduct whitelisting on behalf of ATLANT. This is useful for situations when multiple apps or external providers need to be allowed, to conduct AW. External KYC provider address may be assigned or revoked at any time by ATLANT.  We encourage everyone to verify KYC contract source code:  https://etherscan.io/address/0xd63a77fe246c4a0095796b13c33c15e55fea1f6c#code  In case you require further help with getting verified on ATLANT, or have other issues, please feel free to contact support by writing to help@atlant.io or submitting a ticket on the ATLANT Helpdesk Portal https://helpdesk.atlant.io. Please make sure to use the same email address as you used to register on ATLANT, when submitting tickets.",True

ERC-1462 is a general security token implementation, upon which any compliant security tokens can be built.  Technically, the Base Security Token is an extension to the ERC-20 standard token that provides compliance capabilities with securities regulations and associated legal requirements, while also being fully backward compatible with the ERC-20 standard. This essentially means that any ERC-1462 token is automatically supported by exchanges, wallets and other apps that support ERC-20 tokens, which includes most popular exchanges and wallets.  ATLANT intends to apply the ERC-1462 Base Security Token standard to all Property Tokens created on the ATLANT platform. Please feel free to contact us if you are interested in this new token standard and/or in issuing your own security tokens with ATLANT.  ERC-1462 is currently being reviewed and discussed with maintainers of Ethereum EIPs as a part of the required procedure, prior to be merged into the main EIPs repository. The discussion is available at https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-1462-base-security-token/1501  Being a minimal security token extension, ERC-1462 is already implemented with its source code available on ATLANT’s GitHub: https://github.com/AtlantPlatform/BaseSecurityToken  Pull request into the official Ethereum EIPs repository is available at https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1462",True

Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) describe standards for the Ethereum platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards. The draft has been reviewed and merged into the EIP registry, and is now publicly available for community review at EIPS section of the Ethereum.org website.  ATLANT’s Motivation  There are several security token standards which have been proposed recently, however ATLANT team has concerns about most of these proposals. In our view issues stem mainly from the scope of each of the EIPs, which contain many project or market-specific details. Since many EIPs were designed and backed by for-profit companies, they capture niche requirements which are excessive for general use cases. Further explanations and rationale with examples and case studies are available in the original draft of the ERC-1462 standard.  ATLANT proposes an EIP which is simple, yet modular solution to creating base security tokens for the widest possible scope of applications. ERC-1462 is designed so that it may be used by issuers out of the box, or be built and improved upon. Other issuers are able to add further restrictions and policies to their tokens, using proposed functions and implementation, yet their creativity will not be limited in any way, while using ERC-1462.  We believe that a pragmatic approach is necessary to create a clear and concise general security token specification. Due to this approach, ATLANT’s proposed ERC-1462 draft has now become the first merged standard draft addressing the general case of Security Token utilization on the Ethereum blockchain. We continue collecting feedback from the community, as well as developing our own projects which leverage ERC-1462.  For further details, please visit the EIP-1462 page for ATLANT’s proposed security token standard in the EIPS section of the Ethereum.org website.",True

These smart contracts resemble the usual microservices in a web application architecture, each having an API and dependencies. With growing amounts of services in distributed applications, challenges with deployment and data management become very significant. The problem is being solved by leading tool sets such as the Truffle framework, however with high amounts of overhead that might not be needed by all developers.  Inspired by Ansible Playbooks, ATLANT’s Ethereum Playbook is a declarative tool for comprehensive DApp automation, while remaining as minimalistic as possible. As a part of the ATLANT team’s open-source effort to make Ethereum development easier, Ethereum Playbook is the first step towards simple yet flexible and powerful DApp management.  Released as a command-line application, this tool is intended for ease of use and does not have a steep learning curve.  Ethereum Playbook greatly simplifies working with Ethereum DApps, allowing for seamless configuration and deployment of numerous DApps without losing control over the decentralized infrastructure.  The Playbook uses a simple and clean YAML syntax for creating static specifications. The flexibility of declarative configuration brings confidence into your decentralized application development lifecycle irrespective of the size of target deployment: single DApp or multiple DApp infrastructures.  Ethereum Playbook is not an integral part of the ATLANT platform, rather, it is used to facilitate DApp management within the platform as an internal product. We have decided to release the first public version of the Ethereum Playbook in an attempt to spark further development, laying foundation for a new community-driven project targeting Ethereum developers worldwide.

Being an integral element of the ATLANT distributed system, this component forms a network of nodes, allowing the platform to conduct and maintain information on Property Token Offerings (PTOs) and peer-to-peer (P2P) real estate lease transactions.  Current node implementation (ATLANT-Go) involves operating a distributed store of all information pertaining to PTOs called ADDS (ATLANT Distributed Data Store), which includes property purchase and sale documents necessary for tokenization on a jurisdictional basis such as:   -Title Documents -Planning Documents -Sales Contracts -Commercial Property Standard Enquiries -Energy Performance Certificates -Asbestos Reports -Contamination Reports -Other Necessary Contracts   Additionally, ADDS implemented within the ATLANT Node stores and catalogs various management company reports on properties, such as:  Tenant Billing and Payments Property Repairs and Engineering Reports Property related information such as Insurance, Maintenance, Utilities, etc. The ATLANT Node is designed from the ground up to interact closely with the Ethereum network, in particular, smart contracts relating to the Platform, PTOs and KYC/AML (Know Your Customer / Anti-Money Laundering identity regulations) for property token holders.  PTO contracts handle PTOs and property token behavior (including KYC/AML checks for token transactions), while the KYC contract is managed by a ServiceRegistry EVM contract, which allows for a fully compliant property token exchange from a regulatory standpoint.  The ATLANT node queries both contract sets in order to fetch secure data. The ATL contract is polled by the node for Platform token holder data, which is then processed by the node to handle proceeds from the Platform’s operations.  Running an ATLANT Node  As per the ATLANT White Paper, both ATL and PTO token holders can derive value from operations conducted on the Platform, provided that two main requirements are met:  1. Being a verified individual (having KYC/AML details completed and registered with the ATLANT Exchange).  2. Running an ATLANT node, which helps to secure the network by distributing property and transactional rental data globally, increasing redundancy.  For a detailed description of ATLANT-Go nodes, and related technology, please review the ATLANT white paper, beginning on page 33.  ATLANT-Go is tightly coupled with the ATLANT Exchange, for the sake of compliance (KYC/AML service), inexpensive data storage and redundancy (ADDS) and value distribution (based on work performed).  The ATLANT team is working hard on finalizing the integration of these major Platform components, and we look forward to releasing and integrating the remaining components quickly.

My December bounty is gone because ""the distribution system is automated"" - answer I have received from Atlant support.  I just don't believe this. How could this be still automated if KYC is needed and whitelisting? Somebody has to manually take control over this addresses to stop payments (no KYC) or reenable if needed (fulfilled KYC, whitelisting) like in my case. Am I right?",True

At that time, the ATLANT Node already handled the following key areas of functionality:  Property data management Distributed data storage Networking Secure data distribution Permissions Access control  Since then, development has proceeded significantly in terms of finalizing the platform’s main components, which are responsible for property tokenization, property token trading and peer-to-peer (P2P) rentals.  The ATLANT development team has also focused on the UI (the presentation layer of the platform), while also integrating its primary components into the presentation layer, in order to provide the best possible experience for all platform users.  ATLANT Platform Basic Functionality Completed Now the ATLANT team is pleased to announce that the development of both the property tokenization and P2P rentals aspects of the platform are complete, in terms of initial, basic functionality.  “We’re all very proud of our development team, and the quality of their work” said Julian Svirsky, ATLANT CEO, “They really pulled out all the stops to make this happen. Basic user-ready functionality is a major milestone for any new platform, and we’re very pleased to have reached this point.”  Platform Technical Overview Now Available In order to provide a clearer understanding of the underlying technology, we have published a high-level technical overview of the ATLANT Platform. https://atlant.io/static/docs/Atlant_Tech_overview.pdf  This overview contains a set of the platform’s major components distributed across four layers: Data layer Main business logic layer Self-enforcing logic layer Presentation layer     The ATLANT platform’s data layer is production-ready as of now, represented by the IPFS-based ADDS (ATLANT Distributed Data Storage) on the ATL network and the clustered DBMS in the ATL Services group.  The main business-logic layer comprises the ATL Services and the ATL Node logic, dedicated to both the main and auxiliary functions of the platform. For instance, property tokens trading (Services) and peer-to-peer rentals (Node) represent the main part of the platform’s functionality, while the KYC service (Services) is an auxiliary part. The majority of ATL Services have been successfully implemented, and developed services are currently under review. The ATL Node has also recently been enhanced with P2P rental functionality, which is currently being tested.  The self-enforcing logic layer is represented by a set of EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) smart contracts running on the Ethereum network, allowing for property token creation, token holders KYC (Know Your Customer regulatory compliance data), token distribution, smart rental offers and escrowed agreements, arbitration processes and arbitration management. The ATLANT team has developed and tested all the relevant smart contracts mentioned above, which are involved in implementing the aforementioned functionality.  The presentation layer includes web GUI applications for the property tokenization and trading (ATLANT Exchange) and the peer-to-peer rental aspects (ATLANT Rentals) of the platform. The ATLANT development team is focused on making these apps simple and convenient, yet also powerful and flexible, in terms of UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience). There is also a GUI-based desktop node client on the development roadmap, and it is expected to be released in the near future.  The ATLANT Exchange application preview is already publicly available: https://trade.atlant.io  For more info on ATLANT platform development and code insights, please check GitHub: https://github.com/AtlantPlatform",True

Just one KYC registration will be needed for the entire ATLANT ecosystem.  ATLANT community members are encouraged to monitor announcements closely, to be sure that they don’t miss the opportunity to register, and to pass the KYC process.  IMPORTANT NOTE: Passing KYC registration will also be required to receive ongoing bounty program payments from ATLANT’s 2017 bounty program.  KYC (Know Your Customer) registration is required by law in most financial institutions, and many crypto users are already familiar with the process from registering on trading exchanges and other types of blockchain based platforms. ATLANT KYC registration entails providing proof of identity, proof of address, and source of funds information.  KYC Registration Required to Receive ATLANT Member Benefits Any community members who intend to receive any of ATLANT’s various member benefits will need to complete the KYC registration process and also run a node prior to become eligible, as described in the ATLANT white paper.  ATLANT platform benefits can include:  Receiving listing fees for tokenized properties.  Receiving commissions for P2P rentals.  Receiving P2P rental arbitration fees,for work as an arbiter.  Additional details and requirements related to running an ATLANT node will be announced separately.  KYC Registration Required to Buy, Sell and Trade ATLANT Property Tokens KYC registration will also be required to participate in buying, selling and trading of property tokens on the ATLANT platform.  Please note that most jurisdictions also have requirements for eligibility in order to buy, sell and trade security tokens that go beyond basic KYC registration. Property tokens for properties listed on the ATLANT platform are security tokens (securities), and will be subject to these additional requirements in all applicable jurisdictions.  Please note also that these additional requirements do not apply to the ATLANT (ATL) token, which is a utility token which acts as a membership certificate, as described in the ATLANT white paper.",True

I just feel like the worst enemy and they treat me (us) like this.  Completed KYC long before December bounty distribution. After that, I was not following this thread for 2 weeks. Few days before bounty distribution I read about address whitelisting here in this thread and started the procedure but was not able to finish because I didn't have 1 ETH and later I didn't know how to do it.  I was looking for help here in this thread and in the Telegram channel via PM because I am banned from the group for asking bounty questions. Never got any help only links to useless blog posts where was no detailed info on how to do it step by step. I didn't know that I have to deposit ETH and to which address and I didn't want to do something wrong and lose the money and rest of the bounty payments if I fail to whitelist.  Of course, I didn't get any proper help and was advised to ask my question to support via email. I have contacted support multiple times when tried to pass KYC and they never replied to me.  After so many headaches I finally whitelisted my address 2 days after December bounty distribution and of course didn't get paid!!!  I wrote to support one more time and finally, they replied because there is a new system implemented and every support case got a number to which you can refer later on if they do not reply to long. Of course, support told me that I will not get paid because this is a fully automated distribution and I was too late.  They should pay December bounty together with January to all people who had KYC in time only haven't whitelisted addresses because this requirement was added only a few days before bounty distribution and there was no time frame for this!!!.  If I know that I'll not get paid December bounty I'll wait and buy 1ETH later because prices are falling constantly.  I have just enough of Atlant and how they treat us.  During the bounty and just after they were so thankful and said multiple times that without our help accumulate such amount of money would be just impossible. It is a pity that they forgot about it and do all they can to not pay our bounty.

Somebody has to manually take control over this addresses to stop these payments (no KYC) or reenable if needed (fulfilled KYC, whitelisting). Am I right?

Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) describe standards for the Ethereum platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards.  For details, please visit the EIP-1462 overview for ATLANT’s proposed security token standard in the EIPS section of the Ethereum.org website  ATLANT’s Motivation  There are several security token standards that have been proposed recently, however the ATLANT team has concerns about each of them, mostly because the scope of each of these EIPs contains many project-specific or market-specific details. Since many EIPs are coming from the respective backing companies, they capture many niche requirements that are excessive for a general case. The explanation with examples and case studies are available in the original draft of this standard.  What ATLANT proposes in this EIP is a simple and very modular solution for creating a base security token for the widest possible scope of applications, so it can be used by other issuers to build upon. Other issuers will be able to add more restrictions and policies to the token, using the proposed functions and implementation, but they will not be limited in any way while using this ERC.  This focus and pragmatic approach has allowed ATLANT to create a clear and concise general security token specification. Due to this approach, ATLANT’s proposed ERC-1462 draft has now become the first merged standard draft addressing the general case of Security Token utilization on the Ethereum blockchain. We are continuing to collect feedback from the community, as well as developing our own products that will leverage ERC-1462, soon.  Please click this link to review the original ATLANT article on the Base Security Token proposal. https://blog.atlant.io/atlant-proposes-new-security-token-standard-76cf3e4aeb47  ABOUT ATLANT  ATLANT is a revolutionary global real estate platform enabling tokenization of real estate ownership and P2P rentals.

On every YouTube presentation, Atlant CEO repeats few times that the exchange is ready and platform could be launched in a few weeks.  After fundraising they changed the story and yesterday on Telegram I saw a comment fro the Atlant team that this would take a few months more for sure to start with the platform. Of course, Atlant is ready but they wait for trading licenses.  If this is true why not to launch the platform in a test mode to check everything? Find bugs and other problems before the platform is fully launched. I would do it if I will be Atlant CEO. Why not? This would show a real progress in development and additionally, we can launch rentals on the platform first and tokenization of properties later.  From what I know rentals should be a way easier to start when it comes to regulations and needed licenses (says Atlant CEO, Jullian!!!).  I have to say that I invested in Atlant only because they stated that the platform will be launched after a month and such a date was on the original roadmap. Additionally, Julian, the CEO stated in every presentation that they are almost ready with the code. After ICO they changed all promises and even the roadmap. Today this project is different from this one I have invested. If I know that they will do something like this I will never send a penny to them.  I fill as they lied to me all the time when ICO was ongoing because I asked a few times about licenses and development. Always got the same answer that everything is ok and they will be ready as scheduled on the roadmap. Today they say something totally different and when I started to ask questions banned me from Telegram.",True

This can be something good to tokenize properties or rent but also for investors to make money in a lot of different ways. Not only speculation will drive the price but real usage.

Then Denis jointly with two developers launched the project atlant.io , which was positioned as an international blockbuster real estate platform.

I wrote several articles about your project and helped spread the word. I Need just a little bit of help from you, or at least your opinion on one matter. I should have received few thousand of USD worth of Atlant tokens during next 1.5 year. The problem is that my MyEtherWallet was hacked, and hackers even put a smart contract on it that takes all ETH from my wallet same second it comes there. So everything I get in that wallet is lost. I contacted your bounty manager several times on the forum, but he never answered to me. Then I contacted your manager Tomas on the telegram, and he told me that he will try to help. Bounty manager stated publicly on the forum that he could not change addresses because of distribution is automated. This sounds like a lie from someone that don't want to spend few minutes of his time to help. If it is not a lie, then you guys did not think even a little bit about your bounty participants after you decided to pay us over 18 months. Think how many more wallets will be hacked during that time and you will send our rewards to hackers. I hope that this is not the truth. I am asking you to help me, and as I told your manager Tomas before he got angry at me and blocked me because I called you arrogant for not helping bounty participants, that I am even ready to give all of my Atlant tokens to some charity. My only goal is that hackers don't get all of my payments. If you can, or won't help me, it would be professional from you to answer on this and confirm that official Atlant policy is that they are not changing hacked addresses and not helping, or wanting to help people that worked for them.

The Atlant team overestimated the demand for their tokens and the sentiment of ICO investors over traditional industries merging with blockchains. If they were able to sell more, this wouldn't be an issue. But alas, the ICO ended in the tail-end of the two-year bull rally, with lesser market participants.  So now, ATL acts like the other coins with inflation due to mining rewards. This in itself is alright, but Atlant should be aggressive in spreading out the token trading to many exchanges and increase public awareness of the project, in order to offset the inflation.  If they truly have a strong platform/product and marketing strategy up their sleeves, I still believe they can pull it off and we can still reach moon.  However, distribution that takes one year and a half is also bad. I would suggest they do bounty distribution dynamically (like what the Federal Reserve does). For example, the daily volume now is only $21,137 USD which now includes 1 million in bounty tokens. If the daily volume increases to $300,000, the team can distribute 2 million tokens this time, and decrease again if the volume goes down.  I don't know what the team's intentions are in propping up the market (maybe they want to sell too at a higher price), but it is also bad to have an inflated price with a huge undistributed supply hanging over our heads. This might cause deep market corrections.  One strategy they can consider is to distribute all of the bounty, expecting a mini crash and then announce some major release days after. This may seem devious but it does retests the actual support price where the big buyers are willing to buy.",True

This is the announcement I am talking. Quote from: Frogman on March 02, 2018, 03:20:43 AM Dear ATLANT Bounty Participants,  As previously announced, distribution of ATLANT bounty will begin today.  All participants had enough time to verify addresses, thus as of March 1, 2018 address changes will not be accepted.  Please note the following details:  Each month, approximately one million ATL tokens will be distributed to bounty program participants, over a period of 18 months, proportionately.  Example: If you are due to receive 1800 ATL, you will receive 100 ATL per month, each month, until a total of 1800 ATL is reached.  Monthly distributions will be made during the first week of each calendar month.  Thank You,  ATLANT Team",True

So, when Joe the plumber decides he wants to invest $500 into a real estate investment, he's got a few options:  1) invest in a public REIT 2) Invest through Atlant (decentralized management) 3) Invest through another blockchain company with centralized management  Let's put the REIT option aside and focus on #2 and #3.  What advantage does Atlant really provide? Joe has more control over his investment. From a day to day perspective, this is generally limited to just voting on the management company each year, which shouldn't be too difficult (as long as everything is going well).  But before he even gets to the ownership part, Joe has to decide which property he wants to invest in. A property was put up for sale and there's plenty of info to support a decision, but he's got to go through that process himself. Deciding if he's OK with the location, condition, broader market, etc.  So he's got control over which investments to make, but not really over the day to day stuff. It's not like it's even that efficient from a cost perspective because he's still paying fees to Atlant token holders (7%) at inception,  and to the property manager.  That's a lot of work for a $500 investment, so he'll likely want to invest through a platform that where he can rely on real estate experts to make some of these decisions for him.  If there are options where he can rely on the expertise of others to help with the initial decision making process, I think they will attract more investors than Atlant will.",True

Certainly there's levels to understanding it but it basically comes down to one thing: will this property be more or less desirable in the future. I question the term expert when applied to real estate because it does not take much to assess the variables of buying a certain property and many people who would not refer to themselves as ""real estate experts"" have gotten rich simple by applying basic principles.  For example, if i look at property in nyc i know the population will continue to rise and that the closer you are to manhattan the better. These two realizations are enough reason to invest in most properties in brooklyn, and any person can come to this conclusion without being an expert. However, the barrier of entry is too high.  I'm saying there is a huge market for people to invest in real estate without consulting ""experts."" I dont need to go to anyone to know that brooklyn real estate prices will continue to rise and that downtown brooklyn will eventually become a commercial center like midtown.  I am interested in how Atlant would compete with other real estate platforms based on the blockchain, and what those platforms are. I think decentralization will ultimately be a plus side, not a downfall. Financing is an interesting point, and i doubt traditional financing will be available through atlant anytime soon.  What I'm most focused on is how atlant will relate to taxes. If a person is able to take large sums of money and buy property with atlant or even sell their property and not deal with taxes i can see it skyrocketing.",True

With respect to your NYC reference, did you know that properties in midtown are under a lot of pressure from Hudson Yards? Buying into a property on 52nd Street with Blackrock as a tenant might seem really attractive - unless you knew that they will be vacating.  Speaking of Hudson Yards, did you know that they are getting $100+ psf rents, but having to give away a lot in concessions for it?  Even if you knew all of this, how do you know what the right price is? Do you know what the average cap rate is in Manhattan vs the outer boroughs?  You can just decide to ""buy real estate in NY"" and you might do just fine. But there's also a chance you might not.  Atlant doesn't compete in a vacuum. There are other blockchain companies already out there working on competing platforms where investors don't have to figure this stuff out for themselves.  Decentralization can be a good thing, but it has to be done right.  I asked about taxes a while ago. It'll be up to the individual investors to figure out their own tax liability, but I wouldn't expect that you won't have any.",True

No care whatsoever for the investors that actually invested hard earned money into the project. It's about time most companies start letting their projects grow organically and stop feeding this fucking beggars. I have read thru the thread and none of the actual investors are screaming scam, just only the beggars that are getting sometime for free and unwilling to wait for it.    Personally, i think Atlant should cancel the bounty distribution (redistribute that fund to actual investors) give it a few months for the leeches to lose interest and move to another project, then resume back with marketing and hopefully build this platform. Those of us that actually invested have seen our stake price drastically obliterated in the market, so it doesn't make sense giving free money to this ungrateful bastards just so they can turn around and dump the price some more.     By the way, quit all the yapping about your time wasted etc, most of you fools sit around and fart all day while posting on this forum/facebook/twitter etc for free. This is not a real job, you should be lucky to have someone give you money for something you basically do for free.

Sold everything after seeing this post. The fact that you are keeping team tokens as per original allocation proves two things to me:  a) You are sneaky, lying and proving to be a scam. People have asked this same question on this forum during ICO and you dodged the question. Now that the ICO is over and you have your funds, all of a sudden you can answer it. You know that you are significantly diluting the token value of ICO investors by not making an adjustment to team tokens but apparently you don't care. There's now 7.7m tokens held by investors and more than 30m by the team, what a complete and utter SCAM  b) You don't know how to run a business. If you wanted to make money from the team tokens it would have made more sense to adjust the team token allocation to the equivalent of tokens sold, which would gain investor trust and keep the price stable. Now people are dumping it on exchanges already (no buying volume at all) and your 30m ATL tokens will be worthless in the near future",True

So the entirety of the ICO (let's call it ~$8M) was spent on roughly 13M tokens.  So the remaining 42M instantly dilutes the token value by a factor of 4.  Do you hate money, devs?  Don't you understand that had you burned 75% of your tokens (whose original quantity was a legacy of an over-ambitious initial goal of 100M ANYWAY), ATLANT would probably be worth two to three times what it is right now, with hype to grow?  You shot yourselves in the foot out of greed.  There is still hope, if you bother to make an announcement that you will be burning an *enormous* chunk of your initial tokens.  You will MAKE money by doing this, not lose it.  You should have burned your own tokens in proportion to what was not sold.  It's ridiculous that anyone should have to explain that.  Good luck.  -One irate investor",True

In another article Qryptos is mentioned, and this is another exchange.  I registered on Quoinex just to see but it looks like a very complicated UI (like I am on Wall Street). Don't like that.  When I see the listed coins on Quoinex, they only have BTC, ETH, DASH, QASH and QTUM.  They do have some kind of referral program going on by offering you 25% commission in trader fees if you recommend Quoinex to a friend using your personal link. I suppose it will be 25% on the trader fees that your 'friend' makes.

You can still participate, but this is your LAST CHANCE TO BUY ATL at the special bonus rate of 505 ATL per ETH at atlant.io - but please hurry, the ATLANT ICO ends TOMORROW.  This is not just any ICO. ATLANT is a platform which is revolutionizing the world’s real estate market by creating the first global exchange for tokenized real estate assets - think NASDAQ, but for real estate assets.    ATLANT is also setting out to reduce costs by 90% for both guests and hosts in the P2P rental market (Airbnb, Booking, etc.) with major savings made possible by blockchain technology.    ATLANT ATL token holders can share in the proceeds from both of these markets: tokenized assets and P2P rentals, in proportion to the number of ATL tokens they hold.  Participate in ATLANT’s ICO before it is over -- please visit atlant.io now.    And if you have questions, the ATLANT team and community is available and happy to answer them, on Telegram.    Sincerely yours,    Epay Team",True

In my opinion, since different countries are coming up with regulations and / or exchanges are asking for a lot of verification, the exchange that doesn't require much verification, will attract a lot more traders.  One of the main problems that keeps people from investing in interesting tokens are the ways some exchanges try to get you to comply to their verification process.  Since Atlant is all about real estate, the east is still a largely untapped market in this area. Imagine if the Chinese government decide to allow their citizens to start trading again... A lot of wealth is based in China and they will definately want to invest in real estate!  Kucoin has very good exchange rates for ETH and BTC.The website UI feels smooth and intuitive.  It will become a big player opposed to bigger brothers Binance and Coss because it is using the same (but improved) strategy that shares profits on all the coins with the traders. It is not on coinmarketcap yet but when it will be, it will expand even faster.  I like that there is no need for verification (ID, proof of address or payed bills) because I am fond of my privacy.  The founders really want to appeal to a big audience. They are based in Hong Kong and therefore doesn't apply to the same rules of exchanges based in mainland China. This exchange is starting to gain traction.  They already are listing some Chinese related coins like NEO, GAS, WTC, HSHARE, Bytom, Blackholecoin and they will list VeChain in a couple of days.

In other words, the real estate market is here to stay forever.  Though unchanged in its fundamental processes of temporary or permanent transfer of ownership from one party to another, the procedures of transaction and systems of owning landed properties have evolved in so many ways over time.  In the ancient times only community heads retained ownership of properties and allocated them to whoever they deemed necessary for different purposes. Long after that, individuals and groups started buying off these assets completely and acquired full ownership rights. Populations increased and the property market expanded as well until the more organized systems that we have in existence today.  Challenges in the current system  Despite the organisation of the existing markets, it is still confronted with a lot of challenges that make it difficult for individuals and groups to enjoy the full benefits that are resident within the real estate ecosystem.  The high cost of real estate which is as a result of several external charges and fees by third parties, and also due to the pseudo-monopoly that is existent within the market have locked out a lot of individuals from participating in the market. This is all about to change as ATLANT introduces a blockchain platform that will decentralize the market and totally overhaul the existing system. This innovation is designed to bring about a more transparent and secure market that will be open to all classes of investors.  A non-conventional system  Recently, complete ownership of large real estate properties is becoming unpopular. This is mainly because of the inherent liabilities involved in servicing these properties, especially when they are not in full functional use. With the emergence of the sharing economy, companies like Airbnb, Bookings and Expedia have created platforms that make it easy for individuals or organisations to rent spaces for use on a need and purpose basis. In order words, they have created systems that take renting away from the traditional annual lease or usual hotel booking services. Rather, house owners who may be out of town, or have extra unused spaces can put them up for short time renting and be located directly by those who need them.  This is a kind of service that has grown in popularity and is being patronized by users all over the world. However, this centralized system is prone to deficiencies in the area of high charges that result from fees paid to the platform providers like Airbnb, and also the issue of fake reviews. These are the problems, among several others that the ATLANT platform is out to solve by implementing the blockchain in real estate.  Blockchain for change  ATLANT is implementing the Blockchain in order to reshape the title insurance industry. By registering real estate on a distributed ledger, blockchain could streamline the manually intensive practice of examining public records when validating titles in real estate transactions. While blockchain technology is still in its infancy, and complete decentralized ledger of global property is not going to happen overnight, ATLANT plans to take a leading role in all facets of real estate globally to make this a reality, starting with disrupting the rental market and tokenizing large real estate assets for trading.  Having an asset registered on the decentralized ledger will enable a transparent procedure that will automatically eliminate fraudulent practices in the form of fake reviews and declarations. This will boost the confidence level in the market, making room for more reliable transactions. Tokenization of assets is a development that will create a very liquid market where anyone from anywhere in the work can participate effectively.  Most times, large real estate assets that are put up for sale in the market overstay due to the unavailability of capable buyers. Tokenizing these assets and having these tokens available in a decentralized exchange makes them very liquid and saleable in smaller fractions. It also gives lower level investors the opportunity to buy into properties that they judge to be viable but with no capacity to buy them as a whole.  A decentralized exchange  These transactions will be carried on the ATLANT transparent, secure and decentralized exchange using the Atlant (ATL) tokens. All Atlant (ATL) tokens are essentially membership certificates in the ATLANT Platform, which give numerous rights and privileges to their owners. These owners must comply with KYC/AML policies of ATLANT and proof of member activity confirmed by running an ATLANT node on the member’s computer.  This decentralized platform will also offer a transparent environment for Peer-to-Peer renting that will be more cost effective and void of manipulations in the form of fake reviews and forged rating.  Real estate is a gift of nature and an intrinsic aspect of human existence that should be managed in a manner that is fair to all. The existing systems have failed in offering a fair platform for market competition, therefore the majority of the world population are excluded from the property ownership circle. Services within the sector are also designed in a way that there is a clear demarcation between the rich and the poor.  ATLANT’s blockchain platform has the potential to help accelerate the adoption of the Sharing Economy which has already begun to unleash industry disruption by opening up significant amounts of previously untapped private capacity and tokenization of property may completely change real estate transactions and ownership transfer as we know them.

On the panel session ""Cooperation in the Field of Communications and Information Technologies"", ATLANT CEO Julian Svirsky provided details to governments and business leaders about the multiple opportunities opened by new technologies. As one example of a successful application of blockchain technology, he gave an overview of ATLANT, the decentralized blockchain platform solving current challenges in the real estate market via tokenization of real estate ownership and P2P rentals.  Concluding his presentation, Julian Svirsky said, ""Summing up, it should be noted that  blockchain technology is no longer tomorrow. Blockchain already, today, changes the rules of the game in many sectors of the economy, and we can confidently say that we are witnessing the birth of a new economy.""  The ATLANT CEO's speech aroused genuine interest, both in blockchain technology in general and in the ATLANT project in particular. Julian Svirsky also held a number of meetings with government and industry representatives from various Eurasian Economic Union member countries, during which potential collaboration on various technology and business levels was discussed.

He talked it over with his wife Jia, and they agreed that real estate is usually good over the long term, and stable. However, as a young family with limited investment funds, they felt their options probably didn’t include real estate. That level of investment would have to wait.  If only there were options that didn’t require hefty upfront investment in a single property, and that could be diversified, somehow. And which also had the possibilities of the kind of growth that Wei had already enjoyed from his cryptocurrency portfolio.  Oh well, Wei and Jia both decided, that’s probably not realistic in connection with real estate investing. Maybe in the future, when they had saved more, they could invest in such things.  Wei went back online to research various investment options that were realistic. There were some that seemed okay, but he really wasn’t happy. Then, he found ATLANT.  A whole new world opened up for him. Wei learned that he could invest in real estate assets in a very similar way to trading stocks. And not only that, but he could invest in properties located around the world. Wei got excited, and started researching various properties listed on the ATLANT platform, in several different countries.  He found a new office building in London, a manufacturing center in Singapore, and a very interesting small business center getting ready to open in Metz, France.  Then it hit him, and Wei sighed deeply. His available investment funds only totaled $50,000 or so. Not enough to invest in these three attractive properties, surely.  Still, Wei wanted to know what was possible with ATLANT, and so he researched ATLANT’s approach a bit more, especially the specifics of tokenizing real estate assets, and what fractionalized ownership really meant.  The information he found included the fact that the ATLANT platform offers a unique token for each property, and as with all such tokens, he could invest as much or as little as he liked.  And then the light bulb went off in Wei’s head, and a big grin broke across his face. He didn’t have to decide between these attractive properties. He could allocate some funds to each of them.  Wei worried that there might be differences, though. For instance, when you invest in stocks, you know the company has been vetted thoroughly, as part of their filings. Had these properties been vetted as well? As he dug deeper, Wei ended up not only satisfied, but also impressed with ATLANT’s overall approach.  ATLANT, it turned out, ensures that there are no hidden issues that could harm investors. All listed properties had demonstrated that they were in full compliance with the local laws, and that their property had no liens or other outstanding issues. And it was all certified by the appropriate authorities in each jurisdiction, and recorded on the immutable blockchain.  Wei was sold. He knew his investment could go up or down with the market, and due to various aspects of each property, but not because of any hidden items or legal issues.  He put together $50,000 from his existing cryptocurrency portfolio, and registered on the ATLANT platform, allocating his funds between the three properties he thought were best.  Wei knew that nothing was guaranteed, but at the same time, these all looked like really good investments. And he could own a piece of each of them, with a few hours of research from the comfort of his own phone.  Over the next two years, Wei received proportionate income from the tenants of all three properties, based on the number of tokens he held for each of them. The value of his three tokens increased by an average of 18%. This was a better return than he might have gotten from many other investments, and with none of the extra costs or hassle.  Performance of his investment was akin to owning parts in these buildings, and getting profits from rental payments, but without any of the hassle. Wei and Jia were quite happy with their investments, and how easy it was to make them.

Contract Sets for Decentralized Token Exchange 2. Platform DAO and Property Tokenization    Contract Sets for Decentralized Token Exchange  ADEX contracts represent an exchange matching engine implemented as a smart contract written in Solidity (Ethereum).  Order matching is supported, as opposed to many existing exchange contracts (e.g. EtherDelta). Ethereum ERC20 tokens traded versus Ether.  Supported features & benefits  Order matching  Any ERC20 token support  Exchange decentralization  Funds inaccessible for 3rd parties  Optimized performance  Reduced gas consumption  Currency pairs  Base currency: ERC20 token (any)  Quote currency: ETH  Any ERC20 Ethereum token may be deposited to this exchange contract and subsequently traded versus Ether.  This includes a series of at least two transactions: a deposit transaction (ETH or ERC20 token) and an exchange transaction (providing amount & price). Token exchange is conducted by the contract automatically.  Platform DAO and Property Tokenization   ATLANT DAO and property tokenization platform are implemented as smart contracts written in Solidity language (Ethereum) using Truffle framework.  Supported Functionality  Property platform  • Adding properties for sale • Property approval/rejection by lawyer • PTO initialization  DAO   • Changing voting rules (debate time, minimum quorum) • Proposing a new percent fee for new PTOs • Voting and proposal execution  PTO   • Refunds in case of PTO cancellation • Property token distribution to ATL token holders Both pre-releases are available for download from ATLANT’s GitHub repositories.",True

We are often asked whether or not the ATLANT token (ATL) is a security.  ATLANT has received legal opinions from leading attorneys covering the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe, stating that the ATL token is not a security.  The U.S. decision was prepared by Velton Zegelman PC, a legal firm specializing in the emerging field of cryptocurrency law and acting as corporate counsel for numerous high profile ICO (initial coin offering) transactions, including ATLANT.   The U.S. decision concludes:   “We conclude that the ATL token would not be deemed to meet the definition of security and, accordingly, that the federal securities laws would not apply to the initial distribution and subsequent trading of such ATL tokens in the United States.”   In the decision, Zegelman cites the Howey test as the primary standard for determining whether or not a given cryptocurrency token is a security, or not, stating:   “The applicable Supreme Court case for determining whether an instrument meets the definition of security is SEC v. Howey, 328 U.S. 293 (1946). The Supreme Court has reaffirmed the Howey analysis as recently as 2004 in SEC v. Edwards, 540 U.S. 398 (2004). The Howey standard applies to blockchain tokens and ICOs as well.”   The decision then goes on to address the four criteria outlined in the Howey test, point by point.   One pertinent passage highlights exactly why the ATLANT token is not a security, per the fourth point of the Howey test, which requires that a given (token, in this case) have any increase in value occur “solely through the effort of others.”   “If ATL token holders have rights to validate transactions in the ATLANT platform, to vote on issues related to the selection and management of tokenized real estate assets, to act as individual arbitrators in p2p rental disputes, and to generally actively participate in ATLANT platform operations and derive active income from their efforts, then there is no expectation of profits solely from the efforts of others.”  And, per the rights described in the ATLANT White Paper (p.8–9), ATL token holders certainly do have such rights: ATL tokens are essentially membership certificates in the ATLANT Platform, which give the following rights and privileges to their owners provided compliance with KYC/AML policies of ATLANT and proof of member activity confirmed by running an ATLANT node on the member’s computer:   After a successful token sale, an agreed portion of the property tokens are released to ATL token holders proportionately.   Commissions from P2P platform fees are distributed to the ATL token holders. The size of this fee is determined by voting of the ATL token holders.  ATL token holders also participate in votes to decide various actions taken with respect to the property: platform listing decision, listing fee approval, law firm choice, management company choice (property tokenization), property for rent approval, and rental fee approval. There is also the ability to work, and to earn extra income, within the framework of ATLANT as an arbiter for conflict resolution in P2P rentals, moderated via an arbiter rating system. As a result of this work, the funds withheld from the escrow of the losing party are distributed to the ATL token holder who performed the arbitration.  ATL token holders also have influence on the platform and ability to propose, vote on and aid further developments to improve the efficiency of real estate globally, as well as boost ATLANT’s global adoption and growth. Token holders agree upon every decision taken within the platform, affecting both tokenizing property and the P2P rental service, by the use of a voting mechanism. ATL token holders vote for or against the proposals created by the most reputable token holders, covering all activities within the platform.  The UK/EU decision was prepared by Berwin Leighton Paisner (BLP), headquartered in London, a 1st tier real estate law practice according to Legal 500.   After extensive exploration of various facets of UK/EU legislation related to securities, including MiFID, Prospectus Directive and AIFMD, the decision concludes: “We do not consider that the ATL tokens will constitute securities under EU-level or UK legislation, and as such, the UK and broader EU-level financial services regulatory regimes will not apply to restrict the offering of ATL tokens to EU-based persons.”  Per both of these decisions, it is clear that the ATLANT token is not a security as defined by relevant law in the United States, the United Kingdom, or European Union.",True

To launch on SAFTLaunch, ATLANT was required to pass a rigorous due diligence process, highlighting the solid foundation of every facet of ATLANT from an investment standpoint.  Regarding the type of due diligence that is required, here are some details from the SAFTLaunch FAQ:  “Issuers who pass our KYC/AML check, demonstrate a good token use case, and their seriousness to appropriately handle and use funds in accordance with their proposed plans.  We require issuers to convert all crypto proceeds to the currency they expect to have expenses in.  We require issuers to use an administrator to oversee expenses and spending.  Issuers are required to have their own counsel to ensure compliance with any local or specific regulation or tax concerns.  We interview issuers and perform a rigorous due diligence review to ensure all issuers are professional issuers with promising business prospects. As professional investors, we view this as a core competency.”  Commenting on the approval by SAFTLaunch, ATLANT CEO Julian Svirsky stated, “We are pleased with this new option for investors, and are impressed with the level of due diligence performed by SAFTLaunch. This new partnership also highlights the solid business fundamentals we have created with ATLANT.”",True

What’s Blockchain good for, really?   What can we do with Blockchain based products and services that we can’t do with existing technologies?    And how are the new Blockchain solutions better than existing options?    It’s really not that complicated.    The World Wide Web gave us all the “Internet of Information”.    Blockchain is giving us all the “Internet of Money”.    The Web made information easy. Blockchain makes money easy.    And because real estate is the world’s single largest asset class, estimated at $217 Trillion, or roughly ten times the size of the U.S. economy, that matters. A lot.    Because, while real estate is the world’s largest asset class, it’s also one of the world’s least efficient markets.    It’s expensive, it’s cumbersome, and it’s slow. Or, rather, it has been for the last few thousand years.    Enter Blockchain.   Programmable Money, Programmable Trust   Money has obviously had a great deal of benefit to many people, for its entire history. Hence the interest in money, globally, and from ancient times until the present moment. However, money has also had a very difficult time balancing liquidity (ease of use) with securely storing value (money’s primary purpose).    Blockchain technology allows for the creation of digital money, in the same way that the Web allows for the creation of digital information.    The Web may not seem that revolutionary right now, but that’s because humans get used to new things very quickly.    You’re likely reading these words on a screen, rather than on a printed page. That’s only been truly likely, in comparison to reading a printed version of this article in a given publication, for roughly a decade.    And that’s only been technically possible for the general public for roughly two decades. Out of over five thousand years of recorded human history.    Or, put in a somewhat more staggering way:    As of 2013, over ninety percent of all information ever created by humans was been created in the previous two years.    And according to one estimate, in 2017, that feat will be attained in one year, this year.    That’s what the infrastructure of the Internet and the front end of the Web has enabled, by making the finding, accessing, publishing and sharing of information both easy and free.    And that’s all about to accelerate, due to M2M, or machine-to-machine information exchange, arising in sync with the Internet of Things (IoT).    Why the brief technology history lesson?    Because in the exact same way that the Web has been such a huge deal for information creation and sharing, Blockchain will enable similar sea-changes with respect to value creation and exchange.    But wait, that all sounds a bit like the noise level and hype I mentioned above, doesn’t it?    Possibly — but it’s only noise level and hype if we stop there.    Now it’s time to find the signal in the noise — or the value in the Blockchain.   Carrying the Analogy: Web and Blockchain   The Web allowed more people to do more things with information more easily than ever before.    Blockchain will allow more people to do more things with money more easily than ever before.   The Real Power of Tokenization   Alex Tapscott, co-author of The Blockchain Revolution, and founder of the Blockchain Research Institute, recently tweeted:   “Tokenizing existing assets, aka the biggest transfer of wealth in human history. Stay tuned.”   As his intro to a linked article “Traditional Asset Tokenization” by University of Oregon finance professor Stephen McKeon, who writes in that article:   “Most investors are shut out of development projects entirely unless they can meet minimums which are often on the order of $25k and higher. One day you might be able to buy $10 of a single commercial real estate asset like the Empire State Building, or invest $100 in the development of a LEED-certified housing project. Real estate focused token exchanges will increase liquidity for asset owners. Real estate appraisers will become more like equity analysts, because the market value of any building will be readily apparent if the token is trading.”   “The difference between this and current crowdfunding models is that the token holders can retain fractional ownership.”    “Most electronic exchanges will trade tokens because most assets will be tokenized.”    “Tokenization of traditional assets will cause disruption to the status quo. Some systems that are in place today may not work the same way in the blockchain world (e.g. equity securities lending). That doesn’t mean the blockchain world isn’t coming, it means the current systems will have to evolve.”    What does all this mean for you?    It means that, cutting through the haze of noise level and hype, that if any facet of real estate investing has been too costly for you, that tokenization will end that.    How?    By allowing fractional purchase of tokens that are tied to real estate.    And that’s just one facet of the benefits of blockchain for the global real estate market. And it’s one with potentially significant benefit for investors (at all levels of participation), homeowners, real estate developers, and others. As with the early days of the Web, there’s no way that all possible uses and solutions have already been thought of, yet.    What else? Well, there’s the inherent “programmed trust” of Blockchain which eliminates the need for centralized and expensive middlemen — and more than one, in many cases.    You’ll often have a company or platform providing a service, a bank or credit card company that processes the related transactions, and so on.    We see this with respect to real estate ownership, but due to the far higher volume of transactions, we see it far more in the temporary lodging markets (i.e. apartments, hotel rooms, etc.).    P2P platforms like Airbnb revolutionized traditional lodging, just as Uber revolutionized traditional taxi service. Yet you still have an expensive centralized organization at the center of it all.    So what does Blockchain bring to P2P lodging?    The possibility of significantly reduced fees for both the tenant (guest) and lessor (host) along with minimized possibility of fake reviews and forged ratings, which plagues existing centralized services such as Airbnb and Booking.    In a 2016 report, Goldman Sachs Equity Research stated:   “Building trust between counterparties in the Sharing Economy: P2P lodging sites like Airbnb have already begun to transform the lodging industry by making a public market in private housing. However, adoption may be limited by concerns about safety and security (guests) and property damage (hosts).    By enabling a secure, tamper-proof system for managing digital credentials and reputation, we believe blockchain could help accelerate the adoption of P2P lodging and generate $3 — $9 billion in incremental revenue opportunity through 2020.”    And so, by this small handful of examples, we can see that Blockchain technologies, regardless of all the intricacies under the hood, can bring tangible, real-world benefits to the general public, both businesses and consumers, alike.    Blockchain will help people to save money through greater efficiencies in services and lower fees, to participate in real estate investments that may have been cost-prohibitive before now, and to potentially participate in real estate development in various ways, as well.    Both tokenization of real estate assets and the direct benefits of Blockchain technology for the global temporary housing (i.e. apartments, hotel rooms, etc.) market will unlock a great deal of value, in several different ways, from a market that’s vast but historically very slow and cumbersome.    And that’s just what we can foresee today. And more than that, it’s what is already being built, today. The first real estate focused Blockchain platforms are due to come online in 2018.    And as with the “Internet of Information”, the “Internet of Money” is likely going to be very interesting, valuable and life-changing for many people around the world, for many years to come.",True

It’s no secret that the industry is ripe for change, and that change will come sooner rather than later.  The first sign of movement is the growth of the Airbnb model, allowing moderate peer to peer connectivity, and making a system that allows users to have more freedom of choice. But Airbnb is still a tiny blip in the massive $217 tln global real estate market. Granted, a blip of something massive is still big, but the opportunity for change is clear.  ATLANT, a new and powerful Blockchain technology platform for real estate, believes that Airbnb is onto something, but can’t take it to the level that the public desires. The company is planning to create a fully decentralized real estate ecosystem where clients have the power to buy, sell, and rent property without the profiteering of centralized hubs or brokers.  Tokenize it Selling property is clearly a complex process. When a seller wants to liquidate a piece of real estate, especially of substantial value, the asset must be placed on the market, advertised, and, when a buyer is found, sold. The process of transfer takes extensive time and money as well.  ATLANT has created a system that allows sellers to tokenize their asset, effectively treating it like a stock sale, and liquidating that asset through a token sale within the platform. The tokens the seller collects can be exchanged for fiat currency, and the buyers own a percentage stake in the property.  Brokers, escrows and closing costs are all virtually eliminated. The process is rapid and succinct, and the transfer is complete within days rather than months. Built with excellent technological resources, the ATLANT platform is more than just another ICO. It is a revolutionary marketplace for exchanging real assets fluidly.  Decentralize it More than just a place to buy and sell, ATLANT is creating a system that will outdo corporate rental hubs at their own game. The beauty of a peer to peer system is that it removes the middleman, and through technology creates a connection between parties on either side of a contract.  ATLANT has created a system where tenants can find rentals directly from owners, then create and conclude a rental contract without having to leave the ATLANT ecosystem. Without the complexity of a centralized hub, costs for clients drop drastically, and both renters and landlords are happier. ATLANT’s system is poised to change the way rentals are found, worldwide.  The company has an ICO starting Sept. 7 and concluding Oct. 7. Interested parties will be able to acquire ATLANT’s token, the ATL, which will be used as the internal currency for transactions on the platform. Buyers can receive up to a 19 percent bonus for joining in the first 10 percent of tokens sold.",True

I also invested, but am worried a bit because of the numbers. I'd like to add a bit to the math:  Only the unsold coins meant for the ICO will be burned, none of those meant for the team or the bounty programm! This means there will be 22.5M tokens for the team, 19M tokens for the bounty programm, and only 8.5M held due to pre-sale and ICO (gives you a total of 50M). If ICO doesn't raise significantly more, which it only will if some changes are made, these are the numbers. Sure, the individual percentage of tokens held rises, but the percentage for all buyers is lowered.   So, current token value: $3.5M/50M  = $0.07 ea.  final token value (if al tokens were sold): $50M/150M = $ 0.33 ea. During ICO one has to pay almost ten fold.  Other ICOs (real estate type too) calculate the team share as a percentage of the sold tokens. As mfgex correctly statet, you'll have to burn the same percentage of team tokens, ICO tokens and bounty tokens in order for sale contributors not having to pay everything but only be getting 20% of the tokens, not 69% as you state on the website. That number is only true if all 100M were sold. Other ICOs fix the percentage held by buyers at at least 50%. Sorry, team and bounty people, but I'm sure you'll see the injustice towards investors, if only they lose token percentage.  Unfortunately this way the ICO is mathematically simply unattractive. One can expect the token value to drop by a factor of ten once the tokens are on the exchange and basically feel how ones investment is simply drained towards the team members.   I'm new to the forum and hope not to be judged solely because of that. Only sharing my thoughts in a civil manner.

You need to let the marketplace decide the value of ATLANT, and not try to artificially inflate it.  Look at the example set by Civic (yes different application, but they got their ICO right).  $33M hard cap at ICO, which created the demand to send it flying to $141M today.  If they had been greedy and gone for $100M, it's entirely possible they would be worth LESS than that today.  It suits you long term to create more demand via cheaper tokens & a smaller cap.   The math is not irrelevant - you are asking people to purchase at an instant loss on the prospect that a $100M market cap has room to grow.

Answer me this:  1. Why would I want to bring the price down as an investor, and 2. Which ""competitor"" am I?

I think I'll take another screenshot soon to show everyone.  •  Now you are banking on the fact that some accounts were created roughly around the same time. Maybe because you pissed a few people off by banning them in other channels at the same time!?!?  •  Honestly I want this thing to Moon, and I'm sure other investors in here don't like reading this drama and would rather sweep it under the rug.

It's 2017, not 1951. Brick and mortar is going away.

Not many people work from an office anymore if they can help it, and fewer companies are using them. I don't work in an office, and almost no one I know does.   One of the most important things to look at, in my humble opinion, is the team involved. Listen to what they say in videos, what they write, what they have done on LInkedIn. Who they are.  We live in a pretty transparent world these days.  The people involved in this project clearly have credentials. That's what's important.  Not where they registered the legal entity. Not what building they sit in when they do their work. This statement ""We seriously doubt that ATLANT, Tensigma or Ten Sigma"" have a required permission and authorization.""  Required by whom?  And for what?  And the link to the announcement from the BVI has nothing whatsoever to do with ATLANT. It's about some other company - some other token.

So I finally signed up, mainly so I could respond to this very interesting project. I will certainly begin to contribute more for other projects.  First, I read the whitepaper a few times. Then I watched the YouTube videos, and then I read every post in this thread. And I checked out the GitHub repositories, and visited some other sites that are ranking ICO's. Then I checked out the whitepapers of some competing real estate ICO's.  I feel that by and large, the ATLANT team seemed to respond gracefully to almost all criticisms, with well-written and intelligent answers, and they seem to have done everything right in terms of creating an ICO - keynote address, sponsorship of FinTech, solid whitepaper, and with a few exceptions, the business model seems pretty sound to me (I understand the concerns about operating a real estate asset in a decentralized way, but I am not ready to throw the idea out the window, since we have seen disruptions and surprises many times over the last 10 years).  I am curious, though, about one thing - I have read the whitepaper carefully, and applied the Hawley test with respect to SEC Compliance, and as far as I can tell, there is very little chance that the ATL token, and thus this ICO, could be viewed as a security by the SEC.  In fact, I remember hearing a comment in one of the videos where the opinion of the legal counsel was that it would not be considered as such.  Forgive the newbie question - but if that's the case, why would the ICO be closed to United States citizens?  It's not a matter of life and death, of course, because we will soon be able to buy the token on exchanges and thus participate in the project and network that way.  But ... what is the main reason for shutting out the U.S. if there is little chance it could be viewed as a security?  I noticed this as well as few months ago with another very popular ICO. On the other hand, I have been able to participate with very little trouble in some other ETH-based ICO's ... just trying to figure out why some are open and some are not.

There are too many red flags and we came to a conclusion that it's a scam. Thats what we found:  1. As of today ATLANT, Tensigma or Ten Sigma does not have an office in New York on 19 W 44th street 1700 New York, NY 10036. Pls check it: http://www.19west44.com/   or go to the building to verify.  2.  There were no signs of presence either ATLANT, Tensigma or Ten Sigma in Bersenevskij pereulok 5/4 untill few weeks ago. After raising funds on pre ICO they have rented a place with one specific purpose: to mislead investors by showing that the company has some physical presence. The rental of the place is available for short term training: https://www.pogostite.ru/conferenc-zaly/moskva/loft-ploshchadka-m-kropotkinskaja  3. ATLANT, Tensigma or Ten sigma which can be linked to the ICO is not registered in the State of New York. Please check it:    https://www.dos.ny.gov/corps/bus_entity_search.html  They might be registered in another state but we doubt it.  4. ATLANT, Tensigma or Ten sigma are not registered in the Russian Federation. Please check: https://egrul.nalog.ru/  5. There is no way to verify if Atlant, Tensigma or Ten Sigma are registered in BVI and event if it's registered who are the shareholders behind the structure. What we know that since July, Financial Service Commission of BVI requires from the company which issues tokens a special permission and authorization: http://www.bvifsc.vg/News/tabid/160/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/1678/language/en-GB/E-Crypto-Trade-Finance-Group-Inc--Public-Statement-No-8-of-2017-10-July-2017.aspx We seriously doubt that ATLANT, Tensigma or Ten Sigma have a required permission and authorization. Therefore that token issue is not legal and most likely fund will simply disappear after ICO. You are free to contact Financial Service Commission of BVI for more info. Their contact details are on the above mentioned page.  All in all we think it's not 100m USD business, but a scam.",True

Also to my understanding this is not something in Alpha state, it show more the intention to begin coding, right ?  Also I took a look on your Alpha-Software in the WEB, to me this is some kind of RAW-Demo of a Exchange based also on some even not modified open-source solution, to me its not related to the product you want to offer like described in you white paper.  Also which wonders me why you showcase in this Alpha Version a exchange function of Crypto_currency to ""ATL"", personaly I am less interested on this because every exchange can you this, where is in this Demo the ATLANT related functionality ? If this was published by error who takes charge of the quality of your engineering efforts ? Is there a Team ?  Also why this timing only two day before your crowd sale ?

Homeowner borrows cash against property 2. Local vendor provides appraisal (Centralized) 3. Local custodian holds property (Centralized) 4. Homeowner auctions tokens representing property on LAT platform (Centralized) 5. Homeowner can repurchase property from current token owner at newly appraised price (Centralized, potential conflict of interest) Potential issues 1 No clear reason for using tokenization or blockchain in the business model 2 Unclear certification or legal framework for custodians 3 Insurance and verification for artworks, other assets is not not explicit 4 Potential conflict of interest in appraisal during asset repurchasing 5 In case of default, subsequent management/sale of fractional collateral unclear 6 Unsubstantiated claims that AAPL shares can be currently traded on a nonoperational system   Business Model 1. On own platform Brickblock creates a token for listed ETF, REF, CTF, CMFs 2. Assets are stored in a “digital trust fund” 3. Tokens of each asset on can be traded on the platform Potential issues 1. “Digital trust fund” custodian is centralized, unclear what happens in the event of default or misappropriation of assets 2. ETFs have a market size of $4 trillion, and substantially higher liquidity than $100 billion cryptocurrency assets. Such instruments would therefore actually reduce liquidity 3. Business model is that of a middleman between a broker and user, and the basis for the claimed cost savings is unclear. Also, the “digital trust fund” will likely have further costs 4. Presale raised funds in non ERC-20 tokens such as ETH, without proper KYC or personal cabinet it is unclear how buyers will be able to receive their Brickblock tokens. 5. Major brokerages Fidelity, Robinhood, etc. currently allow for free trading of ETFs 6. Webpage claims that the product is built on Lisk, Waves, NXT, Hyperledger, Ethereum — these platforms are incompatible, indicating that these claims may be problematic.   Business Model 1. Real tokens will be sold for ETH, subsequent funds will be used to buy real estate 2. Real estate will be sold “when it goes higher” based on unknown “threshold equation” and converted to Real tokens 3. Back to step 1 Potential issues 1. Real seems to be a Ponzi scheme given that there are a finite amount of tokens which are to be used to purchase an ever increasing pool of real estate 2. Unclear legal connection between the Real token and the underlying property 3. Claim that Real tokens are deflationary is unsubstantiated and therefore problematic 4. Real claims “will also ensure that our company will be successful, self sustainable and generate profits from year one in order to have stability as we grow”. This claim is not only unsubstantiated, but appears to possibly contradict multiple securities regulations connected with offerings 5. Unclear why property owners would accept Real as payment and how and at what exchange rate they would receive fiat currency in exchange. 6. Real collects a 10% nonnegotiable fee from all tokenization and income of each property, and targets 12–20% annual returns — 30% is inconsistent with any country’s cap rate 7. No team members have real estate experience, and they also claim a “value approach” that is inconsistent with the angel investing backgrounds of the founders 8. Real estate timing formula on pg. 19 of the Real white paper sells properties after unclear gain, and attempts to time uncertain markets 9. Diagram showing real estate outperforming S&P since 2000 would be completely reversed on a slightly different time frame 10. Claims that system is global, yet property contracts don’t seem to differentiate property register IDs in different jurisdictions, making this claim potentially problematic   Business Model 1. Users who are brokers, landlords or sellers or their verified representatives may list properties on the Rex MLS system 2. Verified users are paid for their listings, while unverified ones pay to list 3. System of sponsorships, and ads charge users additional Rex Potential issues 1. Most MLS providers are not global or even national because they are able to charge fees for every location, which contradicts the proposed Rex business model 2. “Pool B consisting of 20% of Rex token supply, allocated to listing rewards” — it is unclear how this will be paid out if system runs out of tokens 3. Team seems to lack technical expertise. Only the founder is said to have “technical background”, but the bio offers only sparse details. 4. No clear advantages of storing the MLS database on the blockchain are demonstrated in the white paper 5. Unclear how such a small upstart without any initial data, would be able to displace large behemoths in the space who continue to charge for their data, by offering the data for free   Business Model 1. System lists assets which are transferrable via digitally signed agreements Potential issues 1. There is no clear link between an asset and tokens or contracts signed, also not clear how said contract will work internationally 2. The proposed business model of benefits to token holders from the “prediction market” and the “exchange” of fiat currency into crypto is unclear.   Business Model 1. Landlords place listings on the website/ios/android 2. Tenants place bids for listings and are able to pay with bank cards, fiat or REST tokens (Relest’s token) Potential issues 1. Whitepaper contains plethora of grammatical mistakes and inconsistencies making it difficult to read and understand. 2. It is unclear what tokenholders will receive 3. It is unclear why this project needs a blockchain 4. Business model as we understand it from the whitepaper and website does not appear to be compelling, and does not offer clear value to any of its users 5. The platform’s main stated benefit is the ability to pay with REST tokens, it is unclear how this is a benefit 6. System claims to send out SMS confirmation — unclear who would pay for it and how this would work without centralization. 7. Landlord has to specify times for auction periods — if they list each day on auction, and tenant wants to stay for 3 days would they have to win each auction? If so, what if they don’t win the second day? 8. System attempts to monetize features such as chat, calendar, and highlights, all features available for free in competing services   Business Model 1. “Initially the Propy Registry will mirror official land registry records in which transfers of real estate are recorded.” 2. “Propy’s vision is that jurisdictions will adopt the Propy Registry as their official ledger of record such that the transfer of a property” Potential issues 1. In its current iteration, Propy is a blockchainless fiat solution, per the white paper. Propy is mirroring official property transfer mechanisms, and requiring extra work from the users to comply with their platform. Putting this functionality on Blockchain simply mirrors work that is done in traditional registers and by physical notaries, lawyers, etc. 2. System intends to reward participants and governments with its tokens and reserves 35% of PROs for this, and it appears that this approach may constitute direct payments to governments and/or officials which may not be legal in various jurisdictions. What happens when they run out of PROs allocated to this? 3. Business model would work if governments accept and implement Propy blockchain as their official blockchain — this goal is likely impossible, and even if achievable non-authoritarian governments will allow more than one company to work with its blockchain to perform transfer of ownership 4. No GitHub account as of August 28, 2017, yet on June 29. 2017 on BBitcointalk, Propy claimed its GitHub repo would be published in a week. Also, Propy’s appstore app does not seem to be either decentralized or based on smart contracts 5. The founder’s video on YouTube shows that she does not seem to understand whether Bitcoin or Ethereum networks have smart contracts 6. Substantial amount of tokens not available on the market creates an overhang",True

This post is probably the best I have read in a long time. I am all for decentralization, I love it, but we must have in mind that there are very complex problems coming with that. I am not saying it is impossible to somehow realize efficient decentralized ownership, but at this point in time panorama hit the nail on the head. If you allow simple access to people with short-term interests when it comes to property, I am not even sure whether anyone can anticipate the real consequences of that. We are seeing this already with nutrition, where high-frequency traders do more harm that good by destroying prices for stuff like rice. I don't even want to know what could happen to the real estate market should all this materialize in a blockchain based decentralized anonymous flipping market. Again, panorama explained it very very well. It is a lot about expectations in markets. Or - to be more precise - it is only about expectations. And if those are impossible for market participants to be anticipated, the outcome will resemble what we have seen during the financial crisis.",True

A property manager can't make this decision, so it has to go to token owners for a vote, right? For the sake of this example, let's assume that the property needs a new HVAC system. The existing one is still working, but it's on its last legs and should really be replaced. Let's also assume that a ""regular"" owner with a long-term view of the property would see this as an easy decision and replace the system.  Well, you've got a collective of strangers who have different interests, knowledge and resources. Some may have bought property tokens for a quick flip and others may have bought as more of a long-term hold. Others may have bought because the building is down the street from them and they just like the idea of it.  When you invest in a stock, you know that management is focused on shareholder value and there's a Board of Directors that provides oversight. With decentralized ownership, you're in a position where you know absolutely nothing about who's invested alongside you and what motivates them. So, when a decision needs to be made, you have to assume everyone is looking out for their own interests but since you don't know what motivates them, it's impossible to know what to expect or if people will vote rationally.  It's easy enough to trade in and out of individual properties, so I might decide that I'd rather not replace the HVAC system since it's in my interest to maintain higher cash flow in the short term and sell my tokens before it actually breaks down.  This is not in the best interest of the property or ownership in general, but it's in my best interest.  Now, maybe I'm the only one who thinks like this...or maybe 90% of the owners do. Even if I'm a ""rational"" real estate owner who knows that the right decision is to replace the system, the fact that I don't know how others will vote is a big problem. There's real uncertainty.  So, what happens when there's uncertainty? It gets reflected in the value of the asset. Just the fact that potential for issues like this to occur will depress token values relative to the actual property value. It happens with REITs as well...poor management or an inefficient structure can cause a company to trade below NAV.  This is a classic prisoner's dilemma, but it the actual decision outcome doesn't really matter because the fact that the situation exists is what causes serious problems in the first place. I won't even go into what could potentially happen if ownership decides not to replace the HVAC and it breaks down, then you've got to deal with more of an emergency and upset tenants.  I know this could sound like a crazy example, which is why I generalized at first, but I think it's absolutely possible. Maybe this isn't exactly how things would turn out, but I can pretty much guarantee that it's more likely that there's chaos instead of order when it's time to make decisions.  I've got no agenda here and I'm not trying to create FUD...I just don't see decentralized real estate ownership working.",True

Also, saying that you've addressed my concerns about the business model because you've replied to all posts that have a question mark doesn't make any sense.

I outlined why I don't think decentralization would really work and you haven't made any counterpoints that convince me otherwise. Does not including a question mark really matter?  Regarding my comment on condo boards - your're right, it is an assumption. I make decisions based on fact when possible, but sometimes you have to make reasonable assumptions to come to a conclusion. I'm trying to think about this using real world scenarios and it seems pretty clear to me that condo owners and token owners would make decisions in a very different way. I thought this was clear based on the progression of my comments in this thread, but I'm happy to outline my thoughts in more detail.  I'm sorry if I'm coming across as defensive here, but like I said, I've put a lot of thought into this because I was seriously considering participating.

I know they will be hiring management companies, but you still need a knowledgeable decision making authority because things happen in business. I'm not saying that properties will will fall apart, but they won't be maximized, and real estate values are based on capitalizing income. So, by transitioning to a decentralized structure, you are likely to negatively impact the value of the real estate unless you can manage the property at least as well as the person you bought it from. Why would anyone ever want to buy a property token if the value of their investment is likely to go down from day one?

My issues also aren't limited to what I mentioned above. Anyone with experience in real estate can think through examples of their own and consider how decentralized ownership would work.  I can't really comment what the moderator you mentioned said since I didn't hear the session, but I wouldn't disagree that decentralized ownership is the holy grail of real estate if you can do it, but that's a big IF and I don't see it happening. Also, I wouldn't really expect him to say he doesn't think you could do it in a public forum, so his comments don't really mean much to me. If you told me that he was personally investing in your platform or tokenizing one of his assets, that would mean something.  I know this could be a never ending conversation as we obviously disagree on this, so I have no interest in a back and forth.

The significant recent increase in the price of Ether (ETH), Ethereum’s token, is the primary reason for this reduction. The hard cap reduction increases value for ATLANT’s early investors. The ICO hard cap has been reduced as follows:  ATLANT also announced a progressive bonus structure for participating in the ICO. The relative value of ATL tokens will increase for every decile (10%, 20%, etc.) of ATL tokens sold, until 100% of the total allocation has been sold, as shown below.  ATLANT ICO Bonus Scale The hard cap reduction and the new progressive bonus structure for the ICO both reflect ATLANT’s commitment to and our appreciation for our early investors, and also sets the stage for the best overall structure moving forward for our ICO, which launches September 7, 2017.  https://medium.com/@atlantio/atlant-important-ico-update-df9a50ec16da",True

ATL tokens are essentially membership certificates in the ATLANT Platform, which give the following rights and privileges to their owners :  Listing fee charged in ERC20 compliant property tokens, in all properties listed through the ATLANT Platform during their initial property token offerings. The platform enables property owners and developers to tokenize property by creating customized smart contracts and perform a token distribution to either sell property (partially or completely) or attract financing for its construction. The size of the listing fee is initially set at 7% of the underlying asset and, subsequently, determined by voting of the ATL token holders. After a successful token sale, an agreed part of the property tokens is released out of ATLANT escrow to ATL token holders proportionately.  Commissions from P2P rentals are imposed on the lessor, as a small fee, once a transaction with the lessee is finalized. These commissions are distributed to the ATL token holders. The size of this fee is determined by voting of the ATL token holders. Votes to decide various actions taken with respect to the property: platform listing decision, listing fee approval, law firm choice, management company choice (property tokenization), property for rent approval, rental fee approval.  Ability to work, and earn extra income, within the framework of ATLANT as an arbiter for conflict resolution in P2P rentals, moderated via an arbiter rating system. As a result of this work funds withheld from the escrow of the losing party are distributed to the ATL token holder who performed the arbitration.  Influence on the platform and ability to propose, vote on and aid further developments to improve the efficiency of real estate globally, as well as boost ATLANT’s global adoption and growth",True

ATLANT codebase includes ADEX (decentralized exchange) EVM smart contracts to allow for a safe and secure method of exchange between Platform tokens (“ATL”) and property tokens (e.g. “ATLAXXX”). Ether and other ERC20 tokens may also be exchanged for property tokens on the decentralized ADEX exchange. Exchanging tokens by means of this model reduces a number of risks associated with traditional centralized exchanges – e.g. a risk of failure to fulfill its obligations to customers. Nevertheless, it is possible for some part of the tokens to be tradeable at centralized digital currency exchanges as well. From an economic point of view, there is an incentive for both ATL token holders and property token holders to contribute to tokens being traded at centralized exchanges. Tokens are traded via a traditional two-sided market consisting of bids and offers. If there are more buyers or sellers the market mechanism will move the token price, and thus the market  capitalization of the asset, to a clearing level in accordance with the market’s assessment of the property value",True

The size of the listing fee is initially set at 7% of the underlying asset and, subsequently, determined by voting of the ATL token holders. After a successful token sale, an agreed part of the property tokens is released out of ATLANT escrow to ATL token holders proportionately. - Commissions from P2P rentals are imposed on the lessor, as a small fee, once a transaction with the lessee is finalized. These commissions are distributed to the ATL token holders. The size of this fee is determined by voting of the ATL token holders. - Votes to decide various actions taken with respect to the property: platform listing decision, listing fee approval, law firm choice, management company choice (property tokenization), property for rent approval, rental fee approval. - Ability to work, and earn extra income, within the framework of ATLANT as an arbiter for conflict resolution in P2P rentals, moderated via an arbiter rating system.

The mechanics works as follows – you receive a temporary presale ATP token right now. After the ICO is complete your ATP token converts into ATL at a rate of 1 into 2 ATL.

And since the tokens are being traded in exchanges all over the world, there is no way to do that.  I totally agree that if you lose your key, it's your own stupid fault. But if it happens to >10% of the token holders it cripples the other 89%. It is a blockchained contract, right? So the rules cannot be changed anymore.

You're somewhat confusing distributed ledger with the word blockchain. All distributed ledgers do not have to necessarily employ a chain of blocks to successfully provide secure and valid achievement of distributed consensus, a blockchain is only one type of data structure considered to be a distributed ledger, where each block shares data with other blocks and forms a P2P network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Nonetheless, if you read our whitepaper (https://atlant.io/assets/documents/en/Atlant_WP_publish.pdf) carefully you will realize that we at ATLANT are building a completely distributed ledger without any centralized hurdles such as going to the authority upon every transaction which Propy does (which in essence is not changing the system, just slapping the word blockchain to make it sound fancy, and does not really fix the existing problems). ATLANT plans to initially trade PTOs on ADEX exchange based on Ethereum smart contracts, which should answer your second question. Per the last part, as already mentioned, we are not changing the status quo, in other words in an existing infrastructure, even without tokenization, if a fractional owner does not sell for long periods of time, 100% of the building can not be sold, however the remainder can be.

ANSWER:   ATL tokens are essentially membership certificates in the ATLANT Platform, which give the following rights and privileges to their owners :  Listing fee charged in ERC20 compliant property tokens, in all properties listed through the ATLANT Platform during their initial property token offerings. The platform enables property owners and developers to tokenize property by creating customized smart contracts and perform a token distribution to either sell property (partially or completely) or attract financing for its construction. The size of the listing fee is initially set at 7% of the underlying asset and, subsequently, determined by voting of the ATL token holders. After a successful token sale, an agreed part of the property tokens is released out of ATLANT escrow to ATL token holders proportionately.  Commissions from P2P rentals are imposed on the lessor, as a small fee, once a transaction with the lessee is finalized. These commissions are distributed to the ATL token holders. The size of this fee is determined by voting of the ATL token holders. Votes to decide various actions taken with respect to the property: platform listing decision, listing fee approval, law firm choice, management company choice (property tokenization), property for rent approval, rental fee approval.  Ability to work, and earn extra income, within the framework of ATLANT as an arbiter for conflict resolution in P2P rentals, moderated via an arbiter rating system. As a result of this work funds withheld from the escrow of the losing party are distributed to the ATL token holder who performed the arbitration.  Influence on the platform and ability to propose, vote on and aid further developments to improve the efficiency of real estate globally, as well as boost ATLANT’s global adoption and growth",True

Rex   doesn't tokenize properties, it just lists them, kind of like zillow or trulia, or any of the other services that do this well without the need for a blockchain  The ATLANT platform will enable subdision of individual parcels of real estate by tokenization, and ATLANT will subsequently list them on exchanges via PTO (Property Token Offering), starting with the decentralized ADEX exchange, based on Ethereum smart contracts.     What we plan to do is create a tradeable market place for individual real estate properties which would revolutionize one of the world's largest markets. Also we plan to disrupt booking and airbnb which charge upwards of 30% because of their bloated staff. Many other real estate projects just replicate what already exists such as etfs or reits in a crypto wrapper - which we think is not terribly useful or innovative. However our project has solid foundation, experienced team which has business (investment banking / hedge funds) and technical expertise having built previous crypto projects    Propy is basically a cheap script, imitating Zillow or Trulia - it does not let you tokenize properties or purchase properties with cryptocurrency. Look at their video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQQLy11uhgs on time index 01:33. Don’t just focus on the fact that Steven Johnson is a US Citizen yet a Ukrainian National, look carefully at the domain name on the title bar. You will see that they bought a $500 off the shelf real estate script, and put their logos into it, and forgot to change the website when creating their video. Further, while they purportedly record everything on the blockchain at time index 2:05 they say that they bring the title to the local authority for approval – this does not sound very decentralized, and is not possible without a massive amount of staff, in each location where this is done. Further they allege that this is possible in the US where no authority can guarantee that there are no leans against the property, and it is almost always necessary to purchase title insurance, in the event that a lean is found down the road. They fail to mention any of this. What I can say is, good luck to Propy investors… :')",True

Thanks for writing the article – we share your passion, and appreciate it that you are into this subject as much as we are, and took the time write.   1. How do you see ATLANT affecting the mortgage industry?  When we’re eventually able to interact with government property blockchains, substantially, however for now we will try to disrupt other parts of the ecosystem.   How do you see ATLANT affeccting the Real Estate industry?  We would like to turn the real estate industry on its head. The industry is massive but not transparent or liquid. We want to make it so large commercial buildings trade similar to stocks, with bids and offers, and so that rentals whether it’s short term or long have 1/10th of the current fees, while bearing true quality ratings. In our opinion this is nothing short of a revolution.   How will ATLANT handle property taxes in the varied markets through out the world?  Property taxes will be handled by the real estate management company appointed by the tokenholders.   Will there be a need for real estate agents and or mortgage companies in this business model? If so, how so?  Real estate agents – initially yes, eventually, ATLANT or a similar model will replace them. Mortgage companies, same effect, but with a longer duration.   So I understand, you are ultimately build a real estate stock exchange where people can put their property up for sale on the exchange which is then converted into a token, buyable and tradeable?  In short, yes   What will dictate each properties value on the tokenized market and how will one property be differentiated by another on the market?  Adam Smith’s invisible hand does its magic. I’m halfway kidding, but just as any other efficient market, buyers and sellers come to a point at which they are willing to meet, and trades happen there. The fewer the frictional costs and transaction fees, the higher the volume, and thereby efficiency of the price finding mechanism.   How will ATLANT handle property transfer of ownership?  SPV which owns the asset is tokenized, tokens are rights to shares. Transfer happens by buying and selling these tokens.   How would you help facilitate real estate agents looking to sell their clients property through your system, or rent them out for clients?  ATLANT is agnostic as to who brings rental properties to it, or property assets to tokenize. While we would prefer to deal with beneficiaries, intermediaries could try to facilitate these trades. However, the whole process is set up in such a way so that they are not needed.   Will the Atlant market place function as an auction?  It will function as an exchange – similar to a way that BTC or ETH trade against fiat. What is someone tries to sell a property worth $200,000 in their market for $300,000 in ATLANT? How will property valuation be handled for potential buyers in other countries?  We have a higher minimum for property size at the time, however in the initial PTO (property token offering) of the asset if the seller would like to sell substantially above market, the PTO will likely not be filled and similar to ICOs when soft-cap is not reached monies are returned to investors.   I am writing a HUGE article on this right now and greatly appreciate your responses in as much detail as possible.  Thanks Upstager",True

We don't just list plots - we are a platform for listing tokenized real estate assets. When they are listed subsequently they trade similar to stocks. All of the information regarding the asset will be listed on our blockchain, this includes legal documents as well as photos, etc.   There are several similar projects, without the blockchain, for instance Realty Shares. But n Realty Shares or other similar schemes you do not have the liquidity of the secondary market, meaning once you buy a piece of their property and receive some income you might be happy, but the second you come to sell you're at the behest of where they bid you or someone that comes to them that wants to bid you for your piece. Given that this is real estate, and is a terribly inefficient market, without an order screen and competitive bids and offers you would likely have to sell to them below the prevailing market price. With ATLANT, you have a real bid x offer screen so you know the true price of the asset. Not to mention that it will be substantially more liquid.

ANSWER ATL tokens are essentially membership certificates in the ATLANT Platform, which give the following rights and privileges to their owners :  Listing fee charged in ERC20 compliant property tokens, in all properties listed through the ATLANT Platform during their initial property token offerings. The platform enables property owners and developers to tokenize property by creating customized smart contracts and perform a token distribution to either sell property (partially or completely) or attract financing for its construction. The size of the listing fee is initially set at 7% of the underlying asset and, subsequently, determined by voting of the ATL token holders. After a successful token sale, an agreed part of the property tokens is released out of ATLANT escrow to ATL token holders proportionately.  Commissions from P2P rentals are imposed on the lessor, as a small fee, once a transaction with the lessee is finalized. These commissions are distributed to the ATL token holders. The size of this fee is determined by voting of the ATL token holders. Votes to decide various actions taken with respect to the property: platform listing decision, listing fee approval, law firm choice, management company choice (property tokenization), property for rent approval, rental fee approval.  Ability to work, and earn extra income, within the framework of ATLANT as an arbiter for conflict resolution in P2P rentals, moderated via an arbiter rating system. As a result of this work funds withheld from the escrow of the losing party are distributed to the ATL token holder who performed the arbitration.  Influence on the platform and ability to propose, vote on and aid further developments to improve the efficiency of real estate globally, as well as boost ATLANT’s global adoption and growth.

Sorry for being repettetive, but I'll quote again from pg 8-9 of the ATLANT White Paper, in the paragraphs below. The fees for the rental portion will be instantaneous, for tokenized properties - upon tokenization events. For PTOs, they will be set by voting of token holders, in conjunction with management companies of each PTO, likely on a monthly basis, for the most part.  ===== ATL tokens are essentially membership certificates in the ATLANT Platform, which give the following rights and privileges to their owners:  Listing fee charged in ERC20 compliant property tokens, in all properties listed through the ATLANT Platform during their initial property token offerings. The platform enables property owners and developers to tokenize property by creating customized smart contracts and perform a token distribution to either sell property (partially or completely) or attract financing for its construction. The size of the listing fee is initially set at 7% of the underlying asset and, subsequently, determined by voting of the ATL token holders. After a successful token sale, an agreed part of the property tokens is released out of ATLANT escrow to ATL token holders proportionately.  Commissions from P2P rentals are imposed on the lessor, as a small fee, once a transaction with the lessee is finalized. These commissions are distributed to the ATL token holders. The size of this fee is determined by voting of the ATL token holders. Votes to decide various actions taken with respect to the property: platform listing decision, listing fee approval, law firm choice, management company choice (property tokenization), property for rent approval, rental fee approval.  Ability to work, and earn extra income, within the framework of ATLANT as an arbiter for conflict resolution in P2P rentals, moderated via an arbiter rating system. As a result of this work funds withheld from the escrow of the losing party are distributed to the ATL token holder who performed the arbitration.  Influence on the platform and ability to propose, vote on and aid further developments to improve the efficiency of real estate globally, as well as boost ATLANT’s global adoption and growth.",True

QUESTION Hi,  I have a few starting questions... 1. Why do the ATL tokens need to get converted into ATP tokens after the ICO? 2. What is your plan in the event the Ethereum network becomes too congested as has already happened a few times? Their blockchain is bloating and within a year or two may become unusable if they don't implement scaling solutions fast enough. ANy plans to possibly migrate to Tezos, EOS, or something that wont be congested? 3. What is the status of your end-user app? 4. What is the status of your github? 5. You are at least the 4th Real estate ICO this month. Already there is REX, REAL, and PROPY. Explain how you are superior to these and why I should invest with you instead? 6. You are trying to capture aprox 6.2 Million ETH in the ICO (315,000,000 ATL tokens / 505 per ETH = 6.2M ETH = $1.3 BILLION USD) What in the world are you going to do with 1.3 BILLION USD ?!?! 7. Which exchanges will you be launching the tokens for trading post ICO?  ANSWER 1. Because we are in a presale phase where we are giving 1010 atl vs 505 atl per eth and via a smart contract. We are initially issuing atp which will automatically concrete to 2 atl after the ico. So you have it reversed. 2. We are building our own blockchain which will work together with the ethereum platform, thus we do not envision such problems. 3. It is in alpha phase, we are working hard on it. 4. Please see our github: https://github.com/AtlantPlatform 5. Rex for instance doesn't tokenize properties, it just lists them, kind of like zillow or trulia, or any of the other services that do this well without the need for a blockchain  The ATLANT platform will enable subdision of individual parcels of real estate by tokenization, and ATLANT will subsequently list them on exchanges via PTO (Property Token Offering), starting with the decentralized ADEX exchange, based on Ethereum smart contracts.     What we plan to do is create a tradeable market place for individual real estate properties which would revolutionize one of the world's largest markets. Also we plan to disrupt booking and airbnb which charge upwards of 30% because of their bloated staff. Many other real estate projects just replicate what already exists such as etfs or reits in a crypto wrapper - which we think is not terribly useful or innovative. However our project has solid foundation, experienced team which has business (investment banking / hedge funds) and technical expertise having built previous crypto projects 6. Your math is wrong. 315 000 000 / 505 * 200 =~$125m 7. As I mentioned, we have been in the crtpto space for some time. We have already started to talk with several exchanges, who should be keen to list ATL",True
