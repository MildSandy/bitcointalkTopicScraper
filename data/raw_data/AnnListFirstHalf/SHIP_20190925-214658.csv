I see the biggest problems as:  a) no disclosure of the financials.  b) no visibility of real system development.  c) shadows regarding the past of the CEO.  It would be rather easy to support the token price if it can be proved that the vast amount of the ICO funds are still there and for backing up the project (ie. not already disappeared in the pockets of the project executives). Not to say, that adds credibility to the CEO and strengthens the relationship with investors. The token should be worth at least about the intrinsic value of the ETH held, that bolsters the price.  As investor I demand that the financials get disclosed and good standing is demonstrated. That would be a credibility proof for the CEO, and if he fails it would be reason to make a case against him in the context of the security fraud allegations.",False

As I see that this project has serious problems (and I don't wish that upon anyone ) I would like to present to you an alternative in the intermodal bussines space. There is another project called IMC. It has been announced about 3 months ago here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3106705.0  The site is here: http://intermodalcoin.online/  Currently we are just entering a phase where we are beggining an extensive marketing campaingn and also finishing our platform whith which we are trying to completely change how intermodal works. The project is not aimed at only one subsector but at the whole intermodal industry. If we pull it off this is a huge market.  While currently the price is very low (because of dumping unfortunatelly) I beleive we are now at a turning point with all the activity being done. If you don't beleive me, please join our discord (https://discord.gg/zwRvuDc) to see what I talk about. We also have quite a few people in our community that are from the intermodal world. We will answer all you question in the Discord and give you any additional info you need. The website is also being redesigned as well as our whole image. We are also starting a bounty in the following days.  Anyway I mean in no way to impose, I posted this just as an alternative for those who are looking for one. Otherwise I wish the project luck and you people a lot of future BTC earnings  Let me just add the disclaimer: While I am a moderator in the IMC Discord and activly helping the team with the project I am not directly connected to them.

The industry as it currently stands is plagued by a number of inefficiencies explained by ShipChain in their whitepaper. The DHL Customer Solutions & Innovation team represented by Dr. Markus Kückelhaus, Vice President Innovation and Trend Research, Gina Chung, Global Director Innovation and Trend Research and Matthias Heutger, Senior Vice President, Global Head of Innovation, is confident that ShipChain’s revolutionary platform will eliminate these issues and increase value as they explained in the official DHL report, “Blockchain In Logistics” which features ShipChain.  According to Roger Crook, former CEO at DHL Global Forwarding, Freight and Chief Strategy Officer of ShipChain, “Blockchain will be a big game changer for supply chains and logistics to reduce inefficiencies and enable integration across the supply chain. It is great to see leading logistics company DHL seeing and investigating the opportunity to use smart contracts and blockchain in the future to help solve inefficiencies and to help to integrate supply chains in the future.”  The DHL Customer Solutions & Innovation team that researched and wrote the report involving ShipChain believe that “blockchain has the significant potential to increase efficiency along the entire logistics and settlement process including trade finance and help to resolve disputes in the logistics industry.” They look to ShipChain’s “track and trace” platform to enable smart contracts that are boosting accuracy and transparency. They go on to say that “by joining forces, we can create the right foundations for successful industry adoption of blockchain and we can ultimately unlock new value in logistics.”  ShipChain CEO John Monarch says, “It’s exciting to see companies at the scale of DHL investigating blockchain and smart contracts, and we’re very proud to have been one of their example cases.  We thoroughly enjoyed our discussions with the DHL team, and look forward to continued conversations with them.“  Great to see Shipchain being recognized my the biggest logistics company in the world.

You can still send to it without issue but if you should double-check the address before doing so, especially if you hand-typed it.  If you are sending to one of your own wallets, you can save the checksummed address via the ""View Wallet Info"" page and copy the address displayed there.

Regarding KYC:  1.  We are within the United States, and as such, subject to US Laws.  That means we are working to comply with OFAC regulations and sanctions.  In doing this, we've contracted with a third party, trusted KYC provider, Onfido.  https://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/offices/Pages/Office-of-Foreign-Assets-Control.aspx  Onfido has been around for ~6 years, and handles KYC for companies like Square payments even  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onfido  2.  ShipChain does not retain your information.  Onfido processes it and we work through it to make sure all compliance needs are met.  3.  If you are receiving the emails from Onfido, but do not wish to participate, there is a link in the email that says ""I no longer need my identity verified"" - This will immediately stop all future emails, and remove you from our verification list.  If you don't wish to participate in the airdrop, the same applies.  We are working hard to make sure this is done as above board, and compliant as possible, and appreciate the patience.  If you have any questions, our team is always available in our Telegram group as well:  https://t.me/shipchain  Thanks!",False

ShipChain finished its prototype last year and are launching their pilot program with Purdue during this quarter. And that partnership is just one of many more coming. On telegram the devs confirmed more partnerships in the works that they won't disclose until they're finalized.  Former VP of DHL Global Forwarding is on the team. Not an advisor... the team. DHL tasked this guy to work on a platform project to fix the ineficiencies in the industry, and then proceeded to throw nearly a billion dollars at this project. Didn't work. What DHL didn't realize is that the platform needed blockchain, and thats what ShipChain brings to the table. The fact that DHL committed so many resources to solving this problem is a huge green flag that ShipChain is tackling something that needs fixing. They are trying to distrupt a *multi-trillion* dollar industry.  Now go look up BiTA - The Blockchain in Trucking Alliance. This is an organization that includes UPS and FedEx: http://www.nasdaq.com/article/ups-steers-into-blockchain-trucking-alliance-cm880232 Guess which ICO is a part of that UPS/FedEx blockchain alliance? ShipChain: https://www.freightwaves.com/news/shipchain-joins-blockchain-in-trucking-allliance   This isn't something that looks to compete or rival Walton/VeChain, but to work with them. This isn't for BMW or Wine supplies -- its for the truckers and freight operators that deliver the products that VeChain and Walton will authenticate. I highly reccomend reading their section in the whitepaper on how the industry works now to see that this compliments Walton/VeChain rather than competes with them.

The logistics industry currently faces numerous problems, including lack of visibility, lack of accountability, high markups from middlemen, and a high occurrence of fraud and theft.  With our technology, and the SHIP token, ShipChain will be able to use blockchain to resolve the biggest problems facing the industry today.  Taking a holistic, multimodal (truck, rail, air, sea) approach enables us to unify the industry in a way that has never been possible until today.  [ SHIPCHAIN PARTNERS ]      ShipChain accomplishes these goals through a combination of contract initiation on the Ethereum blockchain, as well as use of sidechains to facilitate the flow of logistics data, such as telemetry, geolocation, bill of lading, and other necessary information.  The high transaction costs of ethereum for large scale volume are reduced, and specific information for shipping is stored in these sidechains to increase transaction speed, provide a store for specialized info, and reduce cost.  This allows the goal of a unified, industry-wide track and trace environment to occur in a low cost, high speed, trusted method.     [ WEB PLATFORM ]  ShipChain will allow for web booking using the SHIP token, as well as fiat currencies converted to SHIP on site.  Shippers of goods can link directly with freight carriers, choose their individual routes and lanes, and avoid costly middlemen.  This allows for lower cost freight, while carriers will keep more of what they earn to move the shipment.  ShipChain will offer a transparent, low fee environment, cutting out unnecessary steps.  AI guidance to assist in choosing the best route based on variable inputs such as shipper preference, hazardous materials, weather, traffic, and even IoT data received from trucks such as pothole avoidance, and much more, will benefit shippers and drivers in reducing the cost and transit time.  The ShipChain Web platform will also be one of two revenue models for ShipChain, in which a small, transparent markup percentage is applied to the booking of freight.  This is in stark contrast to the existing method of high markup brokers by phone.    [ REWARDS ]  With a shortage of over 100,000 truck drivers in the US alone, and that number expected to grow to over 250,000 by 2025, there are significantly more shipments than there are drivers to handle it.  While self-driving trucks are on the horizon, it is doubtful that regulators will fully allow them to be autonomous in the near future.  In the ShipChain ecosystem, drivers are rewarded for participating in numerous ways, with portions of transaction fees being sent to their SHIP wallet directly.  Not breaking the speed limit too many times, on-time delivery, log compliance, eco-friendly driving, and a high customer rating all contribute into determining how much SHIP they receive as a reward.  This entices new drivers to join the industry, while also helping carriers maintain margins, all the while benefitting owner-operators even more.  [ SHIP TOKEN ]  The SHIP token fuels the ecosystem by acting both as a membership requirement on the blockchain, as well as a method of payment.  While the web platform will allow for multicurrency booking, booking actually takes place on the blockchain using the SHIP token.  SHIP are distributed to drivers based on their tier of rewards, and carriers must hold the token to participate and receive loads.  500,000,000 tokens will be minted, and broken down as such:    [ TEAM ]      [ ADVISORS ]         [ PRESS ]    BOUNTY PROGRAM COMING BELOW",False
