Is there a way to give visitors that same mining option as the jse platform gives? like a different kind of mining pool No the publisher mining from the visitors perspective is quite simple and designed to not interfere with the publishers site once they've opted in. If that mining option is possible is it possible to add a hosting fee?

These have been ongoing for some time and while I think the Ad Block Plus issue isn't resolvable without paying them an extortion fee (pay to play), Yandex is and should be resolved if we can get through to the right person. This has proved challenging though as we've contacted them in various ways to three different office addresses and are still yet to even get a acknowledgement that they have received the letters/emails.  @WanmeiBTC 1. For subID? you can't reset it but you could potentially just use a diferent sub id so for user 123 you could use subid 123a then 123b which would reset it to zero. Is that the kind of thing you are trying to do? 2. It varies across different geos and each website will be different. 3. Yes we can add different ad sizes fairly easily however these will be reliant on publishers manually setting up the ad code tags so wont have as much volume. You can turn off the top ad if it is unwanted in the publisher setup under advanced settings. 4. No we need it to be visible and clear for legal reasons. We offer minor customisations, top or bottom, light or dark but can't allow publishers to shrink it down. 5. The developers are a very small team and don't provide individual support for the growing user base (otherwise we would get nothing done).

I think in the long term it's probably better to have a system that is more automated as it scales, isn't biased, can't be sued (except maybe in America) etc. The suspensions only affects publishers that are sending high volumes of automated bot traffic to their sites. Self-miners, investors, publishers with normal amounts of bot traffic which behaves normally (googlebot for example) wouldn't be affected.

However, Central Bank of Sri-Lanka officials consider crypto as something to look forward to only in the future, which might take 5 to 10 years. This position could be partially explained by a relatively low Internet penetration rate in Sri Lanka, which makes most of its citizens still unaware of Bitcoin.

En 2018 se comercializarán más de $ 200 mil millones de dólares a través de intercambios de anuncios en todo el mundo. Muchos de estos intercambios están interrelacionados y revendiendo el inventario de los demás. Google es el mayor jugador en el campo con una gran red de sitios web de editores a través de sus plataformas Adsense y DoubleClick.  Hay otros proyectos de blockchain también dirigidos a este espacio, pero a nuestro entender estos son principalmente reventa de inventario y ningún otro proyecto del que tengamos conocimiento tiene una base de editores tan grande como JSEcoin que en el momento presente se encuentra en 23,000 sitios web de editores y 12,000,000 de impresiones por día.  Esta base de editores se ha creado a través de la plataforma de minería de editores y el 81% de los editores también han optado por mostrar anuncios adicionales una vez que estén disponibles. Esto proporciona un gran suministro directo establecido para la red que ya está lista y lista para funcionar.  Con un eCPM conservador de $ 5 (Ingresos por cada mil visitantes) estimamos que este tráfico está valuado en alrededor de $ 1,500,000 USD por mes. 12,000,000 impresiones diarias / 1000 * $ 5 * 81% * 30 días = $ 1,458,000 Estas son las cifras actuales, mientras que el token no es negociable, después de la cotización en bolsa esperamos que aumenten los volúmenes en el lado del editor.  Existe un gran potencial aquí para que JSEcoin agregue valor a los editores que quieran extraer y obtener ingresos adicionales a través de la publicidad al mismo tiempo. Todas las características publicitarias serán opcionales y los propietarios del sitio web pueden encenderlas y apagarlas según lo deseen por sitio. Esto no se publicará hasta que el token aparezca en la lista de intercambio para que los editores puedan comparar directamente la publicidad JSE con los intercambios tradicionales como AdSense.  La demanda de publicidad vendrá de anunciantes de marcas, compradores de medios, vendedores afiliados, revendedores y vendedores de respuestas directas. Se trata de grandes clientes que podrán, desde el punto de vista técnico y financiero, adquirir grandes volúmenes de tokens JSE en intercambio para financiar sus campañas publicitarias.  El equipo de JSE tiene contactos existentes en la industria de la tecnología publicitaria y se proporcionará un presupuesto de mercadotecnia para lanzar el intercambio tanto a los nuevos editores como a los anunciantes.  La publicidad tendrá la forma de un sistema multicanal en el que el editor podrá habilitar / deshabilitar cada canal para adaptarlo a la audiencia de su sitio y a los requisitos de monetización.  Banner publicitario / Video / Native Intersticial / Pop bajo Monetización de texto / enlace Redirigir / anuncio de enlace corto Cuando se realiza una sola transacción, el anunciante deberá comprar la cantidad total de JSE en el intercambio. Un porcentaje de los editores que reciben los tokens se venderá inmediatamente y un porcentaje mantendrá sus tokens creando un desequilibrio en la oferta y la demanda que podría beneficiar a todos los interesados en el proyecto . Esto formará una parte importante de la economía de JSE.    El desarrollo y las pruebas del intercambio de anuncios comenzarán este año con la función en funcionamiento en 2019.          Implemented in 23,000 websites and its value today is 0.006 (symbolic value without being yet negotiable) many publishers already rely on the currency, as far as I'm concerned, it is already a great success today.  With a conservative eCPM of $ 5: 12,000,000 impressions per day / 1000 * $ 5 * 81% * 30 days = $ 1,458,000  Now, if we divide the estimate of $ 5 between 30 days (for every 1000 visitors a day) the JSEcoin currency can easily be worth 0.16 cents in its first stage of life, once it goes to market. So according to the project continues to develop ... if you get a good volume of people interested in the project its revaluation can be brutal, it seems to me sincerely the best project of 2018 with difference by:  -Energy saving -to eliminate junk advertising ie (malawares, coarse images of nude women that will benefit everyone since any parent does not want his / her minor child to see that type of advertising, etc.) -Web sites will be cleaner, more reliable, increase in user visits. -We can choose tomorrow if we implement the clean and reliable advertising that JSEcoin offers or directly only use javascript and the most important thing for any webmaster is that we can all access that clean advertising since today that is almost impossible for any web little. -Javascript only consumes 10% of the resources of the pc, we are going to eat coinhive and other competitions. -The team of JSEcoin is great, you answer to everything, you are transparent, legal and friendly, which gives a lot of confidence to the investor and to all those who decide to trust in JSEcoin and above you commit to donate to organizations to help.  I have no doubt that this project will be the best of 2018. But if life circumstances do not convince people I am proud to have contributed to the ico and will contribute at the time I can to help you.  Note: I'm from Spain, I think the JSEcoin team should contact a Spanish-speaking youtuber, to promote JSEcoin, since it's not well known here, it's just a suggestion.  Note: the mathematical operation that I did is a simulation for a small web, I am not an expert and possibly this badly done, if you read this message, go to the JSEcoin website.

Should have a new build out over the next couple of days.  migiz, yeah we couldn't have timed it worse really with the market downturn. We are still hoping the markets and ICO pick up but it's not the end of the world if it doesn't. I believe in the long term future of the project and cryptocurrency in general. Bear markets are only temporary if cryptocurrency is going to go mainstream one day and take over from government controlled fiat currencies. With regards to funding we still have the option of VC funding further down the line. We wont be able to afford the $2m+ listing fees for Binance or Bittrex in the short term but even if we'd hit hard cap this probably wouldn't have been justifiable. The funds we have had in could be valued at a much higher amount by the end of the ICO and if the markets start to rise, investor sentiment will increase alongside of it so fingers crossed it will pick up sooner rather than later. We are going to be proactive and continuing to build awareness around the project regardless. Good point on the videos, these have slowed down since the ICO started. We will try and get some more out there. We have some pre-recorded AMA's as well but if anyone has any questions they would like us to answer then please go ahead and we will do some new ones.

The jsecoin.com domain is currently a single point of failure. All the publisher traffic goes through it and it's used for the platform miners as well, all be it a subdomain and separate nodes. The vast majority of traffic goes through the Google load balancer that handles that domain name and then splits it off in different directions. If the website died then this wouldn't affect the publisher or platform system because they are separate. If that domain got hacked/stolen etc. then we would have to either figure out how to get it back or register a new domain and rebrand or something along those lines. It wouldn't be a good scenario. We will always need a point of discovery for the network, to mitigate risk however at a later stage it would be beneficial to divide this into multiple access points around the globe, perhaps even owned and managed by partners.  2. If you believe that Ethereum is real decentralzation or decentralized enough to meet your criteria then we will be fully integrating the ERC20 functionality in October so users can hold tokens in 3rd party wallets on Ethereums blockchain, transfer between wallets, deposit/withdraw to and from the platform. With the JSE network we need more volume before we open up the client-side consensus (end goal). We currently have around 20,000 concurrent active connections at any one time which wouldn't be enough to prevent a 51% attack from a large bot net. We could use the interim solution at any point which is actually coded and ready to go. Currently the nodes use trusted ECDSA signatures to prevent attacks but we could turn this off by changing one variable in the code base which would enable a standard consensus system using the node servers. We would need some incentive to 3rd parties to run the nodes and at enough scale to prevent abuse, PoS or something like that. Ideally I'd like to see the network get a huge influx of publisher traffic when we list on exchange and tokens become tradeable and hold a USD value. Then we can start work on rolling out the webRTC network in stages. It'll be a slow process and something we need to do lots of testing with. We have already run tests it in a local environment but this is very different to a real world scenario where funds are at stake. The client-side consensus algorithm will be up and running securely throughout the network in 2019, exact date I wouldn't like to say until we are closer to a finished product.",False

In theory as the number of publishers increases, exposure to the project will increase alongside it and price on exchange should increase. This means each publisher will be earning less JSE individually but the tokens they earn will be worth more compared to USD/BTC etc. This is a generalization though and as everyone knows pricing of cryptocurrency can be very volatile and not necessarily related to a individual projects merits.  We do have the option to adjust the number of rewards per block and the value of mining rewards at any point and we have adjusted them in the past (not since last year) to balance out supply and demand. This is something we are reluctant to do too frequently because everyone is happy when the rewards go up but to reduce them would cause a negative backlash.  Currently for most medium sized websites there are enough rewards going out that their daily earnings wont fluctuate due to variance. If the project grows to the size we hope and we have millions of websites then both the earnings for smaller publishers and also the self-mining rewards, assuming we have more self-miners as well, will become more like a traditional lottery where the rewards are higher valued but much less frequent.

But others outside the project, if they can at least give their opinion on how much can be worth.  If we compare with Bitcoin, we must consider the total amount of existing currencies, which in the case of Bitcoin are 21 million and in the case of JSEcoin are 10 billion, but in equivalent capital the Bitcoin is currently around 360 billion dollars and in the case of JSEcoin if we take into account the capital in value of ICO would be about 60 million dollars, if we match the capital, in case JSEcoin reaches a similar capital value, it could exceed a value of more than 60 USD per JSE token, which means that if you invested 50 USD during the ICO period you would receive about 8333 JSE (without counting the bonus) that if you multiply them by 60 you would get a total of 499,980 USD (almost half a million dollars, for having invested only 50 USD).  * The total capital of Bitcoin taken into account is based on the current average quote.

We reached the 20 million JSE ICO distribution a few days ago, and there has been about a further 150k distribution after that, so far.  At this pace, that means only about 150 million ICO distribution by end date of Oct. 11. This isn't even higher than the total amount that has been mined as of today. There would be no point dragging the ICO out beyond that.  That means about $900k for the team to advance the project. Is that enough? I don't know.  This is far below the 5 billion distribution or $30 million hard cap hoped for. I understand though that something far below $30 million, but still much above $900k, could still be adequate.  What I see are many more interested in getting the exchange going and fantasizing about possible price, than actually investing in the project in the first place.  There are 90k+ registrants, 20K+ publishers, and 3k+ miners, the vast majority whom have apparently not yet showed up for the ICO.  I would have thought these groups would have been the most dependable investors. Apparently not, so far.  I don't know the JSE team, but am impressed with what they've done and how they've handled everything so far.

The 20m we've now exceeded was a worse case scenario target. We now have funds to allocate for marketing as well which we are startign to use on PR, banner ads, paid ICO listings etc. Because we started small we were always going to have to ramp up awareness for the project and build an investor audience. Also a lot of investors will leave it to the last minute. On the Pre-ICO for example we had roughly 50% come in on the last day I think. The 5b is a long way off and an ambitious target, no doubt about that but it gives us head room and a best case scenario to work to. In the crypto markets a single endorsement could mean the project sells out overnight and we need to allow for that.  Already, with the funds we have in, we can list on exchange and cover basic costs to give us a two year runway to build the project. We are only two weeks into the ICO and over the next two and a half months I think we will inevitably get more investment. How much remains to be seen and really comes down to how well we execute the marketing. If we can get that right then we can maximize the chances of making the project a long-term success.  @Gameron yes we are aware of 3rd party sales via the platform. I would say be very careful who you are buying tokens off as there are a lot of scams going around, especially on social channels like Telegram/Discord. There is a positive that I believe the people purchasing the tokens are more likely to hodl rather than the ones selling to make a quick buck. This isn't a bad thing once we come to list on exchanges.  @migiz as Rod said we can't offer financial advice or speculation about price movements of any type for legal reasons.

These are the ones that are less interested in the future price and holding for investment, and more interested in getting any price, which is better than ""free"".  So there might be a short term dump driving the price below the .006 ICO price when the exchange happens, and maybe some investors are counting on this, buying in the market, rather than investing in the ICO now.  Does it make any sense to clear the air now, get the exchange going, let this happen, have low float at the beginning, then slowly sell supply into the market as it can absorb it at $.006 until funding goal is achieved?

No need for JSE to be worth more than 1000 USD for each TOKEN, with its value reaches 1 dollar, we are talking about that if you bought at 0.006, you almost get a profit 200x, that is if you invested 1 USD when its price it was 0.006 USD, you will get a profit of almost 200 USD. And that of reaching 1 USD for JSE is something that many might consider difficult to achieve, but with that they give an idea of the potential of profit of this currency, if they add the qualities that JSE offers and that make it different from the rest of TOKENS that seem to be just clones of a single old-fashioned model.",False

SuperV, no the 20,000,000 figure on the ICO page is our first target which we are just over half way to reaching. This will give us enough funds to pay for exchange listing and start marketing and building awareness of the project. The hard cap is 5b so still a long way to go to reach that figure. The most important thing is the exchange listing as that will give us liquidity within the project and enable users to exchange JSE for BTC/ETH and then ultimately transfer to their local currencies. This will be key because at the moment it is a challenge to convince publishers and merchants to use a token that has no exchangeable value. Having said that there's a lot of early adopters that have been willing to take a leap of faith in the project which I am very greatful for. Once listed on exchange we will have a complete package which will make adoption so much easier.  We've tried a number of traffic sources so far to raise awareness many of which are too broad. I think the audience really needs to be specific to cryptocurrency holders/investors for digital marketing campaigns to succeed. Twitter/Facebook have good targeting options but both are placing crypto ads in a grey area so we have to work around their restrictions.

If you restart the app completely from the taskbar or by restarting your PC it should work.  Whotheff, Question 1: I noticed that JSE is a UK based and registered company. How will Brexit influence it in 2019? I can't see Brexit having a big influence on our project. In theory EU regulations wont apply to the UK any more but neither the EU or the UK are regulating the cryptocurrency space at present. At the moment it is working in our favour because the government are so preoccupied with Brexit they aren't interferring with cryptocurrency/ICO's etc. Worse case scenario if they put negative legislation in place would be we would need to move the company to an offshore safe haven but at the moment there's no sign or plans for that happening.  Question 2: How are you planning to decentralize the (currently centralized) coin? The code is already written in https://github.com/JSEcoin/server/blob/master/modules/p2p.js to run as a decentralized network. However at the moment the risk to reward ratios for full decentralization just aren't there so we use ECDSA signatures to verify internal trusted nodes. The network is still running at relatively low volume and a 51% attack would be fairly easy to carry out for an attacker if we didn't do this. Assuming nothing changes politically then we will remain running the nodes internally until it becomes possible to decentralize further. We have a unique opportunity in this project that we already have simultaneous mining connections from tens of thousands of devices. I think in the future rather than run the consensus algorithm on the servers it would be better to use these devices themselves to reach consensus rather than server based nodes. This is the direction I would like to take the project but it is very reliant on volumes. I've seen reports in the media about botnets comprised of quarter of a million devices, we would need our network to be larger than the biggest bot net and improved fraud/bot detection systems to prevent misuse.",False

We definitely got some good users who continued to log in and mine but I think a significant amount will be zero retention rate users who don't return to the platform except to transfer tokens. We could potentially do another airdrop in the future either totally fresh or let everyone who didn't participate last time have another go. There are no firm plans for this at the moment though. If we analyse the new users from the airdrop in a months time and decide there was significant value to the project as a whole then we might consider doing another one during the ICO.  Hi Mamaecrypto, yes sure you can mine on pretty much any device with a web browser. We are still having some issues with the desktop app disconnecting when mining and going back to the ""start mining"" button. Working on a fix now. In the meantime I'd recommend using https://platform.jsecoin.com and under advanced settings using the slider to adjust the hash rate to a point where you aren't causing any issues for the old computer but are finding one hash every 30 seconds.",False

I just switched over to the new desktop app - github updated version, and I have a couple questions about it (I know it may still be buggy).  I notice my hashrate is a bit higher on the desktop app, but I am finding WAY less hashes than the website version. Are the two versions of mining different in difficulty? Does the desktop app have a different pool of coins (not entered into a ""raffle"" like on the website version) that it mines? Just trying to see why I should use the desktop app if the website version is yielding so much better results.  Thanks!",False

There is a target of one hash per 30 second block so if you have a reasonable hash rate which can be adjusted in settings on both the app and the web platform it should work out the same. The desktop app and web platform (self-miners) all operate in one pool with separate payouts to the website publishers (webmasters). The main advantage of the app is you can just leave it running in the background and get it to autostart when your PC starts up without doing anything. Are you finding earnings are higher on the platform as well? We did have a few issues after the updates yesterday which might have affected it but generally they should be the same.

What does it mean to ""participate"" in the ICO? Does this mean if you want to sell your current stock? Can you only trade this coin if you whitelist yourself? Participating in the ICO means investing funds into the project. Basically we are giving people the opportunity to purchase JSE tokens for JSE. You only need to get whitelisted at this stage if you are considering investing in the ICO. If you are mining and are happy with your holdings then you don't need to do anything.  2. Is the ICO temporary, or when it happens does this mean that the coin is now available on the coin markets? The ICO will be temporary, it will close either once the cap is reached or after a 3 month maximum time limit. After the ICO we will apply to 3rd party cryptocurrency exchanges. Once listed you will be able to trade your tokens for BTC/ETH and then ultimately for fiat if you wish to do so.  3. At release this coin will be .006 cents USD. Is it possible this coin can hit 10 cents within a few months? I can't speculate on price I'm afraid.  4. Could we be at risk to ""pump and dump"" groups? Yes because cryptocurrency is open to everyone we have no real way of combating this and I'd suggest that every altcoin with a low-medium market cap is at risk from pump and dump groups.

I think it's something to do with the app framework. Sorry if I get a bit geeky on you here but we are using software called Electron to basically create an application which runs within a frameless browser window. So the desktop app is still actually running as a Chromium browser. It's likely something in this that is less efficient than running the standalone Chrome browser. Unfortunately this is something out of our control because it's related to the framework rather than our code. There's benefits and drawbacks of the desktop app vs the platform so it's nice to have the option.  @Leodala so I'm not sure I understand the question entirely but I'll talk about some end user advantages. So with regards to speed we run fixed 30 second block cycles. This is different to Bitcoin that has a set difficulty rate and variable block times. By fixing the block times and assessing the hashes on completion we are able to offer transactions speeds which are comparable to existing mainstream technology. On to price, we currently offer fee free transfers, this is a key factor in the projects attractiveness to non-technical users. Everyone can understand the benefit of transferring funds across the globe without losing a percentage. We have retained roughly 45% of the total distribution to pay miners over the next 10 years, once that starts to run out we need to have built a profitable business and controlling organization otherwise we will have to introduce fees to generate mining rewards and keep the system going. This will be one of the long-term challenges for the company and we are currently planning on exploring ad-exchange implementations and enterprise subchain solutions after the ICO.",False

Everyone's holdings will multiply 200x but the hard cap will increase too so the effective holdings haven't changed. Also miner rewards will increase 200x and price at ICO will decrease 200x. ICO price will still be above pre-ICO price relative to the changes.  The reason for this is that lower priced coins tend to do better at ICO and in post-ICO trading because investors give more weight to token price than circulating supply. Also there's benefit to miners earning larger denominations of a currency as competition inevitably increases.  There's some other changes as well like reducing the fixed hard cap on token supply to 50% of what it is now which should benefit anyone currently holding JSE and make the project more attractive to investors.  We are doing this now because we need to finalize the details in the ERC20 contract.  If anyone has any feedback please let us know your thoughts.,False

So this would be around 4pm Pacific time for example. Could this be why the Today's earnings figure reset?  Additionally we have had a few people mention that they left the self-mining run overnight and it has cut out after a certain period. We think this is either due to firebase dropping queries or the way socket.io reconnects after a bad connection. It's something that we need to work on to make it more robust. It's a hard bug to recreate though as it only seems to be happening randomly once every 48-72 hours or something like that.

I'm super optimistic about JSEcoin but am new to pre-ICO coins so I had a few questions...  Is there a plan to use the computational power for DAPPS?  How did you get to the 720 and 1440 daily distribution numbers? In ideal conditions, it seems like around .8% of the market cap will be awarded per year and the total amount of coins will be hit in 32 years if no distribution account payments are made for 'website upkeep'. What happens when the distribution account is empty?  Theoretically, if a large website with 100 million monthly active users signed on, would they win all of the 'lotto tickets' and give small publishers no chance?  How does the lotto work? I seem to be getting .005 increments. Is the lotto ran every two minutes and my chances are what I earned in that last two-minute interval?  Is the publisher lotto ticket algorithm public? ""unique visitors, page views, and hashes found""  Sorry for all these questions! I think this is one of the best use cases and we will see JSEcoin become mainstream post-ICO!",False

We don't currently plan to use the computational power to host dapps or smart contracts.  The distribution is set as a fair amount relating to the current distribution of just under 850,000. We may adjust the payouts in future to match supply and demand.  If a really large website came in with 100m uniques a day then they would be taking 90% of the publisher distribution. I think if that happened we would probably have to look at capping the per site amount as our policy is to try and distribute the tokens as far and wide as possible. This isn't an issue at the moment but we will continue to review the publisher accounts and make decissions accordingly. We need to balance attracting large publishers with ensuring small sites can still earn a worthwhile amount of JSE.  The lotto system on the publisher side has a number of inputs but the key one is unique visitors. If a site has a lot of visitors then they will earn more. So to simplify it every time a unique visitor loads a page a lottery ticket is drawn and given to the publisher who owns the site. At 30 second intervals we draw out the rewards and choose 50 winners at random each getting 0.01 JSE. On the self-mining side each user that finds a hash that block gets a ticket and we draw 50 users who all receive 0.005 JSE. This provides the 1440 and 720 JSE distributions per day.  It's not at the moment but it's not a big secret either and will be released in full when we open-source the platform. Basically it's unique visitors (that stay on the site for more than a set period) and also the hashes they find. But as difficulty is increased the hashes become harder to find and this means that it is more directly correlated to unique visitors to the site. Time on site plays a part as does the relation of desktop to mobile users because desktops have more processing power but the key thing is unique visitors.  Thanks for your support and I hope this explains it as clearly as possible. If you have any other questions don't hesitate to ask.",False

We did get a whitelisting from Bitdefender recently so I'm hopeful eventually Kaspersky will come around to.  Hello,  1) Yes the mining process starts after the 15 second privacy notification has ended. So the user has enough time to opt-out. If you feel we need to increase this time period we could. The system is opt-out because it wouldn’t work as an opt-in model for all the same reasons digital advertising doesn’t work as opt-in. Our mining process isn’t resource intensive and consumes less resources in testing than an auto-loading video advertisement. I feel that we aren’t doing anything worse than the big companies that are running digital ads. From a user experience perspective less resources are consumed and our system is less intrusive than advertising.  2) We could potentially increase the time the privacy notification displays or display it for a set amount of time and then shrink it down to a tiny icon in the bottom of the screen so users can always reach the opt-out link from the icon. This was something we discussed with webmasters in this thread and I think will be pushed out in the next update: https://jsecoin.com/forums/topic/privacy-notification/page/2/#post-4851  Would this help us reach compliance? If so we can bring this forward as a priority and get it rolled out in the next week.  3) The wording of the notification is also discussed earlier in that thread. We can not put too much text in there because it needs to display on all devices including older mobile devices which don’t have much room but if you would prefer we could potentially add a smaller line underneath the main notification for desktop devices with something like “Mathematical mining process will start consuming a small amount of resources starting in x seconds”  The opt-in model we have a system in place where users can register at https://platform.jsecoin.com and do what we call self-mining. As previously discussed I don’t see how it would be possible to run the publisher mining effectively as an opt-in model. I think trying to make the opt-out system work for publishers in a way that is transparent and ethical is better than having no system at at all. However I am biased because our business model is dependant on us getting this right.  Thank you for taking the time to look at our platform. I hope this answers your queries and goes some way to showing our commitment to working with your compliance team.

There's a thread here: https://jsecoin.com/forums/topic/recommended-exchanges/ which outlines investors recommended exchanges. The landscape is changing daily as most listing fees are in BTC or alternative Cryptocurrencies and the extreme price movements are constantly moving the goal posts for listing fees. Something like Cryptopia has a set fee which is affordable to some extent and I feel they are a respected platform. Many 3rd tier exchanges offer free listing if you can get voted on which may or may not be an option we look at. Obviously we would love to list on the best and most prestigious exchanges but Bittrex for example charges 50BTC for listing which is way out of budget. If demand is big enough and the potential trading volume is high enough it will be much easier to negotiate with the larger exchanges.  Closer to the time we will draw up a spreadsheet of the available options and compare the pros and cons for each exchange.,False

The mining numbers are volatile because it's based on the 3rd party webmasters sites that our code is running. One or two really big sites makes a huge difference if they are testing traffic.  The update yesterday allows us to improve the efficiency of the hashing system. Before we were sending out complete block data to the browser which would be used with the SHA256 hashing algo. Because we have the block explorer now there is no benefit to that system so we changed it across to a new method. The data is hashed server-side to create a 64char prehash, this is sent out to clients who add a random number (nonce) and rehash that hash,nonce combo. The resulting hash is then processed and sent back to the server if it is a match to the difficulty.  It actually worked a bit too well and we had to cap the hash rates to 10k on the self-mining for a bit until we either increase the overall difficulty or find a way to balance out mobile/desktop devices.  Also we moved from Ajax transfer protocol to websockets via socket.io, this gives us near real-time communications across the network.",False

One other thing is that if you leave it running in a tab and then open up another tab on top the hash rate drops right off because the browser restricts CPU resources to the hidden tab.

Next week once everything settles down we are going to branch our repo and start work on the next major update. We have the testnet fully setup and functional now so the developers can work on and break things without affecting the main system.

EOS are working on some really exciting stuff which may be better suited but we don't know how widely adopted it will be at this point. There's plenty of other organizations working on this technology which could disrupt the industry by the time we are ready to ICO. We could integrate with ERC20 token now which would work with the majority of offline wallets and exchanges but then that would be locking us in to a technology that isn't ideal for our use case. I'm sorry we can't commit to an exact date for ICO at this stage but I don't feel confident I know enough about the challenges ahead to make an accurate assessment.

I agree there have to be fraud prevention happening but again why then PoW mining at all?  Why not PoS or proof of presence or similar?

Once you've exported the coins from the system you can either import them back in to your own account or another account. There are some differences to private keys however the main one being that when you export a bitcoin private key from an online wallet, the private key should be deleted from the online-wallets servers, you are then fully responsible for that private key. If you lose it the funds are lost forever and there is no way of recovering them. With our platform we keep a record of the coincodes associated with your account server-side. If you go into exports you will see the coincode and have the option to import it again. There is a privacy/security vs convenience/safety(losing keys) play off here. When we build out the exchange integration it is likely that we will be using traditional industry standard technologies (ERC20) which will make it possible to use offline wallets / cold storage etc.  Leeke, Yes the decline in earnings is something that we are conscious of as the project has gained traction. The more users/publishers that adopt the technology though the more chance the project has of being a success and ultimately achieving a good valuation on the exchanges. We've treated the anti-virus companies differently to the browser miner blocking plugins. I think if someone goes out of their way to install a mining blocker then it should be treated as an opt-out and the code shouldn't run so we agree with them blocking our platform. There's a few anti-virus companies that have also blocked us which we feel is unwarranted because our technology and systems aren't unethical in the same way that hidden miners are. We have complained and raised support tickets with these companies with varying degrees of success/response. Unfortunately some web based mining organizations are carrying out shady business practices and it's creating a lot of bad press for us as well. At the moment it's still very new technology and most general website visitors don't understand it. Hopefully in due course visitors will get used to the ""website monetized by cryptocurrency mining"" notifications, realize it's not malware or anything to be concerned about and it will become more widely accepted. Until then we have a PR battle on our hands but I think it's a worthy cause.",False

JohnTwo: 1) We have a section on page10 of the whitepaper on future use cases. I'll post it here too (sorry about the long post)  Our primary ambition and end goal is to create a cryptocurrency that is adopted globally by a mainstream audience. Our best chance of getting to that stage is to produce a platform that is focused on the needs of webmasters and accessible to everyone.  We intend to release merchant tools that will allow webmasters to use JSEcoin for taking digital payments via their websites.  Shopping carts Pay buttons SaaS subscriptions Digital downloads Digital marketing Software sales Website membership subscriptions  Anything purchased through a website should be available to pay with cryptocurrency - JSEcoin could lead the way in making this possible and simple for webmasters.  With webmasters on board, it will be easier to convince the mainstream audiences to the benefits of digital currency over traditional fiat currency. If a consumer can easily purchase and use a cryptocurrency, then many will see the deflationary appeal as a big incentive over inflationary local currency.  Advertising  If demand at ICO is not high enough to generate funds required to target mainstream audiences we could fall back to offering an advertising service where JSEcoin is the currency used to trade digital ad space. This was our original idea for the platform before we realized how much mainstream demand there was for a cryptocurrency platform.  We currently have 4216 websites that have opted-in to display advertising if it were to become available. The code snippet is already in place on sites so nothing further would be required from the webmasters.  The advertising space could be sold to affiliate marketers and digital media buyers creating additional demand for JSEcoin on the exchanges.  Webmasters would be rewarded with additional funds in JSE and statistics would be available to show how much of the rewards were coming from mining vs advertising.  2a) You can try the self-mining that CryptoNinja11 mentioned.

Desktop app is finished we just need to tidy up the code and do a few checks before it's released later this month hopefully. Mobile app is going to take a little longer because we are having difficulties getting much performance out of mobile devices for mining.  @sailthor, you can get your affiliate link from the referrals page on the platform at https://platform.jsecoin.com Payout is on registration (when a user clicks the link in their confirmation email) rather than a percentage of any purchases. These are the current terms as of 14th Nov 2017 but please check payouts/terms on the platform as these will likely change in the future and this post wont be updated.
