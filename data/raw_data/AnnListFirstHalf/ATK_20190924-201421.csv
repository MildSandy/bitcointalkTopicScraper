From the beginning this project has been handled incredibly poorly - what apparent credibility there was early on has evaporated thanks to the constant stream of lies, delays and terrible market support. After the fiasco of the ICO do you really think people are going to want to submit KYC docs to a company that originally requested them via unencrypted email? AML BTC is now trading at $0.3463 with near zero trading volumes. Patience is a finite resource. I started as an ardent supporter like you (even posting daily updates on Twitter and other social media outlets), but have been severely burnt by this team and have turned from an advocate to a detractor (all of which has been set in motion by the AML Bitcoin team's actions). Also, whatever developments might be on the way could be crushed in a heartbeat if the SEC decides to investigate the legality of the AML Bitcoin ICO - which I can say with some authority, was not remotely compliant. AML BTC was sold as an investment (there is no ""functional"" token use), making it a security. How am I supposed to trust a company that has to date demonstrated nothing but incompetence and shady business practices?

I have been following this project since phase 1 and have bought enough tokens to keep my interest. lol I believe crypto is the future of fiat currency. But governments will not let that happen, until there is a solution that lets them regulate it. If we know anything about governments is that they like to run our lives, and are full of buerocrates. That being said. I believe, if this coin works with governments it has unlimited potential, and the potential to uniting the word under one currency. If it does go to $.50 I am with Victor, and will buy my fill and those coins will not see the light of day until ABTC replaces most of crypto currency.",False

Baseless threats of exposure being thrown around in a child like attempt at cloak and dagger. Seriously people these kinds of tactics are beneath anyone presenting themselves as adults.  The real truth of the matter is this. None of you are privy to the types of information needed to make any kind of accusation. This absurd crusade against a company that has done nothing illegal is fruitless. Your persistence in this speaks volumes in regards to your intent. Which i believe to be nefarious. You've created a separate chat group who's very title implies antipathy. Even though you claim it's purpose is one of free speech and differing opinion.  I believe most of your actions stem from a feeling of impatient entitlement for some of you. I also believe that your malcontent has left you vulnerable to agitators. In my opinion there are those within your group praying upon your feelings of distrust manipulating you for there own purpose. I don't claim to know who or why. I'm merely reading the signs.  Before purchasing tokens we all signed a terms and conditions attachment. If this was not clear to you than your diligence has failed you. This project will take as long as it takes no more no less.

Yesterday I received a cease and desist Order from NAC solicitors Ordering me to stop posting, Delete all posts I have made about NAC and AML Bitcoin, Hand over all research my group has accumulated and stored in our Private Chat Group! I have until Monday to comply with the Order or NAC has threatened to Sue me! My other group members who have been offered a refund which is subject to an NDA and requires them to delete all posts related to NAC, AML Bitcoin and turn over all documents including those stored in our personal private Chat group! Again our members are strong and will not be bullied into surrender as they believe very strongly what they are doing is in the best interest of the crypto community! The exchange listing today was a bit of a surprise but not un expected,it‚Äôs always been our view NAC would list AML Bitcoin and dump the millions of Coins there holding, They have not provided there wallet addresses so we cannot see what volume on exchange is from them, they have publicly stated there coins are for future mergers so I can see no reason not to make these addresses known. We new HitBtc was not listing AML Bitcoin what we don‚Äôt know is the reason why but we can surmise. 1) NAC won‚Äôt come up with the fee to list on a high volume exchange 2) HitBTC has refused to list AML Bitcoin which would indicate a serious problem since in early days NAC released a statement saying they were happy to announce HitBtc would be first Exchange listing AML Bitcoin which was not refuted by  HitBtc. I know some where expecting a top Exchange as promised by NAC and with the reported 60 million tokens distributed 2 million for Aten Coin  swap they have 58 million tokens sold for between $1-$1.50. One would think a listing on a major exchange would be a must for a project with such lofty goals,Idax Exchange should provide a way out for some only if NAC don‚Äôt fill the order books with there supply of tokens which would keep ABTC price low, Idax is a small new exchange with low volume and will be interesting to see how this plays out. One would think with NAC position on AML/KYC been there main selling point an exchange compliant with AML/KYC would have be used but that‚Äôs not the case here instead using an exchange based out of Mongolia. IDAX is a cryptocurrency exchange based in Mongolia that seems to target mainly Chinese investors. It has pretty solid digital asset portfolio, but does not work with fiat. Furthermore, IDAX` trading platform is relatively nice and the transaction fees are not high, however we don‚Äôt know whether and how it charges deposits and withdrawals.   According to the information on its website, IDAX platform was developed by the Global Blockchain Research Center (GBC). Its transaction center is located in the GBC High-Tech Industrial Park in downtown Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.   While there are no specific regulations in Mongolia regarding digital assets and crypto-exchanges, the activities related to them are not banned like in China. So, IDAX operates in the grey area, which is the case with more cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide. This, of course, involves certain risks. If you`d rather trade in Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies with a regulated entity, we remind you that forex brokers are also an option. Moreover, some of them are duly licensed.  The above is a review Of Idax Exchange, As always my post is my opinion and not intended to start a slagging match with anyone but to provide information and credible evidence, People are free to make there own minds up and post credible information to the contrary, Using person attacks and name calling Just shows a lack of intelligence and Integrity.",False

Just a reminder, there are several coins I know of with substantial AML/KYC compliance, and I'm sure many I've never heard of. There are multiple exchanges that already support government compliance regulation. Where is AML in all of this? Not trading, that's for sure. Whether it's even actually under development is a huge question, since 1) pretty much nobody outside this board is talking about it, 2) the founder is hiding from investors, 3) every time someone asks a question they get jumped by sock puppets, 4) when people want out they get the runaround, 5) when people get too shrill about feeling like they're being scammed, they get lawyers threats",False

And I apologize if I have ever jumped on anyone for having concerns. However, the same thing is happening now, just the other way around. My friends have been a part of projects that have taken MUCH MUCH longer than AML has and it wasn't a scam in the least. I feel like the word scam is just thrown about as if it was nothing when some of them truly don't even know what defines a scam. I truly believe in what AML has the potential of doing and while no one can tell the future, I have believed in this technology from the beginning. This was my gateway into cryptos if you will. I won't back down in supporting them no matter what. I will keep defending them because in reality, all of our money is on the line here and we cannot bash it to the point where the coins will be worthless by the time it hits the exchange.

AM2018 has called him a NAC SHILL from day one and I backup that statement,have a look at his posts starting from January when account was opened,I have not checked internet YET for other posts but I will.   Awesome, I just bought my tokens!!  Awesome, I just bought my tokens!! This digital currency is the best, it is the world's only patent-pending digital currency with anti-money laundering, know-your-customer, anti-terrorism and theft-resistant properties. I'm so happy I was able to create my profile and wallet successfully, it's easy and secure! I totally recommend for you to get this.  It will be a rollercoaster experience, but the satisfaction of buying the best crypto for security; will increase the benefits in the future of the trading all around the world. Let's make it happen!.  Being part of this amazing project of AML Bitcoin, that is why It got my interest to begin with. To have a secure digital currency is the best.  AML Bitcoin has no competition since it is the only crypto, which is being taken by everyone as the safest, most trusted, we just have a little patience.  Canada is also regulating the cryptos. Add that to the list of countries that have a need for this type of crypto  As an AML Token holder, I'm thinking in the long term. We just need to be patient once AML is ready, there will be no boundaries for us.  The British are becoming well versed in crypto regulation http://fortune.com/2017/12/04/eu-bitcoin-anti-money-laundering-uk/ . It is only a matter of time before this project is going to get bigger  That is correct Brad, AML gives that peace of mind. We don‚Äôt have to worry about any issues concerning security like with other cryptos i‚Äôve bought.  AML Bitcoin is a strong project, has the most reliable technology, the only with biometric identification.   The SEC & IRS are no longer passive for cryptos: https://cryptoinsider.21mil.com/us-cryptocurrency-regulation-irs-sec-no-longer-passive/. Thank you AML for giving us this opportunity.  Governments all over the world are making crypto regulations a priority. This article reiterates just how much I believe in AML and it's placed in the crypto industry. https://hackernoon.com/cryptocurrency-s-regulatory-future-e99b5b80d09  AML has the pending patent on biometric security, Japan has tightened the regulations regarding the largest heist ever: https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2018/01/30/editorials/tightening-cryptocurrency-regulations/#.Wtp_KtPwai4  Swiss model to regulate crypto, read this article: http://thehill.com/opinion/finance/383202-america-should-build-on-the-swiss-model-to-regulate-cryptocurrency. AML is now!!  Thailand is also on the crypto regulations, see this article: http://isbpanthernation.com/7562/news/crypto-regulation-in-thailand/ . AML is well on its way to world wide need of this type of blockchain. Only a matter of time!  AML is a long-term project, which requires lots of trust and patience. They have the only patent pending biometric verification  Definitely. AML is the future, of course, I'm also anxious to be able to exchange but one day soon it will happen!  Absolutely, Nancy, we need to stick together, soon we are going to be exchanging the best coin of all time. I have read the whitepaper and I'm confident of this amazing project.  Great John article regarding the Korean regulations, That is why AML is a step ahead of all the other cryptos.  So you think this is a fake account, you are completely wrong, you think just by insulting, you will intimidate me you are WRONG. So do you think that by creating false statements from every account that supports AML Bitcoin is a bot, you need to go to a doctor.  Get a life, you are the same useless guy that has been creating different accounts to tell that this project has no future. If you don't have any interesting to right please go away from here. Many times they have told you to write to the lawyer for your refund, but it seems that you are just another false token holder.  Brad you hit the nail on the head, we are looking at the best cryptocurrency that will be on the market! I don‚Äôt care what the haters say about this project. I know and believe in AML and I have faith that they will take us to new heights!  Interesting article Frank, AML is the only cryptocurrency that embraces all of the inevitable worldwide government regulations. I'm so excited about being part of this project.

IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY.......but you all decided your fate by your own negative discord.  You were given ample opportunities by Melissa to stay in main chat, but you all chose not too.  It's nobody's fault but your own!     What's next.......  Are you going to say MARCUS ANDRADE ISN'T REAL?  I'M A BOT?  DAVID'S NOT A REAL ATTORNEY?  AML/ABTC IS A SCAM?  WERE ALL FAKE ACCOUNTS?  AM2018 IS A POSITIVE PERSON???  STEVEN'S NOT A LIAR???  I DON'T WANT TO BUY YOUR TOKENS???  We've all learned one thing and that's:  NOTHING WILL EVER BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR GUYS!!!  When ABTC's price goes to $5.00, $10.00, $15.00, $20.00, $25.00 dollars, or more a coin what's your next excuse/lie gonna be.  You guys are going to run out of things to say!!  Where's LIAR STEVEN???  Have not heard from him at all!!  But hey, AM2018 says, he's a positive person.  Steven was positive for a while on main chat. He was positive and contributed a lot!  He did and we got along just fine.  Then all the sudden he just went negative......  That's fine but then he really turned negative and then BLATENTLY LIED to me regarding buying his tokens in private chat.  I had a deal with Steven to buy lots of tokens and he LIED and declined and made an excuse as to why he did it!!üò≥üò≥üôÑüôÑ I'll post our entire chat, as I have absolutely nothing to hide.  I guarantee Steven does not want that and will not agree or even answer me!!  AM2018-The worst offender of them ALL did answer me with complete and utter HOG WASH........as usual.  We all know what he's about!!  ZERO CREDIBILITY THERE TOO!!  I offered to buy some of ENCON's tokens through proper channels, a licensed legal attorney, but that's not good enough.  What can you say........for these guys üòÇüòÇüòÇ.  At least Encon's honest about wanting out. We completely disagree on where we think AML BTC is going!  He wants out and I want in!   He's trying to sell out at least unlike others!  AM2018 doesn't want out he just wants to hang out because he doesn't have anything better to do with himself.    It's to bad what's happened, but we'll get through it like everything else in life.  I don't work for NAC, want to purchase someone's tokens through a legit intermediary like David or other, as David mentioned, see his previous posts.  I had a deal w/ Steven and he needs to follow through.  Business is business.  Steven can speak for himself, as I hope he doesn't need others to speak for him!  I have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO HIDE and am WAITING PATIENTLY for your response Steven, or another seller who will go through appropriate legal  means.   When AML/ABTC is way up what's your next excuse gonna be??  I've learned one thing, with these guys it's never gonna be good enough!!  There will always be something else or angle they'll use to try and exploit some other kind of BULL$&?@!  If you haven't already noticed this is all their good at.  NAYSAYERS add absolutely no value whatsoever to the project except for complete and utter nonesense!  WHAT A SHAME!!! üí©üí©üí©  AML BTC/ABTC is here to stay guys, so get used to it!!

HEY INVESTOR'S WHO DIDN'T READ THIS NEWS>  AML BitCoin Announces Listing on HitBTC Exchange by Bitcoin PR Buzz Feed | Nov 24, 2017 | Bitcoin Press Release, Ultimate | http://bitcoinprbuzz.com/aml-bitcoin-announces-listing-on-hitbtc-exchange/   Bitcoin Press Release: AML BitCoin is pleased to announce it will start trading on HitBTC in December  Las Vegas, USA, 23 November: AML BitCoin will commence its public trading on December 15, 2017 on one of the largest digital currency exchanges in the world, HitBTC.  For months the digital coin world has anticipated the arrival of AML BitCoin, the world‚Äôs only patent-pending cryptocurrency with anti-money laundering and ‚Äòknow-your-customer‚Äô (AML/KYC) technology built into its architecture.  Today, Marcus Andrade, the CEO of NAC Foundation, creator of the AML BitCoin, announces that HitBTC will be the first digital currency exchange to list the innovative coin.  ‚ÄúWe appreciate the innovation of AML Bitcoin safety-built features, and we hope that Biometric identification compliance will make cryptocurrency transactions more transparent and secure,‚Äù said Paul Clarkson, Chief Product Officer at HitBTC.  HitBTC is the global innovative trading platform with multi-currency support, high liquidity and low fees, operating since 2013. Provided with rapid powerful API and outstanding matching core engine, HitBTC traders are able to significantly enhance their trading experience. Daily turnover exceeds $400 000 000.  ‚ÄúThe reception for our digital currency has been far beyond our expectation and planning,‚Äù revealed Andrade. ‚ÄúWe were hoping to list first with HitBTC, and are thrilled that this has come together.   We have also been trying to work with the dozen or more other exchanges rushing to fulfill their compliance requirements to list our coin.  Of course, since our coin is designed to be the world‚Äôs only patent-pending digital currency that is compliant with AML and KYC requirements, the process for us is probably smoother than for other coin projects.‚Äù  For the past several months, governments and industry throughout the world, including in Panama, Estonia, the United Kingdom and the United States, have been meeting with representatives with AML BitCoin to integrate their AML/KYC platform into those nation‚Äôs payment systems and plans.  Analysts of the booming digital currency world have predicted a possible surge in value for AML BitCoin, once it is active on the exchanges and is implementing the partnerships it is now negotiating throughout the world.  David Mata, managing director of Silicon Valley hedge and venture capital fund Block Bits Capital typifies the excitement building in the investment community: ‚ÄúWe have a diverse portfolio that includes digital currencies, but this is the one we are watching.

For months the digital coin world has anticipated the arrival of AML BitCoin, the world‚Äôs only patent-pending cryptocurrency with anti-money laundering and ‚Äòknow-your-customer‚Äô (AML/KYC) technology built into its architecture.  Today, Marcus Andrade, the CEO of NAC Foundation, creator of the AML BitCoin, announces that HitBTC will be the first digital currency exchange to list the innovative coin.  ‚ÄúWe appreciate the innovation of AML Bitcoin safety-built features, and we hope that Biometric identification compliance will make cryptocurrency transactions more transparent and secure,‚Äù said Paul Clarkson, Chief Product Officer at HitBTC.  HitBTC is the global innovative trading platform with multi-currency support, high liquidity and low fees, operating since 2013. Provided with rapid powerful API and outstanding matching core engine, HitBTC traders are able to significantly enhance their trading experience. Daily turnover exceeds $400 000 000.  ‚ÄúThe reception for our digital currency has been far beyond our expectation and planning,‚Äù revealed Andrade. ‚ÄúWe were hoping to list first with HitBTC, and are thrilled that this has come together.   We have also been trying to work with the dozen or more other exchanges rushing to fulfill their compliance requirements to list our coin.  Of course, since our coin is designed to be the world‚Äôs only patent-pending digital currency that is compliant with AML and KYC requirements, the process for us is probably smoother than for other coin projects.‚Äù  For the past several months, governments and industry throughout the world, including in Panama, Estonia, the United Kingdom and the United States, have been meeting with representatives with AML BitCoin to integrate their AML/KYC platform into those nation‚Äôs payment systems and plans.  Analysts of the booming digital currency world have predicted a possible surge in value for AML BitCoin, once it is active on the exchanges and is implementing the partnerships it is now negotiating throughout the world.  David Mata, managing director of Silicon Valley hedge and venture capital fund Block Bits Capital typifies the excitement building in the investment community: ‚ÄúWe have a diverse portfolio that includes digital currencies, but this is the one we are watching.

HEY INVESTOR'S WHO DIDN'T READ THIS NEWS>  AML BitCoin Announces Listing on HitBTC Exchange by Bitcoin PR Buzz Feed | Nov 24, 2017 | Bitcoin Press Release, Ultimate | http://bitcoinprbuzz.com/aml-bitcoin-announces-listing-on-hitbtc-exchange/   Bitcoin Press Release: AML BitCoin is pleased to announce it will start trading on HitBTC in December  Las Vegas, USA, 23 November: AML BitCoin will commence its public trading on December 15, 2017 on one of the largest digital currency exchanges in the world, HitBTC.  For months the digital coin world has anticipated the arrival of AML BitCoin, the world‚Äôs only patent-pending cryptocurrency with anti-money laundering and ‚Äòknow-your-customer‚Äô (AML/KYC) technology built into its architecture.  Today, Marcus Andrade, the CEO of NAC Foundation, creator of the AML BitCoin, announces that HitBTC will be the first digital currency exchange to list the innovative coin.  ‚ÄúWe appreciate the innovation of AML Bitcoin safety-built features, and we hope that Biometric identification compliance will make cryptocurrency transactions more transparent and secure,‚Äù said Paul Clarkson, Chief Product Officer at HitBTC.  HitBTC is the global innovative trading platform with multi-currency support, high liquidity and low fees, operating since 2013. Provided with rapid powerful API and outstanding matching core engine, HitBTC traders are able to significantly enhance their trading experience. Daily turnover exceeds $400 000 000.  ‚ÄúThe reception for our digital currency has been far beyond our expectation and planning,‚Äù revealed Andrade. ‚ÄúWe were hoping to list first with HitBTC, and are thrilled that this has come together.   We have also been trying to work with the dozen or more other exchanges rushing to fulfill their compliance requirements to list our coin.  Of course, since our coin is designed to be the world‚Äôs only patent-pending digital currency that is compliant with AML and KYC requirements, the process for us is probably smoother than for other coin projects.‚Äù  For the past several months, governments and industry throughout the world, including in Panama, Estonia, the United Kingdom and the United States, have been meeting with representatives with AML BitCoin to integrate their AML/KYC platform into those nation‚Äôs payment systems and plans.  Analysts of the booming digital currency world have predicted a possible surge in value for AML BitCoin, once it is active on the exchanges and is implementing the partnerships it is now negotiating throughout the world.  David Mata, managing director of Silicon Valley hedge and venture capital fund Block Bits Capital typifies the excitement building in the investment community: ‚ÄúWe have a diverse portfolio that includes digital currencies, but this is the one we are watching. We have taken a huge early position.  It‚Äôs the cryptocurrency equivalent of handing Mark Zuckerberg a check while he sits in his dorm room coding Facebook.‚Äù  About NAC Foundation  NAC Foundation, headquartered in the U.S., is the creator of the AML BitCoin, the world‚Äôs only patent-pending digital currency with anti-money laundering, know-your-customer, anti-terrorism and theft-resistant properties. AML BitCoin is compliant with all major national security and financial protection laws and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act. NAC‚Äôs mission is to strengthen the acceptance and use of digital currencies by advancing throughout the world security compliance, combined with blockchain technology.

We were processing a refund for you some time ago per your request, and then YOU asked us to cancel it; you haven't mentioned this at all here. And then you told us that you wanted us to send your tokens asap. Another thing that you didn't mention is why you couldn't get a refund now--which is because you already have your tokens. It is clearly outlined in our refund policy that Token Holders cannot get a refund after they have received their tokens. https://amltoken.com/terms-of-use/  We are not doing anything wrong. When you registered an account, you agreed to our terms and conditions.  Also, AML BitCoin Token is going to be listed on an exchange. We've told you this. If the list date is not happening when you want it to happen, we apologize for that. AML BitCoin is a medium of exchange. Your purchased tokens; you did not purchase shares in the company. No Token Holders can decide on when the coin is listed. The coin is in the process of being listed, as we've mentioned, and it will be listed asap.  We know that you want to sell your tokens and we have told you that you could sell your tokens to another individual, and do not have to wait for the coin to be listed on an exchange.

As one Token purchaser to another, I'm taking a risk too!  If you are so emotionally distraught over your purchase and think it's an epic fail then here is your chance to recuperate some of your money.  Are you wanting not get any money back whether it's from NAC or me and have the project fail too?  I say that because you are bad mouthing everything AML BTC/NAC stands for and hurting legitimate money here whether you think so, or not!  You are an adult, made an informed decision and purchased AML BTC Tokens without any pressures.  Questions should have been considered and asked way before purchasing.   Before I purchased, I knew there were no guarantees, promises and that there was no particular roadmap per say.  I have been happy with the teams efforts although not perfect.  But neither am I.  Opinions are like ASSHOLES and everyone has one including me!  I hope you can find it in yourself to CALM DOWN.  Forget NAC and everyone for a moment.  Take a deep breathe and think before you react and post.   If you are not selling and staying, for your sake and the sake of other fellow Token Purchasers; let NAC and Team do their job!  You have the potential to make your money back many times over in my opinion.  It's your decision.  I have nothing against you, AM2018 or anyone else and everyone's entitled to their opinions, but there are appropriate ways and channels to go about that!  I want to see everyone flourish not implode, so think about it and do the right responsible things..... I just don't see how you will win either way, by continuing on the path your on!  Have a super weekend everyone!!!  It's an offer and a good one for your consideration.  Let me know  IN MY OPINION:  AML BTC/ABTC IS THE FUTURE AND THAT WILL BECOME VERY APPARENT AS TIME PASSES!

We see that you have not stopped harassing us and our clients and posting endless false accusations, after we've asked you to cease this countless times now. Since you're so unhappy there really isn't any reason for you to be a Token Holder. Please email us so that we can find a resolution for you so that you no longer have to be a Token Holder (If you are an actual Token Holder...).  Also, to address your harassing, threatening, and incredibly false posts that are defamatory in nature (seemingly intentional), let us clear up a few things for you.  #1- You claim that you haven't heard 1 word from the team for 6 months now.....this is certainly not true. We post on our social media channels nearly everyday. We manage Telegram everyday. We posted an update here to clarify items posted on this thread from Token Holders 3 days ago. Not to mention the emails that we send to Token Holders....if you're in fact a Token Holder, you would have seen these.  #2- You're claiming that our team is hiding. Our team is busy working diligently to make this project a success. No one is hiding. No one has any reason to hide. BTW- Did you see this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NztqYHeL_60) of AML BitCoin CEO, Marcus Andrade, at a recent conference? You should check it out.  #3- You're making a lot of completely false theories and accusations and you're attempting to defame our team and product without any leg to stand on, and you need to stop. You need to stop harassing us, threatening us, posting false accusations, and purposely trying to defame us.  #4- It looks like we need mention this to you again- AML BITCOIN IS A MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE. YOU DID NOT BUY SHARES IN THE COMPANY. AML BITCOIN MAKES DECISIONS ON WHEN AND HOW TO DO THINGS- NOT TOKEN HOLDERS.  We still don't know if you are in fact a Token Holder, but if you are, we would love to rectify this for you, so that you no longer have to be one.

A lot of things have happened since this press release was put out. The ICO sale was extended another month and more exchanges are in the works (according to NAC). Plans change all the time! This does not make AML a scam or bad people. It also does not mean that you should harass them with your demands! Just get your refund and move along.

Per your message above, we have been communicating with our Token Holders. Are you a Token Holder? At this point, we are not sure if you really are. We have reached out to you on Twitter to have a conversation and told you that we are here to help you, and asked that you email us, and you have not done so. What you did was give us even more threats. If you are unhappy with your purchase, please reach out to us and we will find a resolution for you.  If you are in fact a Token Holder, you would have received communication from us via email. Every announcement from the company has been communicated with Token Holders via email and is also posted on social media. I'm not sure what you mean by ""spearding stuppid ads,"" per your message above, but we are doing nothing of the sort. Per your message above about holding onto your money for almost a year, it has not been almost a year that the ICO began, and if you are a Token Holder and added your AML Wallet Address to your Token Sale account, then you would have already received your tokens. If you did purchase tokens and haven't received these yet, please add your AML Wallet Address to your Token Sale account and you will get your tokens within one day.  We recently emailed all Token Holders a Post ICO Update. In this email, we announced to Token Holders that 60 million tokens were issued and that the remaining amount would be spent on mergers. We also told Token Holders that the coin will be listed on a digital currency exchange soon. We have kept all Token Holders informed of news as we have news, which we will continue to do.  Things take time. Being listed on exchanges takes time. There are multiple parties involved in getting listed on an exchange and logistics and processes that come with this.  We care about our Token Holders. WHEN we can share the HitBTC date listing, WE WILL. We do not have a specific date to share right now, because as I mentioned above, things do take time, and we do not want to announce a date and have a possibility of the date not being accurate.  IT IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO KNOW THIS:  AML BITCOIN IS A MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE. TOKEN HOLDERS DID NOT PURCHASE SHARES IN THE COMPANY.

We apologize that the coin isn't being listed when you want it to be listed. Our team is working diligently. If we were to provide a list date for HitBTC to you, and that date needs to change, you would be unhappy. Thus, we have told Token Holders that it will be soon, and WE WILL ANNOUNCE the list date when we can share an official list date.

First stage, ico, tokens are sold quickly accompanied by a flood of possibilities and promises. Second stage, distribution, tokens are distributed as quickly as possible in order to receive funds. Third stage, listing, the coin and or token is shoved into any exchange possible. Forth stage, silence, having been listed the developers of the platform seem to cut off all communication and subject the token holders to the volatility of the markets. A road map may be published with future deadlines that can be as far out as a year or more. All this time allows tokens to be subjected to pump and dumps, falsehoods, and media speculation. Keep in mind that most published deadlines are seldom met. This causes not only token holders to lose interest but also any possible partnerships. Thus causing the tokens to lose value and occasionally resulting in a failed project. I for one would not appreciate being thrown to the wolves in a volatile market if the completion of the project is still years away. In my opinion listing should be done as close as possible to the completion of the platform. Any new developments should be withheld until listing in order to maximize interest. It's just the smart way to do things. Patience will prevail.",False

We are not investors we are purchasers. We purchased a product that we believe has or will have value. The belief that this product has or will have value comes from the percieved need for this project in the crypto world. This percieved need is derived from media and government sources that wish to implement regulatory standards. The links above all refer to the direction being taken by governments and financial institutions. This is why we PURCHASED ABTC.

Mark Carney, Bank of England Governor and Chair of the Financial Stability Board, has written to the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors.  It's worth reading page 2 at a minimum http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P180318.pdf  Crypto-assets  Responding to the concerns of members, the FSB has undertaken a review of the financial stability risks posed by the rapid growth of crypto-assets.  The FSB‚Äôs initial assessment is that crypto-assets do not pose risks to global financial stability at this time. This is in part because they are small relative to the financial system. Even at their recent peak, their combined global market value was less than 1% of global GDP. In comparison, just prior to the global financial crisis, the notional value of credit default swaps was 100% of global GDP. Their small size, and the fact that they are not substitutes for currency and with very limited use for real economy and financial transactions, has meant the linkages to the rest of the financial system are limited.  The market continues to evolve rapidly, however, and this initial assessment could change if crypto-assets were to become significantly more widely used or interconnected with the core of the regulated financial system. For example, wider use and greater interconnectedness could, if it occurred without material improvements in conduct, market integrity and cyber resilience, pose financial stability risks through confidence effects. To support monitoring and timely identification of emerging financial stability risks, the FSB will identify metrics and any data gaps.  Crypto-assets raise a host of issues around consumer and investor protection, as well as their use to shield illicit activity and for money laundering and terrorist financing. At the same time, the technologies underlying them have the potential to improve the efficiency and inclusiveness of both the financial system and the economy.  Relevant national authorities have begun to address these issues. Given the global nature of these markets, further international coordination is warranted, supported by international organisations such as CPMI, FATF and IOSCO.  ‚Ä¢ The FSB will identify metrics for enhanced monitoring of the financial stability risks posed by crypto-assets and update the G20 as appropriate.",False

Contrary to some people's beliefs, the team at nac owe you nothing but your tokens (if you choose to invest). But for some reason fools created the idea (in there own heads) that purchasing tokens somehow gave you control over the company. And that just simply is not the case.

Basiclly fuck off AML and give me my 10 tokens!!!  The business license matter is because of a registered agent unrelated to AML Bitcoin.  After I was retained, I realized the problem before you decided to make a huge deal about it on this site.  We were in the process of correcting the issue, which by the way is very common and of no significance whatsoever.

They have to come out with something.  It will be interesting to see if the G20 direct the OECD as they have in the past to come up with an overarching regulatory framework.  Mind you anything they decide will take a long time to be implemented and would have to be passed as domestic regulations based on international standards.  There is plenty of precedence for this.  So before that comes in there will be a complete mismatch of domestic regulations.  Which just means that there will be more opportunities for ABTC.  So many countries are playing regulatory catch up to try and attract business.  Both France and Spain fall into this group.  Clear regulatory leaders are Singapore, Switzerland and UK.

On the other hand the volatility and impulsive nature of crypto investors could help drive acceptance of ABTC. I believe that u.s. involvement in regulatory standards will give other countries an incentive to conform. The u.s. has always been a leader in this space, and many countries have adopted its framework. That being said there are several senators and financial leaders sympathetic to the crypto cause. It seems to be the general consensus not to stifle innovationawhen it comes to this new investment sector.  With that in mind. My hopes lie with the ability of innovative forward thinking participants to successfully convince there counterparts that a fair and broadbased framework is the way forward.

I believe these types of labels will assist the accredited and institutional investor in feeling more secure about the future of crypto.

I finally got my tokens last night. It's been a long ride since OCT 6th 2017. But finally they showed up. I'm also getting the feeling that NAC may be towards the end of the distribution. I tried testing the blockchain by creating a new wallet and transferring 1 ABTC from my main wallet to the test one. And back, it worked fine. This was to make sure that my password still worked or I could loose lots of money.  We have all be asking AML Bitcoin for how many tokens were sold, they're still silent. But for those of you who want a sneak peep window into how much other people have, remember the basics of blockhains, they're public transactions. So review the AML token explorer, its pretty impressive. Here it is:  http://www.atkexplorer.com/movement  AMLBITCOIN got very large participants with larger dollar amounts than I expected. Many amounts in $215k and over.

Thought I would come in and see what other people had to say. Looks like some good soldiers being overshadowed by a couple of want it now crybaby types ( the norm in most chat rooms). But anyway the telegram is better maybe because the people on that forum are showing a little more respect. Seems to me that if you want answers you should wait until there given (like everybody else). Or you could stomp your feet and cry and get treated like a disrespectful little child that needs a time out. Complaining about communication isn't going to make anybody communicate. If your that unhappy wait for the listing sell your position and be done with it. Simple as that. I for one believe this a great opportunity and am happy to be a part of it. Everything I read lately is all about regulation a compliant coin is naturally what comes next. I guess my advise to the haters would be please hate quietly and let the adults do there work. The faster they finish the faster you can leave and the faster we will all be done with you.

I still believe there's great potential for AML cryptos, but this team is by far the worse I've come across - and no, before you ask, this isn't my first ICO. There's something very fishy about the extensions of the ICO (e.g. buying more time to mine), the marketing around it (or lack there-of), and the roadmap itself (AMLBTC won't actually be AML for at least 6 months). For one...If your token/coin is supposed to be AML/KYC compliant, why hasn't there been a KYC verification process other than a ludicrous request to send copies of IDs via email? It doesn't add up. If you look at it objectively, it screams out scam. I would not be surprised to see them being investigated by the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) in the near future - they broke just about every rule of the Howey test during their ICO.  Also, the lead admin Telegram admin, Melissa is part of their marketing team, not just a kid they've hired to moderate.",False

This isn't about FUDding or market manipulation. At this point for me, it's not about the money either; I could easily burn my coins, walk away and feel fine.  I originally bought into the token sale 143 days ago, 5+ months. In that time, I've participated and taken profits from 3 other ICOs. The dates have been a moving target, changing at whim and without any proper explanation.  The final straw for me, was when they asked users to send their KYC via email. The reason they retracted that request, is because I threatened legal action (read the earlier posts in this thread if you'd like to see how it played out). Ask anyone that has the slightest understanding about InfoSec and they will tell you that email is one of the least secure mediums there is. KYC docs from poorly managed or fraudulent ICOs are flooding the dark web. I don't want to be one of the victims...And being somebody that has to keep his own clients safe from hackers, the email KYC request set-off the strongest possible alarm bells I could get.   How can I have confidence/trust in an organization that's supposed to be all about security, when they make such rookie mistakes? Would you send your KYC via email? Do you understand how ridiculously dangerous that is?  Trust has to be earned, and NAC has destroyed that trust, hence the posts I'm making on this thread.

Firstly i dont care about the money i invested but what i do care about is time thats why i want a refund,, time is more valuable than money.  Now the tokensale has been going on for more than what aml anticipated it was promised to end by 15/12 and it didnt happen, now what frustrates me is that initial coins were eth up until the 15th of dec ethereum was about $300 and then 5 folded, which means the $13.5 million target for phase 1 would have went up by a considerable amount and if i remember correctly eth was the only form of currency accepted at start of ico, why was it necessary to add another month and who knows if theres more to come when that 13.5m value would have gone upto say about $40M, how does nac work? clearly by prolonging the time aml would have atleast 3 folded in phase1 value. what is your sale based on?? those initial coins offered are  valued way more than a dollar now   And on top of that only come up with 1 exchange which is slowly dying out due to its poor customer service, after gaining so much value your team should have done better rather than hiding out and milking time and sending children to do weak posts that made me feel like ""I ve had it with this shit"", on top of that y werent the initial buyers who bought before  the initial set phase 1 date werent awarded that %33 discount that was offered some stage, after phase 2 could have atleast burnt the remaining coins but instead burnt us with time,,    seems like Nac is the biggest fraud here, imagine the poor atentoken holders?  seems like all your guts are too full to come up with new ideas,, very poor marketing and who ever put you here should have  got paid more to someone that could come here and spin bs atleast.. you have been useless  and you dont even answer proper questions , this thread and you should be banned coz your team made this ico an obvious scam,,  Can i get my money or  eth back?",False

I live in Australia and so it's been hard to get much information about NAC Foundation other than what's on the internet. From what I can see it's a legitimate organization and the ICO is all above board. My concern was that my bank actually rejected and reversed one of my international transfers to NAC to purchase more tokens. They cited ""potential fraudulent activity"" and add to this the warnings around about lots of fraudulent ICO's suddenly popping up everywhere. What I would like to know is has anyone carried out a thorough check to ensure this is all above board. I have done what I can on the internet and like I said it looks legit but other peoples opinions would be appreciated.  My dealings so far with NAC have been great, any issues or questions have been followed up promptly and closed out to my satisfaction. So far they have been very professional but my Bank has spooked me a bit because I will have no recourse to get my money back if this does turn out to be fraudulent.",False

Led by the CEO of NAC Foundation Marcus Andrade, the meetings were held at the time of the EU Digital Summit in Tallinn, Estonia. Andrade briefed numerous Estonian legislative leaders, including a key parliamentarian digital commerce leader Kalle Palling, on strong international governmental interest in partnering with AML BitCoin who see the project as a solution to stability and security problems threatening the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Andrade also presented the project to the Estonian e-Residency team, which is exploring a launch of its own digital currency, the ESTcoin.  ‚ÄúBecause of its AML/KYC (anti-money laundering/know your customer) features, AML BitCoin is the digital currency that is most able to engage in mainstream commerce, taking its place among traditional payment options,‚Äù said Andrade. Marek Pajussar from the Estonian Financial Supervision Authority expressed strong interest in AML BitCoin‚Äôs technological advances with its AML and KYC protocols and procedures.  In Slovenia, Andrade briefed the Slovenian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public Administration Boris Koprivnikar. As the Minister of Public Administration, Mr Koprivnikar‚Äôs mission is to ensure efficient and forward-looking support for Slovenian citizen, industry and government initiatives. He showed particular interest in understanding how the identification segment of the AML BitCoin platform could be used on a wider scale.  Mr. Andrade also met with key representatives of the Slovenian National Assembly. Deputy Matej Tonin, one of the representatives pushing for cyber security regulation, queried Andrade on how other governments are approaching regulating blockchain and digital currencies.  Andrade hopes that Slovenia and Estonia ‚Äì the European Union‚Äôs technology leaders ‚Äì will soon join other governments around the world partnering with AML BitCoin to promote the use of digital currency with their stable and secure AML BitCoin platform.  ‚ÄúAML BitCoin‚Äôs white label platform is unique. It relies on complex verification methods, such as patent-pending biometric digital identification, that other digital currencies and financial technology platforms do not have and have not yet developed. This makes the AML BitCoin platform ideal for use by governments wanting to make their services digital, but also wanting to protect user identity. A number of nations have recently moved against anonymous digital currency, such as Bitcoin, for fear that their anonymity promotes entry by criminal and terrorist elements into otherwise protected financial systems. In the United States, Members of Congress are considering legislation barring the use by U.S. merchants of anonymous, non-AML compliant cryptocurrencies,‚Äù said Andrade.  AML BitCoin is the world‚Äôs only digital currency with a patent-pending biometric digital identity system tied to the blockchain, enabling strict adherence to all bank security provisions including AML (anti-money laundering) and KYC (know your customer) protections.  _____________________________________________________________________  VERY CURIOUS WHAT HAPPENS IN ESTONIA.

AML Bitcoin is an AML certified cryptocurrency, so very different in nature. I'm a little apprehensive of KYC.legal's business model. It requires a person coming to meet you (in person), which could a) lead to fraud/theft/potential attacks (as people let strangers into their offices/homes), and b) requires a global network of verifiers.

On this example transaction there would be no AML data attached on that specific transaction and coins that were sent directly from the Bittrex online wallet to the vendor's wallet.  So, how is that problem solved, they can't possibly think that Bittrex would be performing AML for users who wants to trade AML Bitcoins, Bittrex would just decide not to add this coin than to undergo such a problematic and tedious major design/code change to house the AML Bitcoins on their exchange.  Same for Poloniex, Kraken, etc.   So, the path of least resistance would be for all the exchanges simply to not list AML Bitcoin.  So, okay all exchanges do not list AML Bitcoins in orders to preserve the purity of the AML requirements within AML Bitcoins, so how exactly would the price appreciate if user's would be able to trade this coin.  Maybe an AML compliant exchange is created, possibly called AML Exchange where this coin is finally listed there to be traded with a handful of currency pairs (AML/BTC, AML/ETH, AML/LTC, etc).   Now imagine this:  AML Bitcoins listed on one exchange with AML requirements set, users have to undergo a series of AML procedures before becoming a member there, that in itself would have fewer members, perhaps not everyone from all countries would be eligible to become a member of said exchange which means that trading volume would be low.  Current ICO price is: $1.00  in light of the projections I have said I really dont see price appreciating by some high factor, in fact the price could go below ICO levels and possibly stay there for a very long time.",False

That said, legally compliant exchanges already impose varying degrees of AML/KYC compliance (especially ones dealing with US customers), limiting the weekly withdrawals based on the level of identification. A number of governments are getting stricter, and will/or do require cross referencing, and tax reporting - which will play well into AML Bitcoin's pre-vetted ecosystem. Also, as the restrictions tighten, VCEs (Virtual Currency Exchanges) that are not compliant/listing non-AML cryptos could be denied banking.",False

At this rate it will be at least April/May, if not June/July before it's done. Given the rising price of Ethereum and BTC, the early adopters are losing money, compared to those buying in now. Instead of 300 AML to 1 ETH, we could be getting 450+.

I would like to make clear that this is an isolated incident, and there are no other contributors effected. Please bare with us as we investigate the matter further and come up with a solution that you will be happy with.  The AML BitCoin Team does not handle any payments during the crowd sale. All payments go directly into our secure, cold storage wallets. We have handled many, many MILLIONS of dollars for other ICO's and have never had a penny unaccounted for. Calling AML Bitcoin a fraud or scam is completely false and bares zero evidence.  It is unfortunate, but TokenLot do not own the address you sent the ETH payment too. When making a purchase via our platform, the ETH address that is issued is not automatically generated when you click ""Pay Now"". All payment addresses that are displayed are pulled from a database of pre-generated addresses. TokenLot has not been compromised or hacked.  We ask that you please give us some more time to investigate our server records to find out where the error could have been made.  Thank you,  The TokenLot Team.",False

For those of you that are curious about what happened, it appears the the TokenLot web site has a security breech wherein the auto-generated ETH address in their payment system was replaced by an address which they do not retain control of. It also appears that several users buying into the AML Bitcoin project were affected and I would think it likely that many other ICOs were affected in a similar manner.  I would like to make it clear that this is NOT the fault of the AML Bitcoin team.  I would like to express my apologies for the inflammatory nature of my posts. I understand that the ICO purchasing system was being run by a third party(and I understood that the whole time) but my suspicions that there was a security breech meant that I need to be as abrasive as possible in order to create a sense of urgency and cause the AML Bitcoin team to take this issue seriously. My desire was primarily to prevent other people from being affected by this and I hope that I was successful in that.  Regarding the AML Bitcoin team and the project; I have been eagerly following AML Bitcoin for months and, despite the problems I've encountered, I am still very much interested in being part of the project.

I provided the email and receiving address that I used and the etherscan.io transaction record which shows the send and receive address for the transaction.  Additionally, there seems to be no way for me to recover the web page which provided the ETH address during the transaction due to the way it was generated so it is impossible for me to verify at this point without going back in time and grabbing a screenshot.  Edit: It appears the the funds I sent have since been moved into an account that has nearly 20,000 ETH, so the address that I was provided was legitimate and the funds I sent have either been sent to an exchange or an account with a huge balance.

Otherwise, it will be an extremely lengthy post.  1. 2.3 Identity Verification: The Digital Identity Trust Network (DTN) DTN appears to be a separate entity to the NAC foundation and processes the verification of users (through government issued documents and biometric means) needed to get access to the AML blockchain. Could you please elaborate about this; how can I trust DTN? Is there any regulatory oversight on this company? Is it being audited? Do they store all the ID data on their own servers and on the NAC servers (and how do they communicate)? And how are the costs of verifying AML users being covered? Brief Answer: The DTN involves a third-part company, who has experience and expertise to verify the submitted identity proof document. The third-party company‚Äôs method should have been audited. Most data are stored on the NAC servers (not front-end servers). All personal information is encrypted before storage in our servers. Some data will be stored using the IPFS protocol. For communication between Internet interfaces for ID data submission and the 3rd-party ID verification platform, network traffic encryption will be involved. We will follow the ISO/IEC 29100:2011 standards (Information technology - Security techniques - Privacy framework), and the system will be subjected to third-party accreditation. Some of the costs of verifying AML users are from the ICO. Some of the costs are covered by the profits from our business. Please refer to the white paper for the basic ideas about our business plan.  2.3.2 Explains how users can identify; 'they select their Country of residence, and State or Province'. How do I know my country is on that list? If not I cannot convert AML Token to AML Bitcoin. Brief Answer: (1) If you are a resident/citizen in a country in the OFAC sanctioned country list, you cannot convert AML Tokens to AML BitCoins. (2) If you are staying in a country in the OFAC sanctioned country list, you cannot convert AML Tokens to AML BitCoins. Please refer to our Terms and Conditions for more details. https://amltoken.com/aml-sale-terms-and-conditions/  2. 3.6.4  Locking the AML BitCoin Accounts of Suspected Criminals Reading this part, it seems to enter quite a grey area, with has 2 downsides; I. there seems to be a lot of non-automated work associated with it, do you plan on having a whole team on this? And how do you plan on covering the ongoing costs associated with it? Brief Answer: This is a very good question. We have thought of a solution on covering the ongoing costs associated with it. Unfortunately, owing to the trade secret, I could not disclose detailed information to you here. I hope you could understand. However, you can think in way that NAC Foundation will develop its business to generate profits, and the ongoing costs will be covered by the profits of our business. You could refer to our whitepaper for the basic ideas of our business plan.    II. If NAC may deem something suspicious, can they lock my funds? Or is it only 'Upon a legitimate request from a governmental body'? P.S. I'm not talking about 3.5 (because I understand being on some terrorist list, NAC will lock the account but that is no grey area). Brief Answer: For suspicious transactions, we are not planning to lock those funds. However, we are planning to report those suspicious activities to the related government agencies, e.g. FinCEN in United States. We will only lock those funds upon a legitimate request from a governmental body.      3. 6.2 Limitations of Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies In this part you cover 3 subjects of limitations (on which I agree), but on only one (6.2.3. Pseudonymous/Anonymous Property of Cryptocurrency and Illegal Activities) seems AML bitcoin to serve a solution, do I read that right? Brief Answer: I hope that I understand your question correctly. If not, please correct me. AML BitCoin is designed to serve as a solution for the illegal activities related to the pseudonymous/anonymous property of cryptocurrency.  4. Although not in the whitepaper, but it was stated (in the FAQ I believe) that all the centralized (ID) information is not stored on front-end servers of NAC, which is nice, but is of course not a guarantee for anything. How do I know this information is really stored securely, not only in a technical sense, but also in procedural form (which employees have access under what conditions, etc.); are you audited by an external company? Brief Answer: Correct. Centralized (ID) information will not be stored on front-end servers of NAC. We will follow the ISO/IEC 29100:2011 standards (Information technology - Security techniques - Privacy framework), and the system will be subjected to third-party accreditation.    5. Having 50 million of AML bitcoin to burn trough will ensure NAC not going broke soon, but how are you planning long term to fund yourself? Brief answer: We are well aware of the need of long term fund to keep the AML BitCoin running. Please refer to whitepaper for the basic ideas of our business plan. AML BitCoin‚Äôs operation will be supported by the profits generated from our business.    6. Because every AML Bitcoin is stored in multi sign addresses (me and NAC having the keys), it is absolutley vital NAC will keep functioning, what provisions are made to that end? Things like disagreements/infighting (everybody leaving NAC) or the whole NAC team is involved in a plane crash or something.. Brief answer:  The key answer for your question is the ‚Äúprovision‚Äù, that NAC is going to make at the end. We have a plan to build one or more valuable assets as the provision to ensure there will be sufficient fund that supports the continuous operation of the AML BitCoin system. As such information is trade-secret, I could not disclose in details here. Moreover, here we have to emphasize that the market price of the AML BitCoin must not be linked to those provisions, and AML BitCoin holders should not expect that the acquisition of AML BitCoin will result in profit because of those provisions. The price of AML BitCoin should be mainly dictated by the market force. This is to ensure that AML BitCoin is not considered as a security.  ",False

Due to high volume, our email server got bogged down and did not generate the emails for you. Rest assured, your contribution is accounted for. We will be resending the confirmation emails which include the amount of ETH you contributed as well as the amount of tokens you purchased. Please allow 12-24 hours to receive this email.

Please accept our apology for any confusion and hesitation caused.  Q1: I bought XXX ATK . When will they be delivered? Answer: We (AML BitCoin team) are arranging the delivery shortly. Definitely, you don't need to wait until the end of the ICO.

Firstly, you need to download the AML Token Wallet (based off Bitcoin Core v.15) on Windows, Linux or Mac from https://www.amltoken.com/.  This will need to be installed, opened, and the blockchain downloaded (which only takes a minute or so, even on slow connections). Note, some anti-virus software flags Bitcoin Core as a miner malware, so you may need to whitelist, or grant an exemption for this.  Once installed go to File | Receiving addresses, and generate a AML Token Wallet address. Once you have this information, you can read through the terms and conditions below to understand what the Token is, and if you are happy, accept the terms and conditions to be sent to our distribution partner.  On their site, you click buy tokens, put in the amount of tokens you would like (currently priced 300ATK/ETH), enter in your name, email address and the AML Token Wallet address you generated earlier. You will then be brought to a screen with an Ethereum Wallet screen. If you use this, send the ETH to the address. If you would like to use Bitcoin, or a wide multitude of altcoins supported by Shapeshift, you can choose Pay with Altcoins. On this screen, it will carry over the Ethereum value you chose based on your token purchase. Select the crypto you want to use, allow the bottom of the screen to load, and then proceed to check out by sending the relevant transaction. The progress of the transaction will happen on screen. Please note: Due to the demand for AML Bitcoin and a backlog our team is going through, it can take up to 12 hours to receive the confirmation email.  All funds are held in Escrow, and tokens will be distributed a little after the end of the Token Sale to participants. We are discussing the possibility for early delivery (i.e., without waiting after the end of the Token Sale. I will keep everybody updated here. One issue is that this token sales involve Escrow.. We need to see how this can be properly handled in the case of early delivery.  This is to ensure that we won't be SCAMMERS.  If you have any questions, please contact info@amlbitcoin.com, via @AMLBitcoin on Twitter, facebook.com/AMLBitcoin  or talk directly to a member of the team on Telegram or Bitcointalk.

We are integrating our AML/KYC features developed for Aten Coin, which is based a rather old version of Bitcoin. As ""Bitcoin Core"" (not bitcoin cash) source code has been improved & changed a lot, we are trying hard to integrate these features into the newest version of Bitcoin core. It won't take too long, but we need to do sufficient amount of testing. We are also introducing some new features to AML BitCoin, such as biometric stuff, optional lock time protection, protection against sanctioned countries. It will take us some time.",False

Could you please elaborate about this; how can I trust DTN? Is there any regulatory oversight on this company? Is it being audited? Do they store all the ID data on their own servers and on the NAC servers (and how do they communicate)? And how are the costs of verifying AML users being covered?  2.3.2 Explains how users can identify; 'they select their Country of residence, and State or Province'. How do I know my country is on that list? If not I cannot convert AML Token to AML Bitcoin.   2. 3.6.4  Locking the AML BitCoin Accounts of Suspected Criminals  Reading this part, it seems to enter quite a grey area, with has 2 downsides; I. there seems to be a lot of non-automated work associated with it, do you plan on having a whole team on this? And how do you plan on covering the ongoing costs associated with it? II. If NAC may deem something suspicious, can they lock my funds? Or is it only 'Upon a legitimate request from a governmental body'? P.S. I'm not talking about 3.5 (because I understand being on some terrorist list, NAC will lock the account but that is no grey area).  3. 6.2 Limitations of Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies  In this part you cover 3 subjects of limitations (on which I agree), but on only one (6.2.3. Pseudonymous/Anonymous Property of Cryptocurrency and Illegal Activities) seems AML bitcoin to serve a solution, do I read that right?  4. Although not in the whitepaper, but it was stated (in the FAQ I believe) that all the centralized (ID) information is not stored on front-end servers of NAC, which is nice, but is of course not a guarantee for anything. How do I know this information is really stored securely, not only in a technical sense, but also in procedural form (which employees have access under what conditions, etc.); are you audited by an external company?  5. Having 50 million of AML bitcoin to burn trough will ensure NAC not going broke soon, but how are you planning long term to fund yourself?  6. Because every AML Bitcoin is stored in multi sign addresses (me and NAC having the keys), it is absolutley vital NAC will keep functioning, what provisions are made to that end? Things like disagreements/infighting (everybody leaving NAC) or the whole NAC team is involved in a plane crash or something..",False

Thanks it's appreciated. Others are welcome to post it in their local thread as well. You can even create your own design and content for how you think it should look. Content sources can be old thread as well but with  namechange to AMLBitcoin. Other content or info is on AMLBitcoin.com and social media mainly on Twitter: @AMLBitcoin  Once AMLbitcoins can be given away I will create bounties. If your thread or design is best we can put it on top here in english, we could make it a contest for local posters/ambassadors and give a bonus, that makes some competition and improves the ANN.",False
