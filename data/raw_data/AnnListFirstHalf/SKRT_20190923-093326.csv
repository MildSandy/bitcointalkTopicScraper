Part of the problem we are addressing is the code architecture: although the system works, the code wasn’t as scalable as we wanted it to be so we decided to spend some extra time fixing that. For the last few weeks, we have been removing old lines of code, refactoring some of the existing systems and making the development more agile for our programming team.  This part of the job is almost invisible for the player but it is definitely worth it when it comes to scaling the project, update features and fix bugs. Spending time refactoring the architecture design - especially on big projects like Skara - will allow us to release new content more easily and quickly down on the road.  As of today, this work is already showing nice results: after refactoring the data model and the login process we have dramatically reduced the loading times up to 80%. Creation of new characters is now more agile and efficient. The new skill modular system allows our designers to quickly prototype new Signs and combine them with other gameplay features to offer new ways to play the game.  And that is precisely the main feature our design team is working on for the last 2-3 months: new characters, types of attacks, skills and game roles. In order to build a nice team fighting experience, we needed a wider variety of roles on the battlefield: pure healers and support characters, skills that can be combined with other characters to create powerful combos, even archers to strike on your enemies from distance! We can’t wait to show you all these new features.  Meanwhile, our art team has been working on new cool stuff to make your survivors look cooler than ever! We have been also working on a new arena called Atash - if you have recently checked some of our streams on Twitch you will already know what are we talking about.",False

After detecting some important issues on the matchmaking for the 3v3 Last Team Standing mode we decided to address the problem and work to find a solution ASAP.  As you may know, Duels have been working okay since our Alpha launch but LTS have proven to be way more complex in terms of getting players in and out in certain conditions: when new survivors join a match in the middle of a fight the server doesn’t automatically update their state. That combined with other special conditions like afk, selecting a character and waiting for new players to come into the lobby generates some bugs. Even if all the players are already in the lobby the system doesn’t display the correct information and that causes confusion.

SKARA offers highest demand among altcoins!  With the crypto market heading back towards 2017 levels, investors are wondering: should I cash out at a loss? Or should I invest in ICOs and hope for a very long term return?  The SKARA Token (SKRT) is the solution to all these problems.  Since the main use of most cryptos is speculative, when Bitcoin goes down, many others follow.  SKRTs are different.  Unlike tokens for yet-to-be-built platforms, SKRTs are sustained by a fast growing community of more than 350k video game players that will be purchasing in-game assets in a soon-to-be legendary eSports title. That means that the demand for SKRT won’t be affected by market sentiment, since gamers don’t know (or care) much about crypto and are used to purchase virtual currencies inside their favorite games.  This is happening from day 1 in our upcoming Beta of Skara — The Blade Remains on the 8th of February (yes this Thursday!) as SKRT will be the only way to purchase premium items in Skara.  Around 8% of free-to-play gamers buy virtual currency, and we plan to hit 3 million players by the end of 2018. That is an estimated 240k players buying and selling SKRT in the secondary market.  Since the prize of SKRT is pegged to the ETH this is the time to buy, so don’t miss out and join our presale: https://www.skaratoken.com/contributors  https://medium.com/@SkaraTBR/tired-of-losing-your-crypto-wealth-skara-offers-highest-demand-among-altcoins-660618fcdd3a",False

During the majority of that time it has been in what is called Alpha, the earliest functioning prototype version that is still playable.  In that basic state, the game has attracted hundreds of thousands of players from around the world, who have had a massive impact on how the game has grown and changed.  One of those players is called Stez.  “I am one of the top players, ranked the highest total score ever, founder/player of the team called Silent Monkeys which is also the current top team (that won the last tournament),” he explained. “Skara is probably the perfect game for everyone that loves playing games against others that are focused on skill matchups.”  Stez compares Skara favorably to the other free-to-play games out there.  “It’s not at all like the typical “unbalanced” or “depending on picks” or “pay2win” games that usually are free to play games have,” he said. “Skara is quite unique in its genre!”  Since Stez is a longtime player and committed community member, he got to see the Beta version before everyone else.  “Balance is on point, the new models look even better, the map update made that icy looking map look extremly nice. The Visual and acoustic effects were pretty awesome as well… not many games rework animations.”  But for Stez the precision came from the action side.  “The fighting felt better — there were only a few bugs and that was on an unpolished version of the game.”  The more polished version will be available February 8.  “We’ve had a major team of QA Testers besides members of the community going over every part of the game,” said SKARA CEO Pablo Rodriguez. “We still have some work to do, but it is definitely ready to enter the world fresh.”  The BETA will not be the only new thing about SKARA franchise.  Besides a hot new game, SKARA will feature a new type of cryptocurrency, the SKARAT.  “We uploaded the smart contract literally yesterday,” said SKARA CTO Victor Moreno. “We were happy to get it back with two thumbs up from the auditors. It will be a new experience for some players, but only if they are into crypto like Ethereum. For everyone else it will be like nothing changed.”  The SKARATs are going on sale officially February 8, but most of the tokens have already been spoken for in the pre-sale.  That’s good news for the team, since the ICO will help finish funding development of the game.  “We have big plans,” said SKARA Co-founder Cesar Ortega. “Soon we will have everything we need to achieve them.”  https://medium.com/@SkaraTBR/the-wait-is-nearly-over-to-try-skaras-beta-704bfaae7704",False

The fights are focused on the right timing, opportunities and  positioning. It comes down to actual skill since reaction times etc are required and it depends on the abilities of the players.

SKARA goes far beyond an award-winning video game. SKARA begins as a fantasy world described in novels and comic books. It is also a competitive free-to-play eSports experience that players define by playing it.   SKARA has been in development since 2012.   Players in SKARA will be able to use their tokens to purchase in-game assets, access special parts of the game world, and even bet on their favorite competitive team in the eSports arena.        Key game features:   Fast-paced combat with timing and accuracy focus: Each survivor has his own 3rd person combat style with a personalized set of close combat movements and skills to fight in frenetic skirmishes against other players.  Fighting synergies between team characters: In order to master the game you will need to learn the specifics of each culture’s combat style to take advantage of your survivor’s unique skills and play as a cohesive group of warriors, empowered by each other’s strengths.  Quick multiplayer matches: You can choose different game modes ranging approximately from 3 to 10 minutes. You cannot hide in the arenas. You must kill your enemies before they kill you.  Game modes: There are 3 game modes: a 1v1 “Duel”, a 3v3 “Last Team Standing” and a 5v5 “Domination”. There are 4 arenas: “Jaarvi” is the icy scenario for the Duels, “Khilma - Lava Coliseum” and “Gâo-di” are the two scenarios where the Last Team Standing matches take place, and “Zem” hosts the “Domination” and “Siege Battles”. Nearly all of them contain interactive elements. Danger is everywhere.  Lore-Rich: The team will also continue the SKARA story directly reflecting what happens in the multiplayer game. Each culture in SKARA has its own story, mythology, heroes and political structure. Music, funerary rites, language and even calligraphy for each one of the cultures is described in the Lore and players can interact with it on the SKARA Wikia (SKARA.wikia.com). Much of this material is generated by players themselves. To date, more than 101 pages worth!  Players become Heroes: In Skara, the best players are not only rewarded with competitive earnings, they become the stuff of legend. We mean that literally, the best players actually become characters in Skara novels and first-person action games--to be played by all.  Card system: To make players into heroes, we have engineered a collectable card system which tracks player stats. The top performers become an asset on the blockchain--and of course the gain some benefit from that status!    Multiple international awards in a variety of categories, a growing community of players and supporters, all while the game was still in an Alpha stage of development!

I thought I were well informed in the gaming scene, but can't remember ever hearing about Skara. The announcement seem to lack some info about what kind of token and so on, but I assume it can be found on the website, which btw is very heavy, used several seconds to load, and all the graphics makes it laggy. I don't do much ICO but this seems very interesting. What about airdrop? Good Luck!  Edit: Ok, you have bounties, thanks",False
