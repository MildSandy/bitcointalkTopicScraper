I can not view my wallet, or buy any XWIN from the wallet because I do not know how to access the wallet(A).  I thought maybe I should just transfer some ETH from my CoinBase account to the wallet address that is displayed for the transfer(B) but it says only transfer from wallets that you want to get paid back on and make sure they accept tokens. I don't think CoinBase does. Plus, why would they give me the ability to create a wallet if I were to just use a different wallet. This website interface is not doing much for building confidence in XWIN... Am I suppose to transfer ETH from my CoinBase to wallet (B) and then XWIN will transfer XWIN tokens to my ETH wallet (A) that the XWin website created? That seems wrong.  https://ibb.co/esLXpR",False

There are several factors of equal importance. 1. Every project starts with the team. It is necessary to point out that in addition to developers and business managers, we have considerable experience in the field of betting and sports forecasting. 2. There is not only great desire, but, most importantly, the ability to make a quality project for the final customer. 3. The project will be implemented regardless of the ICO outcome. Almost a year it has been funded by the co-founders. 4. We’ve established untarnished reputation among the acknowledged masters of the sport. 5. We don’t conduct aggressive advertising campaign and provide discounts and bonuses. We don't scream at the top of our lungs: ""Buy now or it will be too late!"" 6. Our project is transparent and we participate in conferences in the territory of the CIS. 7.  Yes, it's quite possible that often we aren’t in a close dialogue with the community on the forums, but we try to keep you informed about the main news. Although we aren’t able to generate news every day, most of the time is dedicated to developing. In technical terms, we are PROBABLY not the first, but one of the first who do use and will provide the following: - smart-contracts and all the possible functionality they give - Ethereum blockchain, all information is transparent and can’t be changed - the opportunities of the cryptocurrency with complete anonymity - the private AI development  in the part of algorithms and analysis - and other advantages We hope that it will be a comprehensive answer.

During the last several decades, the betting industry has been experiencing serious trust issues caused by speculations and unfair distribution of the prize funds. The blockchain technology is the solution to this problem. We are presenting you XWIN, crypto-bookmaker with the automation of main processes, which allows for the secure betting on different sports.  Football, hockey, tennis, basketball, auto and moto sport, American football, badminton, baseball, biathlon, boxing, volleyball, handball, darts, rugby, mixed martial arts, snooker, chess – it’s only a part of sports you can place bets on using the XWIN platform.  And what stands behind the reliability of this platform?  When you place a bet, you’re making a contract with a system, the conditions of which would be executed regardless of what one of the sides would prefer. The distribution of funds in the decentralized (not controlled by the third parties) platform XWIN is automated, which makes it impossible for anyone to participate in it, or influence its results. The information about all games and bets is secured inside the Ethereum blockchain.  Furthermore, Ethereum guarantees the safety of the funds in your account, availability of constant control and monitoring from any point of the globe, the transparency of transactions and secures the payout.    The AI of the XWIN  XWIN uses artificial intelligence for both calculations of coefficients and scanning of bets, it ensures for the accuracy and speed of calculations, availability of 24/7 monitoring, an instant reaction on changes in the events and mathematical models of higher difficulty.  Verification of results  To prevent the possible attacks and system fraud attempts, XWIN CryptoBet transmits information about the results of events through the trusted addresses. It’s the only element of centralization in the system, but it still remains transparent and can be easily controlled by all community members. All information about parlays, bets, games, prizes, winners, and results is written into XWIN’s smart contract and checked multiple times with several sources of information. Each user is able to review and check the authenticity of the results through their valets and via web – interfaces.   The advantages of investing in XWIN  Due to the obvious advantages of the decentralization, it’s obvious, that is not that distant future many bookmaker platforms will be implementing blockchain technology to ensure the optimal conditions and therefore attract the larger auditory. By the time such projects arrive, XWIN will have already had an active base of users, and thus several advantages, among which are the developed functionality of the system and lower transaction cost. Moreover, participating in ICO gives investors a possibility to become a co-owner of XWIN and hence be free from the additional commission charges.  Once again, the transparency of operations, the security of your personal actives and continuity of the system due to the implementation of the blockchain. None of that may be offered to you by any traditional bookmaker site, and therefore it’s a strong argument towards XWIN.  Commission  Transaction fees are what pays the bills for the existence of platforms. The XWIN commission may fluctuate from 6 to 20% of the bet. This money is credited to the account of the XWIN smart-contract and is automatically divided as such:  •   40% - guarantee fond of payments to the betters; •   30% - PR, marketing, and advertisements; •   10% - administration and legal support; •   20% - revenue, which is divided among the investors   ICO  ICO XWIN CryptoBet has started on 26 of October 2017 and will last exactly 3 months to the 30 of January 2018. The number of coins for the open sales is limited only 80 % XWIN tokens. 20 % XWIN tokens is the blocked share of the founders being available 1 year late. This reserve is a guarantee of the further development of the platform and sustainable growth of the company.     Bounty Funds Distribution  During the ICO XWIN 3% (XWIN tokens) of the funds attracted from the investors is sent to the Bounty Funds Distribution Program. The XWIN team welcomes everyone who wants to join our program to improve or promote XWIN services. Each participant of the Bounty Funds Distribution program will be rewarded with the XWIN tokens. 30% tokens present the remuneration for the developers and technical experts in relation to the XWIN Bounty Funds Distribution program. Developers and technical experts who wish and are able to implement applications, add-ons, plug-ins, interfaces, additional software packages and other IT elements of the system should contact the Development Manager. 70% tokens present the remuneration for participants of the marketing and PR-programs for the XWIN Bounty Funds Distribution.
