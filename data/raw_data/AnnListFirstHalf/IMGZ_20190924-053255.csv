Today, every buyer of clothing and footwear online does not know whether it will fit. It’s called “to buy a pig in a poke”. The buyer risks with such purchases. The lack of reliable information about the fitting degree of the goods, frequent cases of purchase of goods that are not in size, creates a negative impression about the online market of clothing and footwear and casts doubt on the idea of virtual sales in this segment.  We are observing the process of market stagnation, compression of consumer traffic to a small flow.  Who buys clothes and shoes online?  We can assume: 1. Newbies, who for the first time got attracted by the purchase of a product that isn't in regular stores or financial benefits of the purchase. 2. Experienced buyers, those who are not afraid to return the non-fitting goods, and who still hope to eventually get what will fit. 3. Professional online shoppers living in big cities who buy on the Internet things that they have chosen and pre-measured in the normal branded stores. 4. And finally, sustainable clients of branded online stores who buy already proven models of clothes and shoes from the pool of familiar brands.  In our opinion, these categories create that small increase in traffic of Internet shops.  But the bulk of Internet users (about 80% of the world population according to statistics) are still wary of buying clothes and shoes online. Removing the restriction on the guaranteed size selection for online shopping will lead to an avalanche growth in consumer traffic and will lead the most of the sales of clothing and footwear online.",False

There are several American and European stores that try to implement virtual fittings. But they all have certain limitations. For more on that see WP:  https://imigize.io/wp/en/Imigize-Whitepaper-v0.85_EN.pdf  Briefly on the subject. Approaches to solving the problem in these stores are either not designed for the size selection at all (cases with style fitting, when only the footwear appearance is chosen), or do not have enough data for proper selection (cases with 2D based fittings: footwear inner volume and foot maximum length and width). These measurements are only applicable for some range of soft sports shoes with lacing.  Imigize company uses innovative technological solutions based on the 3D format in the practice of its approach to the measurement of clothing and footwear. The result is the possibility of creating a fully featured three-dimensional model of the inner volume of the measured shoes and the customer's feet. The selection algorithm compares these 3D models with each other and finds the best fit, taking into account the comfort parameters for each customer. This comparison is made by more than 20 parameters, including the height of the lift, the position of all fingers, heels, etc…   ou must admit that the precision of such a comparison will be at maximum!

The increase in the number of ecosystem participants: buyers, as the service is very convenient and beneficial, they received a positive evaluation of all buyers who were acquainted with it. The increase in the number of stores as the service removes the main problem of costs and boosts revenue. The increase in the number of manufacturers as using the size comfort and fitting degree data allows producing items that are needed. All this will increase the demand for tokens and will not allow them to depreciate.  The purchase of IMGZ tokens during Pre-Sale and TokenSale will give several advantages. Here is one, for example: You can buy products with benefit online stores for Imigize tokens. The fact that online stores are one of the main users of the service. We suggest to pay one IMGZ token (US$0,22) for one Imigize service use. Contactless fitting scaling on the global market will result in customers demand growth, which will certainly cause shops demand in Imigize tokens.  There will be no emission after the Token-Sale. Thus, stores can buy tokens on free sale. According to preliminary negotiations with major online stores, the most beneficial in this situation is the exchange of tokens for goods with a substantial discount. It is estimated that discounts can be up to 90%. The store would still benefit because one use of the service equals around 3% of the item price in fiat money.  Buying tokens now and then exchanging them on branded goods is a good investment.  ",False

Imigize Service Blockchain creates a new unified information field in the online footwear and clothes market. The elements of this information field are following:  1. Personal for each customer size fitting degree and comfort data of purchased clothes and shoes - personal profiles of size fitting degree and comfort.  2. Protected customer's personal 3D anthropometric data.  3. 3D models of inner volume of shoes and clothes sold in the partners’ online stores.  4. Customer's profiles of size fitting degree and comfort analytical data by following criteria: age, gender, location, social criteria and nationality.  Because of Blockchain technology all personal information is protected (anonymous) and stored decentralized. And since these data are based on real purchases, on established facts of size / comfort fit, on confirmed anthropometric measurements of customers (3D scanning), this creates a verified information environment.      All interactions of ecosystem participants are carried out through the Imigize Service Blockchain (ISB) platform:    Platform functions:  •    Generates and uses within blockchain technology: 3D digital profiles of clothes and footwear inner volume, customers’ personal 3D anthropometric data, size fitting degree and comfort profiles based on contactless fitting and feedback integration.  •     Verifies this information while fitting and purchase of item sale using smart-contracts.   •    Processes raw data received as part of the implementation of smart contracts for each act of sales of goods and builds certain algorithms and formulas of analytics for various parameters.  •    Ensures the protocol and channels of information exchange.  •    Manages payments through smart-contact (SC).

Imigize (IMGZ) token  is used by online stores as compensation to the buyer for access to his personal anthropometric data and his comfort profile.  According to the contract, online stores pay 3-5% for the service in fiat from the cost of each sold part of clothes or shoes or pay fixed price based on the contractual tariff plan (for 12/18 months or the number of digitalized goods etc).  Imigize Service Blockchain will offset 30%-50% of the amount of contracts with online stores to buy tokens from free circulation and from the stimulating pool (50%/50% pro rata) and return them to internet stores.  Online stores transfer IMGZ token to their customers as compensation for the access to their personal anthropometric profiles and participation in the loyalty programs.  Token nominal cost: 1 IMGZ = $0,069 или 1 IMGZ = 0,00010147 ETH  ETH value of the token is fixed on April 28, 2018, at 19:30 am (UTC), ETH is worth US$680.

Thank you for posting it!  We have already encountered multiple cases with feet dimensional changes due to age growth - for instance the situation is very applicable to teenagers and their feet size alteration due to age. The question on body metrics variations lay in the same plane.  Logically only the user can know what happens with his/her body in reality, if there were some reasons e.g. growth, injuries, diets etc., that resulted in feet/body shape/size alteration and if the system's currently used data reflects the real situation. Our mathematical model can only foresee expectable changes basing on the general statistics and suggests making additional scans to refresh data.  We recommend users to make regular scans (easy, fast and charge free using mobile App) to update the system with user’s latest data.  This may be very applicable to women especially during/after weight losing programs - just make one more scan prior online purchasing! Very easy!  Blockchain keeps simultaneously records of the data on all user’s representations, the most important -with the full respect of user’s privacy! Online shops offer the best fit shoes and clothes to the user, distributors supply only relevant shoes and clothes, makers produce only comfortable models based on user’s demand.",False
