Kim https://medium.com/@ebcoin/message-from-founder-jason-j-kim-4efa401e3ba3  We would like to thank all those who have always trusted and loved the EBCoin.  We were deeply distressed by the unexpected accident that happened on Coinrail which was the exchange for listing EBCoin. This refers that the cryptocurrency market still has a long way to go, which means there are a lot of risks all the way to the mainstream market.  In order to meet the expectation of our customers, we were in a hurry to rush to list as soon as possible. The listing decision on Coinrail Exchange was based on benchmarking several successful coins that listed on Coinrail. As mentioned above, we promise that our tokens are safely stored and our Foundation will be responsible for protecting the assets of our customers who transfer EBC tokens to Coinrail.  The EBCoin is currently undergoing a review for listing on large exchanges. This Coinrail accident has caused inconveniences and psychological discomfort of the customers, but it does not have much effect on the planning of the big project.  In addition, we are aware that there was a lack of public relations activities on the website or SNS channel in order to concentrate on listing. We will update the news in the future and fill in the missing parts.  The EBCoin Team is making a lot of progress in business such as the development of wallet, preparation of demonstration day, development of refund system, the establishment of our execution plan, and the alliance with major companies. But we were in the face of a few obstacles as we made one big step toward our goal. We will regard this issue as a lesson, and we will be the EBCoin Team who are faithful to the basics.  We hope you will look forward to being active again, and we will be happy to say good news soon.  News about the listing expected by many people will be delivered as soon as the future plan is concretely confirmed.  Thank you.",False

They also announced negotiations to list their EBCoin currency (Symbol: EBC) on local Japanese exchanges BitFlyer, GMO and Zaif, soon after the conclusion of their crowd sale on February 13.  EBC Foundation originally planned to establish their exchange, KRPEX, in Korea. However, due to the rising regulatory uncertainty faced by digital currencies in Korea, the team set their sights on Japan as the preferred location. In contrast with Korea, Japan has been providing clear guidelines for establishing cryptocurrency exchanges since last year.  The group will work with their Japanese partner, Integro Welfare, who will facilitate the entire process to register and launch KRPEX. Of course, the new exchange will also list EBC Foundation's own EBCoin currency against various other currency trading pairs.  The Japanese Yen is currently the top Bitcoin trading currency in the world, accounting for 56.2 percent of the total trading volume of Bitcoin against fiat currency. The Japanese government in April 2017 introduced legislation to officially recognize cryptocurrency as a payment method equivalent to fiat currencies such as the Yen or the US Dollar.  https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ebcoin-announces-future-listings-and-launch-of-new-cryptocurrency-exchange-300592446.html",False

The implementation of EBCoin will have to be done on a per country basis. This is needed, not just for authorization, but also because each country's tax refund system works slightly different.  Remember though, that even if a specific country does not agree to their customs using EBCoin, EBCoin will still be able to be used as a payment method for participating duty-free retailers. These contracts will be negotiated with the merchants and the payment gateway service providers in that specific country.  Further than that, partnerships with local FOREX services who have kiosks in airports can also be done regardless of customs integration. That will enable the local conversion of EBCoin to FIAT currency.  So, in other words, even without customs integration, the EBCoin platform still has many uses for the international traveller.",False

EBCoin will be integrated with merchants at the payment gateway solution level. In other words, payment terminals at the point-of-sale usually can accept a variety of cards. Visa, Mastercard, JCB, Debit, Credit, Chip, Tap, etc. These terminals will be enabled to also accept EBCoin (EBC) as a payment option, just like any of the others available.  Along with that, merchants can create a ""loyalty program"" based on EBC tokens. eg. Spend over $100 and get 100 EBC tokens as a reward. This also opens up the possibility for system wide EBC rewards sponsored by EBC Foundation. eg. ""Pay with EBC 10 times this month and we'll give you 200 EBC tokens to spend how you wish.""

Gaining approval for placing ATMs in Airports or opening a Kiosk is not an uncommon request made to Airport authorities.

Honestly I just knew through your whitepaper that there is up to $24 billion in sales tax refunds that are unclaimed by travelers, that's a huge amount of money that's been put to waste so that's why when I read your vision, I realize how important this project is, not just towards people who are traveling but towards the community as a whole, with this project people can save a lot of money and they can actually reap the benefits of the tax refund system in their own country. This project's goals are huge and might take time to develop but seeing that the team is composed of a group of people who are experienced in their own field and who are very passionate to bring this project to the top and knowing that this project is already in partnership with a lot of successful and big companies, there's no doubt that this project will be huge in the months to come. I just have a few questions though, how does the loyalty program works? And how can merchants integrate this project into their business?",False

It's not everyday that you're going to find a team that is willing to take risk and approach a subject that's not very popular and known to a lot of people in the cryptocurrency market. This just shows you how dedicated the team behind this project is and how passionate they are to really make the tax refund system better for everyone. I really agree with you on this one, convenience is the key here, the dev is trying to make travelling as convenient as possible, which is another huge reason why people should really support this project. Everybody should really have the opportunity to travel as favorable as possible because traveling is a great recreation that brings so much positive benefits to a person's life. It's like a must have reward that people should give themselves after working so hard in so many months. Definitely the vision behind this project is interesting so I can tell why people are getting interested and watching this project, the first crowdsale was a success, so that means there is already a following here, I think in the second crowdsale there will be more people joining and participating in this project, now it's quite obvious that it's getting seen by a larger market as you can tell by the views that this thread is getting every single day. I really applaud the devs for a job well done here and I hope to see more people in here in the days to come.",False

I love the idea of having the tax refund converted to the local currency of your choice or any other types of cryptocurrency. It shows how flexible this platform can be as they make sure that what you got from the refund would not be wasted but be worth it. However, I saw that there is a limitation when it comes to the currencies it caters to. I wish that as this project progresses, they would allow exchange of EBCoin to other currencies aside from what is stated like PHP since most of us enjoy traveling in the countries where EBCoin is going to be established.
