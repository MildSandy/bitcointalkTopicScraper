Users will be able to access it without any central authority e.g. bank, company, or government.  With the use of this ecosystem, coffee supply will become smoother, inflation will decline, ultimately helping in better economic conditions.”  Crypto N’ Kafe aims at fixing the gloom of underpaid coffee farmers and cutting the involvement of intermediaries, while offering a broader exposure.
