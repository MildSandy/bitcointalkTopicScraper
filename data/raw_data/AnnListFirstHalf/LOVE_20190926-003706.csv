Token holders receive 50% of ALL Love Platform profits  Audience Their are two audiences for this post:  1. Love Coins - for early investors, to fund the platform - to get Ether returns through their holding %  2. Love Platform - for the users - to spend their Ether for the purpose of purchasing services such as: their own Valentine's Day, an exclusive Love Block (only one in the world at any one time), Virtual tradeable hearts and most importantly, a decentralised Marriage.  What are LoveCoins?  LoveCoins are Ethereum ERC-20 tokens that are released prior to the development of the Love Platform. Ether is exchanged for LoveCoins during our pre-sale and ICO. The Ether raised from these two events is used to fund development, auditing, marketing and maintenance of the final platform. Upon release of the Love Platform, the percentage of LoveCoins an ""investor"" holds, relative to the total supply, will dictate their quartely return from the Ether that pools within the Love Platform contract. This pool of Ether, ofcourse, grows due to sales on the Platform. Hence, the premise behind LoveCoins is essentially a percentage marker for investors such that the Love Platform contract knows precisely how much Ether to send them individually, on an ongoing basis.  What is Love Platform?  Love Platform is a way to digitally recognise and acknowledge your love or commitment for another. There are four ways to demonstrate your commitment:  ""Eternal Commitment"" with our ""Blockchain Marriage"" registrar and certificate service ""Reoccuring Commitment"" with our ""Date & Event Lock"" service - for anniversaries or creating a public day of celebration just for yourself and your loved one ""Exclusive Commitment"" with our ""Love Blocks"" feature that names and inscribes current or future blocks exclusively for you, and for all to see. ""Playful Commitment"" with our ""Virtual Hearts"" product that will be tradable virtual assets on the Love Platform itself.    When are the pre-sale and ICO dates?  Pre-sale is on the 10th of March (24 days from today) and runs for roughly four weeks until the 10th of April.  ICO is on the 10th of May and runs until a soft cap is reached of 1000ETH, before initiating a 6 week countdown.    Does the pre-sale offer bonuses? - We understand that the earliest investors take the biggest mental risk, hence time related bonuses and commitment-size related bonuses are available in the pre-sale. - Time related bonuses are available during the ICO (but no commitment-size related bonuses). - People that register receive a referral code. For each friend that signs up and commits to either the ICO or Pre-sale, 2.5% of their commitment will be sent to you up to an accumulative 100% bonus (so, maximum 40 referrals)   What do I do now? 1. Go to https://lovecoins.io and register your email 2. Receive your referral code and begin spreading it to your friends or interested colleagues 3. Accumulate referral bonus percentage prior to the pre-sale 4. Contribute to the pre-sale through our web page or by directly interacting with our TBA pre-sale address  Please leave comments and questions below  Love, Love Platform",False

Other users have been able to register without such an issue. Can you confirm whether or not you experience ANY loaders, success or error dialog boxes?  Perhaps knowing what browser you used when attempting to join our list can help.  FYI - there are no error logs with regards to ANY failed registrations on our server in the past 7 days. Hence if you faced any issues, they would have occurred client side. Would you mind trying again and letting us know if the problem persists?  Thanks for bringing this to our attention, I will inform those who can assist if further intervention is required  RE: Your referral code - upon successful registration, you will receive an email with your referral code and link to give your friends and family.  On a separate note, we hope you had a happy Valentine's day  Kind Regards, Marty",False

Our white paper has been updated twice, the latest is a February version. Understandably, from our perspective, a love-themed token being advertised on Valentine's Day to compete with us is not a surprise.  All we can hope for is community engagement and for everyone to select their desired option.  I for one, have never heard of their offering.  Please provide your thoughts on any of the below channels / read our white paper. I would love to get your take.
