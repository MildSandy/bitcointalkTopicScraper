To respect everyone who participated in the BitDegree ICO we're working on the product that we've outlined in our whitepaper. We want to be very clear and we will not participate in any market manipulation or create fake volume. Because we respect everyone that contributed to the project! That's why we're so transparent and focus on the legal side of crypto. Even Bitcoin is now under $4k dollars and experiencing huge losses, every single cryptocurrency has been affected this past year and exchanges do not help the situation.  The reality is that projects that get bullied into spending millions of dollars (that contributors gave for project development) on exchange listings and later spend a monthly fee on trading bots and market manipulation. This ends up hurting everyone in the long run. Because this is money that they don't spend on self-sustainment or project developing and once they are out of money, they are forced to stop their projects.  BitDegree isn't here for the short-term, we've built sustainable businesses before and we know what it takes. That's why instead of a show of smoke and mirrors and wasteful spending, we focus on what matters the most - THE PROJECT, THE USERBASE, SUSTAINABILITY, and ADOPTION.",False

However, if you're just looking to buy 1 course and never come back we do accept FIAT payments. If we wouldn't do this, people would turn to competitors.

We can't do what we've set out to do without blockchain, a quick explanation.  1. Scholarships & Micro-payments ( using smart-contracts we can easily distribute payments and scholarships to students). Imagine convincing thousands of people to put in their banking information and then manually sending them a couple of dollars as an incentive for completed achievements. This would be such a huge timesink that blockchain and token payments solve with 1 smart-contract.   2. 100% revenue share model for teachers. Using blockchain we can have it so students pay teachers directly. Smart-contract would outline the transaction details so that no side would have to ""pay first"" and feel uneasy.  3. Safety for students. If businesses sponsor courses, students can rest assured that they'll get their scholarships because everything is processed through smart-contracts. Blockchain also adds a level of transparency so no-one feels cheated.  4. And tokens allow us to gamify the platform.",False

If we market to the cryptocurrency crowd who knows how to use BDG tokens, there would be close to no users because the crypto community is extremely small. And, if we market to the 99.5% of the remaining populations (as we're doing now) they have troubles purchasing and want a FIAT gateway. To solve this, we're meeting both of the communities half-way, accepting other payment methods, but we'll be heavily incentivizing the usage of BDG token in the upcoming months. So, it's beneficial for people to learn more about crypto and use it as a payment method. Another solution that's being explored is an automatic internal converter. So, it users could pay as they see most convenient and we would convert everything to BDG.  You can read more about it BitDegree Tokenomics & Payment Models.

I was also part of suppoman when i was new, did the course and was part of there FaceBook page. When i was talking about BDG, i replied on a topic of BitDegree about the price, i said that BDG will drop under 10 cents and if we have  a crash it will go even under 5 cents. And what happened? I was kicked out because of my opinion about BDG price. After i confronted him on youtube, Twitter and Messenger he never had the balls to reply. And even on Youtube he blocked me for posting message (livestream chat and comments section). We have no big crash yet and the price is already 5 cents on IDEX. I am sure the price will go down little bit more but if you want to get in, get in around 3 cents if you believe in the project and hold for a long time, this project can take up at least 2 to 3 years before its mainstream.  @DragonD, we have to warn people for this scumbag because he is like the other pump and dumpers. They buy cheap with there friends (he is talking about them in his video's and call them the pro's) and after that he makes a video of it ""blablla i am investing"" his followers pump the price and pay way to much, he and his pro friend sell it to this idiots maybe they hold a little bit but the most part they sell it and we the sheep have a bag of worthless tokens. Second, he makes every week a few videos with a subject like ""is this the new ico 2018"" ""Is this a game changer of 2018"" off course if you promote so many coins 1 or 2 of them will make it. I can do the same. Since i followed this scumbag i down in crypto by more than half and in fiat i break even. Now i do my own research, most of my ico's i invested in he never mentioned it and that looks promising till now.  @BDG, i believe you can make a working product, i just give you guys the time you will need for it.

A smart contract will send you back BDGs to your (e.g. myetherwallet) address immediately The percentage is a bonus that you get for investing early. 1 ETH = 10,000 BDG.

That by itself is a good start as many projects are built entirely upon increasing useful advertisements such as BAT.  I think a great idea could be using BitDegree to notarize courses that students have completed. Students could take an online test at the end of the course and their performance would be recorded forever on the blockchain. The student could then show his/her course completions to potential employers and they would demonstrate his/her knowledge. Is there anything in the works for something like this?,False

In the field of education there is already a huge number of sites for distance learning of students. Including non-profit organizations from leading universities in the world which are very popular. Does it not seem to the team that the key factor in choosing a training site is the brand of the educational institution that it represents. This is true not only for students but also for employers sponsors. In my opinion the educational institution is the foundation of a successful distance learning site.  Unfortunately I did not find information on plans for cooperation with educational institutions in WP.,False

First, in long term we want the platform to become fully decentralized, work as a DAPP. Student identification, student achievements, student certificates, instructor platform, will be decentralized. We will start with centralized version, but when technologies will allow us to be as ""responsive"" as it is with current technologies we will switch. BitDegree will issue blockchain based certificates. Everybody will be able to see each student progress. We will consider using 3rd party services such as blockcerts.org. Student identification can be done with projects like Civic. Smart contracts and oracles can be integrated with upcoming technologies to achieve full transparency.  Second, we are business not universities oriented. BitDegree goal is to approach real companies with real business needs to create courses that are relevant to the exact company. For example, lets say we have a company which sells crypto mining hardware. BitDegree will approach this company with an offer to create a course on mining. The topic is useful for the learners and for the company as it is closely related to the product they are selling. At first it may look like credibility of the course is low, but in long term university ""name"" become less attractive to the employers in exchange of what exact skills learner is possessing.  Third, we are discussing with advisors from a popular mooc platform providers (We will announce partnership when we reach agreement to do so), to get insights about current industry challenges. Token based education economy will help in areas where currently available moocs can not solve. For example incentivizing students with token rewards to help fellow students in p2p review process or by answering questions in course forums, is a huge driver to successful community.  Hope this answers your question.",False

The team behind this idea are devoted and clear-minded individuals who's sole purpose is to revolutionize the education system. Having said that, one can't simply achieve that goal by providing same old educational service/products as you mentioned. It is just not possible. The team wholeheartedly believe in the same notion as you do, that universities and schools nowadays are inefficient. That is because technology is evolving faster than a educational system can ever do.  The whole idea behind this project is to have a mediator between an employer and a student by providing a platform to learn and by providing a platform that has, as you mentioned, true IT education and more to it. High quality courses is one of the main keys for this project to succeed. BitDegree will become the place where, in the future, you might stumble across an article about a successful yet young expert in the IT industry giving an interview and when a question about his roots will be asked, he will mention BitDegree.  This is an amazing vision of the future which makes the team even more motivated and excited to work on this project.  Everything you need to know and more can be found at their website  Thank you for your time on our thread, feel free to ask any questions you want but i might suggest the Telegram chat. Join the community and get your answers within seconds.  Good luck",False

I would like to post a response to this question in greater details, so bare with me that the answer may get a little bit longer.  Last 7 years I was responsible for foreseeing the Hostinger roadmap. In the meantime starting from 2012 I have started following Bitcoin phenomenon. Even though I am the owner of Bitcoin as a currency - Blockchain as a technology itself fascinated me more. Having public database where everybody has read and write access opens different kind of opportunities that was spinning in my mind since then.  While working in web hosting industry for so long it always struggled me, why there are so many users that are not able to set up their websites even though the tools provided to them are really easy to use. A will to help them set up websites lead me to think about education even more.  With a 000webhost project we have provided millions of young age students ability to start their journey online. For free. This is the important part. We are providing free web hosting services for more than 10 years now. Project had influenced people who are currently successful in their area.  When participating in different IT conferences all around the world, it is very likely that we will find at least a few of our clients. Most of them mention us a part of their journey to online success. They remember 000webhost as their starting point in life. We want to do the same with BitDegree. We want to enable even more students to participate in new Era. We want to teach them Blockchain. We want industry to move towards decentralization. We want to be a big part of it. I know that it is difficult to predict where the market will pivot, what new projects will appear but BitDegree will always strive to provide most useful courses for the industry.  29 million customers is the number of people who had ever used our services. We are going to use this customer base to invite them to learn blockchain technology on BitDegree platform. Most of them are eager to learn new things. We are excited to start this project not from the blank space but on solid background.  I hope this answers your question how they are related to this project.",False
