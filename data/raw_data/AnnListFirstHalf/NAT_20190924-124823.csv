The next days we will make a meeting with the CEO of one of the greatest Domain Exhibitions who would like to promote nametoken at his events in Shanghai and Las Vegas. I hope that we will be able to get enough community support to build a great decentralized domain eco system.  Currently we have no automated bounty program but you can write us if you are interested to support nametoken.  I am glad about every inquiry.  regards  Frank",False
