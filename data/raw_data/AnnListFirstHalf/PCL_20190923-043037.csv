Keep reading to find out what's been going on over the past few months.  We've Only Just Begun  We've grown a great deal since we started and we've been lucky to manage more than $1,000,000 across all of our customers.  But this is just the beginning, we're certain to reach new heights and new people. So get involved in our journey and start growing your savings today.  How is BeliEve Doing?  With an average win rate of over 97% across our portfolios and with an average Estimated Annual Return of over 37%, you can rest easy knowing that your funds are in safe hands.  As if that wasn't enough, we'll even recommend the level of risk best suited to you! You might suit a cool Conservative strategy, maximising your fund availability or maybe you'd be better suited to an Aggressive strategy, exposing yourself to more risks but looking for extra profits and losing some of the fund availability present in the other strategies.  Although we strongly suggest that you stick with our recommended risk profile we do also allow you to select an alternative or additional risk profile for your investments. But remember, Aggressive doesn't always mean more profits! It does however always mean more risk and less fund availability. Only 30% of our customer base exhibit suitability for an aggressive strategy, so be be sure that you're ready for the associated risks if you want to go aggressive.  How do I Get Started?  Getting started couldn't be simpler, all you need to do is set up your free account and then head over to the BeliEve on-boarding section of our website: https://www.aieve.io/main/believe_onboard   There's even a handy guide written by one of our best customers to help you along the way: https://medium.com/@pi3rrot/how-to-set-up-your-believe-account-63943df6141f  Source: https://t.me/peculiumANN/393",False

Meanwhile I recommend to understand the whole picture of Peculium (and that are not many till date, as this project still seems hard to understand)  - the vision (savings-platform) - meant to serve for a huge number of private persons, institutions and nations (national savings-plans) to - provide them with a real savings-option (the prospects in terms of ""savings"" for millenials are devastating)  Just then everybody will (earlier or later) get a feeling for how this CAN be a game-changer, given that there are experts in BigData & AI working on something great.  I recommend watching the ""Financial Analysis"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXbYuJzjHYU  That said the price-prediction is as conservative as I´ve never before seen in any other project and given the facts above, it just makes perfect sense as all these talks and negotiations with institutional investors, CEOs of companies (to implement an effective savings-plan for their employess) as well as national (!) savings-plans (as real options to traditional solutions, such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/401(k)) will take time - a lot of time.  So this project is nothing for the ""moon"" - boys in the cryptosphere. It is not a quick-rich-scheme as the team told it to all impatient community-members since day 1 (!).  This project CAN (nobody can guarantee anything) be an absolute game-changer in the savings-industry, national as well as global. But obviously NOT in the next months or 2 years. Who doesn´t got this time to let it roll out in all its variety, is well advised to move on to any other project.",False

You need to forget FIAT-values when comparing prices (except you consider buying with FIAT (€ / $) ).

On top of this ICO-investors will receive 20% share from the Corporate Profits for the first 3 years irrespective if you are holding tight on your PCL or not, the shares depend on the initial investment only - that´s huge, but only possible when buying from the Peculium-platform !  Soft-fact: when buying in HitBTC your BTC/ETH will go to somebody else. When buying through the Peculium-platform the funds will go to Peculium, raise liquidity & make to project moving forward even faster what will reflect on the PCL-price again.   sorry my english is not so good, that means that if i buy by peculium site and if i hold during 3 years my token i will receive 20 pourcent of token like bonus?

If you have been with us right from the start, you may have already witnessed the previous token burn. If you are a new investor, you will witness the token burn for April, 2018.  Stating simply, token burn is a process where we burn the unsold tokens from a quota set for each month. This decreases the supply of tokens, thereby increasing the price. If you want to know more about why we do it and how it is done, please read a detailed article here.  As stated, today we would be conducting the process of burning tokens for April 2018. Our developer, Mr. Mohamed Amine, will conduct a live webinar and go ahead with the process.  Visit our homepage peculium.io at 17:00 GMT+2 (Paris, Brussels, Berlin).

The hard cap for our project is to raise € 200M. The majority of this fund is to be used as an essential element of asset management, known as “liquidity provider”. At the beginning of the ICO phase, the total number of tokens was capped at 20 Billion at the rate of € 0.01 per PCL.  €200M / 0.01 = 20 Billion  However, if during the CCO phase the price of the PCL token increases 5 folds (€ 0.05 cent per PCL); the total available supply of PCL decreases to 4 billion.  €200M / 0.05 = 4 Billion  This dynamic relationship between the price of PCL token and the supply available for the sale during CCO makes it a rewarding structure for the individual investors during the ICO. If the ICO investors HODL their tokens and progress of the project successfully increases the demand of the token, at the price of € 0.1 the supply might just be restricted to mere 2 Billion PCL tokens. Because most of these 2 Billion tokens are already sold to ICO investors, there will be a few tokens available to purchase by large institutional investors during the CCO phase. In theory, this should drive the demand of the PCL on the market even further, increasing the price even more.  Therefore we urge our investors to HODL their tokens until the end of the CCO period during which a lot of news is expected to come out.   source: https://blog.peculium.io/peculium-launches-its-continued-coin-offering-phase/  i am hopeful that as PCL goes into the CCO, the value of PCL will grow just like what they said. i will be very amazed if it will be in 0.05 EUR per token.",False

We are getting started with the Continuous Coin Offering (CCO) phase.  This CCO phase will last for 5 months. During the CCO phase, Peculium will offer coins to institutions/companies. The total maximum amount of PCL tokens allotted to the CCO phase is 55% (11 Billion PCL). The PCL token is currently been traded on cryto-market exchanges. The ICO price was 0,01€ per token.    The minimum limit for institutional investment is set to €100,000. The institutions can invest in one or more of our three smart contracts. Details on the three smart contracts on http://www.peculium.io.    Our investments and decisions are powered by AIEVE and artificial intelligence engine that can gather, process, and analyze vast amounts of data to provide best predictions on crypto markets. AIEVE will be able to utilize the risk profiles selected in the smart contract and make best investment decisions for you or your company.    Our Vision:  Peculium is based on concept and the underlying current or future valuation of the cryptocurrency assets. Peculium relies on the strong potential of the inherent properties of the Blockchain technology to capitalize on the expected future growth.    Currently this growth potential is overshadowed by the lack of regulation, relative lack of security, and unprecedented amount of volatility in the markets.    We expect our blockchain analytics platform, big data and trends gathering engines, and the predictive forecasting of the crypto markets by analyzing past and present market data to provide necessary information for our Artificial Intelligence to guards against potential losses due to market swings. More on http://www.peculium.io.  The artificial intelligence will be a wonderful support for decision making on the market swings by providing advice or taking long and short positions successfully.    The Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain data analytics platform confer Peculium platform with another important capability, the asset management. Due to the transparent nature of the Blockchain data, and transparent execution of the smart contracts over the smart blockchains. More on http://www.peculium.io.    What is the value proposition for PCL token?    PCL token has two value propositions. PCL tokens will be used as a preferred method of payment for the subscriptions of the services provided by Peculium platform. Just like binance (BNB), Kucoin (KCS) etc the token holders will be able to enjoy benefits from our platform. Other value proposition is the speculative element. Just like any other Blockchain based project, there is a speculative value attached to the success of the project. We expect that in the short-term relative importance of speculative element will dominate the price of PCL token but in the long run, the value proposition of PCL token will mainly be driven by the usage on our platform.   Second important aspect of the valuation of the PCL token is the determination of the total supply of the PCL. The hard cap for our project is to raise € 200M. The majority of this fund is to be used as an essential element for asset management, known as “liquidity provider”.    We believe in a truly transparent global and fair economy that provides a fair chance to succeed to anyone and everyone. We are the pioneers, we have undertaken this ambitions project.

Recently they have partnered with Accuracy, Acurracy is a financial consulting firm. It was created in November 2004 by a team of Arthur Andersen.  This shows that the PCL team is serious about this project and they are being advised by a real company that has offices in ten countries around the world.  I second this.  It's interesting that they are pretty vocal (in a sense) on their newsletter, but don't really have any updates anywhere else.  These newsletter updates seemingly come out of nowhere.  Then, about 1-2 days later, they post it on telegram. They really want people to get over to Reddit it seems.  Absolutely... Telegram is nice for chatting, but for announcements, info´s, updates and stuff it´s useless as you have to repeat all the posts over & over again (usual Telegram-users do not scroll up the last hour(s)... r/Peculium is the place to be in future for those who want to be up-to-date ...!    Reddit is also clearly arranged, you see all recent announcements immediately (i.e. sticky threads) and the search is working very good.  I think Reddit is the go-to for all crypto coins.

Peculium hat die Bedingungen während des Icos zu unserem Nachteil massiv verschlechtert.  1. Der First Solid Contract ist ersatzlos weggefallen. Dieser hätte jedem von uns ermöglicht, mit einer Summe von 25% der Token Kaufsumme in den Topf zu investieren, mit dem AIEVE dann tradet. Und zwar Lebenslang, und Gratis. Wir können somit nicht mehr direkt an AIEVE teilhaben, ausser über die Kurssteigerung der Token.  2. Im Whitepaper V3 steht, dass jedes Jahr 20% der Geschäftsgewinne von Peculium an die Tokenhalter als eine Art Dividende ausgeschüttet werden. In der neuen Fassung ist das ganze nun gedeckelt auf 3 Jahre.  Nun möchte ich folgendes wissen: nach internationalem Übereinkommen kann ein Vertrag nicht einseitig geändert werden. Wie also soll das nun zu verstehen sein? Dies wurde im übrigen auch meines Wissens nicht öffentlich kommuniziert, sondern nur auf mehrfaches Nachfragen im Telegram Chat dann mitgeteilt.  Wie steht Bitcointalk dazu, dass hier Firmen Werbeplatz erhalten, um anschließend solche Änderungen vorzunehmen, die uns alle unangemessen benachteiligen, so der korrekte rechtliche Ausdruck?   Hallo Marco,  erstmal stimmt es, dass der FSC weggefallen ist und die Dividende gedeckelt wurde.  Dies hat - soweit ich weiß - hauptsächlich mit gesetzlichen Regulierungen zu tun gehabt.  Desweiteren bin ich mir ziemlich sicher, dass du unsere AGB nicht gelesen hast und bitte darum, dass du dies nachholst:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0EJmtqin-mqMGVWYW1iYXRHM28/view  Punkt 3 der AGB ist hier nämlich von extrem großer Bedeutung.  (Übrigens ist dies der Standard bei ICOs jeglicher Art.)   Außerdem möchte ich bemerken, dass die Änderung positiv für die Investoren ist.  Die Dividende ist nämlich nicht mehr an die Token gebunden, sondern wirklich nur an die Investition. D.h. egal was der Investor mit seinen Token macht, er wird trotzdem von den Dividenden profitieren. Short translation for all non-german speakers:  Marco76 says: - First solidus contract is cancelled - Dividend is now only paid for the first 3 years.  Criptix confirm: - First solidus contract is cancelled - Dividend will not be paid indefinitely. (Both based on regulatory reasons) Both changes are better for the investor.  -----------------------------------------------------  How far Criptix can really speak for the Peculium Team, I don't know. He is started the ANN-Thread...",False

I have a good track record recently so that's why I am confident, but that's also why all my posts allude to the fact that investments can go down as well as up!  Just don't wade in with more than you can afford to, and be smart and it's always gonna end well.  For instance, your gut feeling is that I might be wrong here so just don't follow that prediction - do your own or find one that motivates your confidence.  This is how proper investing should work, nobody is killing themselves with risk but at the same time feeling confident of good returns  I am under the impression from what I read into on that white paper - that the AI prediction uses forecasts and data trackers from a lot of financial sources like share index, interest rate tracker, coin conversation and coin sell prices, but as well as that it has input from actual people.  So that is why I think if that is used correctly it could have a massive edge.  Also the prediction success rate they currently boast is flippin awesome so it's not out of the bounds of reasonable assumption that this AI system could be as smart as a person who is using a computer for data collection.  In fact that's pretty much what I would call the perfect system.  Machine tools under command of a persons intellect.  Pretty cool.  What's your take on the AI and how far it can predict?  I would love to hear your views as so far nobody has really given me anything, so its all white paper plus speculation from my own perspective.

On the contrary, your logic sounds pretty solid. However, I have learnt from my experience in crypto that the market can be very unexpected, that is why I don't try to make long term predictions on the exact price of a coin.  Obviously I don't know exactly how AIEVE makes it's predictions, but I assume it works similar to other AI's that try to predict things like the stock market or sports. Usually, those AI's can make two kind of predictions with a decent accuracy: 1. Relatively short term predictions which tend to be very specific. 2. Long term predictions which tend to be very general. For example, it might predict that ETH is currently pumped and there will be a big correction in the upcoming weeks/months. However It won't be able to tell exactly when. Another example, it can analyze past patterns of a token to try and determine if a price drop is just a small correction or a real longterm decrease in the value of the token.  Those are just examples of course, and again there is a possibilty that AIEVE works entirely different and will be able to make accurate long term specific predictions. I simply think it's unlikely as this market is currently too volatile (take the situation in SK for example. No AI could have predict that. See how much effect it had on the whole market). If AIEVE does manage to do that, it will surely explode.",False

The way you can see it for yourself, and speculate accurately is to look at their financial figures on the different markets and compare that to the crypto pricing markets.  If you know what you are doing you can see when they start shifting funds out for transfer, and spot new funds when they become available ""unspecified"" - and then join the dots.  The movement of med to big money affects stock markets oil and gold trackers the lot.  Because the movement of cash is what powers the entire world economy.

Basically groups like PCL have to take into account exchange listing fees as part of their ICO process, the fact is big volume coins need big volume exchanges, and not all of them allow voting, so it comes down to if the company decides the other exchanges are enough or not. Personally i think the voting to get in is ok normally, but i've seen a lot of coins game that system.  I'm really hopeful we see PCL atleast on one or 2 of the major exchanges.",False

The people who are invited to these conferences are all heavily invested financial staff of big corporations, bank agents, politicians, and the heads of other businesses who wish to be involved with future projects.  This is more compelling evidence of what I was saying earlier about the movement of financial institutions of these countries into crypto funding.  Here is the date list which is actually 100% confirmed although tickets are invite only so there isn't any way to buy them if you are not already invited to do so.  Manila 25/1/18 Gibraltar 8/2/18 St Petersburg 13/3 Geneva 21/2/18   Bengaluru 22/2/18 Minsk 27/2/18   Istanbul 1/3/18 Bangkok 6/3/18 Tallinn 22/3/18 Tel Aviv 28/3/18   Kiev 29/3/18 Berlin 4/4/18   Moscow 17/4/18 and 18/4/18   Prague 17/5/18  Companies that are confirmed to be attending, who have plans for crypto investments this year are as follows (not exhaustive) :  BrickBlock Ltd. (German Crypto company with associated coin) EasyMINE Ltd. (Polish Crypto farming technology company) REGA Risk Sharing (European risk management and portfolio investment company) SingularityU (Think tank for technology and finance segments) Apla CZS (Cyber Security & commercial platform testing company) Safello (Network probing and security device company) BlockGeeksLabs.Net (Website concerning the crypto industry) TenX (Cryptocurrency and investment fund business) Tachyonic LLC (Legal management company of high value investments internationally) Lynx Capita (Another high value investment company) GrandCentral.Trading (Web platform for crypto trading) Mathias Sundin (Parliament member for Sweden, Chairman of BitCoin Exchange & Co-Partner of WARP Institute) Georgio Ballini (UN Ambassador and trade relations expert) Fernando Guiterrez (European Parliament member and trade expert) Carolina Martowicz (IBM Co Director & Co Founder of their Academy Of Technology) Sofya Blakstaad (Advisor to Stokholm Fintek Exchange) Eric Benz (Manager and Tech Director at CryptoPay)  So there you have it, officially recognisable evidence that these countries and the commercial operations hailing from them are getting BIG into crypto investments this year and next year - with the intent of building a new industry and markets in there (farming, trading, investment).  More than likely this is something the PCL team know about and might well be in attendance at!  Of course though as with industry secrets nobody will be telling.  But since I am not able to attend I can happily confirm this information from the official invite.  Here is a note taken from the invite :  ""We  focus on Sweden and foreign projects implementing Blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

So I am thinking, does this mean it will have a real intellectual element such as that a human expert would have?  Rather than just predicting stuff from financial graphs and economic forecasts like all the other AI's I am thinking this might actually lookk at geopolitical and social events and use these to add to the compute pool - if this is what it does the prediction for zero day or random events will be far higher.  Any body know anything here???    Look at the people who develop thiis AI, then think what their speciality or industry background is!  I'm now wondering if the Peculium AI will be expecting the rise in BTC after the Easter holidays, to somewhere near to $1600 - and the associated rises in all other cryptos as a result Also I wonder if this AI will foresee the slight faltering of the ETH rates during this period, as people switch their ETHs into other coins, and other coins into BTCs to withdraw as cash for taking their kids / wives on holiday!  Because to have predicted these you would have to have considered the changes in international laws regarding finance as well as the Sweden/Swiss investment rumours!  Is that even possible?  I will be super impressed if they do get this right, if they do better than my own manually drawn prediction chart I will literally be gobsmacked.  Any predicction engine that can beat a relatively experienced human deserves a LOT more attention in the media than Peculium is currently getting.  Let's keep our eyes on that!

We can speculate though - to be able to predict prices, you need to know three things : Supply amount, demand level, trade volumes.  So based on that I would think that they are using financial markets trackers which trade in crypos against currency as well as the actual market caps from the various cryptocurrencies as a base.  Then add to this political and geographical factors and you have yourself a merry little prediction dataset.  I imagine what they are doing is on a far larger scale than my basic example though, if they wanted to they could easily incude all the major stock market indicies as well; then trim the data down by averaging the difference scores and running them against a stock simulation or condition.  Sorry if that's a bit of a lardy explanation, its the best I could do Based on speculation since there is no way we shall ever be told the real datasets.  Looking at the picture given on the AI prediction earlier in this conversation - success it seems to mirror this scenario I gave.  Also I would suggest that the algorythm and the datasets are constantly under review for Peculium and this is why it's so successful!  It's not a ""machine"" they just leave to run off on it's own, it is a machine that has several intelligent human operators whom work in the background making tweaks and ensuring it's always competitive.  And that's the only part that is not speculation; reading into their website and looking at the team you can see this for yourself!  As computing power increases over the next few years I would have thought they could actually employ a true AI to run the thing; though for now it will always require human interaction to be as accurate as that graph shows it has been so far!!",False

Maybe we could all form a consensus on this please, because it really is going to drag down the legitimacy of this project and everybody connected to it.  I worked in finance for almost a decade with a further 5 years in banking help desk services.  And I can tell you, the people who make the best decision in the long term are the ones who end up with all the profits.  IMO the consensus here should be this : Use this as a second savings account, so whatever disposable income you are going to put into savings with your bank you can split into 3 and put a third into Peculium - with the intention of adding to this periodically and taking out only the profits, and checking this at the end of every 6 month period.

Just a quick info post for all crypto enthusiasts and investors!  China are currently trying to re write some of their regulatory laws, in order to force out the ""non official"" (that is not government backed) crypto farms ... And this is when combined with the Korean thing, the reason we have seen major price wobbles.  But don't worry because the rest of what I learned is great news for us.  Switzerland where the currency banks all headquarter their firms; where the regulation and law for finance is the easiest to work with and most profitable - is where these companies who are getting squeezed out will be relocating too; and I have it on fairly good authority from a source who lives in Switzerland ad a guy who recently moved to China to teach English EFL students .. that the Swiss government is welcoming these operators with open arms!  Not only that, the actual banks are gonna throw WHOPPING big investments towards crypto farms who move there.  So while in the long long term some will see this as conventional banks trying to ""buy"" crytpo, anybody who knows about the crypto scene will know this is never gonna happen - what is going to happen is that the large amount of investments and high volume trade, will cause the currently flattened prices to rebound and SKYROCKET at the time this starts to physically happen.  My advice, and what I am planning?  Keep a cash store handy; then when the price is low lump some dosh into cryptos as this starts to happen and watch your profits soar.  This goes for ALL the big coins, including many subforks and projects with official support such as Peculium (Google partnered!)  Anybody who is interested, I will keep posting as and when new info comes my way, and if you are interested to hear more detail feel free to quote me.  Happy trading everyone!",False

Well after having posted a few questions earlier, and still waiting for somebody to answer them I took the liberty of reading the white-paper, which is the official information document on the Peculium website and will now share some of the insights gained from that :  1) ALL POSITIONS ARE PUBLIC ON THE PLATFORM.  So that means you can also speculate on your own what will happen based on both current prices and how many positions are ""going"" at any time, as well as their value and loss/gain.  That's kind of necessary for transparency, prevents one or two people investing big to take control of the supply and demand.  I would be interested to leave the client running and collect my own data from it, which also adds to network security via having the client open and aiding decentralisation etc.  2) PLATFORM DOES NOT TAKE COMMISSIONS UNLESS PROFITS ARE REACHED. This is interesting, shows confidence in the platform and prediction model, as they state that the only time commissons fees are ever payable, is after a profit position is reached so basically you never end up paying for a loss making position on the occassion when that happens.  Means easier automation for you, plus less risk on trades.  3) GOOGLE AND CLOUDERA ARE PARTNERED.  This project and the associated coin seem to have big corporate support, which bodes well for it's survivability.  I will have to go and have a look at the partner aggreements and such to provide more detail here but it's certainly a good start having a name like Google behind you where it comes to anything crypto related and new.  Google are not going to back losers, so that tells me they speculate that this has a hidden value likely to be revealed as users participate more over time.  4) PECULIUM IS ALSO AIMED AT CORPORATES FOR EMPLOYEE INVEST AND SAVING.  Looking over how this is all put together, the people involved in the core development team, and what is currently happening in the community with regards to the ICO; I would say this project is aiming to gain popularity as a financial growth option for companies to offer their employees.  That's as well as consumers wanting to jump into this early on for better returns over time.  I would say this gives it particular weight as the entire project would have to be ""lawyer-ready"" in anticipation of corporates throwing their lawyers towards it before throwing money.  That's all for now - I am still reading but it is so far, very intriguing stuff!  ",False

Unless it's hidden somewhere very deep, i looked very hard for anything KYC related and coulden't find it. So, if i can't find it after 15-20minutes of looking, it doesn't matter at all if it was even stated anywhere, because, again, it's actively being hidden from investors.  Now, there is legitimacy behind the project, but after reviewing their telegram, seems like i'm not the only one who was dupped into this ICO with KYC compliance.  It's a very nasty/dirty trick the devs are pulling here, and gives much less weight/hold over this project. I'd stop short of saying scam, because they will do a refund after the ICO is done, which is also pretty fucking dirty, displaying more investments then they have already, creating the illusion of bandwagon.  Despite the transparency with the dev team, they are still in here for the ICO $$, i have no doubt this ICO will bring you a return, but again there is a nasty sense of greed and lack of transparency with their ICO.  And those of you knights who would say ""at least they responded and giving you a refund"" this is expected out of a somewhat reputable business who is explicitly soliciting KYC documents after you've invested, obviously they want to go by the book, and by the book we will go.   Personally, if i had known this info prior, i would not have invested in this fucking coin. I'm pretty fucking good about reading everything before i invest, like i actively and heavily examine documents and other users complaints/feedback regarding each coin, but disregarded telegram entirely this time, which is becoming a big source of quick information and feedback.  And ofc i'm a little upset, i feel like i've been fucked and i absolutely hate that feeling. They are withholding my ETH for the next 3-weeks, which equates to a year on the real world markets. Time is money, and this ICO cost me thousands worth of investments, you're fucking with people's lively hoods here ya cunts.

But what I noticed is this:  At the end of every SOLIDUS period and every financial year is a percentage of the company's profit transferred to ETH wallet. The ETH is then redistributed to all token holders according to the percentage of PCL Tokens owned.  Another incentive to invest, I like this  This is a very nice initiative. Eventhough Peculium is not the first one to do that. If I were Peculium, I would have initiated litecoin or bitcoincash or dash as rewarding currency than ETH. It has become too much for ETH now. ETH cannot handle the load and is visible clearly. When possible, projects should go out of ETH and look for more stable options.  I really like that part of the white paper, it’s good for investors to know what that there is a potential dividend pay out/profit sharing initiative which is paid in ETH. It will make more people want to invest in the project and it’s a really exciting concept. As an investor I like this BUT this won't pass the Howey test so it will make this token to be out of the major exchanges forever. I'm fine with that, what I'm not fine with is with companies changing everything after ICO to try to comply with the rules to be listed in exchanges (TrueFlip I'm looking at you).  TLDR: Dividends means this token will be stuck in etherdelta forever. I'm fine with that.  I am not sure what exactly means with HOWEY test. could you please explain it further? Why only ED supports such dividends and not other exchanges? It would be nice to understand this further.  The ""Howey Test"" is a test created by the US Supreme Court for determining whether certain transactions qualify as ""investment contracts."" If so, then under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, those transactions are considered securities and therefore subject to certain disclosure and registration requirements.  Under the Howey Test, a transaction is an investment contract if:      It is an investment of money     There is an expectation of profits from the investment     The investment of money is in a common enterprise     Any profit comes from the efforts of a promoter or third party  Although the Howey Test uses the term ""money,"" later cases have expanded this to include investments of assets other than money. The term ""common enterprise"" isn't precisely defined, and courts have used different interpretations. Most federal courts define a common enterprise as one that is horizontal, meaning that investors pool their money or assets together to invest in a project. However, other courts use different definitions.  The final factor of the Howey Test concerns whether any profit that comes from the investment is largely or wholly outside of the investor's control. If so, then the investment might be a security. If, however, the investor's own actions largely dictate whether an investment will be profitable, then that investment is probably not a security.  All the major exchanges are avoiding any token that might be a security like the plague.

Over my 4 years here i saw thousands of such accounts and if you dont answer clearly whats going on the real newbies will be manipulated to believe this nonsense.  Btw. I never said he is low iq - I only said he seems not to be smart and that people with a iq higher then 65 will see that he makes baseless accusation which you can only describe as fud.

First of all, I want to say thank you to all of you for your support and your enthousiasm! We are working very hard to build the Peculium Project it is a pleasure to see that our work is esteemed. By the way, if you have any suggestion or proposal about the ICO or the project, please don’t hesitate to share your thoughts with us. The feelings of all of you are very important for us.   Today we will talk about the schedule of the ICO: First, the Private Sale will begin the 1 November at 11pm (GMT). From the 1 to the 8 of November, you can register to the private sale and indicate how many tokens you want to buy. Then from 8 to 22 of November 12am, the sales will be open and everyone that has registered could buy tokens. There will be a huge bonus of 50% so don’t miss it!!  We need founds to pay the devs, the hardware and we can’t wait months for this but don’t worry, we will only sell the minimum number of token requisite, so If you miss it, no worries, during the preICO and the ICO everyone who want tokens could buy some.  This will also be the opportunity to send the tokens for the Airdrop campaign and to test our infrastructure. We will be entirely transparent about the process. By the way, all tokens will be frozen until the 25 of January, to avoid speculation. We will deploy the Peculium token contract on the Ethereum blockchain , with the source code on Etherscan (you can also see it on Github).  After this, at the 27 of November, at midday, we will launch a preICO of 5h with a big bonus and a lot of tokens on sale so be ready!  If you can’t be present for the preICO, it’s ok, because the ICO begin the day after and will last until the 19 of January 2018.   This is the end of this diary, thank you for your reading, and sees you soon.   Mohamed Amine, Team Dev Peculium",False

The passion was admirable, by the numerous instant encouragements, expressing at the same time your warm passion to the projects, which will convey our values that are also yours: Liberty, transparency and oh, how outstanding what tomorrow will show you.   We have made a mistake; we had asked you to give your poste number #xxx in the topic, which does not correspond to the acceptance rules that govern Bitcointalk. We are sorry for that.  Peculium introduces savings in the Blockchain to enable us all to benefit from systemic elements of stability, piloted by the artificial intelligence, because data is the only thing that never lies.  Equilibrium, Values and Ethics are the principles of a successful saving, which offers the security of transactions and help construct a brighter future.   To the administrators and managers of bitcointalk, we sincerely apologize for the coincidence. Thereby, in our following new ticket announcement, we will relate to all the rules carefully.  We are available and prepared for any ameliorations; there is always room for improvement.  Airdrop continues… and it only had occupied 30% of reserved share. You are more than 2000 participants cheering the newly born community of Peculium on Slack.  https://join.slack.com/t/peculium/shared_invite/enQtMjU0NDA0ODE2NTY3LWRiN2YxNzgzZTYwM2JhMDRkNjYwMWJkNTMxZGRjYTMyM2Y2MDQwODJjNTM5MTcyMDZhM2Q2MmFjZjNhNGFiYTY   Join Us…     The Secret Challenge continues...",False
