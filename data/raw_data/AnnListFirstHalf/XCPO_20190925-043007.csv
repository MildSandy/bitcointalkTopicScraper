Here I will show how to setup Cazcoin masternode on Ubuntu 16.04 x64 (1Gb Ram).  First of all download latest Cazcoin wallet on your local PC and let it sync. Once it is fully synced then encrypt the wallet. Then  backup your wallet. You need to have 50000.01 CAZ in your wallet.  MAIN WALLET ON YOUR LOCAL PC First of all unlock your wallet, go to Settings > Unlock wallet To setup your Main Cazcoin wallet go to Tools > Debug Console Then type Code: masternode genkey You should see private key of your MN like this 5rMisfma41fmqn5bzaTddJHGa8Rss718ZneDtZ7CyxZxFziq3xS  save the output in a text file. It will be referred as YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY  Then type Code: getnewaddress MN1 Then copy the returned address and send exactly 50000 CAZ to this address.  Wait for 1 confirmation, then go to the debug console and type Code: masternode outputs You should see one line corresponding to the transaction id (tx_id) of your 5000 coins with a digit identifier (digit) like this ""b4dc2cc10d06e622bb8710dc9513ce67d657310eb5ec2a7e2537159e44199dc9"": ""0""  Save these two strings in a text file.  Note that if you get more than 1 line, it's because you made multiple 50000 coins transactions, with the tx_id and digit associated  Next, go to Tools > Open masternode configuration file Open the masternode.conf file and type at the bottom: Code: MN1 your_vps_ip:17350 YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY tx_id digit  Save it and close it.  Note that each line of the masternode.conf file corresponds to one masternode.  Restart your main wallet.  MASTERNODE WALLET ON VPS If you don't have enough RAM, create 2‚Äì4GB of swap memory Code: sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile sudo chmod 600 /swapfile sudo mkswap /swapfile sudo swapon /swapfile echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab  For work with text files we need install nano Code: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nano  If you have a clean system, you need to install several dependencies Code: sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config libssl-dev libevent-dev bsdmainutils libboost-all-dev curl sudo apt install software-properties-common sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev sudo apt-get install libminiupnpc-dev  Then we need download Cazcoin wallet and run cazcoind Code: wget https://github.com/copicogithub1/cazcoin/releases/download/v.1.0.0/cazcoin-1.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz tar -xvzf cazcoin-1.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz rm cazcoin-1.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz mv cazcoin-1.0.0 cazcoin cd cazcoin/bin ./cazcoind  After see ""Warning: Make sure to encrypt your wallet and delete all non-encrypted backups after you verified that wallet works!"" press Enter wait 15 seconds and then press CTRL+C (exit from cazcoind)  Open Cazcoin wallet configuration file Code: nano ~/.cazcoin/cazcoin.conf  and insert Code: rpcuser=youusername rpcpassword=strongpassword rpcallowip=127.0.0.1 listen=1 server=1 daemon=1 masternode=1 masternodeprivkey=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY  When done making changes and entries,  press CTRL+O press ENTER press CTRL+X  Now start your masternode wallet Code: ./cazcoind -daemon  Wait few mins for your wallet to download the blockchain. You can check the progress with the following command : Code: ./cazcoin-cli getblockcount  The block number has to catch up with the latest on the blockexplorer.  STARTING THE MASTERNODE Go back to your MAIN wallet on local PC First of all unlock your wallet and go to the Masternode tab.  You need to wait for at least 6 confirmations in order to start the masternode. Select the line corresponding to the masternode. Click ""Start-alias"". Click YES to confirm After getting the ""Successfully started masternode."" Your masternode should now be switch to status ENABLED.  If you get an error, check the cazcoin.conf on both vps and local wallet as well as the masternode.conf to be sure everything is as said above.  CHECKING THE MASTERNODE STATUS You can check the masternode status by going to the masternode wallet on your VPS and typing: Code: ./cazcoin-cli masternode status  If your masternode is running it should print ""Masternode successfully started"".  If you have a firewall on your VPS, you need to open the 17350 port.",False

The more coins you have the more likely you will ""win the lottery"" to get a stake reward of 3. You must not only keep the coins in the wallet but must also have the wallet running and open for staking to receive a stake reward. Also a node is 50000 xcpo, which receives rewards every few hours, so 450 would expect rewards on the order of weekly.",False

The theme which has no particular use in the real time and to crypto.  I sam has entered the project later as an advisor and changed the entire way of what copico works and put on a goal of Ecommerce platform.I was introduced to the project by the dev.He is from Ghana and I know him from the last two years.  We started working. Changed theme, changed website, burned 75% of the existing supply and ecommerce work also started but investors wanted a better ROI for the masternode.  We have increased the masternode returns immediately after ICO as initial ROI was low. There were three updates before and the current version. (Please note this)  New investors were still not satisfied with the ROI and there is steady competition in the industry. We decided to double the ROI in the JAN18 first week. Platform work is in progress.   Jan 18: Team released first sneak peek of the platform for which the project is working and there was no update regarding the ROI.Dev said he is working on the update but couldn't complete due to his marriage and followed by honeymoon  Feb18: Team released videos on the platform progress and 50% of the platform work was completed. But there was no update. Existing wallets got sync issues and investors were experiencing orphaned blocks. Sam was continuously in follow-up with dev but he can only say what dev says to him.Sam only said to community what dev said.  Community was pissed with the delay and so is the case with sam. The situation is helpless because all the node details and git details are with the dev and sam doesn't have any of them to engage the work to other dev. Remember dev is also honest and he is trying to deliver the update but as there were three updates before all the investors are distributed among different chains and hence wallet was always crashing for dev.  March18 : Sam gave dev a serious warning to either give an update or give node details back.With the support of the community member we have met a developer in India for easy access to sam.But still couldn't proceed as node details and git details aren‚Äôt there not available.  Situation now : Dev is also serious about the project now and he has set aside all other works and only concentrating on update. He got a new compiler and he is sure of delivering a clean update.  Community response: Team is always giving deadlines and not meeting them,yes its true but understand SAM can only say what dev said. Other community member Mr.L who is from Ghana is visiting devs house regularly and monitoring the progress and he said dev is working hard and confident of delivering the update.  Platform is already complete and ready to go, we just need to bring it live. But with wallet problem even if we bring it live it will be vain. So we are just adding some extra features and making it much better.     SAM SOLUTION AND APPEAL TO INVESTORS:  I am the one who is leading the project from the Second week of the ICO and I have more responsibility to the project and I have personally invested a lot for the platform. I want to take this project big as the project earns me my bread.  Sam came to a decision that we cannot take it big with one dev. Existing dev said that still many people are in old chain and after the new update also some may still be in old chain and the problem may occur again in the coming days.While running an ecommerce platform.  Dev has now created a stable chain and a new wallet and it works like dash wallet.We have successfully completed tool chain for cross compilation and wallet will be as stable as ever.  We have created a new coin in the name of CAZ coin and there will be a swap between copico and caz.  Remember the swap is to have a stable chain and be a boon for the ecommerce platform.  Dev has created a stable wallet like dash to facilitate good stability. We shall update the new source code in the old repo shortly and inform you the dates of swap.  What happens to copico after swap?  Copico is my first project and it will remain for ever,we will just let out more details with the caz coin wallet release.  After the caz wallet release we shall start the marketing and proceed for listings in good exchanges.The platform will turnout as a dream one for investors.  Will employ a good marketing team for greater spread.      Tentative plan after CAZ wallet release:  Distribution of caz coins to copico holders and platform launch under CAZ project.  Moving of copico to ERC20 platform with masternodes with fresh and separate goals  Thanks for the support.",False

Secondly,we started journey with copico so we want to continue it with its own goals so making it to erc20 and i dont know who said to you that erc20 cant have masternodes,it can be done,do a little research you will know by yourself and the new copico will be distributed as airdrop to caz coin holders.ERC20 with masternodes is huge and we can do it.",False
