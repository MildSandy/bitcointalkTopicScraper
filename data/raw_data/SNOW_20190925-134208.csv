We never promoted UU, its still in stealth mode. Thats exactly what we did NOT intend. To promote that great technology with our own means (100K) and get poor results. Thats exactly why we will publish and promote the project AFTER the ICO and WITH the means of the ICO. :-) The costs of promoting the system to endusers (Downloader, Publisher, Uploader) are paid by investors of course. Thats why the coin is so cheap at the moment. A system generating 10 Mio a year would not been offered for 10Mio of course. As you can calculate yourself on the website, the system makes 50% interest and is more than profitably with approx. 500K user. Even 200K are enough for BreakEven. We have experience bringing a system alive into that area. Last project bringing to 500K uses was made with a 1 Mio $ budget. So we are very sure to reach same results with 5 Mio $. Sure, we have no experience in handling users and scalabilty in range of >5 mio. Here we have to add external know how. But 500K we can handle in all circumstances (Support, server management, traffic balancing, db-balancing etc. ) and that is good enough to generate >20% interest a year. Calculate yourself on the website of SC. We made the casflow, its easy to understand.    As I said before: TCU masters the art of entertaining hopes and has never fulfilled them.  As I answered before , those allegations are wrong. I disproved every single allegation with gouing deep into the details. You don`t honour that effort and just repeat it again and again,. And than you complain of not beeing noticed?   Since their launch back in 2000. Just follow their history and cross-reference their promises with reality over the years. As a result of this I would check closely the plausibility of any answer you may get since the credibility of TCU is quite a bit flawed (just understating things here). Again and again, you use same methods of defamation. Why?   Wouldn't be surprised if they declare a customer base belonging to the single client (OTR) of TCU is as own or potential one. Even if they aren't really interested there because resonance was weak: http://www.otrforum.com/showthread.php?75107-Transfer-der-Aufnahmen-in-UltraUpload-io That customer has shown, that UU integrates well in existing Storage-strategies and user accept those kinds of downloads. We managed to integrate the encrypting of >1000 files/day with the ftp-api and thats why the test was made for. Of course this test was not for switching endusers, cause their business model makes higher profit with their own storage.   Sometimes I get the impression that TCU is either a complete fraud or living in an alternative reality. I do have same impression from you, but not limited to ""sometimes"". :-) just kidding, I guess I know why you are such an hater. I guess you lost some money with TC shares while the dotcom buble burst 2000.  Just one example: While bragging about their ""Persistent Legal Department"" they mention: ""Sued by major European Pay TV operator Premiere (now Sky) 2004, pending at European court"". Well, what did happen in short? The guy posting here created a platform for distributing TV streams (""CyberSky-TV""), mostly based on P2P. So far, so good. The issues start with the beginning, because if you are not the owner of content you can't distribute it to your likings. It's usually up to the owner to decide this. It's called ""copyright"" and it keeps business possible. Anything else ranges from pure socialism to communism or just China in their worst cloning days. It gets even worse when you start distributing an encrypted signal of pay TV. So far your words are right... your ly starts in next sentence..  That's what was done. Sorry thats wrong! a lie again. :-) CTV never sended a single signal. It was sued BEFORE it was ever online, just for providing the potential risk that someone could upload such pay tv streams. :-) Read about the case, it should be public available. The kernel of accusation was, that the article in ""new york times"" wouzld encourage people to use the system for illegal purpose. But we did not write that article! And we have no influence how a user will use an infrastructure. One can use any infrastructure for legal or illegal purpose. Even the postal office could transport a bomb.  You may also see immediately the conflict here. TCU wants do to business on their own, wants your money and still they don't concede this to others. They just grab what they want, the property of others and try to turn it into revenue, even if they fail all the time. Things maybe would morally be different if this had been some underground piracy group with no interest in making money. But it wasn't. Thank you for unwillingly confirming, that those infrastructure will generate huge profit. :-) And we are cheap. SC now has a pre money value of 10 Mio for an investor. Storj.io (the other great zero knowledge storage network) is just an idea, very complicated and ambitious development goals and collected 2017 60 Mio. (ICO/VC) with an pre money evaluation of 200 Mio $.So having a zero knowledge storage infrastructure seems to have some value? :-) Can you explain me where the difference is in the business model of SC and storj.io?   Obviously TCU/Ciburski lost the legal battle and wasn't allowed to stream Premiere/Sky ever after. Wrong! Its never allowed to stream SKY, if that would have been the question, we would be allowed to go to german supreme court. And even Sky did not say that. It was about promoting illegal use within that article. The question was much more complex. Thats why its now at EUGH Level. (European court level). If someone is intrested in that case, its all public available.    Strangely they still consider this as good advertising for their ""Persistent Legal Department"", even if the opposite is true.  Strange view of things indeed. Proof: http://www.digitalfernsehen.de/Premiere-setzt-sich-vor-Gericht-gegen-Cybersky-TV-durch.news_716008.0.html This sentence is final and after all these years nobody is expecting something here. But TCU is still selling it as a win in opposition to the truth. Why the opposite? all systems are running well , its in use :-) Its only me personally (I am the only person on planet not allowed to offer the system, every other person can !! and does! :-))   Speaking of wins and success: ""Cybersky-TV"" doesn't exist any more. Yes, cause the case was about advertsing, not about the technology. The technology is legal, not forbidden and widely in use :-)  Difficult to understand, so please be more precise. Please read again the court sentences of german supreme court.  ",False

The CEO has already mentioned that they reply to all the share holders via phone or email. So please do that first. Even after that if your issue is not sorted, then post here.

Right.    A search warrant isn't that easy to get. And the search took a whole day.  https://www.onvista.de/news/pta-adhoc-tcu-ag-geschaeftsbetrieb-der-gesellschaft-unterbrochen-aufgrund-durchsuchungsbeschluss-147687523  The accusation is copyright infringements. Among other things that aren't specified yet. This company isn't really good at telling things, they rather stay silent until shit hits the fan and afterwards anyway. As you can see again right now. There's no statement as any other company would deliver the very same day.  But it's not too hard to guess since some tax investigation is still going on (shady business practices playing boomerang) and the BaFin (German equivalent of the SEC) has some issues with how numbers are and were managed in the mandatory annual reports.  On top they don't seem to sell their coins: https://etherscan.io/token/0xd2457bff1b2cd7b24195e0e12c15b39725a5ebe1  Anyone not buying this can be happy right now since the latest police raid is hitting the Achilles' heel of this company pretty hard because it's aiming for the only source of income. Just check the reports, there's absolutely nothing else. And no income means this project is dead. As I explained before: Anything they promised or advertised for their coin and download platform is just running alongside the normal contractual work for a single customer, as long as resources can be spared. This happened before and well: the quality did tell and fail.  Give this a thought as well: The search warrant was issued because TCU (the company here) is involved in a rogue project located on the Seychelles (as explained before) that offers a paid TV recorder. Owners of the copyright (RTL Television) now strike back. The ideas of the Snowden-Coin and UltraUpload are based on expanding copyright violations on a massive scale. When TCU gets raided even now: how is this going to end if they start making money from selling stolen material on an even bigger scale?  Does really anyone believe you can make money by that and since it's somehow encrypted you are able deny any responsibility successfully and the cash just keeps coming in? I just can't see that happen. You'll be raided and stomped into the ground. When catching the big fishes authorities and copyright holders always follow the money.

You had years and you obviously knew about all the problems and still you never managed to participate in the mentioned forum (www.wallstreet-online.de) or did address the most pressing concerns with a few statements. I mean you treat your existing shareholders like shit. Puts you in a bad light. Right now you pretend to care, but when you got the money this is likely to change. I mean in three years there was not a single reaction by you in in the forums where your shareholders were asking themselves what's going on - and here you respond within 24 hours? Wow. Just wow.  Again about communication: A federal institution states that you faked numbers in your reports. As did independent accountants before. And all you do is publishing this statement, without any explanation, commentary or apology? (Talking about this: https://www.pressetext.com/news/1528111740471 - It's basically saying that TCU added 412.000 Euros unrightfully to their balance sheets and by doing so they faked their financial health. Quite a serious accusation for a company that's traded at the stock market and now tries again to acquire money from investors.) Lies and fakes everywhere. It's getting back to you eventually.  Also things were announced and never released. Any company with dignity would have officially cancelled things at some point while giving a reasonable explanation about the circumstances. Especially when knowing that share holders are still discussing it. Not so much TCU. There was just silence. You guys are utterly bad at communication and even worse at admitting mistakes or failures.

Interesting point is that asking valid questions plus having arguments about pressing concerns is ""spamming"" now? Tells me a lot about you and how thin-skinned you react to critics. Especially while referring to the own product as ""great technology"". As great as the ""TeleFairy"" perhaps - ""the worldwide unique TV-Ad-Blocker and 8 other brilliant devices in one""? Wasn't so brilliant at all, was it? If anyone is interested how a dead product looks like: http://www.telefairy.com/ - made by TCU. Sales were inexistent, mostly because this product is just bad. Also there were three generations of this thing. They all failed miserably and they obviously didn't get better because sales even got worse with each iteration.

The way YOU talk to me, is the way I talk to you. I don`t like to talk with anonymous accounts, haters or people not intrested in our work, only intrested to disrespect others or spread lies to grab some shares cheaper. All real investors can call us at any time (and use that option daily) we have a great nearly 24/7 support for real investors or customers. Have you ever called us or written with a non anonymous account? linkedin, xing, facebook, wherever? No, you did not!. So your kind of communication is poor..not mine.     You had years and you obviously knew about all the problems and still you never managed to participate in the mentioned forum (www.wallstreet-online.de) or did address the most pressing concerns with a few statements. I mean you treat your existing shareholders like shit.  by the way. Its not allowed to answer questions in wallstreet online for an CEO. I tried so years ago and was blocked.   Puts you in a bad light. Right now you pretend to care, but when you got the money this is likely to change. I mean in three years there was not a single reaction by you in in the forums where your shareholders were asking themselves what's going on - and here you respond within 24 hours? Wow. Just wow. See above. I was blocked by wallstreet online. Years ago, we had an investor forum to answer questions, but it was not used only spammed, so we closed it. We have a facebook-Site, did you ever ask a question here? We have email. when did you send a question, which was unanswered? never! Same for phone. Why do we have best relationships to all shareholders, except you ""Apfelbonusmeile/AppleExtraMile""?    A federal government states that you faked numbers in your reports. Untrue. Years ago, our lawyer AND the auditor forced (!) us to post the damage claim into the balance. Otherwise we would hide an important claim value. Now another supervisory auditor said the opposite, so we had to correct that ! Its far beyond ""Fake"". BTW: 4 different independent auditors over 12 years had a different legal opinion than this single supervisor auditor.  And all you do is publishing this statement, without any explanation, commentary or apology? (Talking about this: https://www.pressetext.com/news/1528111740471 - It's basically saying that TCU added 412.000 Euros unrightfully to their balance sheets and by doing so they faked their financial health. Quite a serious accusation for a company that's traded at the stock market and now tries again to acquire money from investors.) Its forbidden by law to add our legal opinion. The text message for that adhoc message was written by Bafin. Not only the meaning, we had to publish it WORD by WORD exactly like Bafin told us. We had a complete other different legal opinion. Like the 5 auditors of us as well. Its forbidden by Bafin to add our legal opinion. We were forced to tell it exactly as Bafin gave us the message ! We had to say, that this IS OUR legal opinion, which it was never. I can send you the emails and letters between us and Bafin. Its quite simple: Our damage claim against RTL Broadcaster was about a million €. So bringing in 400K into the balance is fair treatment against shareholders. And that was not even our idea! The 2015 auditor told us, we have to! Otherwise we would hide an important fact (a benefit) and shareholders can claim they wouldn`t have sold a share knowing about that claim. As far as I remember that claim also meant to pay profit taxes as well in that given year ( I am not sure, I guess it was 2005, when we have succeded against RTL at the BGH and started to prepare the damage claim battle)    Also things were announced and never released. Wrong! if we announce something, we also release...   Any company with dignity would have officially cancelled things at some point while giving a reasonable explanation about the circumstances. We cancelled a lot in our long history. The average of vc-market or innovations of big companies (new products) has a failure rate 9/10. Our failure rate in new products is approximatly 3/10. Most products failed due to a lack of marketing budget due to failed capital increases. No new capital (support by shareholders)->no marketing budget-> even a top product can fail. As you know, our capital was after IPO the same as before, due to ""dotcom"" crash 2000. Other companys with ""professional"" CEOs simply would close such a company (in 2000 all our competitors did so, metabox etc.) . We did not. We stick to our company.   Especially when knowing that share holders are still discussing it. Not so much TCU. There was just silence. see above. I explained why we do not use Wallstreet online for chats. Most of the chats are asking for unpublished future plans. To talk about before an adhoc message is also forbidden by law. And in former times we did a lot of adhoc messages to keep shareholders up2date. This ended as Bafin did also forbid that and named it ""abuse of adhoc message system"". Yes you are right. Since then our adhocs are not as often than before.   You guys are utterly bad at communication and even worse at admitting mistakes or failures.  See above. With respectful non anonymous shareholders we have very good relationship. And we admit failures very often. It was a failure to trust the legal system in germany, to trust in independent judges etc. we learned our lessions, as well as Berry Diller did with aero.tv in the states :-))) when it comes to disruptive game changing media technology, don`t trust the government... it depends on that industry..the broadcasters are very powerful..   Interesting point is that asking valid questions plus having arguments about pressing concerns is ""spamming"" now? repeating the same wrong facts over and over is spamming. First question is always ok. Your ""questions"" are not new. They are all answered hundred times in wallstreet forum by real investors. If you still think we are gready ,its your personal opinion and ok. Repeating it over and over is spamming. In this forum you name yourself an Investor, but in Wallstreet online everybody can read that you don`t have a single share. BTW: Why are you such a hater? dissapointed shareholder? when did you invest? 2000?    Tells me a lot about you and how thin-skinned you react to critics. I answered all your questions. Yes, if you name me gready, its personal. I could easily show you, that salary is probaly the lowest of all CEOs at regular market. I know, you know the facts.    Especially while referring to the own product as ""great technology"". Cause it is. I give you an example: as we developed live peer to peer tv transmission, this great innovation was honoured in an  ""the new york times"" article as ""great product"". German newspaper (Bertelsman group?) named it ""impossible"". We did it. And more than that. We were a year ago one of 2 companies worldwide supportingVC9 in HTML5 . The other one was backed up by US Venture capital with lots of mio. of dollars. Is it my fault, that germany has much harder access to capital? That high tech is better honoured in US? or Compare the german ICO market with the US ICO market. Overregulated!!    As great as the ""TeleFairy"" perhaps - ""the worldwide unique TV-Ad-Blocker and 8 other brilliant devices in one""? As we introduced the Telefairy v1 2000 this was the right product for the right time.We kept our promise to bring that product to market. But the market has changed, satellite receivers are not as common as 15 years ago. Our product  is now more suitable for an app. As soon as Samsung or other gatekeepers allow our app in their market, things can change...TV blocker are not a technical product anymore, its a strategic decision. (see apples announcement of the ""Ad free"" TV, did it ever came to market? :-)  TV landscape has changed in the meantime and over the years we were illegally stopped.    Wasn't so brilliant at all, was it? If anyone is interested how a dead product looks like: http://www.telefairy.com/ - made by TCU. Again wrong. Its working quite well. Me and my kids do not consume advertising. I use the box on all of my TVs :-) But your are right, sales are so low (we went on market without a marketing budget), we don`t develop on it anymore (with small exemptions) since 2017, when we started UltraUpload.io development.     Look at their history, look at their products and there may be doubt. With UltraUpload-ICO means we finally have a proper marketing budget. We learned our lessions. Thats why we trust in clever offshore investors and not in slow german market.. ask yourself why ""our Facebook"" failed (""Wer kennt wen"", by the way coded by a former TC developer)  and not the US-facebook.",False

This was happening ten or even more years ago. Who cares? The actual greed is real, the numbers are bad, right here and right now. The past doesn't help since there is no positive effect coming from there.  2. So they aren't your developers and obviously can't be count into the project of UltraUpload or the ""Snowden-Coin"". Did you still do that? Lies again? Since the customer is on the Seychelles this must be a nightmare to pay people in Germany while evading law violations. Taxes, social insurance contribution and stuff in general. Strange construct. Why aren't you paid for the project accordingly to finance all assets as needed? Must be quite a bad deal. And since it's your only customer and your very existence depends on this project it seems apparent that someone has leverage on you. This makes you weak.  3. Why can't you create a report where anyone interested is able figure out where money comes from and where exactly it goes to? And what additional things are happening at your place, even if the financing is done by someone else? Or did you just made that up to not look too bad?  I mean: Dude, your reputation for transparency is as bad as it gets...   Quote  Secondly: You won't get a good programmer for that salary. Here you are right and at least now, you should recognize, that your math is wrong. See above (2./3.) for the reason. Quote Thirdly: TCU is in desperate need of money. as said before, we invested a lot in 2017/18 into UltraUpload.io and so even forego revenues ..is that desperate? You can read in the annual report, that our cash reserves are well filled and increasing... no problems here, at least much more cash reserves than most startups..We are public listed company so all we do is fully transparent, but even you got all data, you don`t read the numbers correctly..

Solche Apps müssen für jeden TV-Hersteller einzeln entwickelt werden, daher haben wir mit dem Marktführer begonnen, der ca. 40% des Marktes abdeckt. Diese App wird Ihnen Herr Ciburski heute noch auf dem Fernseher dort vorstellen, damit Sie sich einen Eindruck davon machen können, wie einfach der Werbeblocker in der Benutzung ist. Die App ist bereits marktreif, wir möchten aber noch die sehr attraktive ""Personal-TV"" Funktion von der Fernsehfee zum Start anbieten. Weitere Fernsehfee-Features werden wir dann per Update nachliefern. Es kann durchaus sein, daß wir noch in 2015 die App vorstellen.  Es besteht also die Chance, daß wir einen kostenlosen TV-Werbeblocker anbieten, den 40% der hochattraktiven Zielgruppe der Smart-TV User verwenden. Das wäre ein Alptraum für RTL und ein Traum für unseren Börsenkurs. Der Nettoumsatz, den jede App pro Jahr und Haushalt vernichtet liegt bei mindestens 110 Euro, eher beim Doppelten, da die Zielgruppe besonders umkämpft ist. Eine Riesenchance vor der TC nun steht und wir können den Marktstart kaum abwarten.  -> http://telecontrol.de/hv-2015.html  (In general you are a mastermind of entertaining hopes. Anyone can see just by digging a bit and finding out what happened after almost any announcement of you company...)  In short: at the End of 2015 you did announce an APP, the next bing thing. As part of your ""TeleFairy""-Project. You said that the product would be ready for the market. Exactly your words. You may even release it in 2015. And you were eager to start it. Now it's 2018 and nobody has ever heard again from that thing. So we caught you lying.

Easy to explain. The patents rights were special. They were estimated to 17 Mio. € by two independent experts. We brought that into the company as a non cash contribution during foundation of the company. And cause I learned arguing with you is like a chessgame: your next move will be ""this patent was worthless, how can you do that? :-)"" So be sure, the value of that patent was also checked by tax authoritis in a 6 year legal battle we have won! The result of that battle was, that they did not get back claimed 600k, but vice versa we got that 600K from tax authority. Thats why that immaterail value was from the beginning in the balance. If you have doubts that self developed software can never be activated in a balance, please ask any tax expert. There are some exceptions however, but as you know german tax law is complicated. The avaerage rule is ""impossible"" cause otherwise any software company would claim highly annual depreciations and reduce profit tax.   Wrong! if we announce something, we also release... Really? Lets do a little reality-check: You had doubts that we did not release the TV app? we did. The Samsung tv  blocking app is ready and working. Samsung Germany was excited, but Korean Headquarter stopped the public availability. Some big deal behind the scene was made with that app. No idea, what exactly happend. Maybe a deal between Samsung and broadcasters like ""we don`t do that, so we expect this"".. Other gatekeepers like Philips or LG said from the beginning of negotiations, ""no we can`t do that"", we need a good relationship with broadcasters for a lot of other projects. Samsung also saw legal risks, cause they have market leader position and such an app could endager the future of the dual system of german/intl. TV. In the BGH judgement you can read ""as long as the existence of private broadcasting is not endagered"". We will never know the true reasons however, fact is, we still have no OK or NO from samsung since 2 years. As Imentioned before,also Apple TV announced ""Ad blocking"" as the next big thing in TV industry and never released a model..Our app is currently only running on tizen and would not endager private broadcasters, but as said before, the true reasons for the reaction of samsung is unclear. Fact is, we realized the product.You can install that app with an USB stick manually in your TV, but this is quite complex.   (In general you are a mastermind of entertaining hopes. Anyone can see just by digging a bit and finding out what happened after almost any announcement of you company...) As you might notice, no other company realized a tv ad blocking system. Its a difficult market. We had the chance , we were member of samsung developer application infrastructure, all we need is a strategic decision from samsung.   So we caught you lying. See above. again you were wrong. We did not ly. Again every single word in our adhoc was true. Please ask first and avoid your wrong conclusions.   In the German message board there was a big fuzz about that product, those who had still hope that you may get something right were constantly posting about it. This went on for months. No way you could have missed this, especially since you admitted here that you are monitoring that forum. Since it's the largest community in Germany to discuss the stock market you would be stupid not to. Again, that forum is of no interest for me, cause as CEO I amnot allowed to post there andI am blocked.

Its a waste of time to discuss with you, cause you have other motivatiuons than to be informed. If you want to talk with us, we have 4 support channels, facebook, email, phone, messanger...you don`t use any of them, cause you want to stay anonymous. With your false allegations you spread (against yous better knowing) and the crimes you did, its maybe a good decision.   Simple question: Since you knew about the discussions in that forum for so long and all the open questions as well: Why didn't you just release some Ad Hoc / newsletter / whatever_you_want_to_call_it that was addressing these issues? I mean communication is a way of maintaining a relationship. Especially after being a disappointment for so many shareholders so many times as you were and are. There are ways for sure. You went silent for months and even years. And don't tell me that you have those annual reports. They're just your damn duty and even that you don't get right. See above..if you have questions, why not grab a phone. You can call as ""Mister X"", not saying you are Apfelbonusmeile. You can surpress your phone number. Dont play a role, of that poor uninformed shareholder. Again, your intentions are obvious. And as said before, Bafin (financial regulation) told us to reduce the number of adhocs and not to abuse the adhoc system as an advertsing tool.   Next question: You said you weren't allowed to take part on that discussion board. But why are other CEOs able and allowed to participate there? Maybe they pay for it. Again, you can post your questions here: https://www.facebook.com/tcuag/ or by email or phone.     This one seems to be quite active. But also his company seems to be doing well. You are right.

""UltraUpload"" was launched last year and has been online ever since.  Not much can be found. There's literally nothing going on. As an investor for a download platform that's almost online for a year you would expect something more compelling, wouldn't you?  As I said before: TCU masters the art of entertaining hopes and has never fulfilled them. Since their launch back in 2000. Just follow their history and cross-reference their promises with reality over the years. As a result of this I would check closely the plausibility of any answer you may get since the credibility of TCU is quite a bit flawed (just understating things here).  Wouldn't be surprised if they declare a customer base belonging to the single client (OTR) of TCU is as own or potential one. Even if they aren't really interested there because resonance was weak: http://www.otrforum.com/showthread.php?75107-Transfer-der-Aufnahmen-in-UltraUpload-io  Sometimes I get the impression that TCU is either a complete fraud or living in an alternative reality.  Just one example: While bragging about their ""Persistent Legal Department"" they mention: ""Sued by major European Pay TV operator Premiere (now Sky) 2004, pending at European court"".  Well, what did happen in short? The guy posting here created a platform for distributing TV streams (""CyberSky-TV""), mostly based on P2P. So far, so good. The issues start with the beginning, because if you are not the owner of content you can't distribute it to your likings. It's usually up to the owner to decide this. It's called ""copyright"" and it keeps business possible. Anything else ranges from pure socialism to communism or just China in their worst cloning days.  It gets even worse when you start distributing an encrypted signal of pay TV. That's what was done. Any sane mind will tell you that this is a bad idea and just illegal. Because if it wouldn't be they can close business instantly.  You may also see immediately the conflict here. TCU wants do to business on their own, wants your money and still they don't concede this to others. They just grab what they want, the property of others and try to turn it into revenue, even if they fail all the time. Things maybe would morally be different if this had been some underground piracy group with no interest in making money. But it wasn't.  Obviously TCU/Ciburski lost the legal battle and wasn't allowed to stream Premiere/Sky ever after. Strangely they still consider this as good advertising for their ""Persistent Legal Department"", even if the opposite is true. Strange view of things indeed. Proof: http://www.digitalfernsehen.de/Premiere-setzt-sich-vor-Gericht-gegen-Cybersky-TV-durch.news_716008.0.html This sentence is final and after all these years nobody is expecting something here. But TCU is still selling it as a win in opposition to the truth.  Speaking of wins and success: ""Cybersky-TV"" doesn't exist any more.  So you may discover part by part what you are dealing with here.",False

It`s more than a protoytp, cause its fully functional and performance can be tested by potential customers. UI and Integration into Apps (IOS, Android) is for later Development (frontend). Current Priority is smooth Integration of new hoster, hostermanagement, security tests (privacy, hacking schemes) , so a lot of background progress last half year. It was never promoted to endusers. But to some potential publishers. So they could test the inteaction with the system for future websites. For example, we added the new feature of hosting a complete website anonymously on the infrastructure. So the publisher website itself is hosted like a file and can link to other files (content). Very important feature ,not even mentioned in current feature list.   Quote Moving the ultraupload service to the blockchain seems like an interesting idea. But do you have any experience with such a project? What are your companies' skills in the blockchain field? Do you have any references? Only a few companies really have, when it comes to high performance/scalability. Thats why 1/3 of the budget goes into external blockchain development. We are P2P experts , but not BC experts. Thats why we use external know how here. They will decide if a standard solution like BigchainDB will be used or an adoption or if we need an own development. Currently a lot of projects are working on high performing DLTs (in fact we will not use a BC, the use of the word is for better understanding, in fact we wiull move DBs into an DLT). That is part of the development AFTER the ICO. Nevertheless 1/3 of ICO means is for market introduction of UU for enduser (Downloader, publisher). Even without BC one can generate same revenues like MegaUpload, with the downsize of beeing forced to delete a link from time to time (btw: each link can be replaced by another). After BC deletion is impossible. BC development  is only to remove vulnerability by government actions (whistleblower level) and not a important precondition to geneate revenues.

This company has an impressive history of failing. They're not some new and fancy startup. »TC Unterhaltungselektronik« actually was brought to the German Stock Market in the year 2000 and has been unsuccessfully ever after. Initially investors paid about 15 Euros for a share, now they're down to 0.8 Euros. Do the math and guess what this means for the value of this company and their success in all the time. Correct: there's none.  They like to not give any information at all to their shareholders. Thus the word »fraud« is something TCU heard quite a bit from them.  Being invested here in any way is likely not going to end well for the investor. Nearly everybody has lost money so far.  Also it's quite interesting how they tick. They developed a box called »Fernsehfee« or »TeleFairy« that was supposed to rid of advertising in TV. Well, it was a disaster. That thing was a mess and sales were inexistent. And even the few customers complained a lot, until the forum where support was supposed to happen was finally shut down. Great job!  But that's only half the story. The other part is, that TCU has only one customer. That's right. A company traded at the German Stock Market only has one customer, a single source of income. Even worse: that source is legally located on the Seychelles, making it an obvious shell corporation. And if this contract is canceled TCU goes into instant bankruptcy. Living on the edge newly defined. Bye bye Coins!  But it's getting better: this customer they are developing software for is »OTR«, alias »Online TV Recorder«, recording stuff from TV obviously. And they're selling that service to make money. Legally this is a gray area. Taking stuff from TV stations you have not licensed to sell seems tricky, since they paid for that content somehow and can decide who's allowed to do what with it. Even worse: we remember that TCU developed something, albeit not working very well, to get rid of advertising and denying sources of income for the TV stations. The idea counts here. Like a parasite they always try to harvest money at the disadvantage of others. Isn't there a saying like »don't bite the hand that's feeding you«?  So TCU earns money from TV stations by recording and selling their stuff, half legally at best, and at the same they release something to wipe advertising. Nice move! Making not so much friends with those on which tolerance your very existence depends upon.  It's also worth mentioning that they lost a legal battle with a large TV network (RTL) they sued in the last possible instance. Before that they were bragging about how many millions of Euros the are going to squeeze out of that legal battle. Even when it went on for years without success and any amateur could foresee that this wasn't going to end well for TCU because they were desperately lacking arguments.  Also they have ongoing legal battles with German tax authorities since they seem to have tried to evade payments illegally. And they faked numbers in their annual reports they are obliged to publish since they are publicly traded. For that misdeed an agency called BaFin (»Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht«) is on their heels. So we've got two German agencies that are legally challenging this company. And since TCU is always really low on money and the punishment could be severe this is also a high risk of bankruptcy.  By checking the annual reports (available on telecontrol.de) you'll notice that at least 30% or more likely 50% of the annual total turnover of the company is used to pay the two members of the board. That's just insane. And telling you what this is all about. Two greedy persons grabbing all the money they can get. Probably your money, if you buy the coin.  They're also known for lying. All the time. Even now. In the papers for the ICO they're telling you that TCU has got >10 developers. Well, in the last financial report issued they were talking about six people. On the quite recently reworked web page they've got seven developers. That's still quite a bit less than >10. So again: a lie. TCU likes to exaggerate. They did this for years and have gotten nowhere.  Also these developers aren't working full time on the project. Even the last project I mentioned earlier (»TeleFairy«) was designed and developed during spare time since the only customer demands most resources. It was a catastrophic failure and just a fatally bad product.   They tried to raise money at the capital markets by issuing new shares. This failed miserably. Nobody was willing to give them money since they burned all the cash, weren't able to show a single product that's working and never did treat shareholders fairly. Also the stock is trades poorly in general, there's just not enough volume since almost everybody has given up on this fraud.  So here we go now with their »Snowden-Coin«. Their alternative. The name alone is an insult. Snowden believes in something, even if you don't approve his actions or beliefs, and he definitely didn't leak information for money. The platform TCU has in mind is just about piracy and grabbing money. Cheap junk with a big name.  Let's take some illegal content, encrypt it and sell the stuff – that's the idea. We don't own any of that data, we don't even care about it, we are just here to make money when something is downloaded. And it can't be deleted, because we are so clever and this is how blockchains work.  Well. Think further.  I believe that they are going to get into trouble as soon as the first items with child pornography start to appear or just the copyright holders are moving. Just ask Kim Dotcom about them. Even if the files can't be taken down by the system the authorities will definitely target the company behind it. That's TCU. And it's questionable how long this network will last if TCU is gone. Without that the coins will be worthless.  Also there's not much transparency in what TCU is doing. I would only trust things that are open source. But they can't do that because this is all about them making money. So they need an infrastructure they can control. But how to know that not already someone else is with in the boat since you cant check the code? Law enforcement for example.  And what's going to happen with the value of the coin if TCU has been stripped of all computers by a search warrant? I mean they're located in Germany and not some country in the Third World where nobody cares. It's quite easy to figure out who's running the show. And even if their megalomaniacal believe is that they can evade the law: in reality they've always lost their legal battles.  Same concerns exist with bankruptcy. Remember: only one customer is providing all the money to keep this company running and also drains most of the resources. TCU is still beeing constantly low on money, cash grabbing is happening by the board, employees are paid poorly. If TCU goes down so does the whole project. And they are already on the edge at several positions.  I'm not seeing any success here. Only greedy folks with a questionable attitude starting one last attempt to join a hype train with coins and lots of risk for investors.  Do your due diligence. I'm only covering parts of the story here.",False

We know you guy very well from the german share board wallstreet online. Your posts are however a mixture of 50% truth but with false conclusions and 50% untruth..., let me show were you are wrong:     You ""forgot"" to mention, that we made our IPO in the middle of the ""dotcom"" bubble burst 2000. three other IPOs canceled their IPO that day, we not! You ""forgot"" to mention, that the main drop of the share price was in the first week of IPO due to general drop down of technology values those days.     They like to not give any information at all to their shareholders. Thus the word »fraud« is something TCU heard quite a bit from them. We are located in the strongest regulation area of the world: GERMANY . We give regular updates to our shareholders, we anser questions to our shareholder even midnight on phone, we have annual meetings, but we never saw you there ?!?! Of course, we don`t give out ""insider information"" to you, no matter how often you ask ;-) if you want to buy our shares cheaper, keep on bashing.. ;-)   Being invested here in any way is likely not going to end well for the investor. Nearly everybody has lost money so far. That is also untrue: Share profit 2014->2015  128% shareprofit 2012->2013  256% .. however it depends on the time you bought the shares.. don`t blame us for your bad timing. TC is the most volatile share in german market cause very little liquidity, cause long term shareholder keep their shares over decades. From time to time we see some share-hoopers, making fast money on speculations to the best or to the worse (like you) and for some of them it works, if not for you, don`t blame us.   Also it's quite interesting how they tick. They developed a box called »Fernsehfee« or »TeleFairy« that was supposed to rid of advertising in TV. Well, it was a disaster. That thing was a mess and sales were inexistent. And even the few customers complained a lot, until the forum where support was supposed to happen was finally shut down. Great job! Here you also ""forgot"" to mention, that this adlocker was HUGE success in 2000 (it was in the news everywhere and sales request was HUGE), but german major broadcaster managed to prevent market introduction over decades. You ""forgot"" to mention, that it took 14 years to be allowed going on market..what do you think, this means for market succes.. But however, like with our IPO , we kept, what we promised and delivered the product.  But that's only half the story. The other part is, that TCU has only one customer. That's right. A company traded at the German Stock Market only has one customer, a single source of income. Even worse: that source is legally located on the Seychelles, making it an obvious shell corporation. And if this contract is canceled TCU goes into instant bankruptcy. Living on the edge newly defined. Bye bye Coins! Thats more true, than the words before, but you again ""forgot"", why we made that software-creating-contract. Just to survive until we got damage claims from german broadcasters, which prevented illegally our market introduction of first tv ad blocker. And the risk to cancel that contract is lower, than you might think. We are running all their websites since 15 years, its our software and even basic technologies is ours. We licensed for example the unique Peer to peer realtime tv distribution software to that customer.   But it's getting better: this customer they are developing software for is »OTR«, alias »Online TV Recorder«, recording stuff from TV obviously. And they're selling that service to make money. Legally this is a gray area. Taking stuff from TV stations you have not licensed to sell seems tricky, since they paid for that content somehow and can decide who's allowed to do what with it. Even worse: we remember that TCU developed something, albeit not working very well, to get rid of advertising and denying sources of income for the TV stations. The idea counts here. Like a parasite they always try to harvest money at the disadvantage of others. Isn't there a saying like »don't bite the hand that's feeding you«? We cannot confirm your speculation, but in germany as well as in switzerland those services are legal. See BGH (supreme court) speaking 2014. In US Berry Diller startet similar services (Aero TV) but it turned out to be illegal in US. For example there is a legal german service www.save.tv public available doing similar private recordings. So its untrue to name it ""gray area"".   So TCU earns money from TV stations by recording and selling their stuff, half legally at best, and at the same they release something to wipe advertising. Nice move! Making not so much friends with those on which tolerance your very existence depends upon. Are you located in media industries and unhappy about those services? Thank you for underlining our reputation doing UltraUpload.io. Yes, we DO NOT cover interest of big media companys. We ae on the other side. Side of ""free speech"" and supporting customer interst of private copy. We as customers pay with evey single bit of hardware for that right !   It's also worth mentioning that they lost a legal battle with a large TV network (RTL) they sued in the last possible instance. Before that they were bragging about how many millions of Euros the are going to squeeze out of that legal battle. Even when it went on for years without success and any amateur could foresee that this wasn't going to end well for TCU because they were desperately lacking arguments. ?? we succeeded against RTL at the highest german court BGH (similar to US supreme court) wrong facts?   Also they have ongoing legal battles with German tax authorities since they seem to have tried to evade payments illegally. And they faked numbers in their annual reports they are obliged to publish since they are publicly traded. For that misdeed an agency called BaFin (»Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht«) is on their heels. So we've got two German agencies that are legally challenging this company. And since TCU is always really low on money and the punishment could be severe this is also a high risk of bankruptcy. No one is on our heels :-) You ""forgot"" to mention that we again succeded in the legal battle against tax authority at our first instance. We are in constant contact with ""BaFin"", even for the ICO. Nice bashing.   By checking the annual reports (available on telecontrol.de) you'll notice that at least 30% or more likely 50% of the annual total turnover of the company is used to pay the two members of the board. That's just insane. And telling you what this is all about. Two greedy persons grabbing all the money they can get. Probably your money, if you buy the coin. Sorry but this is completly wrong. Our salary is public (and unchanged for 18 years!! ), our revenues too. So its simple math were you are wrong :-)  And you ""forgot"" to mention, that we made a complete salary waiver for several years, when the company was low on cash. We supported our company with private means. So we are gready?   They're also known for lying. All the time. Even now. In the papers for the ICO they're telling you that TCU has got >10 developers.

Also these developers aren't working full time on the project. Even the last project I mentioned earlier (»TeleFairy«) was designed and developed during spare time since the only customer demands most resources. It was a catastrophic failure and just a fatally bad product.  :-)) So, if we can develop such a great product in our space time , we are REALLY GOOD ;-) just check out www.telefairy.com to see, what this app can do for you...Is there any other TV Adblocker on market?     They tried to raise money at the capital markets by issuing new shares. This failed miserably. Nobody was willing to give them money since they burned all the cash, weren't able to show a single product that's working and never did treat shareholders fairly. Also the stock is trades poorly in general, there's just not enough volume since almost everybody has given up on this fraud. ?? if anybody would have given up, there would be HUGE Volume.. Do you see the contradiction? there is low volume cause only share hoppers ae trading.. real investors keep the shares since years and we support real investors quite very well   So here we go now with their »Snowden-Coin«. Their alternative. The name alone is an insult. Snowden believes in something, even if you don't approve his actions or beliefs, and he definitely didn't leak information for money. The platform TCU has in mind is just about piracy and grabbing money. Cheap junk with a big name. Cheap junk? did you forget the revenue of the legal service ""MegaUpload""? 150Mio? And a ""wikileaks for all"" is just that, Assange and Snowden are fighting for.   Let's take some illegal content, encrypt it and sell the stuff – that's the idea. We don't own any of that data, we don't even care about it, we are just here to make money when something is downloaded. And it can't be deleted, because we are so clever and this is how blockchains work. :-) so now I am sure, you are from media industries..:-) sorry again, we fight not for your ""Big money""..  I believe that they are going to get into trouble as soon as the first items with child pornography start to appear or just the copyright holders are moving. Just ask Kim Dotcom about them. Even if the files can't be taken down by the system the authorities will definitely target the company behind it. That's TCU. And it's questionable how long this network will last if TCU is gone. Without that the coins will be worthless. you didn`t understand the system. Even TC is gone, the coin will survive and even the blockchain.. Can you stop bitcoin cause its used for illegal payments?   Also there's not much transparency in what TCU is doing. I would only trust things that are open source. But they can't do that because this is all about them making money. So they need an infrastructure they can control. But how to know that not already someone else is with in the boat since you cant check the code? Law enforcement for example. Thank you for refering about our history. You did unwillingly a lot for our reputation and made clear on which side of the ""battle"" we stood and stand for ever. So the risk, that our code has backdoors is low. And since a customer only needs a (faked) email adress, his IP is only visible to a hoster, that hoster doenst know anything about the content an even a given chunk can be used for legal or illegal content, customers here are much savy than in bitcoin itself.   And what's going to happen with the value of the coin if TCU has been stripped of all computers by a search warrant? I mean they're located in Germany and not some country in the Third World where nobody cares. It's quite easy to figure out who's running the show. And even if their megalomaniacal believe is that they can evade the law: in reality they've always lost their legal battles. :-) again untrue. We always have won our battles... I like your style of making wrong conclusions from right facts or  ""forgetting"" to mention.. you don`t need to ly. And if the domain is the target, we have already a solution, again unstoppable ;-)    Same concerns exist with bankruptcy. Remember: only one customer is providing all the money to keep this company running and also drains most of the resources. TCU is still beeing constantly low on money, cash grabbing is happening by the board, employees are paid poorly. If TCU goes down so does the whole project. And they are already on the edge at several positions. Didn´t you see coin distribution? Our budget is covered for years. And if we would want to ""pump and dump"", we would sale our coins immediatly in a rush like others do and did. No, we sell our coins over 3 years, cause we expect increasing value of coins later, when the blockchain is running. You are talking now over 18 years about our ""bankruptcy"" but we never did?!?!. We saw a lot of competitors going down next to us, with better cash support from big VC partners. But we survived and I think, we proofed that we stick to our company, which we own for over 50% and is our existence for us and our familys and a lot fun to work hard for it evey day.     I'm not seeing any success here. Only greedy folks with a questionable attitude starting one last attempt to join a hype train with coins and lots of risk for investors. Do your due diligence.

This is how the company is doing:  https://abload.de/img/screenshot_20180910_2b9emp.png  Umsatz = overall turnover Gewinn = profit (or loss)  https://abload.de/img/screenshot_20180910_2nhiv6.png  Gehälter = salary of employees (six at that time) Vorstandsbezüge = salery for the two board members / management  Numbers are for the first half of 2018. They are official and can be found here: http://www.telecontrol.de/downloads/hj12018.pdf  You may learn at least three things here:  Firstly: The management is greedy. Check on older reports and you'll find the same picture. They take away 300.000 Euros away every year. Plus >20.000 for a car. Look at the numbers this company is generating and probably you decide: that's preposterous.  Secondly: Check on what those poor six employees are earning. I mean this is Germany. Do the math how much they get annually. It's a joke. You won't get a good programmer for that salary. Or they'll leave you at first chance.  Thirdly: TCU is in desperate need of money. Thus they'll tell you anything. Stories of success and revenue. Well, they did this before, over and over again, since the beginning. And it never went well for any investor.  These are just facts & plain numbers. And they're not much to be positive about.",False

Again you have ""forgotten"" the 100% and 50% salary waiver of the CEOs in the past over years. 2. some of the developers are paid directly from the customer 3. Some of the salarys are in other accounts (external costs) / freelancers / sending bills -> costs   Secondly: You won't get a good programmer for that salary. Here you are right and at least now, you should recognize, that your math is wrong. See above (2./3.) for the reason.   Thirdly: TCU is in desperate need of money. as said before, we invested a lot in 2017/18 into UltraUpload.io and so even forego revenues ..is that desperate? You can read in the annual report, that our cash reserves are well filled and increasing... no problems here, at least much more cash reserves than most startups..We are public listed company so all we do is fully transparent, but even you got all data, you don`t read the numbers correctly..",False
