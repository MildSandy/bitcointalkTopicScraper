We haven’t discussed Faceter with you recently, but it’s all for good reason. We have come a long way in terms of creating a new product, the functionality of which hasn’t been developed before. This is a very time-consuming process that requires full commitment and the use of all possible resources. But now we have something we can’t wait to share with you! But first we will answer perhaps your most popular question:  What’s up with the Faceter App? Apple users can go to the App Store and download the Faceter application right now. This version of the application will allow to test all of the features of Faceter app. Later, this opportunity will appear also for Android users.  For those of you who just want to see how the application works without downloading it, we have prepared a short video.  In this video you can see how convenient the application is, as well as how easy it is to work with video stream and archives in the Faceter application. You can easily switch between dates and cameras, select the desired video segments and save or send it. You can also go to full-screen mode or zoom in on any frame. As you may know, we’ve also launched a beta test and you can join testing here.  Development Those who have been with us for a long time will probably remember that initially, in the MVP, all the functionality of Faceter was contained in one application. However, at the beginning we set ourselves a very ambitious goal: to make Faceter convenient and useful for very different people and industries, including businesses, manufacturing, private users, etc. The more we developed the product, the more we realised that our initial understanding of the product required significant improvement in order to reach our goal.  We worked with hundreds of cameras and dozens of manufacturers. We knew about all the chaos in the market, about the complete absence of a single principle of operation, and about a huge number of errors in the protocols with which cameras work. Eventually we came to the conclusion that in order for us to be able to scale the product and to make it truly convenient it’s not the best application that we need, but the best ecosystem in which each product solves a separate task. By combining them into a system, we will get the Faceter that we have been planning to create.  For the user this does not change anything, but outside of their smartphone or web browser there will now be a large, well-structured mechanism. After months of planning, today we are able to reveal some of the details concerning its structure:  The first part is the Video Surveillance Server by Faceter. It connects and collects audio and video streams from cameras, maintains an archive, provides API access to the archive and to the cameras. It also transfers data to mobile apps.  The second is Face Recognition by Faceter, which is a recognition server and analytics system. It connects to the video archive and analyzes the video / audio streams stored there.  Look out for more exciting product announcements in the near future on the entire Faceter ecosystem, how the miners and users of the service will interact, and how and why it will be as convenient as possible. We’re working very hard on development at the moment, and we promise to keep you all updated throughout each step of this exciting process.  What’s new Now for a little more about our achievements in the development of Faceter. Our team have been tirelessly working on improving the Faceter video surveillance platform, with a focus on stability and performance. We’ve had a lot of positive feedback from our first testers and customers, and we’ve worked really hard to make sure our product is as user-friendly as possible. Here are some of Faceter’s cutting-edge features:  Motion recognition and smart video recording Faceter now only records a video when a movement has been recognized.   This will significantly reduce the data storage. Just imagine how much less space you’ll need to store video data! This feature makes it much more convenient to record at night or to activate video surveillance of the warehouse, for example.  Work with the archive This the feature we are most proud of, as it has not been implemented in such a useful way in any other product we’ve come across so far. In the video below, you can see how fast and easy it is to interact with the video archive. You can navigate to any point in the timeline without having to wait for it to load. Instead you have a whole video canvas, and you can instantly switch to any frame from the archive. Isn’t that fantastic?  Sound recording Moreover, in the near future Faceter will be able to record audio in AAC format to the archive and play it on mobile clients. However, don’t forget to make sure your camera supports this particular format first.  Faceter.io update Soon we will update the website with a personal account and a demo version of the web application, giving you an opportunity to try it out on your desktop.   Don’t forget to stay in touch, and follow us on Twitter, Facebook & Reddit for more exciting updates.  Yours, The Faceter team",False

Today I would like to talk to you about the finer details of face recognition technology and how Faceter works. There are a lot of technical details ahead - don't say we didn't warn you!  Many people believe that deep neural networks recognise faces. Actually, that's not quite right. A neural network allows you to extract a set of unique key features (facial features vector) from a face. Only then it is possible to identify/verify a person by comparing these key characteristics.  Usually, the key features are a set of N numbers (N = 32–2048 - in our case N = 128). The problem is that although we said that facial features vector is unique to each person, in fact, the vectors extracted from one person's different photos will be slightly different. Therefore, we cannot compare vectors element-wise.    A classic way of comparing two vectors is to obtain the Euclidean distance between them. Click on the link if you are interested in how it is actually calculated (https://hlab.stanford.edu/brian/euclidean_distance_in.html).  The lesser the distance between vectors is, the more similar the images will be. Therefore, to compare two people we will need to calculate the distance between their facial features vectors. If the distance is sufficiently small (less than a certain threshold), then we decide that it is the same person; if not, they must be different people.  Let's imagine that we have a database of 1 million people (it means that we have 1 million facial features vectors), and we need to find the most similar face to a reference person's face. In other words, we need to calculate 1 million vector distances between the reference person and the people in the database, and choose the smallest one. With such large volumes of data, this operation becomes quite resource intensive. Our R&D team wrote an implementation of the proximity search algorithm using the GPU, which shows very high performance - over 60 million comparisons per second. However, we are always searching for new ways to optimize our algorithms, and now we are examining an approach called DeepHash.    Using this approach, the neural network not only learns to extract facial vector features during the training process, but also learns to quantify the features of one person into a single unique hash that remains unique for every photo of this person. In this case, we can use the simplest hash comparison operation to compare facial hashes. This approach will create an incremental increase in the search/comparison performance of individuals.  If you are interested in such posts ""from behind the scenes"", leave your feedback, likes and feel free to repost. From time to time, my colleagues and I will be happy to share our thoughts, experiences, and the latest updates with you.  Stay tuned!  Vladimir, Faceter CTO",False

We have prepared again an update and exciting news for you about how Faceter software development is proceeding. Today, we will tell you how things are going in Android development, explain new functionality and show you a few fresh screenshots.  Debugging Before the Launch Since the project is gradually approaching the stage of the first public release, we are increasingly focusing on the sustainability and the correct work of the application. If the last time we talked about a biggish list of bugs that had been fixed, then this time we have reworked the layout of both mobile applications. The new version became much lighter. It allowed us to increase applications’ effectiveness on all devices. Also, we simplified the interface. So as the test results show, the app is more intuitive now. Very soon, you will be able to test our achievements by yourself!  Android-Version Is On Board! We are happy to announce that, as we assumed earlier, the Android-development team has overtaken the iOS team, and the recognition technology has started to work in the Android-version of the application. Yes, we still have a lot of work and tests to do, but another big target is behind.  New Features: Video Data Saving and ID Signing There is a new function of playing the saved video in the web version and both mobile applications. Moreover, if the video was not saved for whatever reason, Faceter will notify you and even name the cause or error. By the way, as for the “missing fragments error” — if you have an original idea on the “screensaver” for the situation when the video has not been saved (poor connection, cut a piece, etc.), then please share it with us and the community. Use the hashtag #backout_faceter on social media — we will be very thankful for all your outstanding ideas. Please, do not offer an image of the girl from “The Ring” movie!  Besides, Faceter has one more important function — now, you can sign recognized people according to their names/nicknames from the profile if a camera has caught them. Being able to determine intruders is much more convenient!  New Screenshots   Finally, we are very excited to show you several new application screenshots. Do you have any comments on this? Then please do not hesitate to share them with us — as long as the development is in the process, we are particularly interested in what you are thinking about our project!  That’s all for now. Before the next tech update, you will receive a very important piece of news that will cheer you up and will not leave anyone indifferent. What is it exactly? Let’s say, there is a hint in the previous updates. However, it is not necessary to play detective — there is very little time left!  See you in a couple of weeks.  Yours, Faceter team",False

As the finish line is getting closer and closer and the adrenaline is pumping, we can’t wait to share our latest news and achievements with you. Let's get started!  Work with the archive. We have already mentioned the function of saving the video, but we have only finished working on it this month. Even if there is a lack of free space the system will continue to work stably, overwriting old material and giving priority to the last 24 hours of the video recording. We also updated the player with the archiving function and improved the user interface—we’re sure you’ll love it!  Express your opinion: we are thinking about implementing a new function that allows users to record a video only during the active moments (when there are any actions in the camera field). This will greatly optimize space management, but this option is not suitable for everyone. What do you think? Would you find this function useful?    Performance improvement. Earlier we used third-party solutions to have an opportunity to work on the UI, but now we’ve switched to our own developments. This will allow our users to get better performance with less resources. For example, video playback function (HLS on Demand).  Time & Attendance. There are new basic functions of Time & Attendance, and this feature also allows users to receive reports with repeated visits. To configure this new functionality, you hardly need to do anything—just set up the cameras. By comparison, with other similar solutions it is necessary to set up work shifts, work schedules for different groups of people, etc. We also provide the real-time uploading of data from Faceter to any ready-made T & A systems. This can be very useful if some corporate clients currently use another system.  Recognition system update. We continue to improve the algorithms of the recognition itself, primarily through the tracking of new technologies and approaches, testing and, if necessary, implementation. During this development session, the standout example of such work was the use of the Deep Wise Convolution layer in our latest version of the face detection network. The use of such layers in a neural network makes it possible to obtain a significant performance increase with minimal loss in quality of detection.  By the way, if you think that our work consists of sitting down behind the monitor, then you are mistaken! Developers of smart video surveillance systems have to overcome quite large distances at work. See for yourself.  Beta-test. Finally, the time has come. We are pleased to announce that soon you to will be able to try out Faceter in the real world. We are finishing the final preparations, and very soon we will invite everyone who wants to participate in the beta testing of the full version of Faceter to be a part of this grand testing. You will need a suitable camera and a few minutes of free time to set up, and to learn about the start of the beta testing you will need to keep up to date with us on social media.

Here we answer your most common questions. We noticed that you often ask us about the software itself, its price, and different versions. You ask about how it looks now, how it will look at the launch, and what will happen after the mass-market version is released. Well, let's shed some light on these topics...  Are the functionality and interface of the corporate and mass-market versions different? Good question. For now, we have decided to develop both versions within a single codebase since we are working on key functions that are important for both development branches. Further, the corporate and mass-market versions will again be separated. However, most of the functions and their UI representation will stay the same.  How much is the corporate version? The cost of the corporate version depends on the number of licensed cameras. The cost of one license, including integration, starts from $30 per month.  Does the B2B version use a decentralized network or centralized servers? Both options are possible, depending on the customer’s preferences.  Will the B2C version be updated on a regular basis? Of course. We are currently working on convenient mobile applications for iOS and Android, as well as on affordable cloud storage for the mass market. However, we are not going to stop there and will continue to improve Faceter. We have something to surprise you with;)  Can I install the app and have a look? Yes!

As the time goes, our developers are preparing new features for both Business-to-Business and Business-to-Customer solutions. Today we are happy to tell you about our new Business-to-Business tool, aimed to help mainly in Sales, Marketing and Workforce management.  Have you ever wished to know how much time people need in average to order pizza or choose milk in the supermarket? Or why receptionist always mopes around, but is never on his place to register you? Our devs wish to know that too and to allow our customers to know that. They thought of a tool, that would allow to analyse the customer attendance and get the proper statistics on the time spent in each customised zone or the tool, that would allow to track the crew behaviour in the customer area. That is how that feature was born in our RnD department.  If you work with video surveillance, you might know, that many cameras or surveillance providers do support a kind of the same feature, but you are drown in countless in range notifications, border cross notifications etc. etc. Our dev team wants to convert this chaotic information flow into a useful and meaningful analytic tool, that can be utilized for several business needs.  There are other features already integrated to the Business-to-Business solution, but they do not allow to track specific zones and apply analytics to them. By applying this feature user receives an integrated analytics tool, that foster sales by better merchandising or factor into changes in workforce management.  See how it looks like to have different zones on the camera stream:   Timeline This feature is specifically designed to handle analytics, that is why user needs to set up two main parameters once and system will be all set:  define zones “Customer zone”, “Merchant zone”, “Pastry zone” etc.; set up different timeframes , such as “Working Hours”, “Closed” etc. Hereinafter the application will show appearance analytics based on this times and zones. See for yourself:     Comprehensible Analytics People want to have vivid graphics instead of numbers , that is why we have also added a board, that shows attendance time on a pie chart:   Each tool helps business to sell and all of us to work more efficient and have more free time, that you’ve used to read this article.

While we are working on mobile applications and preparing to launch production-ready versions this winter for everyone, we suggest you to dream just a little with us!  Faceter is a technology that can change our ordinary way of life even in much more ways than we could imagine at the beginning of the development.  Each time new members joined our team, there were fresh interpretations of how our project can make everyday life more convenient, world safer and business more successful.  Here are just a few options for how, in theory, of course, Faceter technology can be applied:  Intelligent video surveillance can be taught to recognise objects that you need and find them — for example, keys, smartphone, or maybe your shirt. It will allow you to always stay up to date with your customer’s mood, or to monitor students during the lecture, to determine their weak sides in studying. Moreover, maybe it’s time for the movie makers and producers to know which of their jokes and ideas are unsuccessful among the viewers — just install Faceter video surveillance system in movie houses to determine the problems of modern cinematography vividly. Of course, Faceter can warn you about uninvited guests and their aggressive intentions. Moreover, Faceter can distinguish not only objects, but also actions — it is possible to anticipate crimes, emergencies at a workplace or, for example, wildfires (greetings to Australians, we know that it is a quite big problem for your country).  In other words, ideas of using Faceter technology are limited only by imagination. So if all these awesome ideas were invented only by our team, then imagine how many ideas of Faceter technology implementation we can come up with together with our community.  Offer your funny, entertaining, crazy, innovative and valuable ways of using Faceter in the comments to this post in our social media and Telegram chat. Our support managers will select the most unusual, useful and funny suggestions and we will share the results of this challenge with you in early August.  To make your message more visible and easy to find, please put a hashtag #1001Faceter to your comment.  If you want your suggestion to be noticed, then write us at ask@faceter.io with a note in the message topic “One Thousand and One Faceter”. Such messages will be read and considered without any chance to get lost.  The authors of the most original answers will be specially rewarded by Faceter.  That’s all for now, stay tuned!

Today we summarise the results of our 1000 and 1 Faceter event. And we want to thank everyone who took part in this — we received a lot of food for thoughts and had a lot of fun. Let us show you the most interesting answers. So, come on!  Felix Faceter can be used for “check in” at work. I think a lot of people hate their cards, that can be forgotten at home or another jacket. Yes, you are right. This is a great idea, and it is quite simple to realise. We hope that in the next 5 years we will forget the phrase “Oh, f#@$! I forgot my card again”  Shawn Smith Faceter Face could be used in the medical field to detect certain “abnormalities”, as the human eye can detect illness. This future development is possible but we have a long way to go before computer vision will be able to help doctors. However, medical diagnostics is a promising and decent field for Faceter.  Faceter could be used as a supplementary tool in lie detection methods. Shawn, most likely, it is possible. But we are not sure that some representatives of business or politics can be brought out by any of the existing technologies. Even Faceter can’t do this .  Artificial Intelligence Faceter to spy after your wife while you are not at home if she has a lover. It is better to keep some things in secret…  Miroslav Faceter You can definitely use this to avoid girls you already slept with, didn’t call them and forgot their faces. Oh, Mirosav, Miroslav…Please, do not do it, please. Be a decent man  Shrinivas Dontul Faceter can be integrated with Adhaar System of India to make a foolproof system for providing corruption free system in India where sometimes Biometric system fails to recognise the fingerprints of people due to which poor ppl were denied ration. Faceter can help many companies manage stress of their employees. Behavioural pattern analysed by faceter can generate alerts to company management about who is stressed how much and who is happy, healthy and fit etc.. companies will do better if they are able to manage their employey better with Faceter behavioural analysis. Faceter will be used by Major political parties in the world because these political people are all the time under the scanner. In India, these political people meet all sorts of people and do corruption and are never caught. With faceter at least these people records will be maintained with a timeline hence some facts can be established in corruptions cases based on faceter data. We hope that our project will especially develop its software in such fields. Because there are a lot of places in the world where justice and humanity need extra control and monitoring. Thank you, Shrinivas.   And again Shrinivas Dontul May be in future Faceter would be able to tell how many mosquitos are flying around in a Room. 😂😁 So that we can take appropriate action on mosquitos. Are you sure you want to know the exact number?    Ries_NL🇳🇱 Faceter and then team up with cappasity for their 3d modelling software to make a perfect 3d rendering of a fugitive instead of a mugshot. Or in case of missing persons and such. It is a great idea, such opportunities will find application also in animation, game dev and movie making.  David Ring Faceter a mobile app that detects plants and creates a map of all the plants in your garden. Oh, David, good idea! The development of recognition technology can help us to go much further — educational applications for zoos, reserves and parks. Just imagine that in some time it can turn into a pocket guide, like Pokedex in the Pokémon universe, but with much more opportunities for a user.    Marek Jantos Faceter can be used in the shops to prevent underage teenagers buying alcohol and tobacco. Marek, it is entirely possible in the nearest future. But, we really wonder if teens can get around this protection?  Simon Goldsmith Today I was going for a jog, and there was a woman sitting there taking notes of the types of people using the footpath. I looked up and spotted CCTV cameras. One could always send that feed to a Faceter system which could differentiate between cyclists, joggers, mums with kids etc and aggregate details about what kind of people use the paths, you could also track the same people across different CCTV to see how much of the pathway is actually used… This kind of thing could be good for traffic management/planning. Simon, you are absolutely right. Hopefully, the collection of statistical data in any social sphere will become much easier with the development of our technology.  Harvey Beast Faceter to find out who eats all the sweets in the fridge at nights.  @Key65111031 With FACETER, you can finally find out who is my sandwich at work!  Andy I hope faceter gets installed in my office kitchen, so I can figure out which one of my co-workers keeps stealing my milk and sandwiches from the fridge each day! 😂 Guys, we are delighted that you entrust us with such difficult life questions, but let us show you one more solution — a little portion of laxative will help not only reveal the thief, but also to wean him or her from this guilty pleasure. Some issues can be solved without intelligent video surveillance  Ashley Hunter Faceter to be installed at schools to find out who skips lessons Poor kids…  And the most exciting thing, all our participants are waiting for — the competition results! Our support managers have selected the most unusual, useful and funny suggestions and here are 3 people, who have made their best according to our committee: 1.

The market situation may not give us even a day of rest, but that doesn’t threaten us! Our team is working on the production-ready version of our product and its early launch, so it is quite busy out here. Coffee mugs are stored in the sink; pizza and energy drinks are supplied with an enviable frequency! By the way, our devs moved into a new office not so long ago. Congratulations to them!    To brighten up an uninterrupted flow of negative news from the cryptocurrency market, let us tell you what we’ve been doing lately. We have something interesting.  Firstly, like any other IT-project, we are facing many bugs during the development process. So it is just that time to improve our software in all possible ways and clean up the code.  Here are a few bugs that we fixed recently: Arranged update for the history of visits. Optimised processes of making and linking of user profiles; Created a manageable update for the history of visits; “Cleaned” and organized a people directory; Stabilized the face recognition interface; Error notifications became user-friendly; Fixed camera search errors on the dashboard; Completed parameters for the search of visits; Arranged update for the history of visits.  Thus far, this is what we can tell you for now;)  Secondly, as for more important updates and news, our developers are now making a huge effort in the field of creating cloud storage for videos coming from cameras. Below you can see the intermediate results of how the flow through the saved video stream will be organized.    We specifically tried to make the interface as simple and convenient as possible. And it seems to us that this is exactly how it turned out! The interface we created takes into account the needs of both ordinary users and experienced security professionals who need to monitor every frame.  iOS developers are now working on the direct connection to IP cameras, while Android devs are integrating the application with a computer vision. As for the web team, they will almost get to rest (just joking!) and make a lot of various improvements and debugging.  A little bit of humor from our developers — there are new functions which have been added to the MVP-version that allow you to delete a visit or to ignore someone. Now you can hide the fact that you’ve stolen someone else’s yogurt from the office refrigerator (of course, if you are the boss or the head of the security department), or hide the fact that you have a secret lover. But we still advise you not to do any of these things, especially stealing other people’s yogurts.  Finally, the most exciting news — Faceter developers prepared an installation version for corporate clients with a lot of cool features, including an embryo of a neural network, which is placed on a USB flash drive. At the same time, there is an active study of various solutions for organizing video storage and working with SONM is taking place.  Taking into account that the development is moving forward at a very good speed and that the project will be ready to hit the market very soon, we would like to know what video hardware you’ve ever used or plan to use. Here are some manufacturers.  Help us find out which one you prefer: Amcrest Foscam Lorex Reolink Mobotix Vivotek Zmodo Sricam Defeway Panasonic SpyTek  That’s all for today!

As previously planned, we continue to share with you all the news about our main achievements in the developing of a commercial version of the product. And today we have something to show again. Let's start with the good news for our partners.  Install Faceter now! We are pleased to inform you that the corporate version of Faceter for business customers is ready for setting. The installation will be quite easy if there is suitable hardware and an engineer. You need to follow the attached instructions and make sure that your system meets the requirements. If you are interested in the corporate version of Faceter, please contact our sales department at sales@faceter.io.  Integration with SONM! On 4th of July, we begin to work on integration with the decentralised supercomputer SONM. The anticipation of the first results of this cooperation is so exciting - fog computing is coming!  Web version We haven't said anything about the development process of a web-based version of our application for a long time, but now the time has come. We are working on an updated design in general and creating a user interface for the new tools. Images are attached! The web version has a new function - appending of a Digital Video Recorder (a digital video recorder which is connected with N-quantity of IP cameras). Below there is a script for this function.    Besides, we've improved the entire user interface of the user account. Now it is more convenient to use and looks more like our mobile version.    Integration of smart vision with the application As we told you earlier, one of the Faceter teams led by the CTO continues to teach our neural network with new ""tricks"" and increases the recognition quality. But until today it was just technology in a vacuum. And it makes our announcement especially joyful because we have started the integration of ""computer vision"" possibilities into customer application on iOS. At the end of this process, Faceter's primary function will be available to all users directly through the smartphones' screens.  This is one of the most important moments for the whole project. Celebrate it with us!  Since the last update, we have made a significant step forward, and we are not planning to stop in the process of development racing. A more important step is ahead, and we want to be well-prepared for it. Here is a small teaser for you:  We are considering the possibility of launching an open beta. And we want to involve a group of participants who are ready to be a tester and want to contribute to the Faceter development.  Now we are not ready to disclose specific details, but if you want to be the first to know about this possibility, then subscribe to our social networks and follow us there. We will tell more when it will be the right time.  It is all for now, see you in a couple of weeks!  Yours, Faceter team",False

We also send greetings to everyone who participated in the survey and thanks to you! You are the best!    Where are you used to receive news about cryptocurrencies and blockchain? It is entirely predictable, but in 2018 it is easier to receive information directly from social networks, rather than through websites. If you have favourite channels, public accounts or other sources of information — share with us, we really wonder to know who you trust and whom you like to read.    Where do you prefer to discuss crypto news? In this issue, it is an impressive and exciting fact that Reddit is still more popular than BitcoinTalk as a platform for discussing crypto. Also, in the additional answers, you have often mentioned Discord. Maybe it’s time for us to join this platform?   What media do you regularly read? Coindesk and Cointelegraph won entirely predictably. It’s nice to see that you also appreciated the excellent resource — Hackernoon.   Which media do you not like/do not trust? A high percentage of mistrust for Merkle and Coindesk is understandable, but we did not expect to see such a level of suspicion towards the CCN. It’s really interesting, why there are many users dissatisfied with this media. If you know, share your thoughts with us.   Do you read e-mail newsletters? We were pleasantly surprised that so many people read our newsletter regularly, and also many read our letters if they were interested in the topic. Having received such feedback, we will try to make the newsletter even more interesting for you.   What information content from Faceter you would be interested in? We know that most of all you are interested in the process and progress of development. That’s why we decided to tell you regularly about what we are doing right now.

The European Union has entered into a regulation called GDPR which says that people's data, including face images, must be encrypted and stored without the ability of third parties to access them. And on the request of a person who is within the range of the camera, all the recordings on which that person is recognizable must be made available to him free of charge within 30 days from request.  In analogue systems, we are not able to put so many employees to view archival materials to search hundreds of thousands of hours of recordings to find one face. Cities with CCTV, banks, shopping centres, supermarkets etc. will have to change systems to digital ones with the possibility of face recognition. The penalty for not meeting EU requirements is huge and amounts to 10 million euro or up to 2% of the annual global turnover of an enterprise.  Faceter will be the fastest and the simplest safe solution to this problem.

We’ve got many questions from you. Most of them are about our project, goals and commerce. In this Q&A, we’ll try to give you some answers on the most important ones.  Why are sales and commerce so low? Well, the reason lays beyond the current sales and commerce conditions — altcoins sales have become pretty risky, and they aren’t in the priority of the cryptocurrency community for now. We believe that upcoming listings on the new exchanges are about to solve this issue.  When is the app going to be released, when does the mining start? We keep moving by the announced roadmap. There’s a lot of work to make Faceter’s product stable, usable and modern service. Anyway, we aimed to release beta version by the end of the year.  Also, FACE tokens will be available for mining with our computer network, namely in 2019. We are actively exploring the possibility of the earlier computing launch with the capacity of such projects as SONM or Golem. In this case, tokens will be involved in our ecosystem earlier through the atomic token swap mechanism.  When can we expect the next listing? We are currently having conversations with several exchanges, including the major ones. However, with the way the market changes over the last six months, the trade platforms also change the listing rules. Anyway, we don’t have any problems to follow that rules, so we keep working on it right now.  The new announces are about to come!  Follow us in Telegram announcement chat or any other channel you like to get all important information.  Yours, Faceter Team",False

The buy-out price will be based on the market value of FACE token, but not below its nominal value.  FACE token buy-out mechanism:  Based on quarterly results, ~20% of the company's revenue will be allocated to the token buy-out pull. Preparatory measures before the start of the buyout procedure will take about one month.  Faceter issues a smart contract to purchase tokens with a fixed amount and a fixed closing date.  Faceter users will be informed of the opportunity to sell their tokens. Token holders will be able to send their tokens for sale until the critical point is reached – an amount covering the buy-out of a certain number of tokens defined b y the smart contract.  Token holders will be able to send and revoke their tokens prior to the closing date of the smart contract. After the closing date, the number of tokens will be fixed and all participants will be sent funds in proportion to the number of tokens remaining on the contract.

You will be able to buy one and install it at home or in the driveway.  Faceter will recognize people within the range of the camera and inform you using the application about the results. You will have a list there when a person appeared. Add artificial intelligence to this and the system starts defending you against threats.  Example. People in masks appear under your home - Faceter calls the police and he informs you. People who you have added to the blacklist with the possibility of annotation for what they were written in. When Faceter recognizes them you will get an alarm on the phone and all dates of appearance will be kept. He notices the smoke and the fire - sends an alarm to the fire brigade for help. etc.,False

We have recently shared with you our progress in machine learning. Today we want to tell you what the other part of the development team is doing. Let’s go!  Updated UI and new features We have rebuild user interface, making it more understandable for new users. Our desire is to make it handy for you, even if you have never used smart cameras before, to quickly navigate in the interface and enjoy the experience with the application. Also, we’ve added new ways of forming camera lists and remade the current dashboard. Every week, we add new interface details that did not exist in MVP. We added error screens, invalid data entry, camera reset function and much more. There are just some of the new examples of the interface design:   Net Video Recorders Faceter now fully supports three new types of devices. There are: Hikvision https://www.hikvision.com/en/ Provision-ISR http://www.provision-isr.com/ Dahuahttps://www.dahuasecurity.com/ This list will undoubtedly grow. Now you can connect one NVR and get access to all video streams from all cameras that are connected to it.  Android  Yes, we have started the development of the Android-version of the application. Now we are ready to shed a bit more light on this. The Android team is transferring the actual groundwork of iOS team. Although it will take some time, we are sure that at some point the teams will become equal and applications will release with minimal lag from each other. Install on your own server For all comers and especially corporate clients, we have provided the opportunity to install all the software on your server and connect directly to them, bypassing any intermediaries.  Alfa QA We want to make the Faceter app as convenient as possible out of the box, and for sure we understand that its popularity will largely depend on it. That is why we have already started the stage of alfa-application testing. Tester Darya joined our team (welcome Daria), and now the programmers will have even more work (the development department is so-o-o happy now).  Integration of “computer vision” We have started the direct integration of our primary product into a commercial version of the application, which will be available to everyone. For now, this is not our initial task, but to fully meet our roadmap goals, we have already begun to test these functions. We could also tell you about the new tests with SONM, the video playback optimisation in the web application and other minor improvements, but we’ll leave it for the next time.

We have some popular questions that have received in the previous few months. Most likely, many of you are also interested in the information required for other community members. Therefore, we decided to share with you some answers to the most interesting questions.  Let’s go!  1. Why tokens can not be sent back, if I send them to the token contract address? ( How is the token contract address used?) FACE Tokens sent to the FACE Token Contract address are non-reversible and cannot be sent back to the sender.  Why this happens: The token contract (and the token contract address) is the tool for token emission, distribution and track. It is not a wallet address and it can not be used as an address to receive tokens. Once you send tokens to the contract address itself — tokens are stuck there and can not be pulled back.  2. Can you give any comments on GDPR? We align with the data protection and privacy regulations requirements from the latest legislations and we are going to follow all provisions of the GDPR. Our legal team together with the technical staff are carefully studying the requirements of the GDPR both for Faceter service provision and Faceter website/applications compliance with all the GDPR requirements.  3. Can you give a comprehensive and plain explanation of the last tech update? Right now we are developing our own software, where “computer vision” will be installed. We are not going to offer services to implement our technologies as it does, for example, IBM. We want to provide the outstanding technology along with the good software and be the first in the market, like, for example, Apple.  Therefore, right now a part of the technical department headed by CTO continues to work on the main project, when another part develops and updates applications for iOS and Android. The article on Medium describes the work of the first part of developers and shows improvements in face recognition made by applying the new algorithm: it means that Faceter developers have improved the recognition methodology and have increased the percentage of successful recognitions. Soon we will also give you some updates on the work of other Faceter developers.  4. Why are people from Faceter team not presented on the website and LinkedIn? We represent only the key team members on the website. Also, we asked them to update their profiles on LinkedIn too. We do not require this for all other employees. They decide personally either to indicate this information or not. If the team has new faces with high responsibility, we will add them to the website too.  5. Are you still going to use SONM? Currently, there are no existing decentralised computing solutions with a long-standing reputation that’s why we have nothing to rely on. So, we design Faceter core to be able to run in different environments. The top priority for us is to keep our software as a stand-alone solution and be able to run directly on miner’s machines. However, anyway we stay conformed with our intention to support other networks like SONM or Golem. Their teams may already resolve many challenges in such systems, so consider them as a way of moving faster through our roadmap.  We suppose it is enough for the first time. Leave your questions in the comments, and we will give answers on the most interesting one the next time.  Yours, Faceter Team",False

You fellows!  I agree with the statement above that it is possible to attract bloggers from YouTube to the issue of PR - they are very popular, just like the topic of ICO. Perhaps this will give its positive result at the start of development.  It is not excluded that some people sell their tokens in a falling market, because they do not believe in their future fate and want to get at least part of the invested funds back. But honestly, I also do not understand what is the point of selling cheaper than buying. In the long term, the project may well show an excellent result, so it's very stupid to get rid of your coins now. On the other hand, it is a good opportunity to supplement your portfolio to those who did not have time to purchase during the ICO.  I think that in this project all participants will benefit greatly.",False

Oh, now your banker knows you have a problem. They are data mining like fuck. Did you ever talk to someone working at a bank? They do know everything although they are ""not allowed"" to arbitrarily check how it's going for you. There must be other systems, better systems, working with less mass surveillance.

If someone shows signs of becoming very brutal, that person could theoretically opt to implement that chip.

In my country you can still pay cash everywhere. I know that people are abusing knowledge derived from databases. I used to work in a military commission on the usefulness of men for the army. I had all the data regarding them. I admit that they collect too much data and too much data is available to people working there.   But back to the topic, Faceter is just for the protection of sensitive data. So far, buying a similar service in the cloud all the recordings were on third-party servers (I will not mention the biggest names, but we all know what companies offer computing power in the cloud). Faceter divides this data into small parts, turns images into lines that connect individual elements of the face and gives randomly chosen miners. Here no one has access to images and to the result data, i.e. face maps that allow face recognition. In addition, everything is encrypted and only the person with the private key has access. Here, there is no question of transferring data to various companies, employees or data leakage from the cloud in the event of an attack or deliberate disclosure by the cloud owner.  ""New systems shouldn't mean less security. We are all here to improve what we have."" - That's exactly what I think and that's why in my opinion Faceter gives us such data protection, which other CCTV systems could not meet.  Returning to the last part of your statement, I have not heard about such chips, but theoretically, I can answer your question anyway. Here, Faceter probably would not be useful, because before he called for help, an aggressive attack could take place. Who would win it is not known, because as I wrote it, I have not been drinking alcohol for several years because I go to the gym and I have ruled out it deliberately. I am quite big now, I do not know whether he would have an advantage, I suspect that he would not attack me;)  As for the chips, I have no idea who would decide on their implantation, what level of aggression would be sufficient to qualify the person for such an operation. Could such chip have been able to reduce aggression significantly? If so, it can also be a good technology that would prevent many crimes. Who knows.",False

After the Token Sale, we remain true to our proposed roadmap and today we have an important announcement to make. Faceter is announcing a burn of 61,358,389.66 FACE that effectively reduces the total supply of the FACE Token.  How and why Faceter burnt tokens?  61,358,389.66 FACE Tokens were burnt over 4 transactions. The first transaction was a test burning of 1 FACE, while the following 3 transactions burnt tokens from 3 pools.  How it works: Our smart contract includes “burn” feature. FACE Tokens are transferred from our contract to the special address (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000) and these tokens can not be sent back. Such Tokens were eliminated from the total supply and do not exist in the Faceter contract any more.  Accounts with less than 500 tokens (9,385,809.84 FACE): Faceter has committed that there will not be any Airdrop, so all bonus tokens, remaining on accounts with less than 500 FACE were burnt. We have also made a list of all accounts from those tokens were burnt, it is a list of masked emails and amount of tokens (that was burnt). You can find the list here:https://tokensale.faceter.io/faceter_burn.pdf  Advisors tokens (48,300,128.82 FACE): not all tokens from the advisors pool were used for advisors remuneration. As a result, we decided to burn all FACE Tokens remaining in the Advisors remuneration pool.  Bounty program tokens (3,672,450 FACE): as we previously announced, Bounty program was cancelled in favour of a limited bonus offering to early Token Sale contributors, not all FACE were used and the remaining amount was burnt.",False

Faceter invented a system cheaper than cloud computing, named fog computing, which will use miners for calculations. The whole system of accounting for miners, verification of their calculations and valuation of their work is based on blockchain.  Thanks to blokchain we can be sure that the calculations are correct, because they will be made by several miners and then they will be compared with each other if they are identical. Data about people faces will be obfuscate and no miner will have access to all data as it did in the cloud. And for the end, each user will have a private key and no one will be able to view data from his recordings without his consent.  Licenses for the use of Faceter will be available through Face tokens, some of which will be burned every time they receive a monthly license (about 20% of it). To facilitate the purchase of a license, you can buy it for fiat but Faceter, to activate it on the blockchain and assign miners to it, will have to get it by exchanging fiat money for tokens to sign it with the correct key.

Licenses can be purchased for Fiat depending on the country or Face token. Fiat will be exchanged by the system for a token to run licenses. Some of them will be burned, some will go to Facter and the rest will pay for the miners who process the image. Understand that the blockchain is musty, so that the system has such computing power and that the data is confidential. So far, very expensive servers with high computing power were needed so that the customer could have such a service, faceter reduces costs by spreading data over the network and using the blockchain miners. And the fact that the license will be available for Fiat is even better, because people who do not know crypto and do not want to replace Fiat --> BTC -> Face token, will be able to buy licenses directly and the system will turn Fiat into a token by itself.

The story of a programmer with 30 years of experience Vladimir Chernitsky, Faceter co-founder and CTO, talks about how the work of the programmer has changed since the late 1980s and whether neural networks will soon be able to surpass human capabilities.    I started programming at school in Chita, almost 30 years ago. We had the first computer class in the city. In most Soviet schools, teachers explained computer science on the blackboard, and then students completed assignments in notebooks. We were lucky — we had real Yamaha computers. I joined an informatics section, and at first, we mainly played video games there. Then a teacher appeared, who began to explain the basics of programming: Basic, cycles and arrays. We read the «Modelist» magazine in which pieces of ready-made programs were published: an article with a short explanation and two or three pages of code. There was a game named Sacoban; we tried to recreate it on our computers. We wrote a simple game together with a friend and showed it as an example of what can be done on computers to younger students for inspiration. Programming became my main hobby, and I asked my parents to buy a home computer.  When we received feedback from Australia, we were shocked  In 1994, I graduated from school and wanted to enter the Tomsk Institute of Automated Control Systems and Radio Electronics. But my parents did not dare let me travel to another city. So, I stayed in Chita. There was not a single IT-faculty, and I entered where there was strong mathematics. It was an energy faculty. A year later, I found a job in the information-analytical agency of the Chita region. At first, I just created the layouts of different magazines and books on computers in Photoshop and Corel, and set up the network. In 1995, we received the Internet. In that time, the Runet area was completely empty, and the most popular search engine was Altavista.  Our department received an order to make the first site of Chita. I learned to write scripts, and made the first guestbook on Perl. I remember that someone from Australia wrote there, and it was a shock. Then I started to work at the «Chita.net» company. It was the first Internet provider in the city. I developed a billing system to account for customer traffic. It was a beginning of deeper programming growth — C ++ and other stuff. I learned it through teaching myself — I could already find professional forums, publications and books on the Internet.  In the early 2000s, I received $300 per month  I was strongly influenced by an acquaintance with my colleague. He was a hardcore programmer, already at the time, in the early 2000s. He talked about data structures and trees, and developed software for foreign companies on outsourcing. My colleague was looking for clients, and we earned serious money, although for Western companies, our work cost a penny. I took $ 6–8 per hour. In a month, I received $300, and it was 2–3 times more than my official salary. We made a website for one customer from Europe — for his clan in the MMORPG game. Also, we developed a site for the Australian state office. As a result, my partner left for Australia.  I stopped enjoying my work  I was 30 years old when realized that I was tired of everything. At that time, I already had a family, an apartment, but at same time I felt a dissatisfaction, I wanted to grow. With my wife, we began to think of where to move. We chose Novosibirsk. At that time, I was already a leading programmer in «Chita.net». When we moved, it turned out that I wasn’t the big fish that I thought I was back in Chita before. I sent my resume to four places, and I was invited for an interview, but I was refused everywhere. I realized that my knowledge was still superficial. As a result, I went to Azoft company for an average position. After only a year of work there, I probably learned as much as during my previous career. I began to learn different technologies, and projects became more serious. I wrote front-ends in PHP, as well as back-ends in Java. In that «before iOs- and Android-era», where JavaME and SymbianOS dominated, I developed mobile applications. It was 2008 when iOS appeared, and we wrote a test application, and customers came to us. I headed the mobile development unit. The department grew to six people. We wrote under iOS, and a little later, Android appeared, which we quickly mastered.  We recreated the technique of drawing on the water in the application  Once a client came, he wanted to recreate Ebru, the Turkish art of drawing by colors on the water, in his mobile application. The customer wanted to create a software emulation of this technique. The activity of R&D company started with this project, and my new era began. We built a physical and mathematical model, and then went to Akademgorodok to talk with professors to understand the hydrodynamics of the process. As a result, we managed to recreate it quite accurately right on the GPU — on the iPad. Of course, the model was simplified, but the customer was satisfied.  About neural networks  In this project, it became clear that we needed to create an R&D department in the company. I headed it, and we started to do different non-standard projects. In the same way, we came to neural networks that just began to rise. Neural networks are «ancient» technology, but it received a new life in 2012 with Alexnet. Jan Lekun also wrote a study on this subject in the 80's. The first notable project in the field of neural networks was called Neocognitron. Japanese scientists in the 80’s dissected cats, studied how the visual cortex of the brain is arranged. Even then, the technology of pattern recognition appeared, and the machine was taught to «learn» the numbers. Later, Neocognitron finalized and created convolutional neural networks. In 2010, it became clear that these algorithms can be run even on ordinary home computers, and a new life of neural networks began.  I studied the «neurons» from and to  In 2013, a customer came from Spain. He wanted to develop an application for the recognition of data from credit cards for bank customers. It turned out that the best way to achieve this is to use convolutional neural networks. We created the application, and the customer was very satisfied. It took about a year. And then there was a new client who wanted the same application — Robert Posier from South Africa. At that time, I worked for 7 years in Novosibirsk, I continued to develop as a professional, but again I had a strong desire to change something. Robert wanted to create a development office in Moscow and offered me a position in leading it. I took my family and just went to Moscow. In the project Pay.cards, I got the opportunity to study «neurons» from and to, squeeze out a maximum of them. We managed to create an excellent product.  Sometimes neural networks surpass human capabilities  In 2014, an unfortunate accident occurred, which eventually led us to the Faceter. Robert was robbed on the street in Johannesburg, moreover, under several cameras of video surveillance. He did not suffer, although the attackers threatened him with a knife. It affected him so much that he started to think how to make video surveillance more effective. In this way, we came up with the Faceter software, which actually replaces the guard or the policeman on duty, and observes everything happening continuously without days off and smoke breaks. It is a vivid example of how artificial intelligence can replace some human abilities. Even more, neural networks in some cases surpass our capabilities — a system like ours can store data on millions of people and recognize them in the video stream in real time. Of course, one person is incapable of doing this. We want to make sure that the «neurons» could recognize not only faces, but emotions as well, and also analyze the chain of events and diagnose the situation. For example, if a person with an aggressive expression takes a sharp metal object out of his pocket, the system must turn on the alarm mode.  Neuron systems will change everything in the world in the coming decades  I believe that, in the next 20–50 years, this technology will change everything in the world, and fundamentally. I am inspired by the opportunity to develop systems that will be part of this process; I feel I am on the front line of the fourth technological revolution. Our system uses computer vision. It has already been tested in real conditions. We achieved recognition accuracy of 99.78% for the LFW test and 79.46% for MegaFace.  We completed three PoC projects: Face recognition is used for loyalty programs in famous South African pizzerias Debonairs. In the largest casino network, it is applied to identify those who are prohibited from visiting gambling establishments. At one plant, we helped to cope with the fact that employees, when they cannot take a shift, give their passes to untrained relatives or friends. The system compares everyone who passes the checkpoint to a database and reports when it sees an unfamiliar person.  AI can bring real benefits We are working on advanced recognition technologies. Now the system recognizes people by face, and soon it will be able to identify silhouette, clothing, and track movements of a person from the camera to the camera. Then we will learn to recognize situations — the system will not analyze single frames, but chains of events, for a long period of time. Now, systems that can detect individual events already exist. But those who can recognize the chain of events and diagnose situations has still not been developed. Many companies lead such developments. But our main mission is to make the product for mass users. We want to show that artificial intelligence not only can print photos in different colors or draw paintings in Van Gogh style, but also bring a real benefit to everyone.  The work of AI is not much different from the work of the brain  Of course, I share the concerns about the dangers of artificial intelligence. Progress is speedy, and we just cannot follow it. If you could recently say that AI is a primitive organism with limited abilities, now robots can do a backflip and understand the English speech better than most people. In my opinion, the work of AI is no different from how the brain functions in principle. It is, evidently, a simplified model, but it reproduces what is happening in our head. Now, AI is like a children’s toy car in comparison with a standard adult car. But the technology develops rapidly. Everything is radically different from the technologies of the first generation, since the appearance of which only 5 years have passed. Evolution is intense. People try to reproduce the processes in the brain. Extensive development is due to the growth of equipment productivity: networks can be made deeper every year. The computing power of the neural network will be equal to the human brain in the next decade. Humanity stands at the threshold of universal systems creation, and will be enough to indicate the rules, and they will find the best ways for solutions!

General recommendations for users (tech requirements):  The resolution of a captured scene is determined by the camera resolution and the size of the scene. For example, if you are using a camera that delivers 1280x720 resolution, you can cover a scene that is, at most, 3.0 m wide and maximum distance 6 meters. You will need to select a camera and lens that will allow the field of view to match the scene size at the desired distance between the camera and the scene. 30 pixels is the recommended minimal distance between eyes for a face on image or video stream to perform face template extraction reliably (face detection). 60 pixels or more recommended for better face recognition results. Note that this distance should be native, not achieved by resizing an image.  Face Posture The face recognition engine has certain tolerance to face posture: head roll (tilt) – ±25 degrees (configurable); ±15 degrees default value is the fastest setting which is usually sufficient for most near-frontal face images. head pitch (nod) – ±15 degrees from frontal position. head yaw (bobble) – ±30 degrees from frontal position (configurable). ±15 degrees default value is the fastest setting which is usually sufficient for most near-frontal face images. 30 degrees difference between a face template in a database and a face image from camera is acceptable.  Distortion Most lenses exhibit distortion. Often this is in the form of barrel distortion. Barrel distortion is caused by lens magnification being smaller on the edges of the field-of-view compared to the center of the image. The effect is that objects that are near the edge appear closer to the center compared to an undistorted image. Objects of the same size will cover fewer pixels when they are near the edge, compared to what they would cover if they were closer to the center. This means that objects that are near the edge of the field-of-view need to be closer to the camera in order to fulfill requirements on minimum resolution. The effect of barrel distortion is often much more pronounced at short focal lengths, making wide angle lenses less suited for identification purposes.  Illumination Illumination greatly affects the ability to identify persons or objects. Shadows, high contrasts and backlit scenes all make identification and recognition more difficult compared to when lighting conditions are more favorable. Camera features such as wide dynamic range(WDR) and sensors that perform well in low light situations can help, but the best results are obtained if these are combined with additional lightning and adjustment of camera positions to avoid backlit situations. For identification of a human face, balanced illumination in the region of 200-400 lux is recommended.  Motion In order to capture sharp footage of fast-moving persons or objects, you will need to use short shutter speeds. 1/50-1/200s shutter speed is recommended (depends on illumination of detected area)  Compression Compression can greatly affect the usability of recorded materials for identification and recognition. High compression ratios will introduce blur or pixelation that makes identification difficult. If the compression algorithm uses a bit rate limit, the compression could increase when motion occurs, making otherwise clear footage unusable.

The scale of this rating is divided into 10 levels: Positive+, Positive, Stable+, Stable, Risky+, Risky, Risky-, Negative, Negative-, Default. The higher the rate assigned to the project, the better the overall quality of the project’s documentation, and the lower the number of risks for future investors. Faceter received the 3rd highest rating level of the 10 that are measured.  This what ICO Rating experts wrote in their review: “The Faceter project is entering the growing market for video surveillance and aims to solve a number of real-world problems. The project’s chance of solving these problems makes it promising and potentially in high demand. Faceter has a strong team and advisors, who between them have extensive experience in this business area. The fact that the management has sufficient experience of joint work and is successfully developing its business is a definite plus for Faceter. The company has developed a number of mechanisms to boost the investment attractiveness of the token; in particular a mechanism for token burning and buyback is provided. Having studied the available information and written this review, we did not identify any significant risks that could negatively affect the price of the token. The fact that Faceter closed its pre-sale ahead of schedule having collected more than $10 million over a short period of time shows the level of interest this project is attracting”.

Exclusive Interview    Faceter CEO, Robert Pothier, sits down with CryptoCurrencyNews.com for an exclusive chat. Faceter is the first decentralized surveillance system for consumers, powered by facial recognition software that’s been proven to work. From safety and security to marketing and beyond, Faceter is among the top rated ICOs on the market.   The presale ICO broke records yesterday and Faceter continues to be high in demand going into its token sale on February 15th. We got to chat with Faceter CEO Robert Pothier for an exclusive interview about how Faceter got its start and where the surveillance system is heading next.   If you’re unfamiliar with Faceter, read here.     So, Robert, tell us about your background and how you got started with Faceter? After completing Business Management at college, I immediately went to London for 2 years where I worked for a logistics company for the supply of goods (wings up) for London Heathrow airport. It was a great place for me to apply my management skills. On returning to South Africa, I immediately got into sales of technology. It was soon after that I came into contact with Russians trying to integrate European technologies and solutions for Africa. I was fascinated and immediately got involved, finding myself part of a group of great partners and developers around the world (mostly Russian). The years of experience in the IT, telecommunication, and payment industries have helped me develop a keen eye for opportunity and a clear understanding of consumer needs. From payment systems to card scanning and now facial recognition – it’s great to be at the forefront of the latest technology.   Why Faceter? Why focus on a surveillance system for the mass market? We had already developed a card scanning technology (pay.cards) as a free SDK for developers to increase our global business relations. Last year (2017), I was mugged by 4 guys at 9 am in the morning on a public street with many people walking by. It was very traumatic and I was shocked that there were CCTV EVERYWHERE, and the police could not do anything – even with complete fingerprints on my car which they mugged me up against. I was shocked that even the police could not utilize images to help people. I approached my team and now we laugh about “you got mugged so started a recognition company.” At this point, we had members like Vladimir Tchernitski who quickly shared their expertise. They could contribute to offering a solution of computer vision starting with facial recognition stepping the game up from pay.cards. We knew what we could develop but we also knew we needed a solution that goes beyond what is already there. This is where we tackled the issues of computer vision needing heavy computer resources to process the algorithms.  On concluding that Fog computing with data mining would make the solution affordable, we researched the market and realized that nobody was doing it. Faceter was born, and we can offer it to the mass market at affordable rates.   How long has Faceter been in development? Pay.cards was the first computer vision technology we developed about 3 years ago. As per the story above, we only recently developed facial recognition. I am incredibly proud of how quickly my team managed to develop a facial recognition MVP that hits 99.78% accuracy.   Not everyone immediately connects blockchain with surveillance, so what made you choose to use blockchain for the system? We already needed miners to process our Proof of Recognition algorithms. It made perfect sense to develop a token that could reward them for their processes. Quickly the synergy was put together by utilizing a smart contract to burn a token from the market to generate a license for the customer. We then got ICO advisers involved who loved our concept immediately. Our whitepaper has a full description explaining why blockchain is essential for our business.   Why did you choose the Ethereum platform for Faceter? Ethereum simply works for us right now and our product does not require high volumes of transactions either. This means that a more efficient platform can easily be considered later. Some considerations are already underway.   Why did you decide to do an ICO? What are your thoughts on ICOs? It was clear to us to run an ICO. ICO’s are a quick way to raise funds to take our working solution many levels and quickly. We already need to use our own token to complement the token burning and issuing of the license. I believe the old days are gone where people could come up with an idea, open a website and raise millions for their ICO and the bad investments of the past is a good thing – it has taught investors to research their considerations and hence encourage more mature investments in projects that can really make a difference in the world which to most is the ideology of blockchain.   There have been concerns about scam ICOs in the past. What are you doing to gain people’s trust and ensure that Faceter rises above the paranoia? I believe my team’s reputation on past projects and success stories speak for themselves. Secondly, it makes it easier when you have a working project. Even software has added tangibility when a customer can get a look and feel for how your solution works.   Faceter’s pre-ICO sale just ended. How did it go? It is the most exciting part of our journey! We are so pleased to announce that we closed our presale at $10.8 Million USD. The whitelisting exceeded our expectations by 15 times what we originally were offering. Each of Faceter’s contributors is valuable to us, we aim for transparent and fair rules for all participants, so we took tranches of our token sale bonuses to allow more people to benefit from the presale.   Do you have any predictions for how the token sale will go? Our Token Sale starts 15 February and there are still some bonuses. Immediately after the presale closed we saw a huge interest in the main Token Sale as of this morning (07Feb); we have already received over 5000 registrations for the main Token Sale.   What are your main long-term goals for Faceter beyond what we can see on the roadmap for 2019? What we have learned so quickly from doing this ICO is that many retailers have contributed and we have gained a lot of international interest from corporates. Being heavily focused on an affordable, decentralized, mass consumer product, it was surprising to us but it is also shaping what we do. We are building a platform for a boutique of services and applications to build on. As millions of applications were built for mobile phones when Android launched, we can expect thousands of possibilities for surveillance solutions all working on Faceter platform.   What makes Faceter stand out from all the other ICOs out there? Why should people choose Faceter? We are rated by many trackers as one of the top ICO’s and these sites (like icobench.com) are not controlled by us. We are the first to offer Proof of Recognition (POR), the first to be combining facial recognition with fog computing and data mining, have received incredible online support from the public that superseded our expectations and no other facial recognition company is offering an affordable solution for the mass market with open source. If you do a little reading (whitepaper, youtube searches) you will quickly learn why so many like what we are doing. It is also worth noting that during Presale activities, 83 corporate businesses from 52 countries have shown an interest in the product and have approached our company, seeking partnership opportunities.   What’s been the most challenging aspect of the project so far? I am sure my development team would love to answer this, but for me, it was convincing people that Faceter is about offering convenience to an already strong network of surveillance around the world when many still have the mindset that it is about losing privacy. We take privacy very seriously but until now, this kind of technology has not been made available to the public…now it is and it is nothing to be scared of.   What are you most excited about for Faceter? I am truly excited to see Faceter make a change in the world. When people will see the positive impact we can make by improving privacy and making our lives safer. Not (a safer world) for our children, but now and for us to live in; so that our children can grow up in a better one. I have so many scenarios of great things we will do, but the most rewarding will be when I see Faceter save lives.     Faceter is just getting started. The success of the presale shows how interested people are in this technology. The most important thing is that Faceter is not about eliminating privacy. It is about making the world a safer place to live in. For anyone still interested in participating in the Faceter token sale, check out the website for how to get involved.

Most ICOs sold out way too fast, you had to put alot of fee into your transaction to even get through, which resulted  in the infamous gas wars. The Ethereum network was clogged and you had to wait to know if your transaction even got accepted. If it isn't accepted you are losing gas with every try.  Sales I had these problems were Digitex, Insurepal and today Arcblock.  I said that the bonus structure was coherent and therefore the distribution fair, read through my posts again.  If they stuck to the pre-sale conditions they had before 90% of the investors wouldn't have gotten anything and had to wait until the real ICO. At the real ICO the same chaos as mentioned above would occur and the 40% and 30% bonus would also sell out in minutes.",False

Number of Whitelist requests was so hight that tokens with 50% bonuses were not enough to cover all Whitelist demands. To make the process FAIR we decided to unpack bunches from main Token Sale with 40%, 30% and 20% bonuses. Otherwise all the people who applied for the Whitelist could not participate in Presale at all. We assume this unacceptable and unfair. So, we announced the procedure of the Whitelist approval on Jan 31 here in the chat and also in all our social medias and other channels. Those who got less than 50% bonus, please mind that you were late for 50% but because you were in the pending list, we don’t want you to go without any bonus at all. Now all bonuses are reserved and seem to be finished by the main Token Sale date. We understand that many of you have applied for 50% but are not eligible for it, directly related to your position in the Whitelist.  I wish you all well as many appreciate any bonus and the value of ethereum is greatly in your favour as we fixed on the Feb 01.  Robert CEO",False

We are very proud to have received over 7,000 Whitelist applications from 135 countries in 2 days, as of January 31st 7:00 AM UTC. The requested amount has exceeded our Presale token supply by in excess of 15-times. This happening in just 2 days is incredible and we are thankful and humbled. This huge excess of demand requires the team to implement fair and accurate bonus distribution mechanics. We have spent long hours consulting with our legal team and have taken a decision to run the Presale on a Whitelist basis, with a queue and without a free sale. The Faceter team will provide additional tranches of tokens with 40%, 30% and 20% bonuses that were originally reserved for the main Token Sale in order to deliver to those who applied for the Whitelist. The bonuses will be distributed on first come, first served basis. To ensure that the purchasing of tokens operates smoothly and securely, we will be implementing a higher security audit, over and above our regular audit processes. Please be patient - we will be performing this one last test and final fine tuning before taking off. The new date for the Presale start is February 5th 2018 at 7:00 AM UTC. From February 1st at 7.00 AM UTC to February 2nd at 7.00 AM UTC, all contributors who applied via the Whitelist will have their statuses updated and the amount of bonuses will be reflected as determined by your Whitelist position. Between February 2nd at 7.00 AM UTC and February 5th at 7.00 AM UTC, all Whitelisted contributors will be able to fund their account with their chosen cryptocurrency (per our list of acceptable cryptocurrencies) in order to confirm their reservation. On February 5th at 7.00 AM UTC, all applications with topped up amounts for purchasing tokens will be executed automatically and contributors will get tokens added to their Faceter account balance. All tokens pre-ordered but not purchased will be sold as part of the main FACE Token Sale. Thank you for your trust. The Faceter team appreciates this tremendously and is working hard to meet your expectations.

Firstly, your product and presentation is very slick, well done. I watched it when you had zero reviews on ICO bench and even then told some people, faceter has the 'potential' to be absolutely massive. I haven't had the same gut feeling since I saw substratum. Not just another theoretical, tech pipe dream that exists on paper, this is totally real world with mass market capability. I absolutely see the multiple application ability and real world possibility, the product certainly seems genius in a burgeoning and ever growing sector, and if implementation is at an affordable price point for mass usage, you've got half way there.  You're passion is obvious as is Vladimir's amazing technical skills, but that's still not enough to succeed as a business.  Some of the world's best ever inventions failed, not because they weren't good, but simply through lack of exposure or effective sales and marketing strategy.  I have been the CEO of an airline training and recruitment firm, and come from a sales/marketing background. You're current retail contracts in South Africa are a good start, but what is your actual plan to get this into the global marketplace and take it from a cool niche cutting edge product, used on a limited basis to a global leader (or as near as you can possibly get to that?)  Are Paul Scott and Graham Perry going to try and do this alone? Or will you be allocating a sizeable portion of funds raised on obtaining a leading marketing/advertising firm on your behalf? As a potential investor I hope the lions share of what is raised is spent on gaining exposure, in marketing, brand awareness and  establishing a paying global client base and not never ending development (as needed as development is), I'm totally convinced in product and market, but I'd like you to convince me that you have the sales and marketing strategy, because it is this that will make or break your brilliant product invention. Good luck with everything and well done thus far :-)",False

This is the answer from Rob and Paul:  ""Thank you for this crucial question and we cannot agree with you more.  As our initial market drive, we have a marketing and public relations department - in addition to our B2B and B2G sales effort - that works with several online channels targeting the B2C market.  I am unable to share all of our strategies but would love to share this; we have a partnership program with Axis whereby we are already in the process of developing our technology to sit on a camera's on-board microchip (the ARM chip). Axis is a global leader and distributor of surveillance hardware and software and this is a critical method we are employing to have our product distributed in-box and on-camera.     Our presence in the blockchain industry has caused a massive spike in interest globally, most notably through our ever-expanding daily social network engagement.  Many aligned organizations are interested in connecting their services to the platform that we are developing. Additionally, we will leverage the network of other applications building on our solution as well.""  If you have any further questions, you can contact Rob directly.

Faceter makes video surveillance smart, giving brains to cameras through enhanced face detection, object detection and real-time video analysis. These features allow cameras to understand the situation and respond to it, offering much better security to all the customers.  Video surveillance systems are currently the most efficient technical tool to ensure public safety by the means of recording facts and controlling the situation at any site. The global increase in crime, terrorist attacks and, most especially, public concern about safety are the factors that promote the development of the global video surveillance market. According to Markets&Markets, the industry’s turnover reached $30.37 billion in 2016. The growth rate is seemingly unabated, as the industry is expected to reach $75.64 billion in turnover by 2022.   The problem is similar – most video surveillance systems are of little use, and therefore inherently inefficient, since it is only possible to record data via videos, and store video archives. They are therefore backward-looking and dumb in that they cannot, and are completely unable to react to a situation when it is actually happening in real time.   Computer vision technology on the blockchain powered by a decentralized network of miners makes the product affordable for all-sized businesses and mass market consumers. The benefit from a mining perspective is that a contribution of miner's resources to Faceter is twice as profitable as the mining of Ether on the same Graphic Processing Units (GPU’s). At Faceter’s technological core is the absolute respect for privacy, and the utilization of the features of convolutional neural networks to split the tasks reinforces this commitment. As a result, sensitive data is always processed in a completely trusted environment, and all images not subject to recovery are passed to the decentralized network. This amounts up to 80% of the total amount of calculations performed.   Faceter plans to fill this niche by offering a product with broad functionality and an affordable price to mass consumers, such as small businesses and ordinary people.  WATCH VIDEO   HOW IT WORKS?  The system can analyse human faces and track movements of a certain person in real time.    Faceter allows quick and easy search through video databases, keywords or photos.    An easy to interact intuitive interface and quick notification settings improve the platform’s ease of access.    In the future Faceter will be able to detect sequences of events and analyse unusual and dangerous scenarios such as a fist or firefight, kidnapping or carjacking. It will also be able to detect potentially dangerous objects such as fire, guns, etc.  PRIMARY FEATURES OF FACETER    Object and facial recognition and resultant behavioral analysis greatly enhances the capabilities of video surveillance systems to detect potential threats or such events as a smiling customer etc. The technology’s algorithm was proven by LFW and MegaFace test, which are the most trusted in the industry.    Fog computing. The cost of the product is significantly reduced by involving cryptocurrency miners into a decentralized computing network to perform recognition calculations with the added benefit of offering miners a higher income-earning opportunity.    Blockchain. Faceter uses all the nascent opportunities of smart contracts to deliver flexible and transparent payment options and as well as proof-of-recognition mechanisms to a Fog computing network. This is the way Faceter contributes to the growth of the crypto-industry.    Machine learning — using neural networks, you can teach Faceter to react on variations of certain events.    Data protection — Faceter does not process the source video stream outside its trusted environment; only anonymized data is transferred to decentralized networks.    The Faceter token is the “fuel” of a decentralized network enabling flexible, transparent, cross-border closed-loop settlement mechanism for all participants.

About privacy - yes, that's right. This moment in our project paid a lot of attention - everything is really confidential. The system will be able to recognize faces and persons. At your enterprise, it can establish different access rights for workers, monitor attendance. We had an interesting experience with a plant in Africa where we implemented a pilot project - we managed to identify replacement workers who simply passed the pass to their relatives so that there would be no absenteeism.
