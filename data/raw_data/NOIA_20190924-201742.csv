Well the idea that aims to build the next generation of internet combined with blockchain is pretty interesting. But, I'm here to talk about marketing. Since you need an investment in order to be able to develop the project properly, you absolutely need to spread awareness among investors. Why did you choose an airdrop instead of creating a campaign to help you reach investors? Airdrop is like a giveaway when people can earn tokens by doing single task, and a campaign can dive your marketing and spread awareness to people for a longer time and keep people to always be informed though.",False

Let me explain NOIA project from a win-win-win perspective. Three parties involved win - websites, users, and nodes:  Websites, such as Youtube, Spotify, Netflix will benefit from NOIA by saving huge costs on content delivery. Current CDN's are very expensive and centralized, yet NOIA is creating a decentralized CDN, which will help to save such websites up to 8 times on content delivery because of geographically dense network of nodes.  Regular users will experience better loading times and overall better user experience. They might not even know about NOIA, but if Youtube installs NOIA library and becomes our client, regular users will feel significant decrease in loading times.  Nodes are people, that install NOIA application on their computers to share their bandwidth resources. By doing that, they will earn NOIA tokens which then they can sell on the exchanges. Regular node (100 Mbps internet plan/12 hours online per day) might be able to earn around $50 per month.",False

The incentive is that using NOIA Network you will be economically rewarded.   Only the content that is public will be delivered through the NOIA Network and data transfers between nodes and users will be encrypted. To ensure security and govern processes at the beginning our Master Node will be centralized. Also, the content aggregators (like Youtube) will need to sign contracts with NOIA Network Company in order to use our service. After that, we will white-list them. If the content matches the white-list pattern, it can be sent to NOIA nodes via our CSL service. If not - we will have technical means to recall them from the Network asap.

We are considering the UK, the Japanese and the South Korean markets as most promising and where we plan to start. Then, to attract a solid number of reliable Nodes within the proposed target markets, a promotional Smart Contact based Node Reward Program will be developed to reward Nodes for contributing bandwidth and storage in advance of actually delivering data. Through this and other measures, we aim to create an initial community of 2,000 Nodes within each target market. It is a bit too early to talk with content providers. Answering your question why they would be interested I invite you to read this article: https://noia.network/noia-offers-unlimited-scalability-plus-lower-costs-for-smaller-content-providers/. To add, we do have serious strategic partners like Baltneta - one of the largest ISP’s in the Baltic and Nordic regions. They will be testing the NOIA Node Client on its own systems.",False

The good thing is that main criteria have high rates and e.g. communication, project support will be solved in the near future (I ain't even talking about weeks period) when we will start more active marketing. This also solves the mentioned weakness of low popularity in social networks and blockchain news resources. Talking about financial plan - actually it is very clear and we plan to disclose it in the Whitepaper soon. Not to mention, Expansion of the market is rated as low - In 2016 the amount of data being transferred reached 26,600 GB per second.

NOIA acts as an additional layer for content providers, such as Youtube, to optimize their content delivery processes. So if we talk about censorship, NOIA is not the case. During the early stages we will need to control which content providers we are dealing with. For example, we would certainly black-list child porn websites, if they would want to partner with us to optimize their content delivery. This is one of the cases, why we still need controlling unit and cannot be 100% decentralized at first. But as we improve, AI could black-list them automatically, without us interfering.  As it's seen on our roadmap, complete decentralization is planned for 2019, but we need analyze a lot of data and implement AI learning first.",False

We see competitors in segments of CDN market:  Centralized Video CDNs: Akamai, Verizon, Limelight, etc. Centralized General CDNs: Google Cloud, Fastly,Amazon CloudFront, etc. Decentralized/Blockchain Filehosting/CDNs: VideoCoin, Fiilecoin, IPFS, SIQ, MaidSafe, etc.  - Why NOIA network will success in the near future and what catalyst will drive it to success?  The biggest differentiator of NOIA project is that, we are driven by a very clear business purpose, while keeping our network as much open to participate as possible. We use blockchain in a very practical way, we don't intend to solve all problems with blockchain and pure decentralized solution. The catalyst to our success will be our early access to real business clients and the business invoices will become the solid buying support to NOIA tokens.  - What are real features from technical side which could be considered as major advantage of your network?  (more details will be visible in the technical paper which will be released soon)  * Our CSL(content-scaling layer) cloud controller and (initially) master nodes are fully run and maintained by the NOIA team. This way, we could ensure to deliver the highest quality through the active management of the NOIA worker nodes. * But NOIA worker nodes are open to any one to participate to be hired by master nodes. They earn NOIA tokens through sharing network/storage resources. * We will eventually franchise the operation of master nodes, in order to leverage the local knowledge instead of running of our own infrastructure. It is a step towards more decentralized master node network. * We also have some ISPs' input that, they would like to participate of the operation of some master nodes too. Our solution helps them to balance  their network infrastructure load and they don't seem to see their customers sharing resource a threat to them.  - Why people should use NOIA network instead of other solutions let's say when you are production ready  For content publishers, our solution is business oriented and quality of the service is the highest priority. For worker node runners, our tokens will have increasing higher demand along with the growing business. (Read our whitepaper's analysis of the growing CDN market)",False
