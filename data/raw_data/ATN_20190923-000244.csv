Well, if you mean another ICO, yeah, there are a lot of ICOs, but absolutely not like we are.  Many companies are searching for software that can analyze past data to predict the future in the financial markets. This includes the use of various advanced neural networks and the recognition of events that influence the market. They are trying to create devices that can anticipate the future. We state that such a device already exists: the brain of a successful trader who is consistently profitable. A person who can predict market developments with a high probability is still influenced by emotions that can cause him to make negative business decisions, and/or decline business opportunities with the potential to generate greater profits. By identifying the stages where emotions interfere with pure logical decisions, elimination of a portion of loss, or gain can be achieved. We monitor human traders with a camera, thermal camera, pulse meter, and retinal camera as they work. The collected physiological data is then compared with their trading results. Once a sufficient level of information about the individual's unique physical reactions and trading outcomes are compiled and analyzed by the advanced neural network, we can effectively anticipate short-term future developments of their actions. We are a research project with applied patent: ""Method of predicting a subject's failure, and device for performing this method and its use” was filed on September 27, 2017 with the Industrial Property Office of the Czech Republic (Europe) and received file number PV 2017-591. We are a real company in Prague and you can check everyone from Athena team and contact them.  And why should anyone buy Athena? 1) It is a research project that will change trading around the world. 2) The modifiable blockchain will be suitable for corporate use (open-source of course) 3) Athena lab s.r.o. is likely to submit two more patents in the near future. 4) And most crucially: Athena lab will use 35% of its quarterly earnings to buy and burn Athena tokens for the next five years.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  Michal, Athena team",False

The first one is research and second one is daily operation.  In research stage, we will monitor 12-50+ (depends on collected funds) human traders with current Athena team + team of psychologists and collected data. Than all collected information will be used for searching uni-patterns by the advanced neural network. There are 16 groups of people according to how they ""feel"" emotions and we need to find uni-patterns for all groups.  Then in daily operation, the new trader 'just' fills a form for setting correct emotion group. The uni-patterns from that group will be used as start point for creating unique personal patterns and when will be collected enough data (~we expected 3 weeks with using groups uni-patterns), our platform xAthena (based on the advanced neural network) will inform trader when his/her desitions are on ""pure mind"" or on ""emotions"" and set up how much % possibility is to get profit/loss at such moment. The chemical reaction in the human body is same for the same situation. Different is in how much insensitive it is. We can find this patterns for day traders.  Michal, Athena team",False
