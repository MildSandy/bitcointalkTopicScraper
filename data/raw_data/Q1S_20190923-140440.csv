The q1s tokens are so-called ERC20 tokens, i.e. simple Ethereum tokens that are used by basically every ICO in existence.  ERC20 tokens, like all Ethereum contracts, are public as they are stored in the blockchain. One way to check this public information is to use a site like etherscan: https://etherscan.io/token/0xbeebcfe2fbb3c72884341be2b73ae0fc6559b8fc#balances  In the above link, I show the token holders of the q1s contract. On rank 1 you see that 99.2756% of all tokens are held by a single holder, i.e. quantum1net. This means that only 0.7% of the tokens have been sold.  If you click the ""token transfers"" tab on etherscan you can see who has bought q1s tokens, when they bought, and how much they have. We're down to about 1-2 transactions per day now, and there is almost zero volume of tokens being sold. In the past 24 hours, less than 250 q1s tokens were sold which is about €750.  All of this information is public and you can verify it yourself, don't take my word for it.  Also note that the q1n team has gone completely silent. They no longer post updates in this bitcointalk thread, questions on reddit go unanswered, their twitter account is just posting links that have nothing to do with q1n. Why are they silent? Why won't they answer questions? I know the answer, but you'll have to think about that yourself.",False

This article will explain Quantum Project’s ideal business model, but it would be a waste of your time to continue reading if not for the trusted names behind this project. Stories of successful companies begin with investor confidence. When a company’s leader is well-known, investors are more comfortable with their investment, as some investments take much patience in the early stage. From the outside looking in, it may seem as though the company isn’t doing much, when in reality the early stages of the startup are often the busiest, yet not opening marketed. Positive future guidance of the company can fall on deaf ears if there are trust issues among investors. A trusted CEO can make or break a startup, especially during the early stages. It is during this very early stage where smart money find and invests in the company. Smart money enters before institutional investors or the mass public learn of the potential. Smart money is often attracted to startups that are founded by already-successful people. Quantum Project’s founders are Nejc Bukovec and Damian Merlak. Nejc has made a name for himself as business analyst in the financial industry. Nejc cofounded Quantum and leads the daily operations of the business and its development. Damian first cofounded BitStamp in 2011 and has now cofounded Quantum Project. Damian oversees Quantum’s liquidity pool, and is also busy working diligently on the Tokens.net trading exchange. Sebastjan Stucl is the community manager for the project. Sebastjan is the common investor’s connection to the project, providing answers daily on the project’s progress and roadmap. For many investors, the crypto world is full of uncertainty and risk. Having these names behind the project should speak volumes to its credibility and potential. https://medium.com/@quantumproject/quantum-the-ideal-business-model-861f9e9c90d1",False

Quote Buying the Q1S token is supporting the project, getting the possibility to convert to Gold with a bonus, getting a unhackable/uncrackable crypto currencty, a currency that both is like all others, a store of value but also a currency that will be used on the Quantum1Net platform as a means of transact funds when using the services that will be applied, such as file transfer, communication etc.  Quantum1Net will be on a global scale with a network overlay that is absolutley uncrackable and unhackable. ""A global network with multiple head ends to be able to handle global amounts of transactions down to microtransactions, instantly""  Quote ""...many parts of society needs to adapt and prepare for the coming 'quantum threat'. Governments, institutions, enterprises and blockchains, just to mention a few, has to be able to guarantee that they can handle threats that poses a risk to their business, such as cyber threats. We expect the quantum computing- and quantum security industry to grow exponentially within the near future, it is already a hot topic and many large cap organisations are scrambling to get on track with assuring 'quantum security'.""    Quote The price of gold tokens will be based upon the price of silver token when the conversion starts. So for ex. If the silver token is worth 100 EUR, 1 Gold Token will be worth 100 EUR. Since the hardcap for the 2nd sale of the Gold token is 200 million EUR, one can do the math of the Gold Token supply. (Bonuses are not uncluded for the sake of simplicity in the example) Keep in mind, that this is the *hard cap* we are using in the example.  So basically, the Silver Token will be tradable on exchanges and it will be up to the market to decide the price of silver/gold.  One of our supporters wrote the following regarding the fork to bitcoin and the price of the gold token:  Quote from: Moonwalker Demand and supply after ICO, fixed price before ICO. Put simply, They are forking bitcoin with added quantum security. So just look at past few bitcoin forks and do your own calculation.   I hope that answers your questions Andriyana If you have more questions, feel free to ask, we are happy to help!",False

If you are thinking about buying into quantum1net, think again. I have read the papers and they are only intended to look cool for the non-technical reader. All fancy equations about quantum mechanics and entanglement is just smoke and mirrors.  But why should you listen to me and not the quantum1net team?

We denote the signal and idle photons as |V_s> and |V_i> respectively > The wave function can be written as: > |gamma> = 1 / sqrt(2) (|V_i> = |V_s>)  This implies that V_i and V_s are in superposition not that they are entangled. Perhaps you meant `|gamma> = 1 / sqrt(2) (|V_i>|V_s> + |H_i>|H_s>)` ? If so you may want to rewrite that section to clarify it. I was also wondering if the yellow paper had recieved any outside review and if so who has reviewed it?  Also on page 8 of the yellow paper you state that timestamps are sent to both Alice and Bob: Is this over a classical network? How are Alice and Bob authenticated with the device sending the time stamps? i.e. How does the device know it is sending the time stamps to the correct Alice and Bob?,False

Authentication of the client was considered outside of the scope of the paper so it was not mentioned. It short, there is a 3 way communications: A and B are connencet via P2P and have unique IDs. The P2P connection has its own unique ID, which is also reported to the server. Using that data server will stream separate timesamps to both clients. The timestamps are aligned on the server when 3-way connection is established and immidetaly removed from the queue when requested via socket. If another device, even moking the same ID tris to interfere and request timestams from the server, timestamps will become misaligned, making it impossible to geberate an encryption key. It will also result in detection of a 3rd (unauthorized) client,  and session will be terminated. New ID will be generated a new session will start. In addition, we are designing our device so it is  capable of Quantum key distrubution configuration, when actual photons are sent via finber network between 2 devices (in this case one device is A and another B) and no timestamps aer sent over conventional networks.",False

Primarily, how is your proposal quantum-safe? The only thing talked about in the papers is a quantum random number generator, something that has been done for years. But random numbers does not give a quantum safe cryptosystem, you need a quantum-safe algorithm in order to protect against quantum computers.  In the proposal you try to show that your random numbers are ""better"" than a classical RNG/PRNG, however you do not even show the results from a randomness test battery like Diehard/Dieharder.  In fact, quantum random number generators are often worse than a PRNG, as shown by a student of mine.

Random numbers are only part of it, the paper does not detail the actual encryption algorithms, only the key distribution device is covered by Yellow paper. There are 2 applications 1) key generation using timestamps over conventional network when communicating entities receive timestamps (not actual random numbers), from which random bits are generated 2) key distribution by delivering actual photons (again, not numbers) over fiber networks.  The device generates random numbers that belong to certain linear group, Z4 would be one example, producing pairs of public and private keys, the encryption itself is not covered in the public papers, but can only be discussed with an NDA in place.  There are 3 separate parts to it:  1. The physical device capable of (true) quantum key distribution (partially covered by the yellow paper) 2. Encryption algorithms utilizing these keys (not kyes discussed in detail, there are many options) 3. Authentication of communicating entities in the real time using timestamps (if classical network) or photon detection (over quantum network)  We love discussing the topic and you are more than welcome to contact us for information regarding data or such, please contact us at info@quantum1net.com as we can not give you all the details without a signed NDA.

The device measures a time difference of detecting individual photons between 4 detectors. By defining the coincidence window we extract sequences of random numbers which we then converted to key pairs. There are several ways to utilize these random keys on a pair of communicating clients using simple computations, such as multidimensional cellar automata or training a cryptographic deep neural network.  The device is also designed to produce long strings of random numbers (in addition to keys that derived from the timestamp comparisons) which belongs to Z4 group, that can be used in conjunction or reparably from timestamps. These vector had such property that if you from a column vector using 4 streams the sum of all 4 column values must always be 1. This can be used for mutual authentication, since the values of each row cannot be predicted, any deviation from it will invalidate the transaction resulting in new encryption keys being generated due to a very low computational overhead, unique encryption keys can be generated for each transaction, so that even if somebody later obtains actual keys for a pacific transaction (for example if keys were stored on a client computer) they cannot be used to decrypt any other transaction (or any other data block for which this type of encryption is used).",False

A qubit is a two-state quantum-mechanical system, such as the polarization of a single photon: here the two states are vertical polarization and horizontal polarization.  In a classical system, a bit would have to be in one state or the other. However, quantum mechanics allows the qubit to be in a superposition of both states at the same time, a property that is fundamental to quantum computing. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit  So the way a qubit can be in a superposition in different states at the same time is what is so revolutionary.

The Silver Token is like a convertible note ( https://www.seedinvest.com/blog/startup-investing/how-convertible-notes-work ), meaning the ones who holds the Silver Token at the release of the closed Gold Token sale will get a priority and a discount. You do not need to hold the Silver Token all the way to the closed Gold Token release, you could sell all the Silver Tokens after the ICO and buy again before the release of the Gold Token to get the discount and priority. The convertible Silver Token is to take the prototype to product, so that is why it is like a normal convertible note.  Given that our project revolves around the vulnerability of conventional cryptography faced with quantum computing, the Gold Token is based on Bitcoin and features quantum encryption, making it both a testament to the feasibility of our technology and proof against quantum powered attacks. Further on, Bitcoin has the most solid code in the crypto space and best dev support.

For us it is important to be as transparent as possible with our investors (hence the white paper+yellow paper) as we have a finished working prototype.  Get back to me in the thread if you still have any question marks regarding the white- and yellow paper! Cheers!",False

With the introduction of quantum computers, the deterrent presented by RSA and other protocols will cease to be enough to stop hackers, as hacking them will become a worthwhile endeavor.  Generally speaking, encryption techniques today rely on hacking them not being worth the time and resources required. Finding the underlying pattern in a pseudo-random number generator to be able to predict the outcome can be costly, requiring a large number of samplings. Quantum computers will be able to perform the required operations much more efficiently and much faster, in hours or days.  Quantum1Net instead relies on a Quantum Encryption Key Generator (QEKG). Because of the properties of quantum computers itself, tests have shown that even in large samples, the numbers selected follow no pattern thus no predictive algorithm can be derived.",False

I will explain how it works below;  The Silver Token will be traded against the ETH using the ethereum blockchain.  The Silver Token is like a convertible note ( https://www.seedinvest.com/blog/startup-investing/how-convertible-notes-work ), meaning the ones who holds the Silver Token at the release of the closed Gold Token sale will get a priority and a discount. You do not need to hold the Silver Token all the way to the closed Gold Token release, you could sell all the Silver Tokens after the ICO and buy again before the release of the Gold Token to get the discount and priority. The convertible Silver Token is to take the prototype to product, so that is why it is like a normal convertible note.  Given that our project revolves around the vulnerability of conventional cryptography faced with quantum computing, the Gold Token is based on Bitcoin and features quantum encryption, making it both a testament to the feasibility of our technology and proof against quantum powered attacks. Further on, Bitcoin has the most solid code in the crypto space and best dev support.",False

The ICO starts the 2nd February, about one month from now. The initial Silver Token will trade for ETH only. The closed Gold Token offering will accept more currencies, Silver Tokens and BTC included. Silver token investors/holders will be prioritized during this second ICO.",False
