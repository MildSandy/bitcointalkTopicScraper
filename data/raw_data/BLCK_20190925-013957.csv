We will operate on a two-sided market - insurance brokers on one side, and Black Security Token investors on the other side (not to be confused with the BLCK utility token we will offer on the upcoming ICO; please see the whitepaper to learn about the difference).  Why do we rely on brokers for distribution instead of trying to sell directly to customers? We have seen that ramping up customer base is very hard in insurance. However, we have more and more brokers coming to us to have their products created on our platform, and these guys already have the customers. Thus, we don't need to do large scale marketing - they are doing it instead of us.  On the other side, we have the BST investors. Here, some marketing is definitely called upon, but our strategy is to first work with institutional investors like hedge funds, family offices and all others that already invest in insurance-backed assets. Here, too, our emphasis is on sales outreach rather than on blanket marketing.",False

Therefore, we don’t make any predictions over its future price. However, below we have laid out the main factors behind the BLCK tokenomics. The interplay of these components, a well-defined utility of BLCK on the platform and its associated intrinsic value contribute to higher economic sustainability of BLCK compared to crypto tokens that lack a clear connection between their utility and intrinsic economic value.  Speculation and Investment Component. This component reflects market expectations of the future platform development and BLCK demand and the willingness of investors to hold tokens for investment and speculation purposes in response to their expectations. The speculative interest varies according to the post-ICO promotion of the token, and to the degree to which Black Insurance meets its business goals.  Governance Staking Component. This component reflects the need of different stakeholders (namely, the ones that take role in syndicate governance) to hold BLCK for staking purposes as a guarantee of their honest behavior, and for the occasional need to deposit tokens as a warrant for potential conflict resolutions. The influence of this component becomes stronger as the number of syndicates and their size and complexity increases.  Convenience and Fee Mitigation Component. This component reflects the willingness to hold BLCK instead of fiat, or other crypto tokens, for convenience and in order to avoid exchange fees by accepting market price risk.  Transaction Volume Component. The more transactions are executed, the more demand there is for the tokens used in transactions as one of the major price formation components and driving factors.",False

Sound business plan - Black will ask Brokers to present their business plan.  Black’s  specialists  will  analyze  the  plan and consult with specialists in the local market if necessary.  Skin in the game - In order to align the interests of Brokers and Black, the Broker has to have their skin in the game. The Broker must pay a deposit of 5 - 25% of  planned  Gross  Written  Premiums  to  Black that will be used to cover the losses in case the business is unprofitable. In case the loss of the insurance portfolio exceeds 2x the deposit then the Broker is required to fill in the deposit or he can not write new business anymore  Black’s own underwriting know how - Over time Black will gather large quantities of data from different markets, and by analyzing it with machine learning and AI, Black is able to calculate the prices at which any insurance business can be profitable. We will implement smart contracts that accept insurance policies from Brokers only in case insurance premium is at least on the level that does not create loss to Black.  Community references - We require the Broker to have at least two positive references from the market where he operates.  The  references  have  to  prove  that  the  Broker is able to underwrite a profitable book of insurance business.

Now there are a couple of separate questions here, addressing one by one:  1) Black is a crowdsourcing platform that enables brokers to come up with their own insurance schemes, and fund the schemes by selling ""shares"" to crypto investors. We already have close to 60 brokers, doing $350M sales annually who want to work with us. These brokers continue to transact with their existing customers, using whichever currency the customers prefer. Once the brokers have received the insurance payments (premiums), they convert it to BLCK tokens and bring to the platform.  The advantages of this approach are twofold: first, we don't have to worry about sales - the brokers already come with the customers, and second, the customers will not have to start using cryptocurrencies and this way we have a far larger target market.  2) We are targeting the European Union market first, since the insurance regulation is the most relaxed here.  3) In terms of helping the communities. First, Black will start issuing ""insurance backed security tokens"" in the future. This is an absolutely new crypto asset class, and we will pave the way for others to come and create their own crypto-based ETF-s and other crypto securities investment schemes. Second, since insurance industry has been real lazy to cover risks in emerging markets (mainly Africa), Black could potentially help a lot of farmers, artisans and others who currently suffer great losses since no access to insurance.",False

For now we are planning to accept BTC and ETH as payments.  While we will have our own insurance license only in Europe, to start with, we can do business in other regions by using a ""fronting insurer"" (basically a local insurer lends its license for a fee that's usually 3-5%), or through Lloyds of London license.  We have a roadmap for applying for an insurance license just in Europe (EEA), currently. Becoming a licensed insurer is unfortunately a costly and time consuming exercise, but we have great advisors and everything is in place.  This means that in 2019, we and our users are only eligible to write insurance policies in EEA. However, a portion of the future business users (we have a network of dozens insurance brokers and other parties) already have the necessary licenses, and they can start issuing policies in other countries right after the platform is live.  Down the road, we intend to apply for licenses at other markets as well, with current plans to start expansion with the US.",False

We indeed have plenty of blockchain / insurance related companies on our radar.  We are seeing the blockchain / insurance landscape or positioning as follows (from simplest to most complex):  -Service providers create blockchain solutions for the insurance industry, without participating in the insurance vertical themselves  -Products companies create new, innovative insurance products (e.g. parametric insurance, IoT related stuff etc), by establishing a partnership with an insurance company to underwrite the policies, and sell to customers  -Carriers are product companies (above) that don't partner with an existing insurer, and attempt to become a licensed insurer themselves  -Marketplaces (Black) enable creation, capitalisation and distribution of insurance products by platform members, that can include other insurers, brokers, agents and all insurance industry members. We don’t create the products, they do it. This strategy also requires an insurance license, and much more.   Black is currently the one of the very few blockchain / insurance startups actively pursuing the marketplace strategy, and the only one that will enable launching any type of insurance products. The part of the value chain our positioning addresses, is the biggest and most fundamental - all insurance products in the world are created and capitalised, and currently the only ways are through an insurance company, or Lloyd's of London. We're adding a third option.    ",False

There are three reasons for that 1) insured assets are valued in fiat, so insurance must also be transacted in fiat. If ETH goes down 30%, your car repairs would still cost the same, thus if you want your insurance compensation in fiat, the premiums must be nominated in fiat as well. 2) cryptos are still not widely adopted. Many people can't buy insurance if they can only pay in crypto; since we aim to become very big, we need to include everyone. 3) Regulation around charging premiums in cryptos is tricky at this point.

Black does not imply illegal, we are totally legal!   Black is a digital insurance company on blockchain. Our platform connects insurance brokers directly with capital enabling them to launch their own virtual insurance companies. Thus removing the trusted third parties (Insurance Companies) from the value chain.  First, Black is a platform where our business users can design insurance covers, get them capitalised, and write policies. Formally, it's Black Insurance that is writing the policies on behalf of the business users, but we don't design, underwrite or sell the insurance products ourselves - that's up to our users.  We have a roadmap for applying for an insurance license just in Europe (EEA), currently. Becoming a licensed insurer is unfortunately a costly and time consuming exercise, but we have great advisors and everything is in place.  This means that in 2019, we and our users are only eligible to write insurance policies in EEA. However, a portion of the future business users (we have a network of dozens insurance brokers and other parties) already have the necessary licenses, and they can start issuing policies in other countries right after the platform is live. Down the road, we intend to apply for licenses at other markets as well, with current plans to start expansion with the US.

Black Syndicate Tokens (BST) is a security token. BST will be issued when the platform is ready. BSTs can only be purchased and owned by verified “Accredited Investors”. BSTs are investments created by Syndicates that will earn a profit, and the amount and types of BSTs will grow and shrink based on the different types of Syndicates that exist at any given time.  The Black Platform will allow Investors to join together into an investment fund called a Syndicate, and Investors will receive Tokens from the Syndicate in exchange for their investments.  These Black Syndicate Tokens (BSTs) are a special class of Tokens that will be issued when Syndicates are being launched or when they are distributing Profit to their Investors. Each Syndicate will issue their own BST with a unique name and Risk / Reward profile. In its most basic form, a BST will behave like an interest-bearing security (a bond), where holders will calculate the value of a BST as the combination of historical payments.

The goal of Black platform is to empower the insurance brokers by connecting them directly with capital, allowing them to launch their own virtual insurance companies.  The new Scientific Advisor for Black Insurance, Professor Alex Norta is the owner of Norta & Partners, offering holistic consultation and software development service in the field of blockchain technology. He has advised and written whitepapers for many successful blockchain projects such as: Neo, Qtum, Cedex, Datawallet, Cashaa and many more. In the past, he has worked as a post-doctorial researcher on the SOAMeS project at the computer-science department of Helsinki University. His research on a PhD about dynamic inter-organizational business process collaboration was featured in an FP6-EU research project called CrossWork.  “The insurance industry today is slow with bringing products to market because of excessive bureaucracy that distorts free-market mechanisms to the detriment of customers,” explains Prof. Norta.  “Blockchain technology is a means to replace this excessive bureaucracy with a novel control mechanism that is much cheaper, faster and more trustable.

We indeed have plenty of blockchain / insurance related companies on our radar, including Etherisc, Blocksure, Insurepal, ixledger, PolicyPal, ChainThat, fidentiaX, InsurChain, B3i etc.  Now, in my mind, I'm seeing the blockchain / insurance landscape or positioning as follows (from simplest to most complex): Service providers create blockchain solutions for the insurance industry, without participating in the insurance vertical themselves Products companies create new, innovative insurance products (e.g. parametric insurance, IoT related stuff etc), by establishing a partnership with an insurance company to underwrite the policies, and sell to customers Insurance companies are product companies (above) that don't partner with an existing insurer, and attempt to become a licensed insurer themselves Marketplaces enable creation, capitalisation and distribution of insurance products for platform members, that can include other insurers, brokers, agents and all insurance industry members. This strategy also requires an insurance license, and much more.  As far as we know, Black is currently the only blockchain / insurance startup that is actively pursuing the marketplace strategy. The part of the value chain our positioning addresses, is the biggest and most fundamental - all insurance products in the world are created and capitalised, and currently the only ways are through an insurance company, or Lloyd's of London.

Life, property, liability etc. It's up to Syndicates to select which products they invest in, and to Investors to decide which Syndicate they fund in ICO-s.  Now, what are Syndicates? Syndicates are groups of insurance professionals that create ICO-s of BSTx tokens on the Black platform (x representing the number of the Syndicate), and invest in insurance products, also listed on the Black platform. For instance, some entrepreneur creates a crypto wallet insurance, and a syndicate invests in this product. The product can be now traded, and should it make profits, BSTx token investors share the profits.  Why don't investors invest directly in insurance products? Because managing an insurance product is a professional activity, requiring underwriting, actuary, claims handling and adjustment, and reporting capabilities. This is what Syndicate takes care of, in addition to selecting a well balanced portfolio of different insurance products to invest in.",False

Insurance policy administration is a notoriously complex thing, but our staff includes people with ~20 years of policy admin technology experience. Become a licensed insurer. In order to enable our users (Syndicates and Brokers) write any insurance policies, we need to be licensed. This requires reserve capital, and also involves significant legal costs. Attract Syndicates, Brokers and Investors to join the platform and start transacting business. This requires marketing and sales outreach.   2 who are your competitors in the cryptoshpere?  We indeed have plenty of blockchain / insurance related companies on our radar, including Etherisc, Blocksure, Insurepal, ixledger, PolicyPal, ChainThat, fidentiaX, InsurChain, B3i etc.  Now, in my mind, I'm seeing the blockchain / insurance landscape or positioning as follows (from simplest to most complex): Service providers create blockchain solutions for the insurance industry, without participating in the insurance vertical themselves Products companies create new, innovative insurance products (e.g. parametric insurance, IoT related stuff etc), by establishing a partnership with an insurance company to underwrite the policies, and sell to customers Insurance companies are product companies (above) that don't partner with an existing insurer, and attempt to become a licensed insurer themselves Marketplaces enable creation, capitalisation and distribution of insurance products for platform members, that can include other insurers, brokers, agents and all insurance industry members. This strategy also requires an insurance license, and much more.  As far as we know, Black is currently the only blockchain / insurance startup that is actively pursuing the marketplace strategy. The part of the value chain our positioning addresses, is the biggest and most fundamental - all insurance products in the world are created and capitalised, and currently the only ways are through an insurance company, or Lloyd's of London. We're adding a third option.  However, please do list interesting competitors, should you know any!",False

Issuing policies, handling claims and other transactions cost users Black utility tokens (BLCK).

For instance, some entrepreneur creates a crypto wallet insurance, and a syndicate invests in this product.

First, Black is only a platform where our business users can design insurance covers, get them capitalised, and write policies. Formally, it's Black Insurance that is writing the policies, though, on behalf of the business users, but we don't design or sell the products ourselves - that's up to our users.  We have a roadmap for applying for an insurance license just in Europe (EEA), currently. Becoming a licensed insurer is unfortunately a costly and time consuming exercise, but we have great advisors and everything is in place.  This means that in 2019, we and our users are only eligible to write insurance policies in EEA. However, a portion of the future business users (we have a network of dozens insurance brokers and other parties) already have the necessary licenses, and they can start issuing policies in other countries right after the platform is live.  Down the road, we intend to apply for licenses at other markets as well, with US being the usual suspect, of course.",False

We indeed have plenty of blockchain / insurance related companies on our radar, including Etherisc, Blocksure, Insurepal, ixledger, PolicyPal, ChainThat, fidentiaX, InsurChain, B3i etc.  Now, in my mind, I'm seeing the blockchain / insurance landscape or positioning as follows (from simplest to most complex): Service providers create blockchain solutions for the insurance industry, without participating in the insurance vertical themselves Products companies create new, innovative insurance products (e.g. parametric insurance, IoT related stuff etc), by establishing a partnership with an insurance company to underwrite the policies, and sell to customers Insurance companies are product companies (above) that don't partner with an existing insurer, and attempt to become a licensed insurer themselves Marketplaces enable creation, capitalisation and distribution of insurance products for platform members, that can include other insurers, brokers, agents and all insurance industry members. This strategy also requires an insurance license, and much more.  As far as we know, Black is currently the only blockchain / insurance startup that is actively pursuing the marketplace strategy. The part of the value chain our positioning addresses, is the biggest and most fundamental - all insurance products in the world are created and capitalised, and currently the only ways are through an insurance company, or Lloyd's of London. We're adding a third option.  Hope this provides an answer, at least to a degree. Please don't hesitate to ask for clarification or elaboration.  Thanks!",False
