In addition to that, unlike the traditional materials that provide value (e.g. precious metals), NAFEN does not occur in nature, and therefore the amount of artificially produced material can be strictly controlled.

Generally, it is used for different applications depending on the industry, for example -  In metallurgy - Metal-matrix composites. NAFEN™ is a base for the strengthening of metal matrices. Composite powder materials for 3D printing; cable production - wires for power lines; aluminum alloys – construction, rolled metal products, automotive industry, aircraft industry, spacecraft, and satellites.  In oil industry - Nafen can be applied as Catalyst or catalyst carrier. The small diameter of the fibers, high specific surface area, and activity associated with the specific structure of such nanoparticles strongly enhances catalytic properties and increases the potential for use of aluminum oxide nanofibers on a massive scale as a catalyst with high selectivity.  In modern cars, airplanes a lot of composite materials are used. So NAFEN works on a molecular scale to reinforce the polymer matrix by creating a 3D nanomesh within the matrix and strengthening against both compressive and pulling forces. This makes NAFEN™ ideal for use in composites and adhesives to increase compression strength, tensile strength, interlaminar shear, lap shear and other mechanical properties.  You can find out more about such applications in the whitepaper.",False

We are the producer of unique and patented nanofibers which are currently sold all over the world! «NAFEN™» is a project combining advanced technologies in the field of industrial production of a unique crystalline material, which is alumina nanofibers (Al2O3). The high quality and outstanding characteristics of NAFEN™ create vast opportunities for its use in the improvement of mechanical and physicochemical properties of various materials used in such industries as:  Energy creation and storage Fuel Cell technology Metallurgy Chemical and petrochemical production Advanced Materials Engineering Aerospace industry Automotive industry Marine construction and maintenance Electronics industry Building materials industry  The production process is unique in terms of high-performance, scalable technology, and will allow for significant reductions in the final cost of the nanofibers and, consequently, will make it available and more attractive for widespread industrial use.  Watch The Introduction    We are offering to anyone interested in our project an opportunity to participate in the development and construction of a new industrial production facility, which will increase the volume of production and optimize the price of nanofibers, thus allowing the material to revolutionize the huge market of different industries  Read our White Paper to get more technical details  Join our Telegram to ask anything about NAFEN   ICO Campaign  • We create a blockchain currency—NFN token—that is equivalent to a voucher giving 100% discount for 1 gram of NAFEN™ nanofibers. • You, as the owner of the token, will be able to exchange your token for our material, and as the added bonus you also can sell it directly to person(s) or entities interested in purchasing NAFEN™ (e.g. companies that use nanofibers in their products). • We will be listing the NFN token on several cryptocurrency exchanges. So you will be able to sell your tokens at the market price on the exchanges at any given time. • We expect to buyback a proportional number of tokens from the exchanges when our industrial customers order NAFEN ™ nanofibers through our product sales system. • If the price of the token on the cryptocurrency exchange is lower than the price that we agreed with the buyer, the difference will be considered operational profit for the company. If the price of the token is higher than the selling price of our nanofibers (NAFEN ™ is undervalued in the exchange), we will proportionally increase the cost of the nanofibers. • Also, in order to accelerate the process of the token buyback, we will recommend that our industrial customers buy tokens directly from the cryptocurrency exchanges and trade those into the company for a proportional amount of nanofibers. • Our NFN token smart-contract fully complies with the ERC20 standard and has a number of additional functions. Technical implementation of our smart-contract you can find on our GitHub.   ICO Rounds  The initial placement of the tokens will be conducted in 2 rounds:  Pre-Sale Token Sale  Dates of the rounds will be determined during the period of preparation for ICO and will be announced in advance on the company’s official website, as well as in the official ANN thread and social media. Each of the rounds will be limited by time, but will not have any restrictions on the volume of attracted investments.  Soft-cap = 2,500,000 € applies in the case when we do not collect the minimum amount of financial assets during three rounds. If the soft-cap amount is not reached, all investors will receive their investments back.  Hard-cap = 14 000 000 € is strictly limited and when the maximum amount of financial assets is reached, the smart contract will automatically stop receiving any investments, and if necessary, return the overpayments back. The distribution of bonuses for investors based on the volume of emissions would look as follows:    Terms of Crowdsale  1. The smart-contract basis is the Crowdsale contract, which performs the function of selling tokens with pre-defined conditions. The sale of tokens is divided into two stages. Starting dates and duration of each stage are specified when the contract is activated (deployed) while starting dated and duration periods can be changed by the contract holder. All these data are public and visible to all users. 2. For FIAT investors tokens can be issued manually at a pre-agreed amount in euros, which can be transferred to our bank account or in some other alternative way. Such amounts are counted in smart-contact and are public information. 3. Whitelist / Blacklist. The smart-contact publicly implemented the system of white- and blacklist. Tokens sale and counting in capitalization are made only according to the whitelist addresses. An investor can get into the whitelist after passing KYC procedures. 4. In case of getting into the blacklist, for example, because of the legislative prohibition of the country of residence, such investor can independently start the function of automatic money return to the wallet, or request a refund from us. Upon the return, these tokens are automatically burned and are not included in the total capitalization, as well as smart-contract gets the opportunity to issue new tokens instead of burnt ones. 5. The end of the crowdsale occurs automatically by collecting the hard-cap or at the end of the last stage, which of them will come sooner. Collected cryptocurrency will be sent to the multisig address, given when the contact is activated and such information is public. 6. Team receives 10% bonus in addition to total issued tokens amount. Team bonus will be sent to the team address at the end of the crowdsale and such information is public.

Let me explain the idea of this ICO.  Yes, you are right - the material itself has excellent properties and opportunities in many applications, however, we can't sell the appropriate amount of Nafen fibers for industry key-players now because we have the pilot-scale plant, that cannot provide the effective mass production of Nafen for multiple economic and technical reasons.  We sell tokens due to the fact that our main task is to increase the volume of fibers synthesis by building the new plant and thereby increasing sales. And at the same time, high volume of sales will allow us to do the buyback of NFN tokens!  That's why our ICO project campaign deals with the so-called “funding gap” for bringing the working solutions (small production of existing NAFEN materials) into full high-scale commercial availability for big market players.",False
