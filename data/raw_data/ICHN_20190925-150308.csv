Watch the video to get the idea of our project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usVx8KNqLdI.  Our project is not like many other blockchain projects. Firstly, I-CHAIN platform is ready. And, there is the first product on the platform – crypto bank. It means if you register at platform – you can organize own crypto bank in 30 minutes. Secondly, the purpose of I-CHAIN is not to earn money, but to give everybody the opportunity to create own business.  But first of all you need our token. Now it is available here: https://i-chain.net, TOKEN. If you have any problems, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mw5QWt0MaFg.  ICHN token gives you the opportunity to create your own business on the platform. For the present there is only one product – mini-bank. You can open your own crypto bank providing secure crypto deposit, real human support, easy process of fiat money to crypto conversion and ability to restore access to funds even if you lost your wallet. In the very near future there will be many more business alternatives. For instance, soon we expect insurance fund for community and 2 products that you have chosen - payment system (p2p) and product/service guarantee. In sum, this year – dozens of products.  The platform attracts initiative people, and these people already run their businesses on the platform and develop it. To run a mini-bank you need half an hour of time and desire.  We are planning a lot of products; there will be a lot of variants of your own business on the platform, too. To get started, you need an Utility token, its price is now floating, it is about 0,45 ETH.  As for utility from the point of view of the end user (common for the platform as a whole and its any products): When you take out insurance in the insurance company and the risk did not happen, the company takes your money. In the case of a platform product, for example, ""the community of insurers"" - money remains in the community and can be spent on community needs. The policy is cheaper (there is no additional charges, as in a ""classic"" insurance company). Transparency of decisions made - you vote for the payments yourself. As for utility from the point of view of a merchant: With the help of the platform, you can organize your own business in a few clicks. You just need an Utility token for every 1000 clients, organize advertising, invite clients and get their support.  How it works: in about 30 minutes you can set up your product on the platform, then serve the customers and earn commissions.  You can contact us via e-mail: sales@i-chain.net. Our colleague will answer on your questions and help to start a business on I-CHAIN.NET platform.  Today ICO subject is surrounded by negative stuff. That's why we closed I-CHAIN ICO ahead of time, on the 15th of January, 2019. Now our token is available on secondary market. In any case, we continue to work, regardless of whether the ICO is open or not.  Platform is ready, you can become a partner and start your own business on the Platform if you have I-CHAIN.NET token.  https://marketplace.i-chain.net/, https://docs.i-chain.net/  Together we will improve customer experience in insurance and finance industry.",False

I-CHAIN major features and services  Insurers (partners) can publish their products on the Platform, customers can buy and use these products. Platform will cover common insurance processes (i.e. sales, claim processing) and channels of communication (website, mobile application). Also it will be possible to design additional products with extended processes and channels and place these products on marketplace for Insurers to acquire and use them for their business expansion. Risk pools will be created to cover insurance risks and there will be possibility to invest into Risk pools.  Main advantages  Affordability Insurance companies, just businesses or individual entrepreneurs will connect to the I-chain to create their products and then sell them to consumers. Also, anyone who want to obtain insurance will have an opportunity to do so directly on the website, using social networks, mobile applications or instant messengers. In addition, partner companies and consumers will use it for free. It is planned to charge a commission of 0.5% transaction fee for each transaction conducted on the platform. The money will help to maintain and develop our online platform.  Transparency The development of the platform is transparent, and the final product does not depend on the founders of the project.  Diversity We have the opportunity to expand the range of insurance products due to lower prices and the absence of bureaucratic superstructure.  I-CHAIN solving problems  The Platform will resolve many issues. First of all, scalability issues will be resolved by the fact that blockchain layer will be used by portion of data when it is only needed, parts of data needed for insurance companies will be located on our platform. Secondly, Platform will shorten time-to-market, insurers will not need to build their solutions from the scratch, platform will provide them framework and will not require deep expertise in blockchain to start sell “ic insurance” products. Moreover, common platform will also help to resolve common regulatory issues, as it will lobby interest of all industry players and their customers. I-CHAIN Platform will make it possible for individual insurers to compete for customers, offering a range of custom products they will set up with products constructor. Platform will also allow the industry as a whole to streamline its processing and offer a better user experience for customers who have to make a claim. In addition, storing claims and customer information on a blockchain would cut down fraudulent activity – it would certainly make it much harder for criminals to mask their identities or attempt to claim more than once.  Technology behind I-CHAIN  I-CHAIN is based on blockchain technology. Thus, all information about customers, insurance contracts and transactions will be stored in blockchain. This will guarantee maximum transparency, significantly reduce costs of preventing fraud activities, which are borne by insurance companies nowadays, and simplify report preparation for regulators. Our platform is so-called ""Uber of insurance."" It will connect insurance companies, related businesses and consumers and radically change the insurance industry. Blockchain slowly but steadily gets into various spheres of our life. After full version platform launch, we plan to conduct a global marketing campaign and establish partnerships with companies around the world. The market of Blockchain for insurance has no country borders or limits.

We built platform which will allow anyone quickly create own insurance product and act as insurance company, platform will cover not only IT/business processes/sales but legal/licensing needs. And most %% of budget is needed for that (legal/licensing). If we analyze budget to setup insurance company, we will see that licensing is 80-90% of it.

In most developed and developing countries government regulation, which is associated with the toughening of requirements for the production of tokens, and in some cases a complete ban on the production of tokens, makes it difficult to use the ICO mechanism to distribute tokens. In such circumstances due to increased legal risks Glass Cube Ltd. considers it inappropriate to continue the ICO and notifies of its closure on January 15, 2019. Until January 15, 2019, tokens will be still available through the ICO. After January 15, 2019, tokens will be available on secondary market organized by our company. Check out the latest news on our website. Quite possibly in the secondary market the price of tokens will be higher. All ICHN tokens’ holders will certainly be able to take the privilege granted by these tokens according to the Whitepaper.  Specifically, you get the access to our marketplace: https://marketplace.i-chain.net. You will find our first product “mini-bank” («secure deposit») there. Register at marketplace and start your own business on Platform, organize your own crypto-bank. One token makes it possible to create business for 1000 clients.
