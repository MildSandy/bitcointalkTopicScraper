Autoria (ERC20 Token Symbol: AUT) is a new paradigm in cryptocurrency. Our unique Proof of Stake distribution method is the first supply-curve modeled cryptocurrency in the world. We are a U.S. company based out of Ohio. Our talented team, which includes an Ebay software engineer and a NASA associate, have helped create what we feel is the most sophisticated and fundamentally sound token distribution model in the world. We feel privileged to welcome you to our project. We hope you'll enjoy using AUT as much as we've enjoyed creating it.        Key Dates   Don’t Forget to Claim your Mining Well!   Autoria's hard-capped ICO will occur on Autoria.io starting: July 14th until August 4th   Autoria is using a sophisticated supply-curve modeled distribution system which automatically mines AUT tokens based on a 4 factor growth equation. The technical details of this system are outlined here in our yellowpaper (http://autoria.io/yellowpaper.pdf). The token release rate is linear at first and then tapers off as growth and adoption of AUT stabilize. Our token contract is optimized to minimize gas costs and provide future functionalities for easy integration in decentralized applications. Our equation also allows us to reward participants directly by increasing the number of tokens in the mining pool. Our growth equation then automatically adjusts the rate at which AUT tokens are mined. participants will have a 3 week timeframe (July 14th through Aug. 4th) to reserve a stake in AUT. These stakes, or 'Mining Wells' are permanently registered into the Ethereum blockchain and are the only AUT token generating assets available. Each participant will be limited to a 100ETH maximum stake in order to ensure diversity of Mining Well Addresses.   ________________________________________________________     What We Are  ________________________________________________________     Introduction Driven by the growth in Ethereum and rising interest in advanced cryptocurrency smart contracts, Autoria intends to introduce a new standard for ERC20 tokens. We believe that both our unique Automated Self-Mining Tokens and our team’s dedication to building a robust Autorium (AUT) ecosystem sets us apart from all other Ethereum based cryptocurrencies. Our team (http://autoria.io/#team) is targeting a 7 trillion dollar industry ($7,000,000,000,000). Autoria is delivering a simple and safe framework for both users and merchants to use in ecommerce and Point of Sale transactions. We believe a great merchant service needs a fundamentally sound currency. That's why we've devoted as much attention as possible to ensuring our distribution methodology is 100% robust. Our goals area specific and measurable, complete with participant bonus distributions upon completion of major project milestones. Our roadmap to success and specific details (like our budget) are outlined on our website, http://autoria.io, or in our whitepaper, http://autoria.io/whitepaper.pdf Our platform of services is designed to tear down barriers to entry which have stood in the way of widespread cryptocurrency adoption. The Autoria team has a plan, and we want you to be part of it.   What is Autorium? AUT (Autorium) is the world's best Automatically Self Mining ERC20 compatible token built on the Ethereum blockchain. By distributing permanent Mining Wells (instead of mining nodes) before Autorium is circulated, Autoria takes the guesswork out of mining. Automated Well Mining is a permanent solution. Autorium is also the currency used in all of Autoria’s applications. Through collaboration with merchants and the continued development automated solutions, Autoria aims to solve to the biggest hurdles impairing widespread cryptocurrency adoption.  How it Works At Autoria’s foundation is a fundamentally new coin distribution model. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, which require expensive hardware to mine, Autorium is mined automatically. This introduces a new economic paradigm into the cryptocurrency market and provides a predictable rate of liquidity. Built directly into the Ethereum blockchain, this system is transparent and immutable. During our Independent Coin Offering, participants will have the opportunity to claim Mining Wells. Mining Wells are permanently registered to participant’s Ethereum wallets and can be thought of as the “mining nodes” of Autorium’s economy. By producing AUT at a predictable rate, per a mathematical formula, Autorium distribution is provably fair. participants who sieze the opportunity to participate in our ICO will have their Ethereum wallets hardcoded as Mining Wells and become permanent fixtures of Autorium liquidity.  But Autoria’s plan doesn’t stop there.  Autoria is dedicated to supporting and developing the Autorium economy. Autorium is used as currency in all of Autoria’s DAPP’s and Services. At launch these applications will consist of several games, but will continue grow to encompass Autoria’s Merchant Services and Payment Platforms.  What participants can Expect Our goal is to provide a solid foundational cryptocurrency on which a vast network of applications can be built. Our Phase I plans include a rapid listing schedule for major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Bitttrex and Poloniex, and Phase II involves retail during the roll-out of our Merchant Services. More details regarding our particular plans are made available in our whitepaper. participants will receive substantial bonus rewards upon reaching critical milestones. Over $11,000,000 USD worth of AUT tokens have been marked for rewarding early participants.   The Details AUT is the first supply-curve modeled currency distribution system. Mining is based on a mathematical function which is designed to evolve with the release of our decentralized applications. Total token supply at the end of the mining period will depend on the number of Mining Wells sold during the 3 week crowdsale. We believe our distribution model helps accomplish the following: - participants are limited to 100 ETH worth of AUT tokens, or 1,750,000 Tokens at the sale price. This means large participants can't monopolize AUT mining. This is a departure from other POS methods which incentivize monopolization of tokens.   - Our data on other high profile ICO's (such as Status) suggests that 95% of unique ICO funding addresses come from sales of 100 ETH or less. The 100 ETH hard cap also maximizes the diversity of mining addresses. This provides a solid, diverse, infrastructure for our currency.   - Mining wells are permanent. Other POS methods allow for exchange of the token generating assets, which reduces transparency and makes them vulnerable to attacks.   - AUT token distribution is supply-curve fit. That means, it's specifically designed to correspond with key milestones and Autoria application releases. This helps prevent hyper-inflation or hyper-deflation of AUT and allows for the significant appreciation of AUT’s marketcap over time.    ________________________________________________________  Welcome to Autoria    AUTORIA – World’s best Automatically Mined Cryptocurrency and Developer Supported Ecosystem ________________________________________________________ Ecosystem Roadmap    Upon reaching specific measurable goals, Autoria will distribute a series of tiered AUT rewards to all initial participants, these reward tiers are described in detail in our whitepaper.
