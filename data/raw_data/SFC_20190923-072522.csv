We are introducing a new milestone-based funding system with complete transparency for our backers. From now on the funding goals will be broken down into smaller steps allowing our backers to see exactly how effectively the funds are being used.  Such funding system was approved by major backers and our expert advisors and is implemented in context of current market situation as a proactive measure of ensuring the successful fund raising campaign.  Each development phase consists of a number of milestones, each milestone requires certain funding in order to be completed. Refer to the picture below (community build milestones).   Check out the roadmap on our website to see each development phase and learn more about each step, either planned or finished.  Our position on using the system is very clear: we want to achieve complete transparency and approval from our backers, as such system is unique among the ICO projects which usually do not set the clear short-term goals or provide any intermediate results, keeping the backers nervous and waiting for at least some of the promised products or services.  Instead of using the old soft and hard cap system we will have clear milestones. Once all the major goals are complete, the stretch goal system will be implemented, the period of raising funds for the stretch goals (effective marketing campaigns, localization and internationalization ) will be determined by our contributors via the voting system.  SafeCrypt.io is determined to solve the actual problems of the market and we always take into account the feedback collected from our community. We believe that the introduction of the new funding system with its complete transparency will be welcomed and appreciated and will help us increase our reputation even further and succeed within the unstable market situation.

The public pre-sale phase of SafeCrypt.io ICO is starting soon and the registration will be open. We remind you that major and regular investment bonuses will be x3 times bigger during the first 24h of the pre-sale. The amount of tokens available for purchase with triple bonuses applied will be limited to 27.4%  A collective contribution (co-op) functionality will also be available for all contributors.  The co-op rules:  1. Every user who created an account on SafeCrypt.io website is allowed to start a new Co-op or join an existing ongoing Co-op by entering a corresponding Co-op ID if such Co-op ID is known by the user. 2. A Co-op ID is a character-based identifier. 3. Each Co-op has it's own unique ID. 4. Any Co-op is time-limited and is active for 12 hours only. 5. A Co-op may not be stopped or restarted. 6. The number of participants in a Co-op is unlimited. 7. If Co-op participants collectively purchase the minimum amount of SFC required to receive a bonus, such Co-op is considered successful and each participant receives a number of bonus tokens corresponding to their purchase during the Co-op.  Example: A user joins a Co-op on the fourth day of the pre-sale phase and purchases 50000 SFC while the Co-op is active (within 12 hours since the moment the Co-op started). The Co-op is successful and results in a total collective purchase of 150000 SFC which grants every participant with +15% bonus tokens. The user receives 50000 SFC + 7500 SFC as an additional bonus, 57500 SFC total.  8. An initiator of a successful Co-op (a user who started such Co-op) receives additional bonus tokens equal to 5% of a total number of tokens collectively purchased by the participants during the Co-op. This bonus has a fixed value that is not affected by time. Thus, having created a successful Co-op that resulted in a collective purchase of 1 mln. SFC, the Initiator receives 50000 SFC as an Initiator Bonus.  The co-op bonuses are also x3 during the first 24 hours of the public pre-sale.",False

In some jurisdictions ICOs and cryptocurrency in general are very controversial topic. In the US, for instance, ICO is regarded as operations with illegal securities, thus being a citizen of the US and participating in ICO puts you at risk, therefore we do not recommend citizens of certain countries (such as China and USA) to participate in ICO events at all to avoid potential problems with tax commission agencies.

Market Share Daily aggregate exchange volume of the top 100 most popular cryptoexchange platforms is more than $8 bln. and it keeps growing constantly. SafeCrypt.io exchange will take 0.06% fee per transaction, which would be one the lowest fees on the cryptomarket. By providing the highest quality cryptoexchange service and effectively satisfying the market demand, SafeCrypt will achieve strong economic growth and increase its market share:  Pessimistic Prediction Market Share = 0.9% Daily Exchange Volume = 0.9% of 8bln = 72000000 ($72mln) SafeCrypt.io fee = 0.06% of 72mln = 43200 (~$43 thousand daily)  Realistic Prediction Market Share = 5% Daily Exchange Volume = 5% of 8bln = 400000000 ($400mln) SafeCrypt.io fee = 0.06% of 400mln = 240000 ($240 thousand daily)  Optimistic Prediction Market Share = 9.6% Daily Exchange Volume = 9.6% of 8bln = 768000000 ($768mln) SafeCrypt.io fee = 0.06% of 768mln = 460800 (~$460 thousand daily)  It goes without saying that SafeCrypt.io will put all reasonable efforts into making the optimistic prediction become reality. 9.6% of market share is achievable with sufficient funding and by focusing the available resources on the realization of the planned activities (as specified on p.23-24 of the Whitepaper).  The lowest fees on the market, solid development team, implementation of effective marketing strategy and constantly growing reputation of SafeCrypt.io Exchange will ensure exponential growth of the platform’s popularity up until it becomes the place-to-go when it comes to cryptoexchange. Our marketing team claims that it should be called a “very optimistic” prediction; and although the numbers clearly show that it is possible (exchange volumes’ increase rate is growing each day), SafeCrypt development team decided not to single out such prediction.

Here is an excerpt from the Whitepaper about dividends and token repurchase (p.27):  Dividends  Once SafeCrypt exchange is fully functional, the major token holders will receive monthly dividends in accordance to the amount of tokens the investors hold. The dividends will be distributed monthly among the biggest token holders from the moment of SafeCrypt.io platform official release. The minimum amount of SFC tokens the stakeholder owns must be 1% of total token supply or more in order to receive dividends. The value for dividends is calculated from net operating surplus.  Thus, let's say that having generated $13,8mln of income from fees (calculated based on the Optimistic Prediction of 9.6% of market share, refer to p.26 of the Whitepaper), SafeCrypt.io has $10mln of net operating surplus. A stakeholder owning 1% of total SFC will gain dividends equal to $100000 each month ($100 thousand monthly).  Token Repurchase  Stage 1 SafeCrypt will initiate the repurchase process of the tokens sold during the crowdsale 6 months after the ICO is over at a price of 115% of the initial value in order to stabilize the market price and compensate for the sale bonuses. Every investor will be able to benefit at least 15% of their investment by simply selling the tokens on the market.  Stage 2 After the official release of the exchange platform SafeCrypt.io will initiate the second phase of token buy back at a rate of 200% of the initial token price. Note: The buyback process will guarantee the minimum token value on the secondary market and will enable the SFC token holders to benefit directly via trading.   Thus, to be eligible for dividends a contributor must hold 1% or more of the total amount of tokens issued. The dividends are paid in a form of ETH, BTC or other major cryptocurrencies directly to a contributor's wallet (by default, the ETH wallet address used by a contributor during registration). Note that all the unsold tokens will be burnt, therefore the 1% of total tokens left might be much less and with all additional bonuses investors will be able to save a lot. We remind you that up to 27.4% of the tokens will be available for the whitelisted backers. The special presale for those who get whitelisted will last for 24 hours only. Bonuses for early backers will be x3 of those available for the rest of the presale phase.  Hopefully that answers your question,  Thank you.",False

Fully automated transaction processing system - a working merchant mechanics with 44 cryptocurrencies already being accepted in order to allow a wider audience of cryptoinvestors to take part and effectively capitalize on the SafeCrypt.io coin offering.  Multi-trader collective investment functionality (Co-op) - a time-limited feature allowing multiple investors to make collective token purchases in order to obtain larger bonuses.  Completely automatic and accurate dynamic bonus calculation system ensuring timely scheduled and precise token distribution among the cryptoinvestors.  ICO Manager platform was developed to ensure effective management of all PR activities separately from the main platform in order to protect sensitive data and ensure fail-safe-by-design automation.  Mathematically verified economic model designed to secure the SafeCrypt.io token value and ensure stable and continuous growth of the projected ROI for the token holders.  Secure cloud network and data encryption methods have been developed by SafeCrypt.io specifically to store the encrytped metadata of all transactions and safeguard our backers. No force majore poses any threat to the transaction metadata which can be restored in 6.3 seconds time at any given moment. The cloud network guarantees that every transaction is recognized and every investor receives the full amount of tokens purchased during the ICO.  Read more in our Whitepaper.

We do not have direct competitors as the SafeCrypt.io platform model is unique. In case you mean other projects conducting an ICO, than the answer would is simple: prior to the ICO itself we already have a lot to show to our investors, not just vague plans and promises. To demonstrate the promised viability and the initial value to the SafeCrypt.io token holders we have operationalized a part of our framework in order to present the functional prototype of the cryptoexchange platform, along with some unique mechanics specially developed for our cryptoinvestors  (see the features list in the post above).  In case you mean other ICO projects, we are determined to become #1 cryptoexchange with the lowest fees possible (expected transaction fee is 0.06%) and the only platform providing full trading functionality and at the same time allowing traders to retain control over their assets at all time.  Dividends The major investors holding 1% and more of the total token supply will also receive monthly dividends from net operating surplus of the SafeCrypt.io Exchange Platform. Let’s say that having generated $6,9mln of income from fees (the number is based on less than 4.8% market share) SafeCrypt.io has $5mln of net operating surplus. A tokenholder owning 1% of total SFC will gain dividends equal to $50000 each month.  Token Repurchase Stage 1 SafeCrypt will initiate the repurchase process of the tokens sold during the crowdsale 6 months after the ICO is over at a price of 115% of the initial value in order to stabilize the market price and compensate for the sale bonuses. Every investor will be able to benefit at least 15% of their investment by simply selling the tokens on the market. Stage 2 After the official release of the exchange platform SafeCrypt.io will initiate the second phase of token buy back at a rate of 200% of the initial token price. Note: The buyback process will guarantee the minimum token value on the secondary market and will enable the SFC token holders to benefit directly via trading.  And let’s not forget about indirect benefits for the whole crypto community. The more stable the market, the easier it is to build services upon it, the faster the development. Every time a faulty exchange platform collapses, the whole community suffers and that is unacceptable. With SafeCrypt.io we intended to stabilize the cryptomarket and ensure its continuous growth.

For instance, you want to exchange your Bitcoin to Ripple when relative ""buy"" price for Ripple reaches a certain value; as soon as the condition is met you will receive a notification:  - push notification for SafeCrypt.io mobile app; - browser notification for the web version; - text message or email notififaction as an option (set by user).  It works as a substitute for placing orders on regular exchange platforms but with no requirement for the assets to be stored within the platform, thus lowering the risks for our traders to zero.   Customizable news or signals aggregator  This feature will be added by popular request. Traders will be able to set up a custom news feed to monitor all important events and trends signaling for potential changes in exchange rates of selected cryptocurrencies.  The feed will allow our traders to stay tuned with crypto market's fluctuations and react promptly and accordingly. A list of available sources of news will include:  1. External websites; 2. Social networks (Twitter and Facebook); 3. Telegram channels; 4. Other sources (TBA).   Trading effectiveness analysis  An optional feature that will analyze the effectiveness of previous trading operations performed by user. It will act as user's personal stats log which can be analized to improve the user's trading methods and overall effectiveness.  This feature will be customizable and is disabled (no logging) by default.  Cryptocurrency mixing functionality  The cryptocurrency mixing is a feature for traders seeking maximum anonymity. The feaure is already functional and includes:  1. multi cryptocurrency mixing - traders will be able to exchange BTC to ETH, Ripple and other cryptocurrencies or ERC20 tokens in specified proportions;  2. delayed transactions  - time delays can be set up by a trader for each transaction (example: send 20% of my ETH in 50 minutes and the remaining 80% two hours later).  As we were advised by our legal consultants, the mixing functionality is a controversial topic and we will either create a mirror for the platform to make it available for our traders or will limit it to non-controversial functionalities. SafeCrypt.io strives for maximum security and anonymity for crypto traders and we will put all reasonable efforts to have this feature available for everyone using SafeCrypt.io Cryptoexchange Platform.   Thank you for the question, hope you will find the answer exhaustive.  Kind regards.",False

We've been asked a similar question in our interview to Inbound agency, NZ:  How does SafeCrypt differentiate itself from its competitors (if there are any)?  We do not have direct competitors as the SafeCrypt.io platform model is unique. In case you mean other projects conducting an ICO, than the answer would be simple: prior to the ICO itself we already have a lot to show to our investors, not just vague plans and promises. To demonstrate the promised viability and the initial value to the SafeCrypt.io token holders we have operationalized a part of our framework in order to present the functional prototype of the cryptoexchange platform, along with some unique mechanics specially developed for our cryptoinvestors  (see the features list in the post above).  In case you mean other ICO projects, we are determined to become #1 cryptoexchange with the lowest fees possible (expected transaction fee is 0.06%) and the only platform providing full trading functionality and at the same time allowing traders to retain control over their assets at all time.  Dividends The major investors holding 1% and more of the total token supply will also receive monthly dividends from net operating surplus of the SafeCrypt.io Exchange Platform. Let’s say that having generated $6,9mln of income from fees (the number is based on less than 4.8% market share) SafeCrypt.io has $5mln of net operating surplus. A tokenholder owning 1% of total SFC will gain dividends equal to $50000 each month.  Token Repurchase Stage 1 SafeCrypt will initiate the repurchase process of the tokens sold during the crowdsale 6 months after the ICO is over at a price of 115% of the initial value in order to stabilize the market price and compensate for the sale bonuses. Every investor will be able to benefit at least 15% of their investment by simply selling the tokens on the market. Stage 2 After the official release of the exchange platform SafeCrypt.io will initiate the second phase of token buy back at a rate of 200% of the initial token price. Note: The buyback process will guarantee the minimum token value on the secondary market and will enable the SFC token holders to benefit directly via trading.  And let’s not forget about indirect benefits for the whole crypto community. The more stable the market, the easier it is to build services upon it, the faster the development. Every time a faulty exchange platform collapses, the whole community suffers and that is unacceptable. With SafeCrypt.io we intended to stabilize the cryptomarket and ensure its continuous growth. We believe that blockchain is the technology for the people and for our common future and we must appreciate and protect it by all means.  Hope that answers your question!

This type of bonus is also available during all phases of SafeCrypt ICO. A Co-op bonus is absolutely identical to the Major Investment bonus in the numbers behind it (bonus value ranges, minimum amount of tokens that must be purchased and schedule).  How it works:  1. Every user who created an account on SafeCrypt.io website is allowed to start a new Co-op or join an existing ongoing Co-op by entering a corresponding Co-op ID if such Co-op ID is known by the user. 2. A Co-op ID is a character-based identifier. 3. Each Co-op has it's own unique ID. 4. Any Co-op is time-limited and is active for 12 hours only. 5. A Co-op may not be stopped or restarted. 6. The number of participants in a Co-op is unlimited. 7. If Co-op participants collectively purchase the minimum amount of SFC required to receive a bonus, such Co-op is considered successful and each participant receives a number of bonus tokens corresponding to their purchase during the Co-op.      Example: A user joins a Co-op on the fourth day of the pre-sale phase and purchases 50000 SFC while the Co-op is active (within 12 hours since the moment the Co-op started). The Co-op is successful and results in a total collective purchase of 150000 SFC which grants every participant with +15% bonus tokens.     The user receives 50000 SFC + 7500 SFC as an additional bonus, 57500 SFC total.  8. An initiator of a successful Co-op (a user who started such Co-op) receives additional bonus tokens equal to 5% of a total number of tokens collectively purchased by the participants during the Co-op. This bonus has a fixed value that is not affected by time.     Thus, having created a successful Co-op that resulted in a collective purchase of 1 mln. SFC, the Initiator receives 50000 SFC as an Initiator Bonus.    Source: https://safecrypt.io/faq.php (What is a Co-op Investment and how can I benefit from it? and Co-op Rules)",False

SafeCrypt.io has set a required essential minimum of 187.5 mln SFC to be sold during the two phases of the ICO. In case SafeCrypt.io sells less than the essential minimum, additional measures to attract private investments will be taken. SafeCrypt.io has been in development for many months, we will continue our development regardless of the outcome of the ICO and all unsold tokens will be burned following the ICO in order to ensure the stability of the token price for all our backers.  A proportional part of the tokens allocated to the company reserve will also be burned in order to preserve the initial ratio of total tokens allocated: 30% as a company reserve and 70% as publicly available tokens. The more tokens are purchased during the ICO, the faster the development of the platform (both web and mobile versions), the larger SafeCrypt.io's own supply and a variety of cryptocurrencies available for instant exchange, the more effective the marketing campaign would be.  SafeCrypt.io will be able to initiate the token repurchase process out of the company's own net operating surplus and start the dividend payouts sooner. The successful ICO will allow SafeCrypt.io to reach the dominant position on the cryptoexchange market and enable our investors co capitalize on the company's success.  The most pessimistic prediction with a market Share of just 0.9% translates into Daily Exchange Volume of $36mln  (0.9% of 4bln).  SafeCrypt.io fee = 0.06% of 36mln = 21599.9 (~$21600 daily) = $648000 per month.  That said according to SafeCrypt.io Optimistic prediction which is achievable if all publicly available tokens are sold during the ICO: Market Share = 9.6% Daily Exchange Volume = 9.6% of 4bln = 384000000 ($384mln) SafeCrypt.io fee = 0.06% of 384mln = 230399.99 (~$230400 daily) = $6 912 000 per month.  It goes without saying that SafeCrypt.io will put all reasonable efforts into making the optimistic prediction become reality. 9.6% of market share is achievable with sufficient funding and by focusing the available resources on the realization of the planned activities (see pp.23-24) of the whitepaper.

It would be impossible to warrant the security and complete anonymity for the crypto traders using the platform for instant exchanges with having disclosed personal information on the project team and therefore compromising the integrity of the system security by allowing third parties to leverage on the project team members. Decentralized systems are autonomous and independent by definition. Mere rhetoric does not provide the data security and anonymity.

Let's break down the concept of decentralized systems, protection of personal data and the economic basis of the project leading to non-disclosure of personal information of people provided with a direct or indirect access to the system:  1. Moral reasons for protecting personal data  - Prevention of harm - an access by others to one's personal data, characteristics, and whereabouts can be used to harm the data subject; - Informational inequality - especially within the unregulated decentralized environment; - Informational injustice and discrimination; - Encroachment on moral autonomy - an unneeded exposure to outside forces may influence the decisions made by an individual.  2. SafeCrypt.io only operates with own supply of cryptoassets in order to provide fail-safe by design cryptoexchange. It would be the company's assets at risk and not the traders'. Every channel of input to the system is being monitored and having exposed the personal data we will compromise the system integrity by allowing persons with malicious intentions to use such data to insert malware onto the team member's computer, perform social engineering and a whole variety of different illegal activities aimed to disrupt the system or the team for personal benefits.  3. Being decentralized a priori the company will not be able to make use of the formal methods of insurance. Any accident connected to faulty security standards for the employees will result in partial or a complete loss of own circulating supply of cryptoassets required for the business to operate without any chance to resolve the problem with existing formal lawful methods.  4. It shouln't come as a surprise that up to 20% of the cryptoassets being exchanged on the market are one way or another connected to the darknet. Putting the team at risk whilst having no guaranteed protection from the government may have catastrophic consequences.  We do not oblige the traders to invest in our project. We are proving our trustworthiness with real development and the functional system. A few words on advisors: it wouldn't be professional or ethical to insult other ICOs with their advisors and their complete incompetence and questionable authority, with numbers clearly illustrating absolute dilettante approach on project development and planning.

The transaction is processed automatically. All tokens will be distributed among the participants following the ICO period.  It would not be professional to compare the project with other projects. The main features that are already presented to the public: 1. An automated transaction processing system - a working merchant mechanics with 44 cryptocurrencies already being accepted; 2. A multi-trader collective investment functionality (Co-op) - a unique feature specially developed for our backers; 3. A completely automatic and accurate dynamic bonus calculation system; 4. The ICO Manager platform to process the marketing activities for the duration of the crowdsale period; 5. A mathematically verified economic model designed to secure the SafeCrypt.io token value and ensure stable and continuous growth of the projected ROI for the token holders, including:  a. Dividends Once SafeCrypt exchange is fully functional, the major token holders will receive monthly dividends in accordance to the amount of tokens the investors hold. The dividends will be distributed monthly among the biggest token holders from the moment of SafeCrypt.io platform official release. The minimum amount of SFC tokens the stakeholder owns must be 1% of total token supply or more in order to receive dividends. The value for dividends is calculated from net operating surplus. Thus, let's say that having generated $6,9mln of income from fees (calculated based on the Optimistic Prediction of 9.6% of market share), SafeCrypt.io has $5mln of net operating surplus. A stakeholder owning 1% of total SFC will gain dividends equal to $50000 each month.  b.Token Repurchase  Stage 1 SafeCrypt will initiate the repurchase process of the tokens sold during the crowdsale 6 months after the ICO is over at a price of 115% of the initial value in order to stabilize the market price and compensate for the sale bonuses. Every investor will be able to benefit at least 15% of their investment by simply selling the tokens on the market.  Stage 2 After the official release of the exchange platform SafeCrypt.io will initiate the second phase of token buy back at a rate of 200% of the initial token price. Note: The buyback process will guarantee the minimum token value on the secondary market and will enable the SFC token holders to benefit directly via trading.
