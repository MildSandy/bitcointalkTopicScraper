Our community is important to us as we continue to grow. We see many new members joining our referral community, initiating discussions and asking questions about ReMoneta and its products, which is great!  We would like to announce the success of our first stage.  ReMoneta is moving to the next stage of its development. To reflect this, we have updated our website. ReMoneta consists of an underlying platform for creating disruptive products and a developing a number of products connected to that platform for the financial and technological benefit. During the next stage, we have now started the development and promotion of the individual products that will be running of the platform.  You can head over to www.ReMoneta.com to read more.  The initial products being developed are shown below:  1. ReMoneta currency - the only currency in the world which increases in value over time. Imagine a cup of coffee which is cheaper tomorrow than today! 2. EXIT - allows anyone, anywhere, anytime to exit crypto into USD or vice versa, exit traditional currencies into cryptocurrencies for a fraction of the price of any of our competitors. 3. LAND - a token backed by 100% land and offering a long-term secure value which increases over time. 4. SYNC - Disrupting the gaming industry. Mobile gaming is a billion-dollar industry, with some games seeing an average user spending more than $500 for in-app purchases. ReMoneta offers real micro-pricing (e.g. spending $0.01 cents per transaction), which can open up a host of new possibilities. For gaming companies, this means bringing in millions of new users who were reluctant to spend money on in-app purchases, increasing their revenues considerably and for gamers - more fun, as well as features increasing the number of players, loyalty, and allowing gamers to earn financially while they play.  Many people from our community have asked if they can invest in any of our products. We do not have a public sale, however, for individual questions please e-mail info@remoneta.com directly. We welcome your continuing feedback and involvement!",False

As far as I know it is not minable is a standard traditional sense.  Indeed not traditional, but we hope better. Instead of a random computer code generation based on the most powerful computer, the miner takes concrete actions in the real world (see my earlier post today) and based on those actions he is rewarded.

Quote from: FrankDTank on September 07, 2018, 09:20:02 AM Does ReMoneta team  have a plan to prevent pump & dump and price manipulation after the token sale?  There is a lock in period for all. First 10% will be distributed directly a month after the official end of the sale period (Oct 31st), and the rest will be distributed evenly across 6 months. Founders have a 6-month lock in for example, and the rest is distributed over 2 years. The token allocation info is also on the website - www.ReMoneta.com.

[/quote]    Its great to see some community members discovering the real benefits of ReMoneta. This is exactly on-topic.  ReMoneta could indeed (partly) replace traditional currencies in this situation. Since the price of ReMoneta is stable and steadily increasing, this crash does not take place (the second token RET floats and can rise of fall in price). There is land is backing the system for trust, security and stability, but it does not determine the price of ReMoneta. The price is determined by a long term computer model, thus any short term fluctuation in land values are just that - short term changes in the balance sheet but not the price of ReMoneta. The price is stable and rises. The land value may rise and fall in the short term, however, as we see over the long term it hits a strong upward trend, so the value of the whole system increases. In this case you get the benefits from both sides of the coin, real increasing price of ReMoneta and long term increasing value of the underlying companies/system.

No leverage (loans) against the land, it is 100% real solid value backing the company ReMoneta. During the last 200 years, land has risen in value more than gold (on average it did not rise) and even shares surprisingly enough. It also means there is a huge value behind the system, without any claim against it - that makes it very hard for the system to fail - as you can imagine it would take many years without any income at all to use up even the initial land value in a cautiously managed organisation. Plus the land generates ongoing income to cover costs so this extreme situation should not even occur, making it all the more sold, stable and lasting.  ReMoneta also uses a dual token system and pricing controlled by an intelligent long term computer model. So the price is predictable and rises in a stable fashion over time. This solves the issue of all currencies not being a true store of value.

The latter being more detailed. Having said that, I personally recommend reading through all of them. Not just for our project, but for all projects you are looking at. It not only gives you a full overview of the benefits of the project, but it also helps to understand the risks. Or as a more extreme but common example, one pagers may contain all the exiting numbers to make you want to buy, but it's the full whitepaper that gives you the relevant information to understand whether they are scammers, inexperienced, or perhaps unrealistic in their goals.

First, you have a large value backing the currency, so it is not just ""hot air"" or based on future promises which might never be realised - even fiat currencies like the dollar rise and fall due to political and economic vagaries of the US. We even beat fiat currencies in that way. It solves the problem a lot of people have been talking about that crypto has no real value. Now it does. Second, land is a stable asset, so it is better for creating a stable-priced currency, its more secure and safe. Third, land has always increased in value and over the long term it is the best asset for storing value (see the white paper Philosophy, there is a study by Oxford Unviersity looking at the last 200 years of different asset values). Trust, security, real value, stability. These are some of the core concepts of ReMoneta.",False

Is there a minimum investment?  In previous sale stage minimum was 100 usd. Maybe it will be the same this time too.  I hope so,that sounds like a reasonable amount,so many people can join the sale    Is there time to go through proof of care to get the bonus?  Yes. Go ahead, there are some good bonuses to earn.    They have explained land backing in their Telegram chat the following way (I just copy-pasted):   [/quote]  I don't agree that land has always increased in value. It largely depends on the country stability and start land value. But it does make sense if the location is really good. [/quote]  Yes, over the long term is the meaning. For more information on this, see the Oxford university study looking at land prices during the last 200 years in our Philosophy Paper, www.ReMoneta.com. Our pricing is based on an intelligent computer model set again the long term value. It is not impacted by short term or geographic fluctuations, neither is the land portfolio since it is a global portfolio so it averages out any country-specific effects.",False

We even beat fiat currencies in that way. It solves the problem a lot of people have been talking about that crypto has no real value. Now it does.

You are welcome to look at the Linked-in details of all the team members, go to Linked-in and type ""ReMoneta"", you will see the team members connected to the project.  For now the sum was our target. Unlike most projects we can actually use more money practically because it will buy more land which increases the stability and value of the total system. So, yes, you can say more is better. However in this first hard cap, as someone else wrote here, its better not to be greedy.

[/quote]  Mm, its a broad question. Lets say it like this, the goal of ReMoneta is to improve how the world works. That may be a bit philosophical (see our Philosophy Paper on www.ReMoneta.com), but I will explain it.  There are some great benefits for buyers - good possibilities to earn from bonuses, exclusive rewards for private sale buyers, community mining where you earn based on what you do, opportunities to set up a business, amongst other things. But that is only half the story.  We believe you should earn but at the same time drive positive change in the world. This happens in two ways. First the land backing means the ReMoneta token (its a dual token system, RET and ReMoneta) will help to stabilise the financial system. This is because ReMoneta has stable (predictably increasing) prices and is backed by real, measurable value - land. It is not based on loans from banks created from thin air, it is not based on future promises, countries which need to continue to grow in order to generate economic benefit or any kind of ""hot air"". It is based on land. You can live on it, grow crops on it... it is very real. Second, through community mining and the core of how our system works, community members are rewarded for developing/promoting the system and the community shared values. These values are the environment, human health, animal welfare, global unity and clean energy (climate change). By introducing values to money, eventually every transaction, purchase and use of ReMoneta will start to make people think about holding a dollar .v. a pound .v. ReMoneta and what it means. Do you want to support the policies and politics of the US/UK/Europe which are changing, or do you want to use a global currency, separate from these systems, which by its nature is helping to promote these positive values as well as earn you money for doing so AND has a price which is increasing, not falling in value like fiat or volatile like crypto. A system which is zero cost/ frictionless to use and driven by the community itself. Where you can now pay 0.01c micropayments for streaming, gaming, in-apps...  People are asking ""How is ReMoneta different"". Sometimes it needs time to explain, but this is really a completely new approach to how money and the whole global commercial system will function. A system based on rewards and driving positive values into all daily operations of using a currency and commerce.  Thanks that you always share information. It is very important for investors.     [/quote] [/quote]  Clarity and information is based on everything.",False

In the case of ReMoneta the price will show a stable increase in price. That means a predictable and stable increasing price determined by an intelligent computer model. - Based on its land holdings, there is *real* measurable value underlying the group *today* and every day, not just future promises. You are buying a token with a group that already has large value and this increases as more land is purchased - Don't forget that land values are the best asset for consistent long term value increase (see our Philosophy Paper, Oxford University study), www.ReMoneta.com - We have a Proof Of Care bonus for the private sale buyer - so you may obtain a bonus on top of your purchase. - Private sale buyers get access to 1% of all future sales through their exclusive community mining (plus another 6% of additional community mining rewards). - The community mining system is based on your own actions.. so with ReMoneta its not just speculation like other tokns, you have a really concrete and exact path to earn money *which you control yourself* - There is the chance to set up a business on the network free of charge, which can generate you as much income as you achieve - While ReMoneta has a stable price, there is a dual token system. RET is an ERC20 token running on Ethereum and is floating, so the price may increase as there is more demand. You can swap from one to the other as you choose.  So, this should help give a few ideas how you can earn with ReMoneta. As you see there are a lot more options that alternatives to earn good income.   [/quote]  [/quote]  Can you tell use more about that remoneta token,and its purpose? [/quote]  Mm, its a broad question. Lets say it like this, the goal of ReMoneta is to improve how the world works. That may be a bit philosophical (see our Philosophy Paper on www.ReMoneta.com), but I will explain it.  There are some great benefits for buyers - good possibilities to earn from bonuses, exclusive rewards for private sale buyers, community mining where you earn based on what you do, opportunities to set up a business, amongst other things. But that is only half the story.  We believe you should earn but at the same time drive positive change in the world. This happens in two ways. First the land backing means the ReMoneta token (its a dual token system, RET and ReMoneta) will help to stabilise the financial system. This is because ReMoneta has stable (predictably increasing) prices and is backed by real, measurable value - land. It is not based on loans from banks created from thin air, it is not based on future promises, countries which need to continue to grow in order to generate economic benefit or any kind of ""hot air"". It is based on land. You can live on it, grow crops on it... it is very real. Second, through community mining and the core of how our system works, community members are rewarded for developing/promoting the system and the community shared values. These values are the environment, human health, animal welfare, global unity and clean energy (climate change). By introducing values to money, eventually every transaction, purchase and use of ReMoneta will start to make people think about holding a dollar .v. a pound .v. ReMoneta and what it means. Do you want to support the policies and politics of the US/UK/Europe which are changing, or do you want to use a global currency, separate from these systems, which by its nature is helping to promote these positive values as well as earn you money for doing so AND has a price which is increasing, not falling in value like fiat or volatile like crypto. A system which is zero cost/ frictionless to use and driven by the community itself. Where you can now pay 0.01c micropayments for streaming, gaming, in-apps...  People are asking ""How is ReMoneta different"". Sometimes it needs time to explain, but this is really a completely new approach to how money and the whole global commercial system will function. A system based on rewards and driving positive values into all daily operations of using a currency and commerce.  Thanks that you always share information. It is very important for investors.

In the case of ReMoneta the price will show a stable increase in price. That means a predictable and stable increasing price determined by an intelligent computer model. - Based on its land holdings, there is *real* measurable value underlying the group *today* and every day, not just future promises. You are buying a token with a group that already has large value and this increases as more land is purchased - Don't forget that land values are the best asset for consistent long term value increase (see our Philosophy Paper, Oxford University study), www.ReMoneta.com - We have a Proof Of Care bonus for the private sale buyer - so you may obtain a bonus on top of your purchase. - Private sale buyers get access to 1% of all future sales through their exclusive community mining (plus another 6% of additional community mining rewards). - The community mining system is based on your own actions.. so with ReMoneta its not just speculation like other tokns, you have a really concrete and exact path to earn money *which you control yourself* - There is the chance to set up a business on the network free of charge, which can generate you as much income as you achieve - While ReMoneta has a stable price, there is a dual token system. RET is an ERC20 token running on Ethereum and is floating, so the price may increase as there is more demand. You can swap from one to the other as you choose.  So, this should help give a few ideas how you can earn with ReMoneta. As you see there are a lot more options that alternatives to earn good income.   [/quote]  [/quote]  Can you tell use more about that remoneta token,and its purpose? [/quote]  Mm, its a broad question. Lets say it like this, the goal of ReMoneta is to improve how the world works. That may be a bit philosophical (see our Philosophy Paper on www.ReMoneta.com), but I will explain it.  There are some great benefits for buyers - good possibilities to earn from bonuses, exclusive rewards for private sale buyers, community mining where you earn based on what you do, opportunities to set up a business, amongst other things. But that is only half the story.  We believe you should earn but at the same time drive positive change in the world. This happens in two ways. First the land backing means the ReMoneta token (its a dual token system, RET and ReMoneta) will help to stabilise the financial system. This is because ReMoneta has stable (predictably increasing) prices and is backed by real, measurable value - land. It is not based on loans from banks created from thin air, it is not based on future promises, countries which need to continue to grow in order to generate economic benefit or any kind of ""hot air"". It is based on land. You can live on it, grow crops on it... it is very real. Second, through community mining and the core of how our system works, community members are rewarded for developing/promoting the system and the community shared values. These values are the environment, human health, animal welfare, global unity and clean energy (climate change). By introducing values to money, eventually every transaction, purchase and use of ReMoneta will start to make people think about holding a dollar .v. a pound .v. ReMoneta and what it means. Do you want to support the policies and politics of the US/UK/Europe which are changing, or do you want to use a global currency, separate from these systems, which by its nature is helping to promote these positive values as well as earn you money for doing so AND has a price which is increasing, not falling in value like fiat or volatile like crypto. A system which is zero cost/ frictionless to use and driven by the community itself. Where you can now pay 0.01c micropayments for streaming, gaming, in-apps...  People are asking ""How is ReMoneta different"". Sometimes it needs time to explain, but this is really a completely new approach to how money and the whole global commercial system will function. A system based on rewards and driving positive values into all daily operations of using a currency and commerce.     [/quote]  love the confidence in the response",False

RET is an ERC20 token running on Ethereum and is floating, so the price may increase as there is more demand. You can swap from one to the other as you choose.

[/quote]  [/quote]  Can you tell use more about that remoneta token,and its purpose? [/quote]  Mm, its a broad question. Lets say it like this, the goal of ReMoneta is to improve how the world works. That may be a bit philosophical (see our Philosophy Paper on www.ReMoneta.com), but I will explain it.  There are some great benefits for buyers - good possibilities to earn from bonuses, exclusive rewards for private sale buyers, community mining where you earn based on what you do, opportunities to set up a business, amongst other things. But that is only half the story.  We believe you should earn but at the same time drive positive change in the world. This happens in two ways. First the land backing means the ReMoneta token (its a dual token system, RET and ReMoneta) will help to stabilise the financial system. This is because ReMoneta has stable (predictably increasing) prices and is backed by real, measurable value - land. It is not based on loans from banks created from thin air, it is not based on future promises, countries which need to continue to grow in order to generate economic benefit or any kind of ""hot air"". It is based on land. You can live on it, grow crops on it... it is very real. Second, through community mining and the core of how our system works, community members are rewarded for developing/promoting the system and the community shared values. These values are the environment, human health, animal welfare, global unity and clean energy (climate change). By introducing values to money, eventually every transaction, purchase and use of ReMoneta will start to make people think about holding a dollar .v. a pound .v. ReMoneta and what it means. Do you want to support the policies and politics of the US/UK/Europe which are changing, or do you want to use a global currency, separate from these systems, which by its nature is helping to promote these positive values as well as earn you money for doing so AND has a price which is increasing, not falling in value like fiat or volatile like crypto. A system which is zero cost/ frictionless to use and driven by the community itself. Where you can now pay 0.01c micropayments for streaming, gaming, in-apps...  People are asking ""How is ReMoneta different"". Sometimes it needs time to explain, but this is really a completely new approach to how money and the whole global commercial system will function. A system based on rewards and driving positive values into all daily operations of using a currency and commerce.",False

Indeed you just swap one token for the other. Its a bit like USD and EUR. If you are in Europe, you switch your USD to EUR so you can enjoy all the European infrastructure, entertainment and so on. When you go to America, then you swap to USD. In our case, when you want to use all of the facilities of the Ethereum network, you swap to RET. When you want all the benefits of the ReMoneta network, you swap to ReMoneta. Also, the dual token approach is necessary for the price to be completely stable.   Quote from: Memmoria on July 23, 2018, 11:32:02 AM The price is stable, not volatile and is designed to increase steadily over time  How do you plan to achieve that,since cryptocurrencies are usually very volatile?   Three ways. You can see the details in the Philosophy paper on www.ReMoneta.com, but basically: Dual token approach, RET is floating, ReMoneta is not traded. This is needed to balance the economic pressures of the market. The ReMoneta price is determined by a long term intelligent computer model not market trading as above. Land provides stability, trust and security to the companies in the system. It is not leveraged and there is no risk attached. This means an income can be generated for covering costs and buyers know that the companies have a very large and real value and will not fail financially.

Not sure, I haven't heard a thing, would be nice if someone has some source to share this info with us .  It has been confirmed, yes! The official announcement of the partnership is here: https://medium.com/remoneta/remoneta-ret-token-to-join-the-bancor-network-e8dae083d84  what exactly will the partnership mean for ReMoneta ?  This will mean the RET token is integrated with the Bancor network. This gives liquidty for the RET token (on the Ethereum network) and allows people to leverage this infrastructure to swap their token and use more functionality of different tokens on Ethereum. ReMoneta remains the stable, secure currency on the ReMoneta network and is not traded, so you gain additional benefits through this integration.   Quote from: bitmonkey455 on July 21, 2018, 07:20:21 AM  How does the bonus program work ? Do i have to finish them before i buy the tokens ? i saw it took like 14 days to be confirmed, and that's pretty long time...  It can be done as quickly or slowly as you like - only you must submit proofs 14 days before the end of the token sale, see www.ReMoneta.com/bonus You can buy tokens first or do the bonus first and buy later. My recommendation is to start with the bonus now to get maximum time to do it and therefore maximum bonus.

I know it's up to a couple of days (and that's still long) but 14 days is really strange. Maybe someone from the team can clarify this.  Its not 14 days. It could be less than a minute if it goes through directly with IdentityMind. Just in case, you can plan to leave 48 hours to be sure of any eventuality. In my view 48 hours is overkill, but better plan longer and then get it done quicker in reality.

So it is rewarding people for doing something good for the project as well. You can see all the bonuses and actions on www.ReMoneta.com/bonus  The Community Mining (instead of computer power/ electricity in normal mining) starts once the ReMoneta network goes live. This is somehow a similar concept, in that you take certain actions (like bringing new members, retailers, admin/coding for the system) and promoting the community shared values (environment, human health, global unity, animal welfare, clean energy). You submit your works to the community, who give them votes. You are rewarded according to votes - so, how useful the activity is to the community. So, you are rewarded for concrete actions you take supporting the community and promoting its values.

But this a pretty good question actually. It's not clearly stated in the link in their site.  It is not quite clear - but wouldn't every referal be rewarded even a little bit?  It's 100 tokens per referral  Is there some maximum one can earn trough referral system?  I'm also interested in this - is there a possible limit to the bonus?  The only limit is the end of the referral program (so better to start earlier). Every referral which leads to a new registration receives a reward. People are rewarded for the real work they do. That is our basic ethic in ReMoneta. To be open, fair and reward people for what they do which supports the community.

First up, we have a dual token system. RET is floating (the price can change on its own), ReMoneta is stable and that is your surety. The system works with these two tokens. So that answers the question whether or not there could be a price rise.  Stable does not mean the price is exactly fixed at one number. ""Stable growth"" is stable, but not always the same number. It grows. The computer model keeps the ReMoneta price stable and predictable.  It is a risky strategy to invest in a token and only hope the price will go up (price speculation) based on some future development. ReMoneta solves one of the big problems in Crypto - crashing prices. Its much better to buy a token which has a concrete way to earn. if there is also some future development, you have the best of both worlds. ReMoneta has this concrete way to earn:  With ReMoneta we have community mining. This is our form of ""mining"" which uses no computing power or electricity. Instead you take actions to support the community (admin/code, bring new retailers or members) and promote the community's shared values (environment, human health, animal welfare, global unity, clean energy). These are real concrete actions you take yourself which lead to rewards and the whole system is coordinated by the community. More info in the Philosophy Paper, www.ReMoneta.com.  Within the ReMoneta network you may set up your own code, system or business. There is no cost at all to do this. That's another way to earn.  The private sale has a number of Bonus options based on your own actions. Nice for earning.  The purpose of ReMoneta is to be used for buying and selling. Saving costs its not earning, but because there are no joining fees, transaction costs or fees, you spend less. Money is money...  So, there were just a few ways to practically earn from ReMoneta...",False

Token Allocation: - Allocated 10% directly, remainder split evenly across 6 months - 50% directly and 50% monthly over 2 years - 50% directly, and 50% with a 3 month lock-in - 6 month lock-in and an allocation split monthly across 2 years  So wahts the longest period that tokens will be locked?  From this post it seems that it is 6 months without allocation and no distribution at all.Correct me if I'm wrong.  Its clearer to read on the website. Basically for the private sale token buyers, distribution starts 30 days after the end of the private sale (to allow for admin), then its equally distributed across the next 6 months so there is no large influx of supply to the market.  The 6 month lock in and spread across 2 years is for the founders and team, to make sure we are in this project for the long term. We only win when the project wins for everyone.",False

Together we will change the world guys  Its only 10 days countdown to the private sale which opens on 24th July 10:00 GMT!!  Here is a summary of some unique features of ReMoneta:  ReMoneta is very different from other tokens available. Key differences are: - combining all the features below, we bring Crypto to the mainstream - completely stable pricing, avoids falling values in crypto and fiat (dollar/Euro/Pound) - allows micropayments opening up a new industry (imagine 0.1c/s for streaming video or 0.2c for buying a gem on games) with faster throughput than other systems - ReMoneta companies are backed by land, as far as we know the only currency that exists like this (fiat or crypto) and certainly no major ones - zero transaction costs, zero joining costs, zero fees, no costs at all - a totally frictionless hub connecting Crypto with Commerce - near-instant transactions and a huge scaling of transactions for micropayments using time-sliced consolidation - no need to rely on speculation and price rises - very large concrete earnings possible through community mining which uses no computing power or electricity so it is equal for everyone and fair - community members are rewarded by promoting real world values (environment, human health, clean energy, animal welfare, global unity) and the ReMoneta community - retailers are rewarded for joining the network and according to the number of transactions they make - Follow-the-money security, not done elsewhere - Anyone/anywhere/anytime access to blockchain for everyone with an internet connection  ..much more about this can be found in our WP on www.ReMoneta.com and our channel t.me/ReMoneta or t.me/ReMonetaChannel",False

Quote from: BoDerek on July 14, 2018, 06:39:11 AM Can you tell me more about the team,what are your previous projects?   This is a long answer. You can read some good background of the team in the WP and Philosophy document on www.ReMoneta.com, but summary is, ReMoneta is combining the fields of Real Estate, Finance and technology (ReFinTech) to create a completely new currency (bringing crypto to the mainstream and connecting crypto to commerce). The team and advisers background is exactly this. Many years experience in the real estate, finance and technology fields (including crypto - we some very experienced guys on board). Experience of ICOs, development. The two founders, myself and Harijs have both managed large value projects over a long period. I own and have lead various companies in real estate, finance, media, technology and especially been in at the start of different industries, like disaggregated solar in the UK (first national market leader), bulletin boards (that was a while ago for anyone who remembers!), sustainable real estate for over 14 years. Harijs has his own 80m Euro investment fund and has been Chairman of a major bank and leader of a central bank - its very useful to know how it works ""inside"" the system so we can change the system.   Quote from: fivestarBTC on July 14, 2018, 12:03:45 AM the regulation in the region you plan on operating from is it crypto friendly ?   Is any country really crypto friendly . The operating company is in the European Union - Estonia. Estonia is well known for IT and new technologies and the system is quite flexible. We have done a full in-depth legal analysis with the no.1 legal company in the region, Sorainan, who I have worked with for years, so legally everything is as sure as it can be in this market (which is changing every week).",False

But basically it goes like this: Normal mining uses a lot of electricity (bad for the environment) and it favours people with a lot of money to buy big computers. That's not fair and not good. We want a system which is fair for all, doesn't matter how much money you have, how big a computer and which not only gives a financial reward, but also does some good for the world. So, to do the mining you take real world actions, like promoting the values which our community shares (environment, human health, clean energy, animal welfare, global unity) and promoting the community (bringing new retailers, members, supporting other community members...). These actions you post in the system we are developing for that and you are rewarded according to the value to the community, decided by the community.   For anyone interested in some more info, have a look at Medium.com/ReMoneta - we have a whole series of articles there about ReMoneta, the financial system, how things work differently and what is possible.

Having said that, land prices have been shown to always increase over long term (the Philosophy paper refers to a 200 year study made by Oxford Univeristy), so any sort of short term fluctuations in land prices will only impact a number of the balance sheet.

You can find more detail on this in the WhitePaper and Philosopy Paper on www.ReMoneta.com.    Quote from: MadEth on July 12, 2018, 12:43:40 AM Quote from: thorRJ on July 12, 2018, 12:27:55 AM Are the rewards only for Members and retailers? Because being a payment processor, the customer that uses ReMoneta to pay, will not be rewarded? that is a good question  waiting to read the response from team... sure they would make it a fair reward system  The rewards for community members are based on our system called ""Community mining"". Throughout all aspects of the project, the people rewarded are those who are most active in supporting the community and the community values. In the token sale phase that is Proof Of Care (www.ReMoneta.com/bonus), where you show your involvement by promoting and supporting the project. During the project phase, community mining is again by taking actions to promote our values (environment, clean energy, animal welfare, human health and global unity) as well as supporting the community by new retailers, members on board and supporting the system with admin actions and development.  Everyone can participate, everyone is equal, it is all fair. It does not use electricity or computing power to do this mining, so no benefit if you have a lot of money to buy a powerful computer, also that helps the environment. The reward is based on your own activities and their value to the community.  These actions are rewarded in the system. You can read more about that in the Philosophy doc on www.ReMoneta.com, down at the bottom of the front page.",False

It does many things Bitcoin and Ethereum can't do. See my answer below - ReMoneta is very different from other tokens available. Key differences are: - completely stable pricing, avoids falling values in crypto and fiat - allows micropayments opening up a new industry (imagine 0.1c/s for streaming video or 0.2c for buying a gem on games) - ReMoneta companies are backed by land, as far as we know the only currency that exists like this (fiat or crypto) and certainly no major ones - zero transaction costs, zero joining costs, zero fees, no costs at all - near-instant transactions and a huge scaling of transactions for micropayments using time-sliced consolidation - community mining uses no computing power or electricity so it is equal for everyone and fair - community members are rewarded by promoting real world values (environment, human health, clean energy, animal welfare, global unity) and the ReMoneta community - Follow-the-money security - Anyone/anywhere/anytime access for everyone with an internet connection  ..much more about this can be found in our WP on www.ReMoneta.com and our channel t.me/ReMoneta",False
