ABOUT ▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂  PHG – PharmaGenome – CURRENCY for HEALTH A Blockchain based crowdsourced platform for investment and development of an information platform that will alert people to their genetic diseases, guides them with preventive behaviors regarding the way of life and nutrition according to their genetic predispositions in order to escape serious illnesses and help patients select the effective drug and the optimum dose of the drug with respect to their genome. The project is based on Waves platform providing utilities that classical approaches do not utilize to the potential investors.    TECHNOLOGY and SOLUTION ▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂  The platform will enable: Genome analysis Secure storage of full genome information with blockchain technology Complete database of polymorphisms Full interpretation with our medical team Analysis of cancer cells genome  Our advantage is the high level of professionalism of the project team and the extremely rapidly developing areas of the pharma genetics, which has recently received extraordinary growth in all areas of medicine. The project PHARMAGENOME is a touch point with investors rapidly growing market of using human genome for mere effective medical treatment of patients.   MARKET ▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂  Personalized or genomic medicine is an emerging medical discipline that involves using genomic information about an individual as part of their clinical care (e.g., for diagnostic or therapeutic decision-making) and the health outcomes and policy implications of that clinical use. Already, ge¬nomic medicine is making an impact in the fields of oncology, pharmacology, rare and undiagnosed diseases, and infectious disease. European market is estimated to a fantastic size of more than 51 billion EUR, because 20% of all EU population would benefit from genetic tests. The potential market covers those individuals whose genetic predisposition can influence the development of more than 20 diseases.   VISION ▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂  Our vision is to become the most important knowledge base in pharma genetics. Our desire is personalization of medicine, where each drug and its necessary dose can be personalized according to the patients’ patients genome.   CHALLENGE ▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂  The challenge we are facing is, in particular, the creation of a single database of human genomes and the establishment of a single knowledge base on discovered polymorphisms.
