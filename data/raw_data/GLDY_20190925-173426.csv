We believe this phase will enable the delivery of our value proposition which involves the creation of a truly reward-based ecosystem for users of social media video contents. We are excited about this as it implies we are ahead of our roadmap moving forward in Q2 2018.  We will like to reiterate that BuzzShow is a long term project and the team is committed to implementing anything within its power to make it successful as a video social media platform. Against this backdrop, our focus on development is profound as we work hard to ensure our product is distinguished within a competitive market.  Here’s a summary of our progress so far:  1. Development Team Expansion  In the past quarter, we have identified high level talents to join the team and assist with developing and integrating the functionalities of the alpha platform. This is crucial to our plan and resolution to ensure a timely achievement of our goals.  2. Platform Development  · UI/UX Facelift: To provide an exciting user experience and management, we are working to introduce new and improved interfaces for the entire platform in addition to the existing ones. To aid the platform’s economics, the Ethereum integration has also been implemented.  3. Blockchain Implementation  · Smart Contract Development: The Blockchain Technology is a revolutionary concept and Blockchain Integration is a key part of our development. To this end, the team has developed contracts to be integrated into the platform to manage the Token Transactions and the Platform Economics.  Our development is an ongoing process. This is important as we are committed to ensuring the BuzzShow platform incorporates relevant changes within the blockchain industry. In the near future, we intend to update the platform’s security, implement the Inter Planetary File Sharing (IPFS) and release the iOS and Android applications for the platform. This will follow the implementation of the token integration and the finalization of the closed Alpha testing.  Furthermore, the BuzzShow Goldies are utility tokens meant to incentivize the creation, curation and viewing of video contents. Its value will motivate content creation and sharing in the long-run. Given the recent clamor from within our community for exchange listing, we would like to emphasize again that BuzzShow Network project works on a clear plan and we are under no form of pressure to go on exchanges before it is right for the project. While we are determined to optimize our product and deliver on our promises, exchange listing will definitely come up at the right time.  We thank our community for the patience and amazing support we have received so far. In the coming weeks, we hope to reach a 100% completion of the Alpha facelift, the token economics integration and transition to the release and Integrated Token Sale respectively.

Buzzshow further development as specified all a long does not depend in any way with the Tokensale   BuzzShow is already developed project that lots of resources already has been placed in it, Buzzshow has solid professional team and partnership with lead companies in the space in place.  This brings the project further with its abilities to be here in a longer term.  We do need your participation and support by both taking active role on the platform, as well as spreading the word to create network effect.  For us it is Marathon and not sprint race.  we hope you feel the same   Please keep challenging us with good and productive questions and we will try to be as transparent as possible   2018 is the year of BuzzShow getting the right position in the market.

A   decentralized   blockchain   can   be   created that   will    give   content   creators   a   platform   that   they   truly   control.    Additionally,   revenue    can   be   shared among   content   creators,   curators, and   consumers as   per   the    level   of   activity   and   popularity   of   their   content.   Rewards   can   be   offered to    those   who   frequently   watch   on   the   platform   to   create   an   incentive   ensuring    that   the   content   on   the   platform   has   an   audience.   Using   blockchain   technology    offers   users   several   key benefits   that   the   existing   developed   Buzzshow    platform   will   be   able   to   instantly   provide: i. The   first   benefit   is   that   the   platform   prevents   corporations   from   limiting    the   creative   freedom   of   video   content   creators.   As   long   as   the    content   does   not   border   on   hate   speech   or   infringe   the   rights   of    others,   content   creators   should   have   a   platform   to   share   their   ideas.    Corporations   are   inherently   biased, and   they   tend   to   lean   towards    one   side   of   an argument.   The   blockchain   will   provide   a   truly   equal    place   where   ideas   can   be   shared.   The   alpha   version   of   the   platform   is    not   yet decentralized.   However,   it   is   intended   that   future   releases   of    the   platform   will   become gradually   decentralized   as   third   generation    blockchain   technology   matures   and   becomes   available.    ii. The   second   benefit   is   the   confidentiality   of   blockchain-based   platforms.    Sometimes   content   creators   would   prefer   to   keep   their   identities    anonymous   to   allow them   to   continue   leading   a   normal   life.    Blockchains   use   pseudonyms   offering   superior   confidentiality   without    Buzzshow   white   paper Page   |   8 affecting   the   income.   Additionally,   the   social   space   on   YouTube   and    Facebook   does   not   belong   to   the   users.   It   belongs   to   the   firm, and    they   reserve   the   right   to   delete,   block   and   close   channels   and    accounts   based   on   their   discretion,   which   most   of   the   time   is   onesided.  The   freedom of   users to   create   by   allowing   them   to   own   their    account   and   data   at   all   times   is   now   being   affected   by   the   very    companies   that   initially   disrupted   the   monopoly   of   Apple   and    Microsoft   by   offering   an   unregulated   platform.   Digital   media   giants    such   as   Facebook   and   YouTube have   become   so   big   and   powerful    that   they   themselves   are   now starting   to   be one   sided in the   way    they   do   business,   surpassing   users’ rights   in   various   basic   mean   of    privacy   and   ownership   rights.    iii. The   third   key   benefit   is   the   security of   the   content.   Most conventional    platforms   like   Google   may   have   systems   to   prevent   copyright    problems, but   they   are   ineffective   because   some   people   have    developed   ingenious   methods   of   bypassing   these   copyright    limitations.   Blockchains   are   based on   algorithms   that   are   more    secure.    Additionally   Buzzshow   copyright   infringement   prevention    infrastructure will   be augmented   by   two unique   roles   of   our    ecosystem:   the   Moderator   and   the   Validator.      Both   of   these   roles   are    compensated   to   validate   copyright information   and   to   monitor   and    flag   any   content   that   violates   Buzzshow   policies.   Preventing   copyright    infringements will   spur   additional   development   of   original   content   on    the   platform",False

From YouTube’s adsense program, content creators get paid a certain percentage of the ad revenue for their efforts. To state this in a more appropriate manner, content creators are actually “meant to get paid” for their efforts. This is because many don’t get paid commensurate sums compared to the time and resources expended in creating contents for their channels.  The few who get paid significant sums, achieve that with a huge amount of promotion and audience building which normally takes a lot of time.  BuzzShow is disrupting this tradition with the transformative power of the blockchain technology to foster an innovative reward-based video social media network where video content creators get an equal opportunity to acquire the gains from the value they create whether they engage in promotion or not. The implementation of cryptocurrencies ensures interests are protected across the value chain and the creation of a more acceptable (although disruptive) system that engenders high level security as well as value distribution.  The whitelisting process for the upcoming token sale is currently ongoing.  35% bonus is up for grabs in the pre-sale, but you need to register ahead.

BuzzShow platform stores a record of all the videos that are created, the money paid by advertisers and the money given to content curators, creators, and viewers in a single distributed ledger. This promotes decentralization, security of the records and confidentiality of the users on the platform. Through this, you are assured that your content cannot be tampered with by any one on the platform, or outside the platform such as hackers.  The use of IPFS on the platform will ensure there is no centralized control center for the videos shared. The videos will therefore finally be stored on a truly decentralized ledger that allows users to use the platform even when there are connection problems in certain areas. The platform will have different benefits to the different users, depending on their contribution. These benefits can be described as follows:  ** Video creators will earn Goldies for both creating contents and add it to their channel as well as when users view the video. This gives video creators a dual chance of earning revenue. They can also charge premiums if they would like.  **Video curators will earn Goldies every time they share a video or when a video is viewed on their channel.  **Viewers will earn Goldies when they watch videos on the platform, and they can use these Goldies to pay for premium content from their favorite content creators.  ** Buzzshow plan to provide a storage option by liaising with other decentralized storage firms and allowing content owners to pay a small fee to store videos on the blockchain.  ** Advertisers can buy Goldies for use to pay advertising space either from the curators or specific content creators. Validators verify the adverts that are included in video to ensure that advertisers only market based on the advertising space. These validators are paid using Goldies.  **  Moderators earn Goldies by validating whether the content shared by creators adheres to the terms and conditions. They flag issues like racism and inappropriate content to ensure that users do not violate the terms of the platform.  ** Developers / Platform will retain some of the Goldies reserved for them. Additionally, they earn based on any plugins and upgrades introduced to the platform.   Hope This clarifies a bit your questions",False
